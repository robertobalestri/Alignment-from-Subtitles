1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,740
Good morning, sunshine.

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,530
Hey.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,710
Look like you could use

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,710
an aspirin.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,350
What time did you make it home

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,350
from Molly's last night?

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
I didn't.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
Oh.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,740
Walk of shame?

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,740
I mean, I've been there.

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,610
Dr. Rhodes, I need you.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,780
I'm not on Trauma

13
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,780
today, Maggie.

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,820
Not a Trauma.

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,820
Robert Haywood,

16
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,820
Dr. Reese's dad,

17
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,960
CFD just arrived

18
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,960
with a STEMI alert.

19
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,150
Yeah.

20
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,990
Courtney,

21
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,990
you're going to T 2.

22
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,690
Robert Haywood,

23
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,690
58-year-old male

24
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,930
with known history of

25
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,930
heart failure, CAD, and...

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,970
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,970
Yeah, he's my patient.

28
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,370
Heart rate, 95.

29
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,370
BP, 88 over 44.

30
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,870
New onset angina unrelieved

31
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,710
with nitro and aspirin

32
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,710
in the field.

33
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,770
EKG shows ST elevations.

34
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,310
It feels like

35
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,310
someone's squeezing.

36
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,970
I know, Bob,

37
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,970
you're having a heart attack.

38
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,540
Just try to stay calm, okay?

39
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,020
All right, everybody,

40
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,020
on my count.

41
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,490
One, two, three.

42
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,490
There we go.

43
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,110
Maggie, you paged.

44
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,460
It's your dad.

45
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,890
The ambo just brought him in.

46
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,890
What?

47
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,130
Irregular heartbeat.

48
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,130
He's in a-fib.

49
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,140
Four of morphine,

50
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,640
esmolol drip, and an aspirin.

51
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,470
Rapid ventricular rate, 210.

52
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,570
He's in SVT and hypotensive.

53
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,570
We need to cardiovert.

54
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,400
Give me the paddles.

55
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,400
All right, five of valium.

56
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,570
Charge to 75 joules.

57
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,570
Charged.

58
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,910
Sync and clear.

59
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,090
Back to sinus rhythm.

60
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,090
Rate, 88.

61
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,650
All right, Maggie,

62
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,650
call the cath lab.

63
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,660
Tell 'em we're on our way up.

64
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,660
I got you.

65
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,850
Ready?

66
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,850
Wait.

67
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,260
All right. Let's go.

68
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,940
Come on, Sarah,

69
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,940
you can ride up with us.

70
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
Sarah?

71
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,010
We stented your right

72
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,010
coronary artery,

73
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,770
and we placed a balloon pump.

74
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,950
Now, your ejection fraction

75
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,950
is low,

76
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,450
so I'm afraid

77
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,450
that you're gonna

78
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,450
have to stay in the ICU...

79
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,850
Until a heart

80
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,850
becomes available.

81
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,450
Mmm-hmm.

82
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,130
It's just as I predicted.

83
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,030
Though, I'll admit, I didn't

84
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,030
expect to end up here so soon.

85
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,860
You are at the highest status

86
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,860
on the transplant list.

87
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,620
But only for 30 days.

88
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,130
If I don't get

89
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,130
a heart by then...

90
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,140
Ah, we'll... We'll cross

91
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,140
that bridge when we get there?

92
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,870
Took the words

93
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,870
right out of my mouth, Bob.

94
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,610
I'll see you soon, all right?

95
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,610
All right.

96
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,980
Oh, Dr. Rhodes,

97
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,180
do you know if, uh,

98
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,180
Sarah's here today?

99
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,720
Uh, I'm not sure about that,

100
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,350
but I can check on it for you.

101
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,460
Hey. I heard about your dad.

102
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm sorry.

103
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,960
If you need to talk or...

104
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,230
I don't.

105
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,370
But thanks.

106
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,700
Dr. Sexton, heads up.

107
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,410
This is Henry Lee.

108
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,410
How are you doing, Mr. Lee?

109
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,840
You're going

110
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,840
to Treatment 2.

111
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,850
Congestive heart failure

112
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,850
and metastatic stage four

113
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,710
non-small cell lung cancer.

114
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,520
Stopped chemo last month.

115
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,420
All right, Mr. Lee.

116
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,330
Hey, Henry.

117
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,450
There's my girl.

118
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,660
You two know each other?

119
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,160
Old friends.

120
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,690
Henry used to come into

121
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,690
the ED once a month

122
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,200
for his heart meds.

123
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,940
Been missing you

124
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,940
around here, man.

125
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,700
Okay, where does it hurt,

126
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,700
Mr. Lee?

127
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,100
Faster to tell you

128
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,100
where it doesn't hurt.

129
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,070
Give five of morphine IV.

130
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,280
Bibasilar crackles.

131
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,620
Add 20 of Lasix

132
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,620
and order a chest X-ray.

133
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,190
Henry has a history of

134
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,190
malignant pleural effusions.

135
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,220
Every time

136
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,220
they drain my lungs,

137
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,230
suckers just fill

138
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,230
right back up.

139
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,890
Okay, well, we can put in

140
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,890
a drainage tube.

141
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,800
No, no, no more procedures.

142
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,630
No needles, no tubes.

143
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,300
I'm done with all that.

144
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,070
Yes, sir.

145
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,180
Henry's cancer's everywhere.

146
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,190
Hey, does he have any family?

147
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
Not that I know of.

148
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
His wife is deceased.

149
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,150
I'm pretty sure

150
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,150
he lives alone.

151
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,080
Okay, well,

152
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,080
we'll have to transfer him

153
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,490
to a hospice facility.

154
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,420
I'm sorry, April.

155
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,440
Choi, Halstead,

156
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,440
walk with me.

157
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,260
CFD's inbound

158
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,260
with two teenage boys

159
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,540
burned in a house fire,

160
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,410
one of which is

161
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,410
Carter Singleton the Third.

162
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Singleton?

163
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,410
Yes, as in

164
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,410
the soon-to-be-constructed

165
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,040
Singleton Center

166
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,040
for Diagnostic Radiology.

167
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,050
Huge donors,

168
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,050
and Goodwin's godson, so...

169
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,180
VIP.

170
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,180
Yeah.

171
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,280
Yeah.

172
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,550
You're going to

173
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,550
Treatment 6. Desmond?

174
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,290
Sixteen-year-old male,

175
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,290
22% second-degree burns.

176
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,420
BP, 120 over 82.

177
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Heart rate, 110.

178
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,120
A friend's right behind.

179
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,120
Bo? Where's Bo?

180
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,100
Bo Williams, 17 years old.

181
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,790
85% third degree burns.

182
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,800
Couldn't get a BP,

183
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,800
but palpable

184
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,800
radial pulse of 112.

185
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,130
Kid's a real hero.

186
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,130
When we got there,

187
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,970
he was giving his buddy

188
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,970
CPR on the lawn.

189
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,770
Okay, gently,

190
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,770
one, two, three.

191
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,240
A hundred of fentanyl

192
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,240
for the pain.

193
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,240
Yes, Doctor.

194
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,470
Thank you, Desmond.

195
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,470
Yep.

196
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,880
All right, lungs are clear.

197
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,260
Where'd you learn to do CPR?

198
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,950
Boy Scouts.

199
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,950
Carter, I'm here.

200
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,120
Is Bo gonna be okay?

201
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,920
He's with Dr. Choi,

202
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,920
one of the best.

203
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,960
He's taking

204
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,960
very good care of him.

205
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,960
Groin line's in.

206
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,140
I'm having trouble

207
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,140
bagging him.

208
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,800
His chest is cooked.

209
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,800
He needs a chest escharotomy.

210
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,500
Scalpel?

211
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,500
You're gonna do it here?

212
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,070
No choice.

213
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,070
His chest can't expand.

214
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,080
Gotta release

215
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,080
the skin tension.

216
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,820
Ms. Goodwin?

217
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,320
Oh, my God, Carter!

218
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,690
Lydia, careful.

219
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,660
Sharon, is he gonna be okay?

220
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,450
Carter suffered

221
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,450
second-degree burns.

222
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,520
They're gonna be painful

223
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,520
to the touch for a while.

224
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,590
Dr. Halstead,

225
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,590
Lydia and Maurice Singleton.

226
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,200
Son, uh, how...

227
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,200
How did this happen?

228
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,770
Is Bo all right?

229
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,000
Were you with Bo?

230
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,310
That boy is nothing

231
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,310
but trouble.

232
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,470
That's not true, Mom.

233
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,270
You know you are not allowed

234
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,270
to go over to his house.

235
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,110
Lydia, just lighten up

236
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,110
a little bit, please.

237
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,440
Uh, Maria, wash the burns

238
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,440
with soap and water,

239
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,780
apply Silvadene cream,

240
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,780
and I'll be back

241
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,780
to help dress him.

242
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,720
Thank you, Dr. Halstead.

243
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,420
Here, please.

244
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,350
That kid's in

245
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,350
pretty bad shape.

246
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,860
Have you notified

247
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,860
his parents?

248
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,960
They were visiting some

249
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,960
friends over in Lake Geneva.

250
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,430
Driving back now.

251
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,290
That's terrible news

252
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,290
to come home to.

253
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah.

254
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,640
All right.

255
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,970
Hey.

256
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,050
So, sidelined for

257
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,050
the conjoined twins surgery,

258
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,050
and now you're doing

259
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,050
procedures before

260
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,050
your morning coffee?

261
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,920
I like the fight in you.

262
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm a glutton for punishment.

263
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,390
Latham made his choice clear.

264
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,220
You know, it's not over

265
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,220
until the first incision.

266
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,550
Start playing nice, maybe

267
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,550
you'll be holding the scalpel.

268
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,030
Are you all of a sudden

269
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,030
rooting for my success?

270
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,260
Not at all,

271
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,260
I just hate

272
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,260
winning by default.

273
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,770
Bruce Hammond, 34.

274
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,270
Blunt trauma to the chest

275
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,600
following a high-speed

276
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,600
car accident.

277
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,610
Negative echo,

278
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,610
but a small left hemothorax

279
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,240
and a sternal fracture.

280
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,180
CT's negative

281
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,180
for aortic injury.

282
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,280
Yes, but Radiology read

283
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,280
that there might be

284
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,840
a small pericardial effusion.

285
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,410
Since he's got a hemothorax,

286
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,410
let's put a chest tube in

287
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,250
and see what comes out,

288
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,910
and if he needs surgery,

289
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,890
we can do a high left

290
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,890
thoracotomy.

291
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,260
Hold on.

292
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,690
Is that a blush of contrast

293
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,690
over the right atrium?

294
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,900
If there's a hole

295
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,900
in his heart, he needs

296
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,900
a median sternotomy.

297
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,590
Good eye, Dr. Bekker.

298
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,970
If it is a blush,

299
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,970
we can't afford to ignore it.

300
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,270
I don't know, opening him up

301
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,270
is highly aggressive,

302
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,070
and we don't know

303
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,070
whether the contrast

304
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,040
is inside or outside

305
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,040
of his heart.

306
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,210
If the majority is

307
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,210
in favor of sternotomy...

308
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,510
I'll follow.

309
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,510
Excellent.

310
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,150
Dr. Bekker, you'll lead.

311
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,150
Dr. Rhodes, you'll assist.

312
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,620
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,350
Oh, don't look so pained.

314
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,320
I think you just earned

315
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,320
yourself some good will.

316
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,200
When did Emma's pain start?

317
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,900
About an hour ago,

318
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,900
halfway through ballet class.

319
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,500
I wasn't sure

320
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,500
if I should bring her in,

321
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,840
but her mom would have my head

322
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,840
if something happened to her.

323
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,340
I was worried that

324
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,340
it might be appendicitis.

325
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,670
No, appendicitis would be

326
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,670
pain on her right side,

327
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,540
but I would like to get

328
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,540
an ultrasound.

329
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,510
You know, when I was young,

330
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,510
I wanted to take ballet,

331
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,020
but unfortunately,

332
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,020
I was born with two left feet,

333
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,490
so I went with violin instead.

334
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,150
Well, I don't

335
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,150
really like dance,

336
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,660
but my mommy did ballet

337
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,660
when she was young,

338
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,620
so she makes me go.

339
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,790
Oh.

340
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,300
Right now, I'm gonna

341
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,300
put this on your stomach,

342
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,660
so I can see

343
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,660
what's inside, okay?

344
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,090
All right.

345
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,710
Monique,

346
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,710
can you increase the depth?

347
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,270
I can't see

348
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,270
her uterus and ovaries.

349
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,610
It's already all the way up,

350
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,610
Dr. Manning.

351
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,720
All right,

352
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,720
let's start a line.

353
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,560
Give her one milligram

354
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,560
of morphine for the pain.

355
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,120
And let me know as soon

356
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,120
as her mom gets here.

357
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,460
I'd like to speak with her.

358
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,960
Is Emma gonna be okay?

359
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,290
Yes, but it's a good thing

360
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,290
that you brought her in.

361
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,960
All right, Emma,

362
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm gonna be back soon, okay?

363
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Okay.

364
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,970
Thank you.

365
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,750
Hey, Dr. Charles,

366
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,750
you got a sec?

367
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,910
I've got a case

368
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,910
I'd like to run by you.

369
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,550
What you got?

370
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,550
My patient, Emma, nine,

371
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,550
she presented with abdominal

372
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,550
pain on the left side,

373
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,020
so I did a quick bedside scan

374
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,020
to check her ovaries.

375
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,260
It's actually

376
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,260
testicular torsion.

377
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,820
Testicular torsion?

378
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,820
Yes.

379
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,930
The ultrasound showed an

380
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,930
absence of uterus and ovaries,

381
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,590
but she has

382
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,590
undescended testes.

383
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,690
Huh.

384
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,420
Nothing about this

385
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,420
in her chart?

386
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,270
No, I doubt the family

387
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,270
has any idea.

388
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,200
Okay. Page

389
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,200
Pediatric Urology.

390
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,140
We need to get

391
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,140
a plan together.

392
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,510
Okay, thank you.

393
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,840
I suspect Emma has

394
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,840
17-beta HSD3 deficiency.

395
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,850
It's caused by

396
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,850
a genetic mutation.

397
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,490
Emma's testes aren't

398
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,490
able to carry out

399
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,490
the final step of

400
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,490
testosterone synthesis.

401
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,500
So, just to be clear,

402
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,500
genetically, she's male?

403
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,690
She almost certainly has

404
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,690
XY chromosomes, yes.

405
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,500
As far as the testicular

406
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,500
torsion, what's required?

407
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,000
We need to untwist the testis

408
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,630
and then fixate it

409
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,630
via orchiopexy.

410
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,640
So we'll be able

411
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,640
to save the testicle?

412
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,940
With surgery, yes,

413
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,600
otherwise, it'll die from

414
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,600
lack of blood flow

415
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
in six, maybe

416
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
eight hours tops.

417
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,980
Okay, thank you, Dr. Rios.

418
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,170
We'll share the news

419
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,170
with her mother

420
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,810
and get surgical consent.

421
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,480
This news could

422
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,480
change Emma's

423
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,480
whole sense of identity.

424
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,780
It is a lot for this family

425
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,780
to process.

426
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,590
You know, my experience

427
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,590
in situations like this

428
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,520
is that the children are often

429
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,060
surprisingly open-minded

430
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,060
and resilient.

431
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,130
What's the story?

432
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,230
Well, Carter said that

433
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,230
Bo was cooking up BHL.

434
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,340
Uh, butane hash oil.

435
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,840
You blast marijuana

436
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,840
with enough butane,

437
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,170
and you get pure THC.

438
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,270
Lengths kids will go to

439
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,270
to get high these days.

440
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,680
Exactly.

441
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,380
Uh, Carter said he heard

442
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,380
screams from the other room,

443
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,420
so he ran in, he tried

444
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,420
to pat out the flames on Bo.

445
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,350
Then his sweatshirt

446
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,350
caught fire,

447
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,480
but he dropped and rolled.

448
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,460
Guessing from Bo's burns,

449
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,460
he didn't do the same.

450
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,090
Yeah, Carter said

451
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,090
Bo panicked and ran.

452
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,050
Can I talk to him?

453
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,890
He's nonresponsive

454
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,890
and on a ventilator,

455
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,260
but I'll let you know.

456
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,230
Hey, Will.

457
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,770
Dr. Frisch.

458
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,400
I think after last night,

459
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,400
you can call me Maia.

460
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,880
Lunch? I'm buying.

461
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,540
Uh, pretty slammed today.

462
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,770
Another time.

463
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,880
I take it you and Nat

464
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,880
are on the outs still?

465
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,620
As far as I know.

466
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,950
Careful.

467
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,950
She'll come around.

468
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,560
Mr. Lee, this stage

469
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,560
in your life can bring

470
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,660
a lot of painful emotions

471
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,660
and memories up.

472
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,130
I can help to talk about

473
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,130
what you're feeling,

474
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,630
any concerns you're having,

475
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,630
fears, regrets.

476
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,650
Henry, what is it?

477
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,650
What's wrong?

478
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,650
Where's my shirt?

479
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,800
My boy...

480
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,270
Jackson.

481
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,840
You have a son?

482
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,110
When he was little,

483
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,350
he was my shadow...

484
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,880
But as he got older,

485
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,880
we started butting heads.

486
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,220
Didn't care too much

487
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,220
for all my rules.

488
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,030
Rough neighborhood

489
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,030
where we lived.

490
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,130
Sounds like you were

491
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,130
just trying to protect him.

492
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,360
But maybe I was

493
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,360
too hard on him.

494
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,870
His mom passed

495
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,870
about 10 years ago.

496
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,400
After the funeral,

497
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,400
we had words.

498
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,880
Said some ugly things

499
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,880
to each other.

500
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,550
Haven't spoken since.

501
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,860
Do you have his phone number?

502
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,860
Any idea where he lives?

503
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,490
Last I heard,

504
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,220
he was up in Wilmette...

505
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,160
Or maybe Skokie?

506
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,230
Can't remember.

507
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,410
Should've reached out sooner.

508
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,270
It's not too late.

509
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,270
We'll find him.

510
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,050
We will do our best, Mr. Lee.

511
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,050
Don't you think

512
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,050
you're overpromising?

513
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,920
How do you know we'll be

514
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,920
able to track this guy down?

515
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,790
I'm not letting

516
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,790
Henry die alone.

517
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,870
Ruptured atrial appendage.

518
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,970
Median sternotomy

519
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,970
was the right call.

520
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,470
Ah, it was a coin toss.

521
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,470
Could've gone the other way.

522
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,840
Still, pulling

523
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,840
someone through

524
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,440
that kind of blunt trauma,

525
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,440
it's impressive.

526
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,880
You should write it up.

527
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,480
I know I said play nice,

528
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,480
but don't go soft on me.

529
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,290
That's no fun.

530
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,290
Hold on...

531
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,490
There are only

532
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,490
244 instruments here.

533
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,830
There are supposed to be 245.

534
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,530
Dr. Rhodes, stop closing.

535
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,530
Everyone search your areas.

536
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,070
Check your trays,

537
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,070
the drape pockets,

538
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,630
look in the basins,

539
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,630
everywhere.

540
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,630
It has to be here somewhere.

541
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,560
Somebody talk

542
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,560
to me, anybody!

543
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,240
We counted

544
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,240
three times already.

545
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,480
Instrument's in the chest.

546
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,780
Get a tech in here

547
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,780
to get a chest X-ray,

548
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,410
and page Dr. Latham now!

549
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,120
I don't understand.

550
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,220
How could her doctors

551
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,220
have missed this for so long?

552
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,490
Why don't we go

553
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,490
somewhere more private?

554
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
Your daughter is in

555
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
excellent hands, trust me.

556
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,460
Here, right this way.

557
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,770
So, because Emma's genitals

558
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,770
are typically female,

559
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,330
there was no reason to suspect

560
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,330
that she had the condition.

561
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,100
If the testicular torsion

562
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,080
hadn't caused

563
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,080
Emma's pain today,

564
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,800
it's very likely she

565
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,800
wouldn't have been diagnosed

566
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,240
until she reached puberty.

567
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,710
What happens during puberty?

568
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,540
When Emma turns 12 or 13,

569
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,140
uh, the testes will start

570
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,140
to make testosterone.

571
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,650
She may develop

572
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,650
typically male attributes.

573
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,280
Um, body and facial hair,

574
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,280
an Adam's apple,

575
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,050
her voice may deepen.

576
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,050
What?

577
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,790
No, that can't happen.

578
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,790
You have to take them out.

579
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,560
The only thing that is

580
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,560
medically necessary right now

581
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,120
is to alleviate Emma's pain

582
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,120
by untwisting the testis.

583
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
But Emma would have to have

584
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,100
another surgery

585
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,100
down the line, right?

586
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,600
I mean, she'd have to

587
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,600
have them taken out.

588
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,760
She's a girl.

589
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,430
Children with

590
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,430
Emma's condition

591
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,980
often identify as male

592
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,980
after puberty.

593
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,380
No, that's not...

594
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,380
That's not gonna happen.

595
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,310
I want you to take them out.

596
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,350
To perform an irreversible

597
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,350
procedure of this nature,

598
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,650
we would need to inform Emma

599
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,650
and get her assent.

600
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,660
Her assent?

601
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,660
She's nine.

602
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,420
She won't understand,

603
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,420
and even if she does,

604
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,460
it'll traumatize her.

605
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,460
We fully appreciate

606
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,620
how completely overwhelming

607
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,620
this is right now.

608
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,920
Really, we do.

609
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,690
But the truth is that

610
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,690
the evolving thinking

611
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,130
among medical ethicists

612
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,630
is that children should be

613
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,630
afforded gender autonomy,

614
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,170
regardless of their age.

615
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,870
You know what, I just wanna

616
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,870
be with my daughter right now.

617
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,360
Of course.

618
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,550
What the hell is that?

619
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,550
No idea.

620
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,480
Not an instrument I recognize.

621
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,610
But it is a foreign body,

622
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,320
and we can't pinpoint

623
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,320
where it is.

624
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,550
It could be in the pleural

625
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,550
cavity, the pericardium.

626
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,360
We're going to have to

627
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,360
reopen the sternotomy.

628
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,550
Clearly.

629
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,430
How could a careless oversight

630
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,430
like this occur?

631
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,620
We use the same instruments,

632
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,360
the same routine

633
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,360
every single time.

634
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,800
How could both of you miss it?

635
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,770
Is the patient's skin

636
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,770
fully closed?

637
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,130
No. A few staples away.

638
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,800
If the skin isn't closed,

639
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,540
then the incident

640
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,540
isn't a sentinel event.

641
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,240
Going back in won't be

642
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,240
considered a second operation.

643
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,480
You both narrowly escaped an

644
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,480
investigation by the hospital

645
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,580
and a report to IDPH.

646
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,210
I want you in my office

647
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,080
as soon as you retrieve

648
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,080
the foreign body,

649
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,320
and I wanna know

650
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,320
who's responsible.

651
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,990
Don't beat yourself up.

652
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,990
It's only your second strike.

653
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,860
You know this could

654
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,860
just as easily be

655
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,560
your instrument, right?

656
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,600
Lucky it's an easy fix.

657
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,740
You better not have

658
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,740
been smoking with Bo.

659
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,410
I wasn't, Mom.

660
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,410
I told you already.

661
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,140
Bo almost ended up

662
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,140
in juvie last year,

663
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,120
but the judge agreed

664
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,120
to give him another shot.

665
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,180
Now, you would've thought he

666
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,180
would've learned his lesson...

667
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,420
Mom, just shut up, okay?

668
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

669
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,860
Excuse me?

670
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,760
Don't talk to your mother

671
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,760
like that. What is with you?

672
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,830
What's going on?

673
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,530
Sats are dropping.

674
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,530
What's wrong with Bo?

675
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,360
Take him off the vent

676
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,360
and start bagging.

677
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,310
He's bradying down.

678
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,310
Heart rate's 30.

679
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,640
Milligram of epi.

680
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,510
No pulse. PEA.

681
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,510
Another milligram of Epi.

682
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,830
No.

683
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,800
No! No! No!

684
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,500
Son...

685
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,500
Bo, please!

686
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,300
Carter...

687
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,300
Carter... Carter...

688
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,340
No, just go save him, please!

689
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,340
Sweetie...

690
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,570
Please, Bo, come on, man!

691
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,770
Bo!

692
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,770
Carter...

693
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,840
Bo, come on, man!

694
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,160
That poor family.

695
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,160
Yeah.

696
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,590
It's strange.

697
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,060
Bo's parents said

698
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,060
he'd been doing so well.

699
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,830
They'd been regularly

700
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,830
drug-testing him.

701
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,560
He'd been clean for months.

702
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,670
Guess he just

703
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,670
fell off the wagon.

704
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,660
Did you get

705
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,660
a tox screen on Bo?

706
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,770
No, why?

707
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,780
Do me a favor and get one.

708
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm gonna get one on Carter.

709
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,180
Jackson Lee.

710
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,240
No? Okay.

711
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,240
All right, thank you, bye.

712
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,080
Hey, any news?

713
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,680
Not yet.

714
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,820
I think I found

715
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,820
his LinkedIn profile, though.

716
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,950
Just trying to track down

717
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,690
a phone number

718
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,690
or an e-mail address.

719
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,930
I have a friend

720
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,930
over at the DMV.

721
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,660
Send me what you have

722
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,660
on Jackson.

723
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,500
I'll see what he can do.

724
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,500
Thanks, Maggie.

725
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,230
Yeah.

726
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,230
Need some help in here.

727
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,900
Okay.

728
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,240
Sats down to 90.

729
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,240
CO2's at 65 on the ABG.

730
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,400
Okay, Mr. Lee, you have DNI

731
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,400
and DNR orders on your chart.

732
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,370
Now, I need to

733
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,370
confirm that you do not

734
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,370
want us to intubate you

735
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,880
or perform CPR

736
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,880
should your heart stop.

737
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,790
Okay. Then we're gonna

738
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,790
make you feel comfortable.

739
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,220
Start a morphine drip

740
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,220
and give four of Ativan.

741
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,140
Okay.

742
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,990
No holes in the right pleura.

743
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,020
Or the left.

744
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,650
It must be in the pericardium.

745
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,160
Give me more suction.

746
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,030
Instrument's not there.

747
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,830
It's in the heart.

748
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,750
We're going to have

749
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,750
to reopen the atriotomy.

750
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,940
That's going to require

751
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,940
putting him back on bypass.

752
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,110
You're increasing his risk of

753
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,110
air embolism and stroke.

754
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,350
We're aware, Marty,

755
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,350
but we don't have a choice.

756
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,180
Your quick fix just got

757
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,180
a lot more complicated.

758
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,290
Hi.

759
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,460
You feeling better, Emma?

760
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,520
My mommy says

761
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,520
I'll need an operation.

762
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,820
Yes, that's what my friend,

763
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,820
Dr. Charles, and I

764
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,130
came to talk to you about.

765
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,130
Hi, Emma.

766
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,070
So, you remember

767
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,070
when I took a picture

768
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,330
of your belly earlier?

769
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,070
Well, it showed me that you

770
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,070
have something inside of you.

771
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,440
Something that only boys

772
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,440
have, honey, not girls.

773
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,380
That part inside of you,

774
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,810
it may cause you

775
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,810
to change a little

776
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,580
on the outside in a few years.

777
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,210
It'll make you

778
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,210
look like a boy.

779
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,850
Ms. Paulson, would you mind

780
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,850
giving us a moment to explain?

781
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,210
Please?

782
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,880
So, Emma...

783
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,920
Most people

784
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,920
who look like girls

785
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,920
on the outside

786
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,750
feel like girls on the inside,

787
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,090
but sometimes,

788
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
a person who looks like

789
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
a girl on the outside

790
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,660
feels like a boy

791
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,660
on the inside,

792
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,660
and you know what...

793
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,100
Okay, stop, stop, you...

794
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,100
You're just confusing her.

795
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,240
Of course Emma

796
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,240
feels like a girl.

797
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,630
Sweetie,

798
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,630
the part inside of you,

799
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,410
it's what's hurting you

800
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,410
right now,

801
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,110
so Mommy wants

802
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,110
the doctors to take it out

803
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,580
so that you'll be safe.

804
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,510
Mrs. Paulson...

805
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,510
Wait, will it hurt?

806
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,840
No, not at all, sweetie.

807
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,680
You'll be asleep

808
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,680
the whole time.

809
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,850
And when you wake up,

810
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,850
we can get chocolate sundaes.

811
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,250
So it's okay

812
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,250
if they take them out?

813
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,760
Mmm-hmm.

814
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,230
Ms. Paulson, can we speak

815
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,230
to you outside for a moment?

816
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,870
Okay, you heard her.

817
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,370
You have her assent.

818
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,370
Take them out.

819
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,570
It was not

820
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,570
an informed decision.

821
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,070
Well, Emma's nine years old.

822
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,840
She didn't understand

823
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,840
half of what you were saying.

824
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,710
Again, regardless of her age,

825
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,710
it's very important

826
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,210
that we at least try and

827
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,210
explain the situation to Emma,

828
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,880
so we can give her a chance

829
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,880
to tell us how she feels.

830
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,380
I... I know how she feels.

831
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,920
I know my child, and I won't

832
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,920
let you manipulate her.

833
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,820
We were not trying

834
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,820
to manipulate her.

835
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,050
Why don't we take a beat,

836
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,820
let Dr. Manning and I

837
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,820
put our heads together,

838
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,590
and see if we can come up

839
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,590
with a course of action

840
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,100
that everybody's

841
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,100
comfortable with, okay?

842
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,600
I take it

843
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,600
things didn't go well.

844
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,440
Emma's mom coerced her into

845
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,440
having her testes removed.

846
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,030
Yeah, we gotta get

847
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,030
Goodwin involved

848
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,810
to see if we can convene

849
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,810
an emergency ethics panel.

850
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,900
We have three hours tops

851
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,900
until the testicle dies.

852
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,980
We better move fast.

853
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,020
Given the placement and

854
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,020
orientation of the handprints

855
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,620
on Carter's back,

856
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,620
there's no way

857
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,620
they're his own.

858
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,290
Okay? So?

859
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,090
So Carter told

860
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,090
my brother, Jay,

861
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,100
that he tried to slap out

862
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,100
the flames on Bo.

863
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,770
I haven't said

864
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,770
anything to Jay.

865
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,430
So, you think Carter

866
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,430
may have started the fire

867
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,030
and is blaming Bo?

868
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,470
Carter tested positive

869
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,470
for THC.

870
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,370
Bo was clean.

871
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,010
Thank you, Dr. Halstead.

872
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,060
What you up to?

873
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm trying to write a budget

874
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,290
for this research

875
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,290
grant application,

876
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,230
but Excel formulas hate me.

877
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,670
Well, I don't know

878
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,670
if you know this,

879
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,710
but I am kinda a math whiz.

880
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,500
I am, I can take a stab at it,

881
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,500
if you wanna go see your dad.

882
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't.

883
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,740
I don't want

884
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,740
to talk about him,

885
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,040
and I don't wanna see him.

886
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,340
Okay?

887
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,410
Yeah.

888
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,490
Noah...

889
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,330
I know you Sextons

890
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,330
are as thick as thieves,

891
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,730
but not every family's

892
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,730
like that.

893
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,730
April?

894
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,570
Your son is coming, Henry.

895
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,850
Jackson's coming.

896
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,240
Thank you.

897
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,090
My angel.

898
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,360
Metzenbaum

899
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,360
and DeBakey Forceps.

900
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,130
Reopening the atriotomy now.

901
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,070
I'll need better

902
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,070
visualization. Suction.

903
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,370
A-ha. There it is.

904
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,810
Stuck in the ostia

905
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,810
of the pulmonary vein.

906
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,440
What is it?

907
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,550
It's the tip of

908
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,550
a suction catheter.

909
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,710
You were the only one

910
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,710
on suction.

911
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,880
Then hold on.

912
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,020
Cardiac suction catheters

913
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,960
don't have detachable tips.

914
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,160
At one point, Dr. Bekker

915
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,160
had to suction

916
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,160
an area herself.

917
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,930
I handed her a catheter

918
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,930
from a trauma tray.

919
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,300
I think it's yours.

920
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,510
Well, we're going to need

921
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,510
to take it out, aren't we?

922
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,770
Stone forceps.

923
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,770
Forceps.

924
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,420
Got it.

925
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,260
BP is dropping.

926
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,760
The vessel tore.

927
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,760
He's bleeding out.

928
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,130
Quick,

929
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,130
get me some 5-0 Prolene

930
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,530
and a long needle driver.

931
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,190
Careful you don't

932
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,190
ligate the vein.

933
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,060
If you narrow it,

934
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,060
he could lose

935
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,060
part of his lung.

936
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,630
Why don't you stop

937
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,630
backseat driving

938
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,000
and help me save his life?

939
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,550
You okay?

940
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,550
Yes.

941
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,050
No.

942
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,720
My patient's mom

943
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,720
is trying to force

944
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,230
an invasive surgery on her.

945
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,060
Unless the ethics committee

946
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,060
intervenes,

947
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,060
I don't think

948
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,060
I'm gonna be

949
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,060
able to stop it.

950
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,230
I mean, I know I shouldn't

951
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,230
be unloading on you.

952
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,570
I'm... I know we're...

953
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,570
I'm sorry.

954
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,900
No, it's okay.

955
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,900
Case sounds tough.

956
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,240
Sorry, Nat.

957
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,480
But I know

958
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,480
you'll figure it out.

959
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,550
Yeah.

960
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,880
You look exhausted.

961
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,690
Are you okay?

962
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,680
Uh, yeah.

963
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,420
Had a tough time

964
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,420
sleeping last night.

965
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,060
Anyway, good luck.

966
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,570
Finished repairing

967
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,570
the pulmonary vein laceration.

968
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,100
BP any better, Marty?

969
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,100
Talk to me.

970
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,570
Vitals are stable.

971
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,140
Dr. Rhodes,

972
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,140
close the atriotomy,

973
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,150
take the patient off bypass,

974
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,150
and staple him up.

975
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,010
Uh, wait a second,

976
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,010
you're the lead here.

977
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,410
You have to decide

978
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,410
how you want him closed.

979
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,350
Wires or plates and screws

980
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,350
for the sternum?

981
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,180
Don't you remember

982
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,180
how we closed him last time?

983
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,350
Do it again.

984
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,890
I don't know who the hell

985
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,890
you think you are,

986
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,660
but that stunt

987
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,660
you just pulled,

988
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,530
leaving me there

989
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,530
to clean up your mess?

990
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,570
I'm sorry.

991
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,170
Come on, Ava,

992
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,170
you don't have to worry

993
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,040
about your reputation, okay?

994
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,880
This isn't some reflection

995
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,880
of your surgical skill.

996
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,050
This is just... It...

997
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,050
It's human error.

998
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,720
It could happen to anybody.

999
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,280
You really think

1000
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,280
it's my reputation

1001
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,620
I'm worried about?

1002
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,730
Bruce... Bruce

1003
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,730
almost died today,

1004
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,560
because of my stupid mistake.

1005
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,500
He didn't...

1006
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,500
Hey, listen to me.

1007
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,460
Ava, he didn't.

1008
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,670
He didn't, okay?

1009
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,840
He's in recovery

1010
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,840
because of what you did.

1011
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,470
Oh...

1012
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,470
What if he has deficits?

1013
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,310
I could never forgive myself.

1014
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,350
Involuntary manslaughter's

1015
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,350
a class 3 felony.

1016
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,360
Carries a potential

1017
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,360
jail sentence.

1018
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,760
It certainly doesn't

1019
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,760
help matters

1020
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,560
if Carter lied

1021
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,560
during his statement.

1022
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,890
Why are we discussing charges

1023
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,430
when we should be

1024
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,430
talking to the police?

1025
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,130
I'm sorry...

1026
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,000
But whatever

1027
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,000
the consequences are,

1028
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,870
Carter needs to face them.

1029
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,970
You're right.

1030
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,310
Thank you, gentlemen,

1031
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,310
for filling us in.

1032
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,010
We'll handle it from here.

1033
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,020
Look, Sharon...

1034
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,420
CFD and CPD will conduct

1035
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,990
their own very thorough

1036
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,990
investigation,

1037
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,500
and it is in the hospital's

1038
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,500
best interest

1039
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,500
and frankly yours

1040
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,500
to not put yourself

1041
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,500
in the middle.

1042
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,230
But I am

1043
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,230
in the middle, Peter.

1044
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,970
Carter's my godson.

1045
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,030
I've known this boy

1046
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,030
since he was in diapers.

1047
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,240
He's not some

1048
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,240
master manipulator.

1049
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,010
If he lied,

1050
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,010
it's because he was scared.

1051
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,310
Beside the fact that the

1052
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,310
Singletons are your friends,

1053
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,510
they are also major donors

1054
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,510
to this hospital,

1055
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,420
and there is a multimillion-

1056
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,420
dollar relationship

1057
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,510
at stake here.

1058
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,220
So if the kid is gonna

1059
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,220
get in trouble,

1060
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,220
please, let PD be

1061
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,220
the bad guys.

1062
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,530
Any word from

1063
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,530
the ethics committee?

1064
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,600
No way.

1065
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,370
No way they're gonna

1066
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,370
allow this.

1067
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,810
Because, technically,

1068
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,340
they have both Judy

1069
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,340
and Emma's consent,

1070
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,780
and because testicular torsion

1071
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,780
is a medical emergency,

1072
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,440
the hospital feels

1073
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,440
obligated to act.

1074
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,780
But the assent was coerced.

1075
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,750
Yeah, but coercion's

1076
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,750
very difficult to prove,

1077
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,880
and the truth is that in

1078
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,880
the majority of these cases,

1079
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,680
the courts do side

1080
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,680
with the parents.

1081
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,950
The board's worried

1082
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,950
about a negligence suit.

1083
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,690
What?

1084
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,230
Oh, no. Oh.

1085
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,420
Help. Someone, help.

1086
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,570
Uh, what... What's...

1087
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,570
what's wrong with her?

1088
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,370
The testicle

1089
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,370
must be more ischemic.

1090
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,100
Not getting enough blood flow.

1091
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,010
We can't wait any longer.

1092
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,570
Prep this patient

1093
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,570
for surgery now.

1094
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,720
Mommy, I'm scared.

1095
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,720
I don't want them to hurt me.

1096
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,550
No, no, no, honey,

1097
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,550
they won't hurt you,

1098
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,550
I promise.

1099
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,590
Judy, I know you love

1100
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,590
your daughter,

1101
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,750
and I know you're afraid of

1102
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,750
what the future might hold,

1103
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,380
but Emma trusts you,

1104
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,380
she counts on you.

1105
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
I just...

1106
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
I don't want anything

1107
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
to happen to my little girl.

1108
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,220
She's all that I have.

1109
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,220
You're not gonna lose her.

1110
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,320
No matter what gender

1111
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,320
Emma identifies with,

1112
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,660
she's still gonna be

1113
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,660
your child,

1114
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,760
the same kid who loves

1115
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,760
chocolate sundaes

1116
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,000
and hates ballet.

1117
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,000
She told you?

1118
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,960
That's the exciting part.

1119
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,470
Having our kids show us

1120
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,470
who they are

1121
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,470
in their own time.

1122
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,900
Mommy?

1123
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,310
Mommy?

1124
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,280
Don't take them out.

1125
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,610
Are you sure?

1126
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,610
Yes, I'm sure.

1127
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,150
Hey, Maggie,

1128
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,150
any word from Henry's son?

1129
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,420
I thought he was just

1130
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,420
driving down from Wilmette.

1131
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,260
His phone keeps on

1132
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,260
going to voicemail.

1133
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,090
Maybe he changed his mind

1134
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,090
about coming.

1135
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,260
How can he let

1136
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,260
his father die alone?

1137
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,700
We don't know

1138
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,700
the whole story, April,

1139
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,000
what went on between them.

1140
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,160
Some things are hard

1141
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,160
to get over.

1142
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,670
I never should have

1143
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,670
gotten Henry's hopes up.

1144
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,440
I have to tell him.

1145
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,440
I'll go with you.

1146
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,510
Henry?

1147
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,190
Henry...

1148
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,620
Jackson...

1149
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,300
Son...

1150
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,300
Henry, I'm sorry...

1151
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,490
I'm here.

1152
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,540
I'm right here.

1153
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,370
You came?

1154
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,410
Yeah.

1155
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,070
My boy.

1156
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,040
My boy.

1157
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,830
The evidence is substantial,

1158
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,540
and it's in

1159
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,540
Carter's best interest

1160
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,670
to come clean to the police

1161
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,670
on his own.

1162
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,580
A jury will look

1163
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,580
favorably on that.

1164
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,680
A jury?

1165
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,680
Oh, God. No.

1166
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,110
Sharon, I am begging you,

1167
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,220
please do not say anything.

1168
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,220
Lydia...

1169
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,950
This will not bring Bo back,

1170
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,860
and it will ruin

1171
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,860
Carter's life.

1172
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,900
Grace?

1173
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,900
I had to talk to you.

1174
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,110
When we got here,

1175
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,040
Dr. Choi told us

1176
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,040
what, uh, Carter did.

1177
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,970
Grace, I...

1178
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,450
He said when the paramedics

1179
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,450
found the boys,

1180
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,280
that Carter

1181
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,440
was performing CPR on Bo.

1182
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,160
I'm so sorry, Lydia.

1183
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,490
I'm so sorry that Bo got

1184
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,490
Carter into this mess.

1185
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,130
I'm so sorry.

1186
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,850
Hey, Will...

1187
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,850
Thank you for earlier.

1188
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,090
I didn't do anything.

1189
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,320
Well, that's the point.

1190
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,320
You just listened.

1191
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,060
I appreciate it.

1192
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,290
All right.

1193
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,700
Well, I'm always here to lend

1194
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,700
an ear any time you need.

1195
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,600
How 'bout tonight?

1196
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,760
Oysters at Shaw's?

1197
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,700
Sure.

1198
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,700
Okay.

1199
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,120
Hey.

1200
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,130
You know the last time

1201
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,500
we were in a hospital room

1202
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,500
together?

1203
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,370
The day you were born.

1204
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,800
You were there?

1205
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,800
Mmm-hmm, yeah.

1206
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,130
I was holding you

1207
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,130
when you opened your eyes

1208
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,700
for the first time.

1209
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,650
You know, they say

1210
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,650
it takes about a week

1211
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,050
for a newborn

1212
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,050
to focus on objects,

1213
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,150
but I swear,

1214
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,580
you looked right at me.

1215
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,750
And that was it.

1216
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,730
I was hooked.

1217
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,890
You know, Carter,

1218
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,890
you're my godson.

1219
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,190
I only want

1220
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,190
what's best for you.

1221
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,770
And if there's anything else

1222
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,400
you need to tell

1223
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,400
the police, baby,

1224
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,670
now is the time.

1225
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,600
You...

1226
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,970
You're gonna carry

1227
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,970
this day with you

1228
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,210
for the rest of your life,

1229
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,050
and holding a secret

1230
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,050
on top of that...

1231
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,720
It'll be too much, baby.

1232
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,190
It'll break you, Carter.

1233
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,560
It'll break you.

1234
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,380
Yes, he's hanging in.

1235
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,380
Yeah, I'll...

1236
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,580
Let... Let...

1237
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,580
Let me call you back,

1238
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,580
Miles, thanks, bye.

1239
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,430
What is he doing here?

1240
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,560
Carter asked to speak with

1241
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,560
Detective Halstead again.

1242
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,420
What did you say to him?

1243
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,490
I'm sorry, Lydia.

1244
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,270
You're sorry?

1245
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,910
That was the right thing

1246
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,910
to do, Ms. Goodwin.

1247
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,660
Yeah, I think

1248
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,660
that's debatable.

1249
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,090
When the Singletons

1250
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,090
pull their funding,

1251
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,530
which I imagine

1252
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,530
they're going to do,

1253
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,500
you're gonna have to

1254
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,500
answer to the board.

1255
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,300
I'm prepared to do that.

1256
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,800
Noah...

1257
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,800
What you did in there...

1258
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,570
You think I was wrong

1259
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,370
for letting him think

1260
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,370
his son was there.

1261
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,070
No. No, I don't.

1262
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,070
I think it was really kind.

1263
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,480
I'm sorry I snapped

1264
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,480
at you earlier.

1265
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,490
No, you don't... You don't

1266
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,490
have to apologize. That's...

1267
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,530
No, I do. I do.

1268
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,530
You were just being a friend.

1269
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,330
When I said I didn't

1270
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,330
wanna see my dad,

1271
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,200
the truth is I don't want

1272
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,200
to want to see him.

1273
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,860
Does that make sense?

1274
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,100
Um...

1275
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,100
It's okay.

1276
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,840
It doesn't make sense

1277
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,840
to me either.

1278
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,400
Night, Noah.

1279
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,400
Night.

1280
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,370
How's the patient?

1281
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,370
Just waking up.

1282
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,670
But his vitals are stable and

1283
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,670
he's neurologically intact.

1284
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,040
Ah.

1285
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,240
I suppose you know

1286
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,240
what I'm going to ask next.

1287
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,510
It was my instrument,

1288
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,510
Dr. Latham.

1289
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,710
I take full responsibility.

1290
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,940
No, it was my instrument.

1291
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,940
My fault.

1292
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,120
That's not true.

1293
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,120
Yes, it is.

1294
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,820
Ah.

1295
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,390
My rabbi used to say,

1296
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,830
Ah.

1297
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,370
"You are smart, smart, smart,

1298
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,560
"but, eh, not so smart."

1299
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,180
You both are my most

1300
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,180
promising fellows,

1301
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,270
but now I am no longer certain

1302
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,270
that either of you

1303
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,150
should be my second for

1304
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,150
the conjoined twins surgery.

1305
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,750
I'll be watching you both

1306
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,750
very closely going forward.

1307
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,790
You didn't have to do that.

1308
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,790
I know.

1309
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,590
I can take my lumps.

1310
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,590
Never said you couldn't.

1311
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,710
I guess we're both

1312
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,710
in the doghouse now.

1313
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,140
Plenty of room for two.

1314
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,680
Don't worry,

1315
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,680
you get used to it.

1316
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,320
Builds character.

1317
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,350
Here you are, sir.

1318
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,220
Oh, hey.

1319
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,950
I ordered us half a dozen

1320
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,950
of Henderson Bay oysters.

1321
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,290
What do you want to drink?

1322
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,500
Uh, excuse me...

1323
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,500
Wait, Nat...

1324
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,830
If there's any chance

1325
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,830
we're moving forward here,

1326
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,230
there's something

1327
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,230
I gotta tell you.

1328
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,870
What is it?

1329
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,810
Last night after work,

1330
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,810
I grabbed a drink.

1331
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,710
I met someone at the bar.

1332
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,020
It was nothing.

1333
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,020
It was just high school stuff.

1334
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,380
High school stuff?

1335
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,380
It didn't go beyond kissing.

1336
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,020
Well, not much.

1337
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,250
And I... I thought of you.

1338
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,250
I put the brakes on.

1339
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,520
I actually fell asleep

1340
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,520
on her couch.

1341
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,220
Were you thinking of me

1342
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,220
when you went home with her?

1343
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,700
Nat, you've been so distant

1344
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,700
the past two weeks,

1345
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,800
I didn't know if things

1346
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,800
would turn around

1347
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,800

1348
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,170
You know, when I asked

1349
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,170

00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,400
it was never about

1351
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,400
wanting anyone else.

1352
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,500
I don't want anyone else.

1353
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,840
It meant nothing, I swear.

1354
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,840
Nat, I'm...
