1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,930
Stand back.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,300
What was his temp?

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,300
102.

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,780
Yeah, he's junky and wheezy

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,780
on both sides.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,910
Zach's been coughing,

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,910
uh, gasping.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,350
It's terrible.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,220
Bibasilar infiltrates.

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,520
What does that mean?

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,520
Well, most likely, pneumonia.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,090
April, let's start vancomycin,

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,090
40 milligrams per kilogram,

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,030
and we'll get him admitted

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,030
to the PICU.

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,360
Oh, God.

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,360
Don't worry.

18
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,060
We've got great pediatricians.

19
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,030
Yeah, you can

20
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,030
go up with him.

21
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,030
Dr. Charles,

22
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,030
why didn't you tell me

23
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,840
the truth about my father?

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,510
And... And what is that?

25
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,810
That he is a psychopath.

26
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,910
I looked at his chart.

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,880
You did, did ya?

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,880
Yes.

29
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,850
Before you looked at

30
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,850
your father's chart,

31
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,580
did you agree

32
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,580
to cosign his loan?

33
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,920
No.

34
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,920
You didn't?

35
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,890
Could that maybe be because,

36
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,490
somewhere, you already

37
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,490
knew what he was?

38
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,260
You could have told me.

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,820
Sarah, I couldn't tell you.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,820
You know I couldn't.

41
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,990
Yeah, because

42
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,990
he locked you up

43
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,830
with doctor-patient

44
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,830
confidentiality.

45
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,700
He made it so you couldn't

46
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,700
interfere,

47
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,000
went to you

48
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,000
with a bogus complaint.

49
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,510
God, the premeditation,

50
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,510
the manipulation,

51
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,050
it's... He is disgusting.

52
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,310
Or he's just somebody

53
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,350
who is incapable of

54
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,350
empathetic feelings.

55
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,970
Sarah, look, I'm so sorry,

56
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,720
I can't imagine how difficult

57
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,720
this must be,

58
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,650
but I would just hope

59
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,650
that... That...

60
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,990
There might be something

61
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,990
positive in your knowing.

62
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,820
Positive?

63
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,820
Well, just the clarity.

64
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,660
The clarity of the revelation

65
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,660
that your father was

66
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,660
who he was

67
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,830
and he was born that way,

68
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,890
and that his leaving

69
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,230
had absolutely nothing

70
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,230
to do with you.

71
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,800
That's my consolation?

72
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,540
Dr. Charles,

73
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,540
after all of these years...

74
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,800
All these years,

75
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,540
my father finally

76
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,540
walks back into my life,

77
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,780
and it turns out...

78
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,710
He never loved me.

79
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,620
He can never love me.

80
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,730
ED?

81
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,930
Yeah.

82
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,310
Dr. Halstead, it's the PICU.

83
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,210
This is Dr. Halstead.

84
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,480
Yeah, that's right.

85
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,480
Zach Womack, four months old.

86
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,450
Really?

87
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,690
Hey, thank you.

88
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,980
That baby we just

89
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,980
sent up to the PICU...

90
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,760
He never made it there.

91
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,570
We got off the elevator,

92
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,570
a nurse met us,

93
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,230
and she said that Zach

94
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,230
needed some sort of test.

95
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,140
A scan.

96
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,140
She said he needed a scan.

97
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,870
She took him away

98
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,870
and she never

99
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,870
brought him back.

100
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,740
Did you follow up

101
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,740
with Radiology?

102
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,870
No scans were ordered.

103
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,470
And the nurse

104
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,470
they've described

105
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,820
doesn't match

106
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,820
anyone on my staff.

107
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,880
Has someone kidnapped

108
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,880
our baby?

109
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,790
We can't be sure

110
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,790
about that yet.

111
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
Oh, no.

112
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,490
No.

113
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,950
Call a Code Pink.

114
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,290
Tell Security to put

115
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,290
the hospital on lockdown.

116
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,800
The ED, including Trauma,

117
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,800
goes on bypass.

118
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,000
Until further notice,

119
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,000
no one comes in or out.

120
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,930
I promise you we're going

121
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,930
to find your baby.

122
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,120
Earl, the hospital's

123
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,120
going on lockdown.

124
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,450
Get to your post.

125
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,450
Yes, sir.

126
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,610
This is Cole.

127
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,610
Code Pink. Code Pink.

128
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,660
Copy that, Code Pink.

129
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,400
Get that patient in now.

130
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,400
Hospital's going on lockdown.

131
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,820
You're going to

132
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,820
Treatment Two.

133
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,460
Jill Fisher, 25 years old.

134
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,430
Her VW Bug got T-boned

135
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,430
by a pickup.

136
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,900
Seat belt sign

137
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,900
and chest wall abrasions.

138
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,560
Gonna need X-ray.

139
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,560
Help me!

140
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,970
I'm her mother.

141
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,970
We are, sweetheart.

142
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,970
BP, 100 over 70.

143
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,880
Heart rate, 96.

144
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,880
She's satting at 88%.

145
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,510
Is she gonna be okay?

146
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,510
We haven't examined her yet,

147
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,450
but we're gonna

148
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,450
take good care of her.

149
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,510
All right,

150
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,510
let's get her transferred

151
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,680
and onto the monitors.

152
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,150
One, two, and three.

153
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,550
Doris, 50 of fentanyl.

154
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,550
On it.

155
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,920
Is she gonna be okay?

156
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,920
Ma'am, please come with me.

157
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,190
I... I love you, honey.

158
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,190
Careful.

159
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,700
Multiple right

160
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,700
posterior rib fractures

161
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,970
and a pneumothorax.

162
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,940
She needs a chest tube.

163
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,940
20 of lidocaine.

164
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,640
Sats are 82 and falling.

165
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,010
All right, so hustle.

166
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,490
Ready for the tube.

167
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,590
She's at 90.

168
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,590
Sats are coming up.

169
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,730
Uh, we're gonna need

170
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,730
a repeat chest X-ray,

171
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
and let's order a CT c-spine,

172
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
abdomen and pelvis.

173
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,100
Code Pink. Code Pink.

174
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,510
Missing kid?

175
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,510
Yeah.

176
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,610
Probably the baby

177
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,610
Dr. Halstead sent to PICU.

178
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,410
Sorry, yes, I understand.

179
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,410
Step back.

180
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,610
Step back, ma'am.

181
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,180
We'll let you know

182
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,180
as soon as possible.

183
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,450
All right, people, the ED

184
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,450
is officially on bypass.

185
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,820
Lock it down.

186
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,820
Nothing comes in or out.

187
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,890
Keep your eyes open

188
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,890
for a woman,

189
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,790
probably in scrubs,

190
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,790
with an infant.

191
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,160
Doris, triage

192
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,160
the waiting room.

193
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,890
Let's clear out

194
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,890
any rooms we can.

195
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,460
And cycle in the patients

196
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,460
with the most immediate needs.

197
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,000
Got it.

198
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,400
Monique, I want an inventory

199
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,400
of our drugs, blood products,

200
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,300
all critical supplies.

201
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,340
We need to be ready to make do

202
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,340
with what we've got on hand.

203
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,400
Copy.

204
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,070
The cops should've

205
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,070
stopped you. We're on bypass.

206
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,840
We're not leaving.

207
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,840
This guy could die.

208
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,740
Earl, we're not gonna let

209
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,740
this man bleed to death.

210
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,170
Let him in. It's on me.

211
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,190
Come on, let's go. Dr. Choi?

212
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,190
Right here.

213
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,190
You're going to Baghdad.

214
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,850
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

215
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,320
Tim Vance, 30-year-old male.

216
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,320
Bar fight.

217
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,290
Took a long blade

218
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,290
to his left chest.

219
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,920
Heart rate, 120.

220
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,920
BP, 92 over 58.

221
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,930
He stabbed me

222
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,930
over a game of pool.

223
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,870
All right, save your breath.

224
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,370
Let's transfer.

225
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,270
On my count.

226
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,270
Ready, one, two, three.

227
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,280
All right,

228
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,280
no breath sounds on the left.

229
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,290
Hand me the ultrasound.

230
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,290
Code Pink...

231
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,350
The Code Pink could be

232
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,350
the baby I treated.

233
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,080
Man...

234
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,890
He's got a large

235
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,890
pericardial effusion.

236
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,220
Blood's pooling

237
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,220
around the heart.

238
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,290
BP's falling!

239
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
Tamponade's compressing

240
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
the heart.

241
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,860
He's bradying down.

242
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,860
Start bagging.

243
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,860
Page Dr. Rhodes.

244
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,130
He's not in the hospital.

245
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,130
Big CT event off campus.

246
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,130
They're not gonna let him in

247
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,130
'cause of the lockdown.

248
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,970
Get me another surgeon.

249
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,970
Dr. Latham's in surgery,

250
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,200
and the Trauma service is up

251
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,200
in the OR on another case.

252
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,900
Then splash prep his left

253
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,900
chest and hand me a knife.

254
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,070
I gotta open him up now.

255
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,120
Dr. Rhodes.

256
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,120
Morning.

257
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,350
Morning.

258
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,350
You know my husband, Larry.

259
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,410
Larry, good to see you.

260
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,250
He's always dragging me

261
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,250
to these things.

262
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm an introvert. I hate them.

263
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,960
I am completely

264
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,960
with you there.

265
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,860
Yes, well, there are

266
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,860
a lot of checkbooks here,

267
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,960
and their owners would like

268
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,960
to meet our rising star,

269
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,300
so please...

270
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,300
Go and schmooze.

271
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,030
Ah.

272
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,970
Dad.

273
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,010
Were your ears burning?

274
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,010
We were just talking

275
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,010
about you.

276
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,570
Oh, really?

277
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,570
Yeah.

278
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,370
I told Dr. Bekker

279
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,370
how your mother and I knew,

280
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,180
even when you were

281
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,180
just a little boy,

282
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,550
how you'd be a surgeon.

283
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,080
Do you remember when that dog

284
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,080
got ahold of your

285
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,080
Teddy Ruxpin?

286
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,220
He sewed that little thing

287
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,220
together.

288
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,320
You had a Teddy Ruxpin?

289
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,390
I wouldn't believe everything

290
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,390
my father tells you.

291
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,990
Oh, Connor's always

292
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,990
been uncomfortable

293
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,030
with anything that

294
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,030
smelled of praise.

295
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,400
That's funny,

296
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,400
I never noticed that.

297
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
I'm gonna go get

298
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
some breakfast.

299
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,870
Try the avocado toast.

300
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,270
We are having a trunk show

301
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,270
next week.

302
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,310
Loro Piana. I would love it

303
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,310
if you'd come as my guest.

304
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,110
I'd love to.

305
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,040
Ava...

306
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,040
Hospital's on lockdown.

307
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,850
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

308
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,650
Dr. Reese,

309
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,650
Goodwin needs us upstairs

310
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
to consult on that Code Pink.

311
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,960
On the way.

312
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,900
Hey.

313
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,970
Hey.

314
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,010
Code Pink. Code Pink.

315
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,540
All hospital personnel,

316
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,130
please report to

317
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,130
your designated stations.

318
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,010
It was a baby that I treated.

319
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,980
Oh, God.

320
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,940
Patient got in

321
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,940
just under the wire.

322
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,180
Both of you, please.

323
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,780
Good morning.

324
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,330
I'm Dr. Halstead.

325
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,330
This is Dr. Manning.

326
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,860
Hi.

327
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,860
Hello.

328
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,330
Mr. Taylor, I see you're

329
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,330
being treated for lymphoma.

330
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,700
That's right.

331
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,670
He's had multiple rounds

332
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,670
of chemo.

333
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,970
So, what brings you in today?

334
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,170
Woke up this morning,

335
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,170
could hardly breathe.

336
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,600
Our oncologist at East Mercy

337
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,600
said to come here

338
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,910
since it's closer.

339
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,500
Well, it's a good thing

340
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,500
that you did.

341
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,350
Uh, let's get a chest X-ray,

342
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,350
CBC, coags, and a d-dimer,

343
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,750
and also, call over to East

344
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,750
Mercy for his records, okay?

345
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,810
Thank you.

346
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,360
Just try to relax,

347
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,360
Mr. Taylor.

348
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,890
We're gonna run these tests

349
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,890
and sort this out.

350
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,190
Okay.

351
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,190
We'll be back shortly.

352
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,560
Thanks.

353
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,950
Let's hope he's just got

354
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,950
a little bug.

355
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,120
Yeah. Nat...

356
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,930
I can't stand this.

357
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,930
We gotta talk.

358
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,930
I know.

359
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,300
Come over tonight.

360
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,750
We reviewed

361
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,750
all the security cam footage.

362
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,580
No one left the hospital

363
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,580
with the infant.

364
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,180
So he and his abductor

365
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,180
are still on the premises?

366
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,240
We think so.

367
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,450
We would've gotten a ping

368
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,450
from the baby's

369
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,450
ID bracelet

370
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,950
if the abductor had tried

371
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,950
to exit with him.

372
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,560
Dr. Charles,

373
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,560
from your experience,

374
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,090
what kind of person

375
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,090
do you think we're

376
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,090
looking for?

377
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,860
In a majority of these cases,

378
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,560
the abductor is a woman

379
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,560
of child-bearing age,

380
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,830
who is either infertile

381
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,890
or has experienced fetal loss.

382
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,940
Um, they're distraught and

383
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,940
determined one way

384
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,940
or the other

385
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,300
to have a baby of their own.

386
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,570
Then maybe she's not likely

387
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,570
to hurt him.

388
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,310
Not if wanting a child

389
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,310
is what's driving her.

390
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,580
But what if that's

391
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,580
not what's driving her?

392
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,610
What if she's someone who

393
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,610
enjoys causing other's pain,

394
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,840
a person without a conscience?

395
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,180
I mean, it's possible,

396
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,410
and if someone like that

397
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,410
gets backed into a corner,

398
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,790
there's no telling

399
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,790
how she might react.

400
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,990
This person knew

401
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,990
where the PICU was.

402
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,930
Could very well

403
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,930
have been a patient here.

404
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,190
I think we should

405
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,190
compile a list of women

406
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,930
who have experienced

407
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,930
birth trauma here

408
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,490
in the last six months.

409
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,430
All right, and I think

410
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,430
it's a good idea for you

411
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,910
to assign a psychiatrist

412
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,910
to each search team,

413
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,310
help defuse any situation

414
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,310
where the baby may be at risk.

415
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,400
Let's get started.

416
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,720
Daniel...

417
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,320
We've got to find this baby.

418
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,250
Your patient has

419
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,250
a large mediastinal mass

420
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,890
with what looks like positive

421
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,890
nodes throughout his chest.

422
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,560
It's compressing his lungs

423
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,560
and all his major vessels.

424
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,100
That's why he's

425
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,100
so short of breath.

426
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,530
Okay, so, what's next?

427
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,370
Surgery?

428
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,370
Another round of chemo?

429
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,770
A tumor this large?

430
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,770
Even with chemotherapy,

431
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,540
it wouldn't shrink

432
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,540
to an operable size.

433
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,170
Then what?

434
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,610
Um, from his medical records,

435
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,580
it looks like he's had

436
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,580
a solid treatment history.

437
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,590
Unfortunately, we've reached

438
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,590
the limits of what we can do.

439
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,620
So that's it?

440
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,620
We're giving up?

441
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,590
No, there... There has to be

442
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,590
something else we can do.

443
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,250
Uh...

444
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,250
My advice?

445
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
The sooner you tell Mr. Taylor

446
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
and his wife the prognosis,

447
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,820
the better.

448
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,130
It'll give them a chance

449
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,130
to find some closure.

450
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,130
Hi.

451
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,000
I got your CT results.

452
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,600
In addition to your

453
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,600
rib injury,

454
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,840
you also have a compression

455
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,840
fracture of your L2.

456
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,500
That's a vertebrae

457
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,500
in your lower back.

458
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,210
Now, it's not serious.

459
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,610
Doesn't require surgery...

460
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,980
But because of the chest tube

461
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,980
and the fractures,

462
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,610
we wanna keep you in the

463
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,610
hospital for a couple of days.

464
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,950
Once we get you upstairs,

465
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,620
we'll start you on

466
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,620
a pain-management regimen

467
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,860
and fit you for a brace, okay?

468
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,090
Thank you, Dr. Sexton.

469
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,000
How much time do I have?

470
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,700
Hard to say.

471
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,870
A few weeks, maybe less.

472
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,410
Oh, my God.

473
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,500
I am so sorry.

474
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,650
We can have a hospice nurse

475
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,650
come in and talk to you.

476
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,650
A hospice?

477
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,450
I know.

478
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,350
But hospice will provide

479
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,350
your husband

480
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,120
with the best quality of life

481
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,120
in the time that remains.

482
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,600
I always said

483
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,600
I wanted to die at home.

484
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,490
Looks like I'll get my wish.

485
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,640
It'll be all right, Bev.

486
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,870
Call the kids,

487
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,870
have them come out.

488
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,420
How soon can we leave?

489
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,080
Unfortunately, the hospital

490
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,080
is under lockdown currently,

491
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,280
due to a security issue.

492
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,650
No one is allowed in or out.

493
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,490
But we can start

494
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,490
your discharge paperwork,

495
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,290
and as soon as

496
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,290
the lockdown is lifted,

497
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,130
you'll be able to go home.

498
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,600
Thank you.

499
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,430
It's okay.

500
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,170
Heart rate's down to 80.

501
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,580
All right...

502
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,550
I'm gonna release

503
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,550
the tamponade.

504
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,310
Give me some suction.

505
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,360
Numbers are

506
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,360
still in the tank.

507
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,190
Because he was stabbed

508
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,190
in the heart. He needs blood.

509
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,560
I don't care where he is,

510
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,560
get me Connor.

511
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,590
Just prepare

512
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,590
an innocuous press release,

513
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,130
and then let me know

514
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,130
the second we find that baby.

515
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,300
Dr. Rhodes.

516
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,570
Connor,

517
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,570
I need your help, buddy.

518
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,340
Yeah, okay. Ava.

519
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,210
Surgical suites one and three

520
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,210
aren't in use.

521
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,840
You check those,

522
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,840
we'll cover the rest.

523
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,820
Code Pink. Code Pink.

524
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,410
All hospital personnel,

525
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,320
please report to

526
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,320
your designated stations.

527
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,520
Clear.

528
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,550
So, your description

529
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,550
of our attacker

530
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,890
is someone possibly

531
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,890
without a conscience.

532
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,660
I'm just curious,

533
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,660
what led you to that?

534
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,220
There have been

535
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,220
a number of cases

536
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,360
of women murdering children,

537
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,460
Diane Downs, Susan Smith.

538
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,840
I don't really see

539
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,840
the comparison, though.

540
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,500
I mean, neither of those women

541
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,340
abducted a baby

542
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,340
from a hospital.

543
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,780
You're just speculating, too.

544
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,970
We don't know

545
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,970
who we're dealing with.

546
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,810
There's no guarantee

547
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,810
she's some bereft mother

548
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,870
who's lost a child.

549
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,440
For all we know,

550
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,440
she could be a...

551
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,050
A psychopath?

552
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,560
Dr. Charles, this has

553
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,560
nothing to do with my father.

554
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,460
And just because my opinion

555
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,460
is different from yours

556
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,550
doesn't make it biased.

557
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,550
All clear.

558
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,300
Will, I've been doing

559
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,300
research on Gary's cancer,

560
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,070
and I found a case

561
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,070
where a combination

562
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,300
of bleomycin, etoposide,

563
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,300
and cisplatin

564
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,430
rapidly shrank

565
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,430
germ cell tumors,

566
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,840
so I called

567
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,840
my oncologist friend,

568
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,540
who said it was anecdotal

569
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,540
but possible.

570
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,520
Anecdotal?

571
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,880
There haven't been

572
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,880
any studies,

573
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,610
and it's not approved

574
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,610
by the FDA.

575
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,780
So, you're proposing

576
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,780
we use these drugs off-label?

577
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,780
Will, the man is

578
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,780
terminally ill.

579
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,590
Yes... And I don't wanna

580
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,590
speed up that process,

581
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,820
or cause him

582
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,820
any unnecessary suffering.

583
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,490
Well, I think

584
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,490
it's worth the risk.

585
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,660
I'm sorry, I don't.

586
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,360
What happened to you?

587
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,860
You used to go to any length

588
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,860
to try and save someone.

589
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,640
Yeah,

590
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,640
and it never ended well.

591
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,730
I also have a larger

592
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,730
responsibility now.

593
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,710
Because you're an Attending?

594
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,710
That's right.

595
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,740
So I don't get a say?

596
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,180
I'm sorry, in this case, no.

597
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,380
What you're suggesting

598
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,380
is bad medicine.

599
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,780
Okay.

600
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,390
All right, give me

601
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,390
a view of the medial side

602
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,930
of the left ventricle.

603
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,690
Yeah, good.

604
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,490
Uh, now, Ethan, you're gonna

605
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,490
remove your finger,

606
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,190
and once you get

607
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,190
the stapler in place,

608
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,360
you're gonna close laterally

609
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,360
across the opening.

610
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,100
I can't get

611
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,100
the stapler in place.

612
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,370
It's a moving target.

613
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,940
Keep trying.

614
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,280
Got it. Staple's in.

615
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,010
Good.

616
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,340
No. No, wait,

617
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,340
this isn't working.

618
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,780
Every time I get a staple in,

619
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,780
it tears,

620
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,580
making the hole even bigger.

621
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,580
All right, here.

622
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,220
What are you doing?

623
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,220
I gotta get in there.

624
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,950
The hospital's on lockdown.

625
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,950
They won't let you in.

626
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,920
I have to try.

627
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,920
Help Ethan get him stabilized.

628
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,090
All right, Dr. Choi,

629
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,090
let's see if I can keep you

630
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,650
from killing this patient.

631
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,090
You understand

632
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,090
this is experimental?

633
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,060
I can't guarantee

634
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,060
it'll have any effect

635
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,800
on Mr. Taylor's cancer.

636
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,200
It might even be harmful.

637
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,370
We understand.

638
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,770
And do I have

639
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,770
your permission?

640
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,410
Yes.

641
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,010
Please. Go ahead.

642
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,750
Okay.

643
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,060
Sorry, folks, as soon as

644
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,060
the lockdown is lifted, you'll

645
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,060
all get to see a doctor.

646
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,960
So what? I'm just supposed

647
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,960
to wait here bleeding?

648
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,190
Got no choice, ma'am.

649
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,190
If you're worried,

650
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,760
Lakeshore Memorial's

651
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,760
only a mile away.

652
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,560
Sir, gotta stop you there.

653
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,600
Look, I am a doctor

654
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,600
on staff here, all right?

655
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,970
Sorry, can't let you in.

656
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,630
There is a man

657
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,630
in the emergency room

658
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,770
with a stab wound

659
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,770
in his heart.

660
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,770
Sorry.

661
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,940
If I don't get in there,

662
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,940
he's gonna die.

663
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,870
Not my call.

664
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,670
I wish I could let you in,

665
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,670
but it's not up to me.

666
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,650
Fine.

667
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,650
I will let you in,

668
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,240
as soon as the lockdown is...

669
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,240
Earl, I need to get in there.

670
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,050
Can you help me out?

671
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,460
Come with me.

672
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,450
Look, legally...

673
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,990
I found this tunnel

674
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,990
when we were reviewing

675
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,630
the hospital's emergency

676
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,630
evacuation plan.

677
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,860
Apparently, it was used

678
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,860
to ferry patients

679
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,960
and supplies

680
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,960
between buildings.

681
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,970
But once they put in

682
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,970
the over-street walkways,

683
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,530
it was decommissioned.

684
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,670
Here's your way in.

685
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,250
When you come to the fork,

686
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,250
stay to the right.

687
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,080
At the end of the tunnel,

688
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,080
you'll find a series of doors.

689
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,420
Take the first one

690
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,420
on the right.

691
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,720
That'll put you

692
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,720
inside the hospital.

693
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,950
All right, thanks, Earl.

694
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,890
Oh, and you...

695
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,890
You might need this.

696
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,060
Anyone asks,

697
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,060
it wasn't me who told you.

698
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,730
You got it.

699
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,900
How's she doing?

700
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,900
Um, sleeping.

701
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,600
Good. We're still waiting

702
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,600
for a room to open.

703
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,440
I'm transferring

704
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,440
another patient now,

705
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,540
but Jill's next in line.

706
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,650
Hopefully won't be

707
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,650
much longer.

708
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,380
Dr. Manning, can I see you?

709
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,030
Please excuse me.

710
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,330
You gave him those drugs?

711
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,330
Mmm-hmm.

712
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,230
I told you not to,

713
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,230
and you did it anyway.

714
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840
His wife wanted

715
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840
to give 'em a try.

716
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,500
You shouldn't have

717
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,500
even suggested it.

718
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,540
She deserved a choice.

719
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,980
You went behind my back.

720
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,980
I can't believe you did that.

721
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,650
You wouldn't listen to me.

722
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,650
I did listen to you.

723
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,350
I just hope you haven't put

724
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,350
a nail in this man's coffin.

725
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,670
Cole here.

726
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,070
We just got a ping

727
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,070
off the baby's ID bracelet.

728
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,670
She used an emergency exit

729
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,670
stairwell, East Wing.

730
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,630
Wait...

731
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,010
"Zachary Womack."

732
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,010
They were here.

733
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,840
She cut off his bracelet.

734
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,180
She knew the signal

735
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,180
would bring us here.

736
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,650
She's playing a game with us.

737
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,740
His IV.

738
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,010
He's not getting

739
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,010
his antibiotics anymore.

740
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,190
Ah, come on.

741
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,020
I still can't get it in.

742
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,630
Get me a closer look

743
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,630
at the hole.

744
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,840
Here's what I want you to do.

745
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,870
Get two Allis clamps...

746
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,240
Here.

747
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,650
I want you to clamp on

748
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,650
either side of the hole.

749
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,950
Ready.

750
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,950
Okay, April,

751
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,790
you're going to

752
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,790
take hold of the clamps

753
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,020
and lift the heart.

754
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,020
Okay.

755
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,160
As soon as she does,

756
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,790
Dr. Choi,

757
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,790
you'll remove your finger

758
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,990
and see if you can

759
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,990
get the staple in

760
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,990
while it's elevated.

761
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,870
Got it?

762
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,870
Copy.

763
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,970
Here we go.

764
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,970
One, two, three, lift.

765
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,910
It's in. It's working.

766
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,340
Well done.

767
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,770
Ava... Ava,

768
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,770
he's still bleeding.

769
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,720
Give me suction.

770
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,980
He's hypotensive!

771
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,280
Dr. Choi, I need you to snake

772
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,280
your hand around the heart.

773
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,690
What do you feel?

774
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,250
He's got a hole

775
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,250
in the backside.

776
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,790
The knife went

777
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,790
through and through.

778
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,300
Looks like you have

779
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,300
more work to do.

780
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,660
What's happening?

781
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,660
He's in v-fib.

782
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,970
No pulse.

783
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,970
Monique, start bagging.

784
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,730
Doris, get on his chest.

785
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,670
Charge to 150. Clear.

786
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,810
Still in v-fib.

787
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,080
Monique,

788
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,080
push one milligram of epi.

789
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,890
Doris, get back on his chest.

790
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,890
I got it.

791
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,980
Hold compressions.

792
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,820
Clear.

793
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,720
No pulse.

794
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,560
Monique, another milligram

795
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,560
of epi and atropine.

796
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,020
Natalie...

797
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,260
Natalie...

798
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,260
He's gone.

799
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,890
My Gary...

800
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,730
Time of death, 14:30.

801
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,670
I'm sorry.

802
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,670
I'm so sorry.

803
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,880
Just don't even say it.

804
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,880
Nat...

805
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,440
Off-label meds.

806
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,440
Did I kill him?

807
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,850
The man was dying.

808
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,850
I shouldn't have done it.

809
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,990
Uh, yeah, sorry.

810
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,870
Help! There's something wrong

811
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,870
with my daughter.

812
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,530
What's happening?

813
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,830
Her vocal cords are

814
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,830
spasming, blocking airflow.

815
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,970
Help her!

816
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,070
This is Noah's patient.

817
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,070
Where is he?

818
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,980
He had to take

819
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,980
a patient upstairs.

820
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,750
Dr. Choi, we need

821
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,750
some help over here.

822
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,810
I'm a little busy!

823
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,810
Ay-yai-yai-yah.

824
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,990
We need to intubate.

825
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,990
Maggie...

826
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,920
Twenty of etomidate,

827
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,920
10 of sux.

828
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,520
Maggie...

829
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,520
We need a doctor.

830
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,790
Now.

831
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,860
Okay, sweetie.

832
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,380
It's too tight.

833
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,650
I can't get past

834
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,650
the vocal cords.

835
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,350
She's down to 87.

836
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,350
We need a doctor.

837
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,690
Oh, God.

838
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,490
I'll cric her.

839
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,600
Are you crazy?

840
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,600
You can't do that.

841
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,130
Doris, give me a scalpel.

842
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
You're not allowed.

843
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
It's gotta be a doctor.

844
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,240
Help her!

845
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,730
Give me the scalpel, Doris.

846
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm in. Bag her.

847
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,340
Got it.

848
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,510
Sats are coming back up.

849
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,420
He's bradying down.

850
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,380
I can't reach it.

851
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,380
Keep trying.

852
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,990
Heart rate's dropping.

853
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,530
Where are we?

854
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,430
It's about time.

855
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,730
Hole backside of

856
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,730
his left ventricle.

857
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,590
Connor,

858
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,590
here's what's happening.

859
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,530
Whenever they elevate

860
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,530
the heart

861
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,530
to make the repair,

862
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,090
it cuts off his venous return.

863
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,610
Okay, get me

864
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,610
two bags of saline.

865
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,700
April, load up a 2-0 prolene

866
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,700
on a long needle driver.

867
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,250
How'd you get in here?

868
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,250
Long story.

869
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,980
On my count, I want you

870
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,980
to roll him onto his side.

871
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,710
One, two, three.

872
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,650
Up... And down.

873
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,280
All right, Ethan,

874
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,280
when I tell you,

875
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,880
I want you to remove

876
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,880
your finger,

877
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,120
and I'm gonna replace it

878
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,120
with mine.

879
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,990
Ready and go.

880
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,200
Okay, I'm gonna try

881
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,200
to access the hole

882
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,390
from this angle.

883
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,930
Careful,

884
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,930
he bradies down quickly.

885
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,710
All right, stitch is in.

886
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,470
That should temporize

887
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,470
the bleed long enough

888
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,210
to get him up to the OR.

889
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,650
Let's go.

890
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,240
Dr. Bekker, you are amazing.

891
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,450
Thank you.

892
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,400
Dr. Halstead,

893
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,400
Dr. Ray tells me

894
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,940
off-label meds were given

895
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,940
to that patient.

896
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,000
Bleomycin,

897
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,000
etoposide, and cisplatin.

898
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,200
For lymphoma?

899
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,200
I know.

900
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,300
But the patient died

901
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,300
within hours

902
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,210
after the drugs

903
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,210
were administered.

904
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,180
Adverse drug reaction.

905
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,240
We could get sued for this.

906
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,550
Where is Dr. Manning?

907
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,490
Ms. Goodwin, the chart,

908
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,490
it's not correct.

909
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,550
Dr. Manning didn't

910
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,550
prescribe the drugs.

911
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,600
It was me.

912
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,600
You?

913
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,230
I found some

914
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,230
anecdotal evidence

915
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,770
that supported the efficacy

916
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,770
of that cocktail.

917
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,190
Thought we had

918
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,190
nothing to lose.

919
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,360
Dr. Halstead, I had hoped

920
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,140
that you had outgrown

921
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,140
your recklessness.

922
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,430
Clearly, you haven't.

923
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,270
I'm referring this to

924
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,270
the disciplinary committee.

925
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,600
Hey, uh, my patient

926
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,600
in Treatment Two,

927
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,030
who cric'd her?

928
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,030
I did.

929
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,900
What?

930
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,900
You cric'd a patient?

931
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,190
She was in laryngospasm,

932
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,190
you weren't available,

933
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,900
and all my other doctors

934
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,900
were tied up.

935
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,800
A nurse cannot cric.

936
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,030
You should've waited

937
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,030
for a doctor.

938
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,410
She would've died.

939
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,410
And you could've killed her.

940
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,970
Noah...

941
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,970
What?

942
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,880
Maggie's been nursing since

943
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,880
before you started shaving.

944
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,070
So what?

945
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,070
It's against the rules.

946
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,620
She's seen a cric

947
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,620
done 1,000 times.

948
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,310
Okay.

949
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,310
Back off.

950
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,950
Please, we need a doctor.

951
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,950
She's waking up.

952
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,880
Jill? Honey? Can you hear me?

953
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,030
What's wrong with her eye?

954
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,720
She's got a left-sided

955
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,720
facial droop.

956
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,430
I think she might've

957
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,430
had a stroke.

958
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,700
All right, we need to get

959
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,700
her up for a head CT now.

960
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,130
Let's go.

961
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,130
Get ready to bag her.

962
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,040
On it.

963
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,040
One, two, three.

964
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,890
Hey...

965
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,890
You told Dr. Ray

966
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,330
that you prescribed

967
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,330
Gary's meds?

968
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,230
It's no big deal.

969
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,230
Yes, it is.

970
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,740
I own my mistakes, not you.

971
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,580
I feel terrible

972
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,580
that Gary might've died

973
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,700
because of those drugs,

974
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,250
but I am the one

975
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,250
responsible, okay?

976
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,380
You do not need to protect me.

977
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,540
I know that.

978
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,540
Do you?

979
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,840
Do you know that?

980
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,910
Natalie, you are

981
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,910
already miserable.

982
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,520
I didn't want you to have

983
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,520
to deal with all this.

984
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,490
Besides, I'm the Attending.

985
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,750
Ultimately,

986
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,750
it's my responsibility.

987
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,390
Oh, my... Come off it.

988
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,070
Would you have done the same

989
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,070
thing for Ethan or for Noah?

990
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,290
No, because they're men.

991
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,830
They can take care

992
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,830
of themselves.

993
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,400
But not me. I'm just

994
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,400
a helpless little girl.

995
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,340
I have some news.

996
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,180
Security compiled

997
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,180
a list of former patients

998
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,810
who fit the profile

999
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,810
of our abductor,

1000
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,610
then cross-referenced them

1001
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,280
against today's visitors log.

1002
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,520
Turns out, we got a hit.

1003
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,220
Joanna Harris.

1004
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,120
Would you show them the tape,

1005
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,120
please?

1006
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,390
Couple of months ago,

1007
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,900
Joanna Harris was

1008
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,900
in the ED, pregnant.

1009
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,690
She lost the baby.

1010
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,230
Twenty-two weeks.

1011
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,230
Very sad case.

1012
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,040
So she impersonated

1013
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,040
a healthcare worker

1014
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,910
to get to the PICU.

1015
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,270
It's entirely possible

1016
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,270
that the trauma,

1017
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,210
coupled with

1018
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,210
the overwhelming fear

1019
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,580
of never being able to

1020
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,580
carry a baby to term,

1021
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,340
uh, pushed her over the edge.

1022
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,350
But she seems to have thought

1023
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,350
things out pretty thoroughly.

1024
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,580
I'd say her actions were

1025
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,580
calculated, even predatory.

1026
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,910
Well, given what we know

1027
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,910
about the patient,

1028
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,020
can you think of

1029
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,020
where she might've gone?

1030
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,320
Some place she could hide.

1031
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,730
A supply closet or call room.

1032
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,160
Security teams

1033
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,160
covered all those.

1034
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,220
According to the logs,

1035
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,200
Ms. Harris took

1036
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,200
our maternity tour last May.

1037
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,760
Meaning?

1038
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,140
Well, isn't that

1039
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,140
when we were transitioning

1040
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,830
between the old maternity wing

1041
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,830
and the new one?

1042
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,970
Yes.

1043
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,700
She might know

1044
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,700
the old maternity wing.

1045
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,670
All right, let's go.

1046
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,220
Clear.

1047
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,290
Hi, Joanna.

1048
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,260
I'm Dr. Charles.

1049
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,570
Stay away.

1050
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,570
You're not taking him.

1051
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,210
Yeah, but the problem is

1052
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,210
the baby is... Is very sick.

1053
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,240
You can't have him.

1054
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,240
He's mine.

1055
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,310
And I'm sure you want

1056
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,310
the best for him, right?

1057
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,410
He needs medicine,

1058
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,410
antibiotics,

1059
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,040
or else he won't get better.

1060
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,750
The fact is,

1061
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,750
if the baby doesn't get

1062
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,410
some treatment soon,

1063
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,250
uh, there's a chance

1064
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,250
he could die.

1065
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,520
No.

1066
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,650
None of us want that.

1067
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,650
That's why we're here.

1068
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,290
We need to get him

1069
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,290
back to his room,

1070
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,730
so he can get treated.

1071
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,230
Will you let us help him?

1072
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,500
I'm afraid.

1073
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,200
There's nothing

1074
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,200
to be afraid of.

1075
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,370
We understand

1076
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,370
why you did this.

1077
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,270
No one is gonna punish you.

1078
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,650
What about them?

1079
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,780
They just wanna make sure

1080
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,780
that the baby stays safe.

1081
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,530
Nothing bad is gonna

1082
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,530
happen to you, I promise.

1083
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,720
Uh, well,

1084
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,720
the important thing here

1085
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,460
is that we need to get

1086
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,460
some treatment for the baby

1087
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,020
as soon as possible.

1088
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,670
Give me the baby, Joanna.

1089
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,960
I can't. I...

1090
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,100
Oh, you can.

1091
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,100
You can, trust me.

1092
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,740
I'll protect you.

1093
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,250
What? No.

1094
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,390
Why? I gave you the baby.

1095
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,960
You... You lied to me.

1096
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,960
You lied to me.

1097
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,200
Why did she lie to me?

1098
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,850
Yes. Thank you.

1099
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,660
Hey, everybody,

1100
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,630
they found the baby.

1101
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,300
Let's make sure

1102
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,300
you check in with Admitting.

1103
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,960
You will be seen

1104
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,960
in order of need.

1105
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,510
For those less seriously

1106
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,510
ill or injured,

1107
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,180
try to be patient.

1108
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,680
We will get to you.

1109
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,410
Go ahead, sir.

1110
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,410
This way, yeah.

1111
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,550
Patient suffered

1112
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,550
an ischemic stroke.

1113
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,220
Between the unsuccessful

1114
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,220
attempt at intubation

1115
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,890
and the time it took

1116
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,890
to cric her,

1117
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,730
the patient's airway was down

1118
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,730
for over a minute,

1119
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
starving the brain of oxygen.

1120
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,860
Good thing you have

1121
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,860
lawyers on retainer.

1122
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,460
Thank you, Dr. Abrams.

1123
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,140
I didn't have any choice.

1124
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,130
All of our ED doctors

1125
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,130
were tied up

1126
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,130
because of the lockdown,

1127
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,770
the patient was

1128
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,770
in laryngospasm.

1129
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,910
I couldn't get the tubes

1130
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,910
past her cord.

1131
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,210
At that point,

1132
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,210
I had to cric her.

1133
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,410
Any doctor would have

1134
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,410
the same problem.

1135
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,610
Yeah, except, Maggie...

1136
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,490
They're doctors.

1137
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,390
They're allowed to perform

1138
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,390
these procedures.

1139
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,520
Sharon, what would

1140
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,520
you have done?

1141
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,890
Exactly what you did,

1142
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,860
but, unfortunately,

1143
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,860
that's not going to help you.

1144
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,760
Sharon, am I gonna lose

1145
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,760
my job over this?

1146
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,960
I hope not,

1147
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,760
but until I can

1148
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,760
figure something out...

1149
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,640
I've got to suspend you,

1150
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,640
Maggie.

1151
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,900
Sharon...

1152
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,900
I'm sorry.

1153
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,890
The patient would've died.

1154
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,490
I have no regrets.

1155
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,970
I know what you're gonna say.

1156
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,580
I should not have

1157
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,580
lied to Joanna.

1158
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,810
It was wrong.

1159
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,480
She's just a desperate,

1160
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,480
troubled woman,

1161
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,650
not a psychopath.

1162
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,150
I agree.

1163
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,360
She's not, but am I?

1164
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,360
Am I a psychopath?

1165
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,420
What?

1166
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,090
Look how easily

1167
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,090
I lied to her,

1168
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,220
how I coldly manipulated her.

1169
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,520
In this context,

1170
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,090
that's hardly an indication

1171
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,090
of psychopathy.

1172
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,160
Well, how about my life?

1173
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,100
Would you say that I'm able

1174
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,100
to form lasting relationships?

1175
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,900
I mean,

1176
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,900
I have no real friends,

1177
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,100
no significant

1178
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,100
romantic attachments.

1179
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,940
I think I have emotions,

1180
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,940
but maybe they aren't real.

1181
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,840
Maybe they're just imitative.

1182
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,280
You just told me

1183
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,280
that you felt guilty

1184
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,780
about lying to a patient,

1185
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,250
which means that

1186
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,250
you have a conscience,

1187
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,580
which means that

1188
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,580
you're not a psychopath.

1189
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,890
Whatever you wanna call it,

1190
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,890
I am my father's daughter.

1191
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,650
Well... Well,

1192
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,650
you're also my resident,

1193
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,820
and I find you to be a...

1194
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,130
A deeply compassionate person,

1195
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,830
who's capable

1196
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,830
of great empathy.

1197
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,240
I just never would've

1198
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,240
roped you into

1199
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,930
this whole psychiatry thing

1200
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,030
if I wasn't entirely

1201
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,030
convinced of that.

1202
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,240
See you tomorrow?

1203
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,560
Thanks, man.

1204
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,720
He should wake up

1205
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,720
pretty soon.

1206
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,890
Yeah.

1207
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,890
Nice work today.

1208
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,260
You, too.

1209
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,260
Yeah.

1210
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,200
Dr. Bekker...

1211
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,210
Have you come to see me

1212
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,210
or our patient?

1213
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,170
How's he doing?

1214
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
I think he's gonna make it.

1215
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,500
It's a long day, huh?

1216
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,500
Yeah.

1217
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,740
I could go for a meal.

1218
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,280
I'd, uh, check the cafeteria.

1219
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,620
It's Tuesday.

1220
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,060
It's meatloaf.

1221
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,450
My favorite.

1222
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,060
Good night.

1223
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,450
Dr. Halstead.

1224
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,320
I owe you an apology.

1225
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,080
Gary Taylor's autopsy revealed

1226
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,710
that he died from

1227
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,710
cardiac failure,

1228
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,620
not an adverse drug reaction

1229
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,620
or metastatic cancer.

1230
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,490
In fact, in the hours from

1231
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,490
the time he was given

1232
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,490
the drugs

1233
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,120
until he died,

1234
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,130
the mass actually shrank

1235
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,130
one centimeter.

1236
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,030
That off-label cocktail

1237
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,030
of yours, it worked.

1238
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,070
I let Ms. Goodwin know.

1239
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,070
Congratulations.

1240
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,270
Uh... Um, look, uh,

1241
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,270
it wasn't my idea.

1242
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,340
It was Dr. Manning's.

1243
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,780
Okay, whatever.

1244
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,780
We've been thinking

1245
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,780
about launching

1246
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,110
a Phase One

1247
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,110
clinical trial to...

1248
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,110
Excuse me.

1249
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,520
Whoa, Nat, hold up...

1250
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,290
You're gonna get

1251
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,290
the credit you deserve.

1252
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,350
I'll make sure of that.

1253
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,090
You think that's

1254
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,090
what's bothering me?

1255
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,720
Look, I know I shouldn't

1256
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,720
have taken the blame,

1257
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,100
and I certainly don't

1258
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,100
deserve the credit.

1259
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,860
Will, stop.

1260
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,630
Just stop.

1261
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,730
My whole career,

1262
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,730
from med school on,

1263
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,740
I keep running into

1264
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,740
the same problem,

1265
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,470
men who either dismiss me

1266
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,470
or patronize me,

1267
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,740
who cannot see me as an equal.

1268
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,110
Well, I see you as an equal.

1269
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,110
No, you don't.

1270
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,510
And it's not just today.

1271
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,510
It keeps happening.

1272
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,020
Natalie...

1273
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,020
Look, I know you love me,

1274
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,490
but in a way,

1275
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,490
that's part of the problem.

1276
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,050
You can only see me

1277
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,050
as the woman you love,

1278
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,820
the woman you need to protect

1279
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,820
and take care of,

1280
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,120
and in a way, that limits me.

1281
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,500
It puts me in a kind of jail.

1282
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,330
Look, I don't want that,

1283
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,330
Natalie.

1284
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,700
Let's talk about this.

1285
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,800
We'll figure it out.

1286
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,070
Maybe we can,

1287
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,410
but right now,

1288
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,410
I need a break, okay?

1289
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,810
I love you...

1290
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,900
But I need a break from us.

1291
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,250
No, come on.
