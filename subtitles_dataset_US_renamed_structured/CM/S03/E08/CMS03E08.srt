1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,180
I'm the man

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,510
Come 'round

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,310
No-no-nothing can break

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,380
You can't break me down

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,550
I got gas in the tank

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,390
I got money in the bank

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,850
I got news for you, baby,

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,850
you're looking at the man

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,020
Looking at the man

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,050
I got skin in the game

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,830
I don't feel no pain

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,270
I got news for you, baby,

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,270
you're looking at the man

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,620
Thanks.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,420
Wow, some showy

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,420
new wheels.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,900
Not cheap.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,900
What are we talking? 125?

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,190
In the neighborhood.

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,170
Not one I've ever lived in.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,230
Morning.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,290
Good morning.

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,030
Nice looking.

24
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,130
But is she attracted

25
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,130
to you or the car?

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,210
I'm gonna go find out.

27
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,040
Catch up to you later.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,990
Hi.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,090
Connor.

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,090
Lisette.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,950
That's it.

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,550
You got this.

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,550
Nice job, little man.

34
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,350
I think you got

35
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,350
a future architect here.

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,830
Or a demolitions expert.

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,290
Oh, I get a turn.

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,860
Thank you.

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,360
Owen,

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,360
is that good?

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
You like that?

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,030
Told ya.

43
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,340
We'll just have to rebuild

44
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,340
it again now, won't we?

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,470
Ow!

46
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,470
What happened?

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,970
I have no idea.

48
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,610
Are you okay?

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,510
Yeah.

50
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,580
Patton.

51
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,320
The Evil Dead.

52
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,320
Usual?

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,760
The Dirty Dozen.

54
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,260
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

55
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,020
Come on, all your favorite

56
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,020
movies can't be slasher films.

57
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,890
Better than

58
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,890
World War II flicks.

59
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
They're classics.

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,330
What can I get you?

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Chai tea latte, almond milk,

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,800
no water, no foam, extra hot.

63
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,300
You got it.

64
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,530
Black coffee.

65
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,270
It is mystifying how little

66
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,270
we have in common.

67
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,440
Luckily, opposites attract.

68
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,880
Works for me.

69
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,240
Got a chai tea latte,

70
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,800
no water, no foam,

71
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,800
almond milk,

72
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,970
extra hot.

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
Thank you.

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
Really?

75
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,340
Hers comes out first?

76
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,850
He'll pay.

77
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,850
Catch you later.

78
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,280
I need a doctor, please!

79
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,390
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

80
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,390
Not me, a woman,

81
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,190
two blocks over,

82
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,190
she's on the ground,

83
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,190
isn't moving.

84
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,260
Show me.

85
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,130
Excuse me, excuse me.

86
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,870
Hey, can you hear me?

87
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,040
Can you hear me?

88
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,040
Who saw what happened?

89
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,810
She jogged past me,

90
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,810
then she just fell.

91
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,940
I called 911.

92
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,210
God, is she alive?

93
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,210
Barely.

94
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
Can't wait on the paramedics.

95
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,720
I need you.

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,390
20-something female

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,390
went down while jogging.

98
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,190
Barely awake, weak pulse,

99
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,190
hypothermic.

100
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,170
Let's get her on the monitors

101
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,170
and start a line.

102
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,070
Bolus a liter of warm saline

103
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,070
and grab some blankets.

104
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,330
We need to raise

105
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,330
her body temp.

106
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,910
She's pretty bundled up.

107
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,470
How long was she exposed

108
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,470
to the elements?

109
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,900
On the ground.

110
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,900
Two, maybe three minutes.

111
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,040
That's it?

112
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,040
And she's hypothermic?

113
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,100
Yeah.

114
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,010
Oh, God.

115
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,320
There's nothing to her.

116
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,320
Let's get her up.

117
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,820
Okay.

118
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,830
This side.

119
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,220
Hair's brittle and thin,

120
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,220
lanugo covering the skin.

121
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,360
Anorexia.

122
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,860
Stethoscope.

123
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,670
BP 88 over 50,

124
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,670
heart rate 50s.

125
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,270
EKG is sinus brady.

126
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,570
Bilateral crackles.

127
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,240
Her eyes are yellow.

128
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,240
She's jaundiced.

129
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,820
God, I can feel

130
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,820
right through her

131
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,820
to the bed underneath.

132
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,150
Where am I?

133
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,990
Hey, in the hospital.

134
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,290
Can you tell me

135
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,290
your name?

136
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,890
Allison.

137
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,690
Allison, I'm Dr. Choi,

138
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,690
I'm gonna help you, okay?

139
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,030
I'm okay.

140
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,030
I just need to rest.

141
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's get a CBC, CMP, LFTs,

142
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,000
a chest X-ray

143
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,000
and a 12-lead EKG.

144
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,260
Yep, on it.

145
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,240
Morning, I'm Dr. Halstead.

146
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,370
Asterid.

147
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,840
It looks like

148
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,840
you're hurting, too.

149
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,080
Need a hit?

150
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,780
Thanks, but let's

151
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,780
get you squared away first.

152
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,080
What happened?

153
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,780
I was running

154
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,780
up the stairs

155
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,780
to the platform

156
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,050
to catch the train.

157
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,120
By the time I got

158
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,120
to the last step,

159
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,180
I was...

160
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,130
I was so exhausted,

161
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,130
I tripped.

162
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,500
Landed on my arm.

163
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,790
Is it broken?

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,700
Well, maybe.

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,700
We'll get some X-rays.

166
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,360
Lean forward for me.

167
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,070
Ah.

168
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,450
You okay?

169
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,710
I tweaked my back

170
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,710
a few months ago.

171
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,870
Free clinic gave me

172
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,870
some anti-inflammatories.

173
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,880
Said they'd help.

174
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,880
They haven't.

175
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,110
I even crushed them up

176
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,110
and snorted them.

177
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,280
What?

178
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,790
Just kidding.

179
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,690
I'm a stand-up comic,

180
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,990
so when I see an opening

181
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,990
for a joke, I have to take it.

182
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,130
Well, timing was excellent,

183
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,130
I'll give you that.

184
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,760
Where does your back hurt?

185
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,030
Uh, it's a sharp pain

186
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,030
down here.

187
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,090
Mmm-hmm.

188
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,300
More throbbing up here.

189
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,140
The fall made it worse,

190
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,140
didn't it?

191
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,500
Well, I can't say

192
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,500
without a CT,

193
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,340
but no bruising or swelling,

194
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,900
so that's a good sign.

195
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,170
Hang tight.

196
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,170
The techs will be by soon

197
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,510
to take you up to Radiology.

198
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,050
Maggie, which nurse

199
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,050
do you have

200
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,610
covering Asterid

201
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,610
in Treatment Four?

202
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,050
You're looking at her.

203
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,920
Double duty again, huh?

204
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,930
Yep, twice the work for me,

205
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,620
and yet, it's the hospital's

206
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,620
bank account that benefits.

207
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,260
You know,

208
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,260
trickle up economics.

209
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,460
Absolutely.

210
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,660
Nice shiner.

211
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,260
I haven't seen one of those

212
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,260
on you for a while.

213
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,930
This time,

214
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,930
it wasn't my fault.

215
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,630
South Side boy.

216
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,680
Somehow, I don't buy it.

217
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,070
What do you need in Four?

218
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,370
AP lateral of the left elbow

219
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,410
and a CT chest and belly

220
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,410
with contrast.

221
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,210
You got it.

222
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,220
Dr. Reese.

223
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,980
Welcome back.

224
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,980
How are you doing?

225
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,180
Great, great, very eager

226
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,180
to dive back in.

227
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,250
Fantastic.

228
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,190
Just for the record,

229
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,190
easing back in is okay, too,

230
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,920
but thrilled you're here.

231
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,090
How's therapy been going?

232
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,360
Oh, well,

233
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,360
it better be going well.

234
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,490
Daily counseling,

235
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,490
anger management sessions,

236
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,060
meeting with

237
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,060
the hospital attorney.

238
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,500
And remember, not intended

239
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,500
to be a punishment.

240
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,060
Oh, no, of course not.

241
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,300
It's actually a great way

242
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,300
to grow professionally.

243
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,900
Can't hide from it.

244
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,900
It keeps the secrets

245
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,380
in their pockets.

246
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,380
Wonderful.

247
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,970
20-something woman,

248
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,970
agitated and out of control.

249
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,540
PD found her running

250
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,540
around in the middle

251
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,110
of the I-90 express lanes.

252
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,620
What's she on?

253
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,620
Nothing we can tell.

254
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,150
No track marks

255
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,150
or tweaking signs,

256
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,150
but a lot of rambling.

257
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,420
Our insides, holding in...

258
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,180
Airway's clearly intact.

259
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,520
Obviously has no problem

260
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,520
moving four limbs

261
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,520
spontaneously.

262
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,590
I'd say my job is done.

263
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,520
She's all yours.

264
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,030
Thank you.

265
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,760
Dr. Charles, Treatment Three,

266
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,760
can't wait.

267
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,330
But now I see

268
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,330
how everything

269
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,330
is filled with water...

270
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,430
Oh, man.

271
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,880
Um...

272
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,880
Go ahead, I've got Jane Doe.

273
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,140
Do a full assessment,

274
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,140
and we will staff it later.

275
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,610
Thanks.

276
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,670
You good?

277
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,740
I'm good.

278
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,100
Welcome back.

279
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,010
Don't open the box, no.

280
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,010
Open the box, no.

281
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,350
Don't open the box.

282
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,350
Back and forth, on and off.

283
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,220
Allison, how you doing?

284
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,200
We're here...

285
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,200
Take it easy there.

286
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,200
Easy, easy, easy.

287
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,970
Allison, I'm Dr. Charles.

288
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,300
Shrink.

289
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,070
So, um, something tells me

290
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,980
this isn't your first time

291
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,980
in an ED.

292
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,040
Not just saline, is it?

293
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,110
D5?

294
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,210
Well, your blood sugar

295
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,210
was 44,

296
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,050
so you know,

297
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,050
the dextrose...

298
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,220
Treats hypoglycemia and all

299
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,220
that comes with it, I know.

300
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,820
But at

301
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,820
170 calories per liter...

302
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,190
If I can get 80 per mile,

303
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,600
home to lake

304
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,600
and back is four,

305
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,930
that's 320.

306
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,060
So, is your math

307
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,060
working out?

308
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,200
Are you gonna be able

309
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,200
to burn off

310
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,200
those extra calories?

311
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,470
I don't need to be here.

312
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,610
Check my levels, vitamins.

313
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,490
Potassium.

314
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,820
They'll be normal.

315
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,920
What is the go-to trick

316
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,920
these days

317
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,580
for, you know,

318
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,580
gaming those numbers?

319
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,560
You guys still

320
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,560
sucking on lemons

321
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,220
or, I don't know, I heard

322
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,220
that guzzling vitamin water

323
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
is kind of coming into vogue.

324
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,770
I mean,

325
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,770
it's none of my business,

326
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,100
but I am curious.

327
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,870
How long has it been

328
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,870
going on for?

329
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,680
Five years?

330
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,710
Ten?

331
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,580
Fifteen? Fifteen years?

332
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,890
At least 15 years.

333
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,700
I want to go home.

334
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,160
Okay.

335
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,590
Allison, you know,

336
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,590
if you can't get out of bed,

337
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,350
you know that I can't...

338
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,350
I can't let you go, right?

339
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,590
And you do know

340
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,590
what that means.

341
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,530
Five hundred.

342
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,660
Five thousand.

343
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,430
One thousand.

344
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,160
Four thousand.

345
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,230
Fifteen hundred.

346
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,360
Three thousand.

347
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,360
Two.

348
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,630
Three.

349
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,770
Fine.

350
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,270
Three thousand calories.

351
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,350
And it has to be

352
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,350
through your nose.

353
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,650
If this goes.

354
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,820
Hmm.

355
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,910
Got yourself a deal.

356
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,200
And following the fingers,

357
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,200
you can count,

358
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,300
the count likes to laugh,

359
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,300
and he's just a puppet,

360
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,640
sometimes I feel

361
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,640
like a puppet,

362
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,400
with someone operating me...

363
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm Dr. Reese.

364
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,940
Can you tell me your name?

365
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,940
Not operating on me.

366
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,950
Because surgery belongs in

367
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,950
another part of the hospital.

368
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,350
Each part separated

369
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,350
by a floor, a floor made

370
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,350
of marble or wood.

371
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,010
Can you tell me

372
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,010
how you got here?

373
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,490
Cooking things through

374
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,490
at a slow heat.

375
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,950
The temperature

376
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,950
cooks evenly...

377
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,950
Where do you live?

378
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,580
Through me to the core

379
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,580
of my eyes and my brain,

380
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,150
and none of it will stop.

381
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,630
Watching the whirring,

382
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,630
watching the whirring,

383
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,060
go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

384
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,000
Foot, foot, left, right,

385
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,000
left, right.

386
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,790
Back and forth, on and off,

387
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,790
on and off, on and off.

388
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,270
Back and forth, on and off,

389
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,270
the switch,

390
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,270
the light switch breaking...

391
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,000
Meds first, talk later?

392
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,970
Please. Uh, let's get her

393
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,970
Risperdal M-TAB

394
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,600
two milligrams,

395
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,600
should calm her down.

396
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,040
All right.

397
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,840
I don't know why

398
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,840
I let you talk me

399
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,510
out of coming

400
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,510
here yesterday.

401
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm fine,

402
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,380
it's just a really bad cold.

403
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,120
It's our first

404
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,120
vacation together.

405
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,020
Emergency room's

406
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,020
not on the itinerary.

407
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,680
Temp's 100.4.

408
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,490
See, Hannah,

409
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,490
it's barely a fever.

410
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,460
God forbid he let on

411
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,460
that he's sick.

412
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,190
I've got

413
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,190
a stubborn one also.

414
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,190
Mmm.

415
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,930
Me, too.

416
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Lymph nodes are enlarged.

417
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,760
All right.

418
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,700
I'm gonna have you open

419
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,700
your mouth for me.

420
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,240
He hasn't eaten

421
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,240
in three days.

422
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,010
He can barely sip water.

423
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,010
It hurts that bad.

424
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,110
Throat's pretty raw.

425
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,110
Tonsils are swollen.

426
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,110
Yellow exudate.

427
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,950
What's that?

428
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,950
Pus.

429
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,720
Maybe an infection.

430
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,480
See, we should've

431
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,480
come yesterday.

432
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,460
I'll get a rapid strep test.

433
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,990
And let's get

434
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,990
a CBC and BMP also.

435
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,590
I'm sorry.

436
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,130
I just wanted the trip

437
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,130
to be perfect.

438
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,130
And I just want you

439
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,130
to be healthy.

440
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,630
Well, hopefully we can solve

441
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,630
both of your problems.

442
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,930
I'll be back shortly.

443
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,570
What, you keeping a secret?

444
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,980
Hey.

445
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,980
"Your Toddler and You."

446
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,610
Is this business or pleasure?

447
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,680
Both.

448
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm looking for ideas on how

449
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,480
to get Owen to like me.

450
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,120
What makes you think

451
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,120
he doesn't?

452
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,630
Oh, I don't know.

453
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,720
You worry too much.

454
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,020
Hey, Owen's number one

455
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,020
in Natalie's life.

456
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,560
If I can't

457
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,560
make it work with him,

458
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,560
I got no shot with her.

459
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,070
Well, let me break down

460
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,070
toddlers for you.

461
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,760
They eat, sleep,

462
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,760
poop, and play.

463
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,140
Help 'em out with any one of

464
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,140
those things, and you're gold.

465
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,440
Radiologist's report.

466
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,070
Asterid's arm X-ray

467
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,070
and CT scans.

468
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,580
And no fractures?

469
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,580
Mmm-hmm.

470
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,870
Just soft tissue swelling.

471
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,570
Let's wrap her elbow up

472
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,570
and put it in a sling.

473
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,880
Got it.

474
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,240
Whoa.

475
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,810
What is it?

476
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,080
Her CT.

477
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,160
I need Connor and Dr. Neal

478
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,160
in Urology.

479
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,320
I got it.

480
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,560
3,000 calories?

481
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,960
It's all she's willing

482
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,960
to accept.

483
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,430
Why are you negotiating?

484
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,730
Dangerously low albumin,

485
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,730
renal insufficiency.

486
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,670
5'6" and less than 70 pounds.

487
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,760
Dr. Charles, I carried her in,

488
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,760
she was nothing.

489
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,740
She needs high-calorie,

490
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,740
long-term nutrition.

491
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,070
I agree.

492
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,010
Then what are you doing?

493
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,840
Anorexia is actually

494
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,840
the most deadly mental illness

495
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,910
that there is.

496
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,510
Every instinct she has

497
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,510
is telling her to resist this,

498
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,490
and I don't want to push her

499
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,490
any harder than she'll let us.

500
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,550
Then let me push her.

501
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,550
No.

502
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,990
I made a deal,

503
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,990
we have to honor it.

504
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,690
Trust me, it's her best shot.

505
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,130
Listen, we get 3,000,

506
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,130
and you'll go back for more.

507
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,670
Of course.

508
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,670
Dr. Choi,

509
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,960
Allison's parents are here.

510
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,960
Waiting room.

511
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,230
Thanks, Mags.

512
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,740
I'll fill them in

513
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,740
and place the feeding tube.

514
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,010
Is she the worst case

515
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,010
you've ever seen?

516
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,650
Healthy BMI is 18 to 25.

517
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,050
Hers is 11.

518
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,850
If she's going to survive,

519
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,590
we can't afford to make

520
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,590
any mistakes here.

521
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,250
She's killing herself.

522
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,060
So, um, so catch me up

523
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,060
on Jane Doe.

524
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,600
Um, no idea on her.

525
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,860
Maggie is working

526
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,860
with PD to get a name.

527
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,990
Tox screen is clean,

528
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,990
this isn't drug-induced.

529
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,730
And I'm thinking

530
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,730
bipolar mania.

531
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,860
Rapid speech,

532
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,860
psychomotor agitation,

533
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,600
flight of ideas,

534
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,600
plus she hasn't

535
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,600
bathed in days.

536
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,610
So, presumably,

537
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,610
she went manic

538
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,580
and fled wherever

539
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,580
she was living?

540
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,880
Stop this

541
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,880
You started her on Risperdal?

542
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,310
It hasn't made a dent.

543
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,220
I want to double the dose and

544
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,220
add a second mood stabilizer.

545
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,420
You ruled out

546
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,420
all other possibilities?

547
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,150
You know,

548
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,150
schizoaffective disorder,

549
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,820
temporal lobe epilepsy,

550
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,820
delirium,

551
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,880
other mood disorders?

552
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,720
Why?

553
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,720
Mania can be diagnosed

554
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,590
through pattern recognition

555
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,590
just like I've done,

556
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,360
and there's been no clinical

557
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,360
indication to keep digging

558
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,560
for anything else.

559
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,540
Just humor me,

560
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,540
okay, Doctor?

561
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,130
Look, it's your

562
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,130
first day back,

563
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,060
before you add

564
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,060
any other meds,

565
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,110
just check all the boxes,

566
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,110
even if you don't think

567
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,110
it's necessary.

568
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,110
Physical, neural exam,

569
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,110
motor function,

570
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,480
head CT,

571
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,480
all that stuff, okay?

572
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,240
Okay.

573
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,240
Okay, good.

574
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,550
I wish there was

575
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,550
something I could do.

576
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,520
Hi, guys,

577
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,420
Uh, so, Tommy,

578
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,420
you do not have strep.

579
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,590
But your body is

580
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,590
most likely fighting off

581
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,860
a bacterial infection.

582
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,860
So, I'm gonna start you

583
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,860
on clindamycin,

584
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,460
which is an oral antibiotic.

585
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,500
Whatever the bug,

586
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,500
it'll take care of it.

587
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,500
Mmm-hmm.

588
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,000
So we can

589
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,000
get out of here?

590
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,770
Yes, but please,

591
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,770
just try to take it easy

592
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,770
the next few days.

593
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,740
As cliché as it is,

594
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,740
rest is the best medicine.

595
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,540
I won't let him leave

596
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,540
the hotel, promise.

597
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,040
Ow!

598
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,410
Are you okay?

599
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,110
My ankle.

600
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,620
Why don't you

601
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,620
let me take a look?

602
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,390
Whoa,

603
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,390
that's really red.

604
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,930
You didn't feel anything?

605
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,990
Uh-uh.

606
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,130
Hot and fluctuant.

607
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,760
I and D it?

608
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,760
Yeah.

609
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,600
Now, I'm gonna make

610
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,600
a small incision,

611
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,580
so that we can get

612
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,580
a sample, okay?

613
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,010
All right,

614
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,010
and when I ask you to,

615
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,070
I'm gonna have

616
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,070
you take a deep breath,

617
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,610
and exhale for me, okay?

618
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,450
All right, this is gonna hurt

619
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,450
a little bit, all right?

620
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,910
Take a deep breath in.

621
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,680
Good.

622
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,380
And another one.

623
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,160
And again.

624
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,850
Good.

625
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,120
One last time.

626
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,590
Great job.

627
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
All right,

628
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
here comes the incision.

629
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,510
Oh.

630
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,740
Is that what's in my throat?

631
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,470
How did it get

632
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,470
in his ankle?

633
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,510
Let's just wait

634
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,510
and see what the lab says.

635
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,980
Bad news, though, you guys are

636
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,980
gonna have to hang out here

637
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,450
a little bit longer,

638
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,450
I'm sorry.

639
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,080
All right, you need anything,

640
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,080
I'll be close by.

641
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,690
Bacteria can travel once

642
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,690
it enters the bloodstream,

643
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,360
but for a new infection

644
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,360
to manifest that fast...

645
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,730
Yeah, something's

646
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,730
definitely going on.

647
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,690
See you in the lab, okay?

648
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,690
Yeah.

649
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,340
It's cancer?

650
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,940
Yeah, it's likely

651
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,940
renal cell carcinoma.

652
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,440
The tumor extends

653
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,440
from inside your left kidney,

654
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,340
into the inferior vena cava,

655
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,550
and up

656
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,550
into the right atrium

657
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,550
of your heart.

658
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,150
You never had

659
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,150
a sprained back.

660
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,620
The pain is from

661
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,620
ureteral compression.

662
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,820
You were exhausted

663
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,820
running up the stairs

664
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,590
because the tumor

665
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,590
was blocking blood

666
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,360
from returning

667
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,360
to your heart.

668
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,960
Asterid, you following us?

669
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,960
Yeah, I'm just trying

670
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,960
to find a joke

671
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,530
to cope with all of this.

672
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,140
That's okay.

673
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,710
We'll find the funny

674
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,710
after you've beaten this.

675
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,110
Mmm-hmm.

676
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,970
Seriously, I'm not dying?

677
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,070
No.

678
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,780
No, the cancer is treatable.

679
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,780
The tumor is operable.

680
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,050
Now, to get all of it,

681
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,050
I'm gonna have to involve

682
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,050
other surgeons,

683
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,280
and unfortunately,

684
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,490
we will have to remove

685
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,490
your left kidney.

686
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,460
But you can live

687
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,460
just fine with one.

688
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,860
I know it's a lot

689
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,860
to take all at once.

690
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,120
You don't get it.

691
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,070
I do open mic night.

692
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,470
Those gigs don't come

693
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,470
with health care plans.

694
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,540
And the three jobs

695
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,540
that I do have

696
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,540
barely cover the rent.

697
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,080
So I can't pay for this.

698
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,970
You don't have to.

699
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,840
The tumor invading your heart

700
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,840
is life-threatening,

701
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,520
and that means that Medicaid

702
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,520
will cover the surgery

703
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,290
and the resulting recovery.

704
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,690
It's not gonna

705
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,690
cost me anything?

706
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,990
No.

707
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,360
We're gonna

708
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,360
take care of you.

709
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,730
Allison, I'm gonna put

710
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,730
this tube in your nose.

711
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,270
When you feel it

712
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,270
in your throat,

713
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,270
I need you to swallow.

714
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,000
Allison, you understand?

715
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,510
Okay, here we go.

716
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,420
Swallow.

717
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,820
Allison, swallow.

718
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,190
There you go.

719
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,730
It's going in, nice job.

720
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
It's going to work

721
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
this time.

722
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,530
We've tried helping her

723
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,530
for years.

724
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,330
Doctors, rehabs.

725
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,160
No matter what we do,

726
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,160
she just keeps withering away.

727
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,900
Sometimes, being out

728
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,900
of options is what it takes

729
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,470
to instill desire

730
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,470
to get better.

731
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,610
X-ray.

732
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,820
Tube's in.

733
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,550
I'm gonna turn on

734
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,550
the pump now.

735
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,710
Allison, Allison.

736
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,710
Look at me, look at me.

737
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,250
Slow breaths.

738
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,250
I can't.

739
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,300
Yes, you can.

740
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,300
You can do this.

741
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,080
You're fine, you're...

742
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,080
No, no, stop.

743
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,350
Just relax,

744
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,350
just relax.

745
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,350
Stop it.

746
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,820
I can't do it.

747
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,690
I need it out!

748
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,090
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

749
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,090
No, no, no, no, no!

750
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,290
We'll try again.

751
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,530
No.

752
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,260
I'm done.

753
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,360
Allison!

754
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,070
I said I'm done.

755
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,640
Why don't we give Dr. Choi

756
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,640
a moment to prepare

757
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,640
another tube?

758
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,070
Maybe we can...

759
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,070
You're not hearing me.

760
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,580
I want my lawyer.

761
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm serious.

762
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,580
Get my phone.

763
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,050
I'm calling my lawyer now.

764
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,490
Will, I'll come find you

765
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,490
when we're done.

766
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,930
I'm good.

767
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,360
Kidney free?

768
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,840
Yep, from everything

769
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,840
but the renal vein.

770
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,700
I'm vessel looping

771
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,700
the inferior vena cava

772
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,700
below it now.

773
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,570
I'm curious.

774
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,510
You score a date tonight?

775
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,010
I did.

776
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,850
How's it going on your end?

777
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,610
Opening the right atrium.

778
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,490
I can see the bulb

779
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,490
of the tumor.

780
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,390
There we go.

781
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,720
Your turn.

782
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,960
All right.

783
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,230
Tumor is one long stalk now.

784
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,370
I'm gonna tease it out

785
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,370
as we remove the kidney.

786
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,140
Kidney is detached.

787
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,900
And here we go.

788
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,780
All right.

789
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,640
Got it.

790
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,950
One piece? No stragglers?

791
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,950
It's whole.

792
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,940
Impressive.

793
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,480
Bet your mojo's

794
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,480
gonna last all night long.

795
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,720
Lucky girl.

796
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,160
We will conquer

797
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,160
the evil beast

798
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,160
that live inside,

799
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,790
and I shout them

800
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,790
out, out, out, out.

801
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,270
And the winds blow by, and

802
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,270
carry my breath into the sky.

803
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,630
God's shouting down

804
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,630
and carries my clothes

805
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,630
into your head.

806
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,800
And I will conquer

807
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,800
the evil beast

808
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,800
that live inside...

809
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,360
Thanks, Trudy.

810
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,360
Dr. Reese?

811
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,300
I just got off the phone

812
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,300
with PD.

813
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,350
A woman named Melissa Withers

814
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,350
filed a missing persons report

815
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,880
about her sister, Jamie.

816
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,080
Description matches

817
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,080
your Jane Doe.

818
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,090
Out, out, out,

819
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,090
out, out, out, I pray.

820
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,780
And to follow the pages

821
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,780
as they turn,

822
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,780
thumbing through.

823
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,090
Do you got a phone number

824
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,090
for Melissa?

825
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,450
For Melissa.

826
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,630
Deja vu.

827
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,470
Oh, I had pneumonia,

828
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,470
right after college.

829
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,100
Spent two weeks

830
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,100
in the hospital,

831
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,100
Waukesha, Wisconsin.

832
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,070
Let me guess.

833
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,070
Same vending machines?

834
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,840
It's amazing.

835
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,040
Cafeteria makes

836
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,040
a great smoothie.

837
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,650
No, I want to stay close

838
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,650
to Tommy.

839
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,780
I'll find something.

840
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,890
Hey, so, the clindamycin

841
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,890
is not gonna work.

842
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,020
Bacteria pulled

843
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,020
from his ankle,

844
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,020
gram-positive cocci.

845
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,500
A staph infection.

846
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,500
Yeah.

847
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,100
So, let's switch

848
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,100
to IV Vancomycin.

849
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,700
Staph can be a sticky bug.

850
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,700
We need to be more aggressive.

851
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,260
Okay.

852
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,260
Thank you.

853
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,900
So we clear to try

854
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,900
another feeding tube?

855
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,280
Um, no.

856
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,370
We are not.

857
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,620
Apparently,

858
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,620
Allison was prepared

859
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,620
for this moment.

860
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,590
She's already had

861
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,590
papers drawn up

862
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,590
to prevent forcible feeding.

863
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,090
Hospital lawyers

864
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,090
don't want to fight it.

865
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,560
That's insane.

866
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,820
They'll just let her die?

867
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,330
Well, legally,

868
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,330
they don't have a move.

869
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,790
Precedent's already been set

870
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,790
in the courts.

871
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,960
In each case, the patient's

872
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,960
wishes were upheld.

873
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,460
So we go to the parents.

874
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,460
Don't they have a say?

875
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,630
Allison's an adult, Ethan.

876
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,040
I mean, ultimately,

877
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,040
she decides her own fate.

878
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,210
So, there's nothing

879
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,210
we can do?

880
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,470
Look, after seven years,

881
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,340
anorexia is considered

882
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,340
severe and enduring.

883
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,410
This poor lady

884
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,410
has been struggling

885
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,410
for more than 15.

886
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,150
Her entire being is fixated

887
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,150
on gaining control,

888
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,590
and holding onto it.

889
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,720
Even if it kills her.

890
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,690
So regardless

891
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,690
of the injunction,

892
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,490
or her parents love...

893
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,390
The odds of her

894
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,390
recovery are...

895
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,770
Hey, there.

896
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,400
How you feeling?

897
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,450
All things considered,

898
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,450
fantastic.

899
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,740
I mean...

900
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,480
I'm down a kidney,

901
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,480
but at least it didn't cost me

902
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,990
an arm and a leg.

903
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,080
See, you got your

904
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,080
sense of humor back.

905
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,780
Kind of.

906
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,880
Yeah, that was

907
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,880
pretty awful, huh?

908
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,350
Look, jokes aside, thank you.

909
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,690
Sure.

910
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,500
So, I'm gonna be back

911
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,760
to check on you

912
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,760
in a couple of hours,

913
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,960
but before

914
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,960
we head out,

915
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,960
any questions?

916
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,540
Just one.

917
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,540
My right leg is achy.

918
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,840
Around the shin.

919
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,370
Never felt it before.

920
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,300
Maybe a side effect

921
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,300
from the anesthesia?

922
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,510
Could be.

923
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,550
Let me speak

924
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,550
with the anesthesiologist

925
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,350
and see what he thinks.

926
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,920
Right now,

927
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,920
you just get some rest.

928
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,450
Leg pain? That's not

929
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,450
from the anesthesia.

930
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,690
No, but let's not say it

931
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,690
out loud without an X-ray.

932
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,790
I'll get it going.

933
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,320
Hannah.

934
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,190
Hannah?

935
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,530
Oh, my God. Tommy?

936
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,410
Help. Help!

937
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,400
What's happening?

938
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,310
Temp's up to 104.

939
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,310
He's tachy.

940
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,110
BP's 94 over 62.

941
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,110
Septic shock.

942
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,580
First dose of Vanc

943
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,580
didn't work.

944
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,990
Bolus a liter

945
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,990
of normal saline,

946
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,990
and push IV Tylenol.

947
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,850
Tommy, can you open

948
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,850
your mouth for me?

949
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,390
What are you looking for?

950
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,050
Abscesses that

951
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,050
weren't there earlier.

952
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,720
Nothing dental or oral.

953
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,230
Help me search his skin.

954
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,170
Nothing on this side.

955
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,470
Here either.

956
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,410
Get a cooling blanket.

957
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,750
He should be getting better,

958
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,750
but he's only getting worse.

959
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,310
It's gonna be okay.

960
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,310
It's okay.

961
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,490
Hey.

962
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,490
Hi.

963
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,260
Tommy's latest labs.

964
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,130
He doesn't have

965
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,130
a staph infection.

966
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
Vancomycin-Resistant

967
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
Enterococcus.

968
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,260
The super bug?

969
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,260
Yeah.

970
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,310
And one that is

971
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,310
not easy to get.

972
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,570
VRE's a nosocomial infection.

973
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,570
It lives in hospitals.

974
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,840
I don't think

975
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,840
I've ever seen it

976
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,840
contracted anywhere else.

977
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,280
Hannah.

978
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,710
She had pneumonia

979
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,710
a decade ago.

980
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,310
Was hospitalized

981
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,310
for two weeks.

982
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,480
Could've picked it up then,

983
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,480
had it ever since.

984
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,150
Asymptomatic carrier.

985
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,120
Intimate relationship,

986
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,250
lots of ways she could've

987
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,250
passed it on.

988
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,060
Okay, let's start Tommy

989
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,060
on IV Linezolid,

990
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,120
swab Hannah's nose

991
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,120
and throat for the bacteria,

992
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,290
confirm she's the source.

993
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,800
Got it.

994
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,800
Thank you.

995
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,760
Oh, Dr. Charles,

996
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,760
our Jane Doe

997
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,760
is Jamie Walker,

998
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,700
an aspiring chef

999
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,700
in culinary school.

1000
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,960
Huh.

1001
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,700
A month ago, she started

1002
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,700
staying up all night,

1003
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,800
reading the Bible,

1004
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,800
and writing a manifesto.

1005
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,740
Last week,

1006
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,740
she dropped out of school

1007
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,930
and hasn't been seen home

1008
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,930
in four days.

1009
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,070
Now, my original findings,

1010
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,480
combined with her

1011
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,480
sudden onset drop,

1012
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,980
lack in functioning,

1013
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,980
her decreased need

1014
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,980
for sleep,

1015
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,680
her grandiose thinking

1016
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,680
combined with

1017
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,680
hyper-religiosity,

1018
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,580
it is what I thought,

1019
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,580
bipolar mania.

1020
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,560
So, exams, lab results

1021
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,560
didn't poke any holes?

1022
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,850
No, I never got to them.

1023
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,620
I filled in the blanks

1024
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,620
with the added history.

1025
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,100
Wait, so, you got all that,

1026
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,900
a detailed,

1027
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,900
chronological history,

1028
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,900
from a patient

1029
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,960
in a manic state?

1030
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,270
Uh, well, no,

1031
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,270
it came from collateral.

1032
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,930
I found and spoke

1033
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,930
with her sister, Melissa.

1034
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,660
Dr. Reese, I thought

1035
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,660
that we were checking

1036
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,660
all the boxes.

1037
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,210
You know, doing it

1038
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,210
by the book?

1039
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,750
I... I confirmed my diagnosis.

1040
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,280
Does it matter

1041
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,280
how I got there?

1042
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,280
Yes, when you're

1043
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,280
on probation, it does.

1044
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,040
It does matter

1045
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,040
how you got there.

1046
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,040
Um, you're... You're right.

1047
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,110
Okay.

1048
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,720
So, um...

1049
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,720
So what's the next move,

1050
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,720
for your patient?

1051
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,720
I want to admit her

1052
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,720
to the psych ward.

1053
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,590
She hasn't responded

1054
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,590
to any of her meds.

1055
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,500
And what meds would those be?

1056
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,900
I doubled the Risperdal

1057
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,900
and added Depakote.

1058
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,800
Also without filling you in.

1059
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,070
Okay.

1060
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,800
Well, um, you know,

1061
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,800
with bipolar,

1062
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,040
all those meds,

1063
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,880
should've made

1064
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,880
some kind of dent,

1065
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,310
so I'd like to take a look.

1066
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,020
The cancer metastasized

1067
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,020
to her tibia.

1068
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,420
Likely months ago.

1069
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,920
No discomfort

1070
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,920
upon admission?

1071
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,550
It was drowned out by

1072
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,550
the back pain from her kidney.

1073
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,760
Once that was alleviated...

1074
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,800
Her body registered

1075
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,800
the new problem.

1076
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,390
So, did we catch it in time?

1077
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,500
Let's start Asterid

1078
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,500
on a high dose bolus

1079
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,560
of Interleukin-2,

1080
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,560
see if she responds.

1081
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,370
If she doesn't,

1082
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,370
she may be a candidate

1083
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,910
for our phase three trial

1084
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,910
of Pazopanib,

1085
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,030
a chemotherapy agent.

1086
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,700
I'm gonna pull Ortho in,

1087
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,700
as well.

1088
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,610
Excuse me,

1089
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,610
Dr. Rhodes, Halstead,

1090
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,610
may I speak with you?

1091
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,080
I'm canceling

1092
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,080
Asterid's move to Oncology.

1093
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,490
What?

1094
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,490
Instead,

1095
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,990
I'm going to find a bed

1096
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,990
for her

1097
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,790
in a safety net hospital.

1098
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,550
Med is a premiere

1099
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,550
cancer center.

1100
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,600
You're gonna transfer her?

1101
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,600
I don't have a choice.

1102
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,130
She doesn't have insurance,

1103
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,390
and I know the hospital

1104
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,390
won't cover the bill

1105
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,460
her treatments

1106
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,460
are going to generate.

1107
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,590
She has emergency coverage

1108
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,590
from Medicaid.

1109
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,640
Right, but that only

1110
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,640
pays for procedures

1111
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,800
related to removal

1112
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,800
of the tumor.

1113
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,640
The bone cancer is new,

1114
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,800
and not immediately

1115
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,800
life-threatening.

1116
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,810
We can't throw Asterid out.

1117
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,870
A free clinic misdiagnosed

1118
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,870
her renal cell carcinoma

1119
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,150
as a back sprain.

1120
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,620
If we put her

1121
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,620
in the system,

1122
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,850
she might fall

1123
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,850
through the cracks again.

1124
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,720
You have pulled

1125
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,720
strings before,

1126
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,160
you made the numbers work,

1127
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,160
just do it again.

1128
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,850
Do you know

1129
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,850
what kind of numbers

1130
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,850
we're talking about here?

1131
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,360
$100,000?

1132
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,600
$200,000?

1133
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,930
What kind of dream world

1134
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,930
are you living in?

1135
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,500
Do you want me

1136
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,500
to inform the patient?

1137
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
No, we'll do it.

1138
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,050
Sitting in pews...

1139
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,050
Hi, I'm Dr. Charles.

1140
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,520
Four days ago, we could have

1141
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,520
somewhat of a conversation,

1142
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,560
and now, I don't know

1143
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,560
if she's eaten.

1144
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,460
Between her work and school,

1145
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,550
I thought Jamie

1146
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,550
was just stressed.

1147
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,530
I didn't realize she was

1148
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,530
having a breakdown.

1149
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,000
None of this is on you.

1150
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,560
Um, Jamie?

1151
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,540
I'd like to examine you now.

1152
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,540
Would that be all right?

1153
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,470
Free, free, free.

1154
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,470
Locked up inside.

1155
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,130
Wanted everything for it,

1156
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,130
everything.

1157
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,810
Everything. So much my arms

1158
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,810
can't even hold them all...

1159
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,750
Clear,

1160
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,750
prominent disinhibition.

1161
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,940
Hasn't let up since

1162
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,940
my first exam.

1163
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,710
Consistent with bipolar mania.

1164
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,780
Let me go.

1165
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,840
You see this?

1166
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,040
In her eyes?

1167
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,610
What?

1168
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,630
Yellowish-brown circles

1169
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,630
around her irises.

1170
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,590
I think they're

1171
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,590
Kayser-Fleischer rings.

1172
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,960
And weeks,

1173
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,960
days and weeks

1174
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,730
flipping in the calendar,

1175
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,730
the bright light

1176
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,730
burns the trees,

1177
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,100
leaves, falling,

1178
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,100
stop falling, too many...

1179
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,640
Too many people crowding.

1180
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,230
Too many people.

1181
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,230
Bright light burns the trees.

1182
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,500
Leaves falling.

1183
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,500
Too many people.

1184
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,600
Um... Your sister

1185
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,600
is in culinary school.

1186
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,140
Has she ever said anything

1187
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,140
to you about... About copper,

1188
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,550
using copper pots?

1189
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,640
Uh, yeah, I think so.

1190
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,710
Something about them being

1191
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,710
the best heat conductors.

1192
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,120
I don't know anything

1193
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,120
about cooking.

1194
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,710
Does that mean something

1195
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,710
to you?

1196
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,050
Dr. Reese?

1197
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,490
Wilson's disease.

1198
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,490
What's that?

1199
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,530
It's a genetic disorder,

1200
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,130
um, where com...

1201
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,130
Copper accumulates

1202
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,130
in the body.

1203
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,760
Jamie's use of copper cookware

1204
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,600
could've accelerated

1205
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,600
the buildup

1206
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,730
that led to this

1207
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,730
manic episode.

1208
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,570
If this is Wilson's disease,

1209
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,570
is there a cure?

1210
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,480
Um, no, but there is

1211
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,480
treatment to manage it,

1212
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,180
and she...

1213
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,180
She would get better.

1214
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,810
Oh, thank God.

1215
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,550
Dr. Reese, could I just have

1216
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,550
a word outside? Thank you.

1217
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,490
And twitching.

1218
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,490
Wiggle, wriggle, wiggle...

1219
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,030
So, you couldn't even get

1220
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,030
close enough to your patient

1221
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,590
to examine her eyes?

1222
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,000
She was so agitated...

1223
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,160
Dr. Reese.

1224
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,160
Help!

1225
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,170
No pulse. V-fib.

1226
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,170
Charge 200.

1227
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,050
Charged.

1228
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,050
Clear.

1229
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,810
Oh, my poor baby.

1230
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,140
One milligram epi.

1231
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,140
Charge 200 again.

1232
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,690
Epi's in. Charged.

1233
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,690
Clear.

1234
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,730
Asystole.

1235
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,730
We can't shock her anymore.

1236
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,460
Oh, my God.

1237
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,460
What's he doing?

1238
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,460
Come on, come on.

1239
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,100
She's suffered enough.

1240
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,100
Please, stop.

1241
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,550
Time of death 18:21.

1242
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,280
We're looking

1243
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,280
for Dr. Halstead.

1244
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,480
Here to transfer

1245
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,480
an Asterid Morgan to County.

1246
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,020
Right, one sec.

1247
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,650
Will?

1248
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,650
Yeah?

1249
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,720
They're here.

1250
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,690
Hey, guys.

1251
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,690
Come with me.

1252
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,200
I got this from Hannah?

1253
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,640
How? I don't have

1254
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,640
a sore throat.

1255
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,510
No fever, aches, pains,

1256
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,510
I'm not sick.

1257
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,170
You don't have

1258
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,170
an active infection,

1259
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,300
but since your pneumonia,

1260
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,300
you've been contagious.

1261
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,900
For 10 years?

1262
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,280
I work in an office,

1263
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,280
cross paths with dozens

1264
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,280
of people every day,

1265
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,910
not to mention

1266
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,910
boyfriends before Tommy.

1267
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,110
No one else has

1268
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,110
ever gotten sick.

1269
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,920
We're gonna run some tests

1270
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,920
and find out

1271
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,920
exactly what it is.

1272
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,480
Honey, I am so sorry.

1273
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,650
It's not your fault.

1274
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,650
You had no idea.

1275
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,790
Besides, I'm feeling better.

1276
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,560
It means

1277
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,560
that these antibiotics

1278
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,560
are working, right?

1279
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,790
Yes.

1280
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,990
Put Hannah on them.

1281
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,330
Yeah.

1282
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,330
Kill whatever bug

1283
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,130
she's been dragging around

1284
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,130
for the last 10 years.

1285
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,260
I'm afraid

1286
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,260
it's not that simple.

1287
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,210
You see, as a carrier,

1288
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,210
you're colonized

1289
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,210
with the bacteria.

1290
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,870
Which means

1291
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,870
it lives in too many places

1292
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,870
in your body

1293
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,740
for the antibiotic

1294
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,740
to be effective.

1295
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,080
You mean,

1296
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,080
I've got this forever?

1297
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,850
I'm afraid so.

1298
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,590
Then I could give it

1299
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,590
to Tommy again.

1300
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,850
With precautions, the risk

1301
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,850
of reinfection can be reduced.

1302
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,560
This can't be...

1303
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,560
This can't be happening.

1304
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,060
We can deal with it.

1305
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,230
Yeah.

1306
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,230
We'll figure it out.

1307
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,900
This sucks.

1308
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,170
We do everything right

1309
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,170
and still come up short.

1310
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,700
All right, let's go.

1311
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,070
Screw this.

1312
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,580
Stop, she's not

1313
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,580
going anywhere.

1314
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,180
Sorry, we have

1315
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,180
transfer orders.

1316
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,550
And I am overriding them.

1317
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,120
Dr. Rhodes, what's going on?

1318
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,430
It's okay, Asterid.

1319
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,430
It's just a miscommunication.

1320
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,430
I'm gonna take care of it.

1321
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,330
Go ahead and put her back.

1322
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,290
Whatever you say.

1323
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,570
Sign here, so this doesn't

1324
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,570
come down on us.

1325
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,570
Connor, what are you doing?

1326
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,840
I got this.

1327
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,840
Don't worry.

1328
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,460
I did my two-week suspension.

1329
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,560
I am in therapy.

1330
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,330
I am not supposed

1331
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,330
to be afraid anymore.

1332
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,970
I am a psychiatrist.

1333
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,900
Rule number one is to connect

1334
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,900
with your patients,

1335
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,440
and I could not even

1336
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,440
look her in the eye.

1337
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,440
Look, the good news is

1338
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,440
that you recognize

1339
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,440
the problem.

1340
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,980
Right?

1341
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,910
Sarah, nobody learns

1342
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,910
how to master their fears

1343
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,880
in two weeks, trust me.

1344
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,110
It just doesn't happen.

1345
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,880
Not even somebody

1346
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,880
as determined as you are.

1347
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,180
Okay.

1348
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,290
You know what?

1349
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,290
Um, when Allison died today,

1350
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,920
I saw myself,

1351
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,920
because she could not change.

1352
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,360
But I have to. I have to.

1353
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,360
I just don't know how.

1354
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,740
You have to help me,

1355
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,740
Dr. Charles.

1356
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,800
Of course.

1357
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,570
Of course.

1358
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,570
Of course I will.

1359
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,570
Okay.

1360
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,680
Hey, how's it going?

1361
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,090
They haven't taken

1362
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,090
their eyes off each other.

1363
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,970
Hey, Hannah,

1364
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,970
here are some pamphlets

1365
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,970
on universal precautions.

1366
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,830
I thought they might

1367
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,830
be helpful

1368
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,830
for you and Tommy.

1369
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,570
Yeah, uh, I don't need them.

1370
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,830
You don't?

1371
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,470
There's only one thing to do.

1372
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,280
Will you give this

1373
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,280
to Tommy tomorrow?

1374
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,490
I couldn't tell him myself.

1375
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,550
Hannah...

1376
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,820
I love him.

1377
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,050
I can't put him at risk.

1378
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,830
Dealing with TB,

1379
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,830
Tate and I,

1380
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,840
the pressure it put

1381
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,840
on our relationship...

1382
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,940
I get it.

1383
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,650
Uh-huh. Same here.

1384
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,970
Where are you

1385
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,970
gonna put it?

1386
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,010
Right there.

1387
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,010
Right there?

1388
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,980
Oh, that's gonna

1389
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,980
be beautiful.

1390
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,380
You like it

1391
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,380
standing up like that?

1392
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,510
Oh, I'll take that as a no.

1393
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,080
Oh.

1394
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,320
Special delivery.

1395
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,390
What did you do?

1396
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,800
Hey, little man.

1397
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,590
Look what I have for ya.

1398
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,600
A car.

1399
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,600
A truck!

1400
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,900
It is!

1401
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,170
Is this because of that?

1402
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,010
I'm reading up

1403
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,010
on child development.

1404
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,140
Emotional modeling,

1405
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,140
active engagement.

1406
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,450
I thought maybe the best way

1407
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,450
to bond might just be a bribe.

1408
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,550
Owen, do you like the car?

1409
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,020
Yeah.

1410
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,020
Yeah?

1411
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,020
Want to get in,

1412
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,020
try it out?

1413
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,520
Take it for a spin?

1414
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,420
Oh!

1415
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,420
Ah!

1416
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,490
I'm so sorry.

1417
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,490
Are you okay?

1418
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,170
Does he hate me?

1419
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,170
What?

1420
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,220
No.

1421
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,330
Of course not.

1422
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,340
Hey, how could he hate you?

1423
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,400
I don't know.

1424
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,580
Look, you and I are lucky.

1425
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,370
A pair of black eyes,

1426
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,370
it's nothing.

1427
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,650
Let's go get you some ice.

1428
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,650
Come on.

1429
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,390
Dr. Rhodes.

1430
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,390
Excuse me.

1431
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,480
A moment.

1432
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,990
Asterid's transfer

1433
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,990
to County...

1434
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm sure you can

1435
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,960
imagine my surprise

1436
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,590
when I learned it was

1437
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,590
suddenly unnecessary.

1438
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,300
Yeah, it, uh...

1439
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,630
It turns out that

1440
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,630
the hospital's charitable fund

1441
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,640
has enough money

1442
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,640
to cover her costs.

1443
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,270
It does now.

1444
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,270
It seems a six-figure donation

1445
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,710
was made a few hours ago

1446
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,710
anonymously.

1447
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,150
That's good timing, I guess.

1448
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,150
Mmm.

1449
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,480
Good night.

1450
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,950
Dr. Rhodes,

1451
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,650
Be careful.

1452
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,320
Patients are going

1453
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,320
to keep coming.

1454
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,120
And as wealthy

1455
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,120
as you may be,

1456
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,990
your checkbook

1457
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,990
won't be able to keep up.

1458
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,420
But it did today.

1459
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,390
Good night, Ms. Goodwin.
