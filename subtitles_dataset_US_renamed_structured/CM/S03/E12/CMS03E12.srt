1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,390
Morning.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,040
Uh, do you want me

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,040
to make you some coffee?

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,970
No, I always get one

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,970
from the cart at work,

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,140
unless you're making

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,140
some for yourself.

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,680
Uh, no, actually,

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,680
the cart sounds good,

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,270
'cause I have no idea

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,270
how to use this thing.

12
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,020
Um, so...

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,220
You wanna go straight to work,

14
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,020
or do you need to stop by

15
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,020
at your place first or...

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
I think my fish will survive

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
till I get home tonight.

18
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,120
Though I could go

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,120
feed them now,

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,790
if you wanted to get

21
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,790
a drink tonight after work.

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,100
Yeah, sure. Uh, uh...

23
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,830
What?

24
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,380
Uh, I actually have

25
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,380
plans tonight.

26
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,910
Plans?

27
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,740
But I can cancel them.

28
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,800
Nope.

29
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,340
Keep your plans. It's fine.

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,250
Smooth.

31
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,260
Hey.

32
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,430
How was the night shift?

33
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,430
Only got puked on twice.

34
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,200
Then it was a good night.

35
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,290
Bye, guys. See you tomorrow.

36
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,530
Bye.

37
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,530
Night.

38
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,370
Have you contacted your

39
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,370
sister yet about meeting up?

40
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,340
Still working on it.

41
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,240
It might actually

42
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,240
be better for her

43
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,940
if I keep a little distance.

44
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,810
Better for her or for you?

45
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,610
You know what would

46
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,610
be good for me?

47
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,620
Is dinner with you tonight.

48
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,560
Are you gonna shower first?

49
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,560
Depends on who's paying.

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,960
Then it's definitely

51
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,960
on me.

52
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,830
Later.

53
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,830
Bye.

54
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,700
And now she's shivering

55
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,700
and, and throwing up,

56
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,710
and I don't know what to do.

57
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,770
Deb, what's going on?

58
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,170
Her homeless friend

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,170
is nine months pregnant

60
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,080
and has a fever.

61
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,080
She needs to come in.

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,310
But she won't, right?

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,310
No.

64
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,310
Would you come out

65
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,310
and help her, please?

66
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,080
Not when she's

67
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,080
this far along.

68
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,180
She needs to be monitored

69
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,180
and have emergency

70
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,180
measures nearby.

71
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,250
Dr. Choi...

72
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,060
Let me get some supplies.

73
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,690
Hey, wait. Hey...

74
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,960
You're just gonna go

75
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,960
treat a pregnant girl

76
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,960
on the streets?

77
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,820
I have met

78
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,820
some of these kids.

79
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,890
They're underage.

80
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,890
They know that

81
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,890
if they come in,

82
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,870
they'll get put in a system.

83
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,870
Yeah, but she's nine months.

84
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,000
She's gonna have to come in

85
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,000
eventually to have her baby.

86
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,070
But she needs

87
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,070
to be assessed now.

88
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,810
Nat, I could use your help.

89
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,810
Seriously?

90
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,650
Fine.

91
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,650
Thanks.

92
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,760
Text babysitter.

93
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,990
Cold pizza is

94
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,990
Owen's favorite breakfast.

95
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,800
There's some in the fridge.

96
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,800
Tell him I love him.

97
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,140
Send.

98
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,140
I'll send your message.

99
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,020
She's over here.

100
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,150
Come on. Come on.

101
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,130
I wrapped her up,

102
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,130
but she's still shivering.

103
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,330
Hey.

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,830
Laura, I'm Dr. Manning.

105
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,460
I'm gonna take

106
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,460
your temperature, okay?

107
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,660
Let me take a look.

108
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,860
103.

109
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,670
You most likely have

110
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,670
an infection.

111
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,230
It is very important

112
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,230
that we treat it

113
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,010
before you go into labor.

114
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,370
Okay, but my water broke,

115
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,370
what does that mean?

116
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,750
When did your water break?

117
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,750
Two days ago.

118
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,750
Dr. Reese...

119
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,420
How was your dinner

120
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,420
with your dad?

121
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,860
It was good.

122
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,770
Uh, I mean, I'm glad

123
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,770
we're talking again.

124
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,130
He's funny, smart.

125
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,070
You don't sound

126
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,070
entirely convinced.

127
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,040
Well, it's just kinda hard

128
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,040
to look past the last

129
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,040
20 years.

130
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,910
I know he wrote me

131
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,910
those letters, but...

132
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,140
There were other ways

133
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,140
to contact me if he wanted.

134
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,710
Makes me wonder.

135
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,550
Well, you know what,

136
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,550
I've always been

137
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,320
immensely impressed

138
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,320
with your instincts,

139
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,620
so no reason to stop

140
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,620
listening to them now.

141
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,390
Yeah, I guess so.

142
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,390
Courtney?

143
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,390
I've got Luke Wallis.

144
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,800
Cystic fibrosis.

145
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,800
No breath sounds on the right.

146
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,530
Tachycardic with

147
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,530
BP 122 over 66.

148
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,200
Satting at 86.

149
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,200
Oh, I know Luke.

150
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,070
How you doing, buddy?

151
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,070
Been better.

152
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,510
He was just watching TV,

153
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,570
and then suddenly,

154
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,570
he couldn't breathe.

155
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
Get a stat chest X-ray.

156
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,850
Make it a CT.

157
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,410
And get more information.

158
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,350
On my count, one, two, three.

159
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,220
There we go.

160
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,690
Has his lung function

161
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,690
been getting worse?

162
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,170
He's been in the ICU three

163
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,170
times in the last five months.

164
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,430
Dr. Rhodes

165
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,430
has him at the top

166
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,430
of the transplant list

167
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
for lungs, but

168
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
so far, it's nothing.

169
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,280
He's got a pneumothorax

170
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,280
on the right,

171
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,570
significant rales on the left.

172
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,510
Set me up for

173
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,510
a 16 French chest tube.

174
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,980
That's a little invasive.

175
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,980
We can use a pigtail catheter.

176
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,570
His lungs are too stiff.

177
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,570
He needs a tube.

178
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,310
Which will only cause

179
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,310
additional trauma.

180
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,220
It's bad, isn't it?

181
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,850
The collapsed lung means

182
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,850
that your lungs are so scarred

183
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,830
that they can't

184
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,830
hold together, so...

185
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,460
Yeah, buddy, it's bad.

186
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,400
Look, as soon as we get

187
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,400
your lung re-inflated,

188
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm gonna sit down with you

189
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,900
and your mom and your dad,

190
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,060
and we're gonna talk about

191
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,060
what comes next, okay?

192
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,780
Chest tube, 16 French.

193
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,780
Lidocaine?

194
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,680
All right, buddy, you're

195
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,680
gonna feel a little pinch,

196
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,650
followed by

197
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,650
some pressure, okay?

198
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,480
There you go, buddy.

199
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,190
You're doing great, pal.

200
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,720
Mr. Thomas, I'm Dr. Halstead.

201
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,990
I heard you had

202
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,990
an incident at work today.

203
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,970
Yeah, I guess

204
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,970
I, uh, fell down.

205
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,040
The EMS report says

206
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,040
they found you unconscious.

207
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,770
How long you been

208
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,770
coughing up blood?

209
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,600
A few weeks.

210
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,710
Some wheezing and stridor.

211
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,710
What's his weight?

212
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,250
138.

213
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,350
Doc, I appreciate

214
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,350
your concern,

215
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,220
but I'd just as soon

216
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,220
go rest up at home.

217
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,250
Yeah, I don't blame ya,

218
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,250
but I fear if you go home,

219
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,620
you may have a far worse event

220
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,220
than whatever happened

221
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,220
this morning.

222
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,620
That's okay.

223
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,770
Well, you're too dehydrated

224
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,770
to walk out of here,

225
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
so why don't you let me

226
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
give you some fluids,

227
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,600
we'll run some tests,

228
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,440
and I promise

229
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,440
I'll be back soon?

230
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,180
All right.

231
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,180
Syncope, weight loss,

232
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,180
hemoptysis.

233
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,120
He's got cancer, right?

234
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,490
A lot of people

235
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,490
are more afraid

236
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,820
of getting the diagnosis

237
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,820
than the actual treatment.

238
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,160
Let's get a CBC

239
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,160
with diff, EKG,

240
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,790
chest X-ray, and CT.

241
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,090
And then we can try

242
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,090
and talk to him again.

243
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,670
So, um,

244
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,670
Robert Haywood is here

245
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,400
for a thoracic PET scan?

246
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,380
Uh, yeah, we're doing

247
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,380
a full cardiac workup.

248
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,420
You think you could add

249
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,420
a head study to that for me?

250
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,920
I just wanna make sure I'm not

251
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,920
missing anything on my end.

252
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,280
Sure, no problem.

253
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,280
Thank you.

254
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,840
Mmm-hmm.

255
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,520
Laura,

256
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,530
your membranes

257
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,530
ruptured prematurely,

258
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,560
allowing an infection

259
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,560
in your uterus.

260
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,600
The longer we go without

261
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,600
delivering this baby,

262
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,530
the greater the danger

263
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,530
you're both in.

264
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,860
So deliver it then.

265
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,300
We need to do it

266
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,300
at the hospital.

267
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,770
No, I told you,

268
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,770
I'm not going.

269
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,570
I understand that

270
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,570
you don't want to,

271
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,510
but this is a safety

272
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,510
issue, okay?

273
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,010
You need to think

274
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,010
about your baby.

275
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,510
I said no.

276
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,670
If there are complications,

277
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,670
if anything goes wrong...

278
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,580
It's okay, we'll do it here.

279
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,650
You're not seriously thinking

280
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,650
about inducing her

281
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,310
right here on the street?

282
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,020
Women deliver outside

283
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,020
the hospital all the time.

284
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,530
Yeah, and some of them die.

285
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,190
Listen, I don't like this

286
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,190
either, but you heard her.

287
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,760
She's gonna do this

288
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,760
with or without us.

289
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,320
And then what? A newborn

290
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,320
can't survive out here.

291
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,660
Nat, you don't have to

292
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,660
do this, but I'm staying.

293
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,530
I have good news.

294
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,100
They found a pair

295
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,100
of lungs in Kansas

296
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,300
that are a perfect match.

297
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,710
We're loading them

298
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,710
onto a plane now.

299
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,180
Oh, my God.

300
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,180
You hear that, Luke?

301
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,720
This is good news, buddy.

302
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,410
Uh, I am gonna have

303
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,410
a conversation

304
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,410
with Dr. Bekker,

305
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,390
and I'll be back in

306
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,390
just a few minutes, okay?

307
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,490
I'll start

308
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,490
the transplant protocol.

309
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,820
Hold on.

310
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,230
We have to put him on ECMO.

311
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,230
What?

312
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,600
He's satting in the 80s

313
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,600
and wearing down.

314
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,030
His respiratory muscles

315
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,030
are going to give out.

316
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,660
But ECMO could introduce

317
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,660
an infection.

318
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,840
It's a partial

319
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,840
contraindication to surgery.

320
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,740
And Kansas is

321
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,740
a two-hour flight.

322
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,070
We have to keep him oxygenated

323
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,070
till the lungs get here.

324
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,270
Those lungs only last

325
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,270
four hours.

326
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,650
If anything goes wrong

327
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,650
before they get here,

328
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,120
and he's stuck on ECMO,

329
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,810
we may not be able

330
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,810
to get him off.

331
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,950
He could die.

332
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,890
Then we make sure that

333
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,890
nothing goes wrong.

334
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,860
Thank you.

335
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,360
Mr. Thomas...

336
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
We found a large growth

337
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
in your larynx.

338
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,240
It's almost certainly cancer.

339
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,170
All right.

340
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,810
Now, the good news is,

341
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,540
we have an excellent

342
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,540
oncology department,

343
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,080
so I'd like to arrange for

344
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,080
a biopsy and a consultation,

345
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,240
so they can determine...

346
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,240
It's okay.

347
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,420
I'm not interested.

348
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,450
Mr. Thomas, the sooner

349
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,450
you begin treatment,

350
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,460
the better your chances

351
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,460
of survival.

352
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,620
You don't understand. I'm...

353
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,690
I'm ready to die.

354
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,230
I know it's a lot

355
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,230
of information,

356
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,070
and it can seem overwhelming,

357
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,070
but I...

358
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,470
I said no.

359
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,240
Can you tell me why you're

360
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,240
so resistant to treatment?

361
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,210
Because I've made it 56 years

362
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,020
without molesting a child,

363
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,220
and I can't stand it anymore.

364
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,290
I'm sorry?

365
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,730
I'm a pedophile...

366
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,860
And I wanna die.

367
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,070
Yeah?

368
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,440
Have you seen this yet?

369
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,640
A lawsuit?

370
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,410
An indigent man's claiming

371
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,410
an ambulance driver

372
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,320
passed him over to bring in

373
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,320
an insured patient instead.

374
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,760
Seems the extra wait time

375
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,760
cost this guy his leg.

376
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,550
Oh, that's terrible.

377
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,730
But isn't that the fault

378
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,730
of the ambulance company?

379
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,630
Apparently the ambulance

380
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,630
driver was following

381
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,390
our hospital's instructions.

382
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,230
Now that's ridiculous.

383
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,170
I never told anyone

384
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,170
to pass up uninsured patients.

385
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,970
No, but the claimant states

386
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,840
that an E.D. charge nurse

387
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,840
named Maggie Lockwood did.

388
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,710
Give me some time

389
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,710
to look into it.

390
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,350
Try to relax, all right?

391
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,350
Look at me.

392
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,980
Look at me, look at me.

393
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,980
Take a deep breath.

394
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,030
104. The antibiotics

395
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,030
aren't working.

396
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,430
We need a couple bags

397
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,430
of Flagyl.

398
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,930
Ethan...

399
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,930
I need more drugs?

400
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,870
Laura, what you need is to go

401
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,870
to the hospital, okay?

402
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,570
You're putting yourself and

403
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,570
your baby at unnecessary risk.

404
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,700
She can't. They'll put her

405
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,700
back into foster care.

406
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,040
I know it's not ideal,

407
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,040
but this isn't just about you.

408
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,670
Your baby's gonna need food

409
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,670
and a roof over its head.

410
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,550
Unless they keep 'em

411
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,550
out in the yard,

412
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,850
feed 'em whatever

413
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,850
the dogs don't want.

414
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,150
I'll talk to

415
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,150
the social worker,

416
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,480
make sure you find

417
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,480
a good home.

418
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,390
No one wants to adopt

419
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,390
a 16-year-old.

420
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,820
Even if you do get

421
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,820
a good home in foster care,

422
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,290
everyone keeps getting

423
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,290
passed along,

424
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,930
until you finally

425
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,930
end up some place

426
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,830
where they'd rather cash

427
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,830
a check from the state

428
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,590
than feed you.

429
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,660
Yeah, they're the ones

430
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,660
who keep you forever.

431
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,600
Nat, we really need

432
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,600
those antibiotics.

433
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,100
Okay, I'll be back

434
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,100
as soon as I can.

435
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,640
Yeah.

436
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,440
Okay, keep breathing,

437
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,440
keep breathing.

438
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,570
Okay? Keep breathing.

439
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,640
Just try to relax.

440
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,640
It's okay.

441
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,180
Dr. Rhodes?

442
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,060
What's wrong?

443
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,220
Luke's LFTs are rising.

444
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,530
What... What does that mean?

445
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,500
It indicates that he might be

446
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,500
in early liver failure.

447
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,030
Unfortunately,

448
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,030
if it progresses,

449
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,870
it could prevent him

450
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,870
from getting the lungs.

451
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,930
Prevent him?

452
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,450
Fortunately, we can still

453
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,450
get him off the ECMO,

454
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,780
while we try to

455
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,780
reverse this trend.

456
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,150
However, if we take him

457
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,150
off of ECMO now,

458
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,980
it decreases the odds

459
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,980
that he survives

460
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,580
until the lungs get here.

461
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,150
I don't understand.

462
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,150
Can't you agree on what to do?

463
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,980
It's not a black and white

464
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,980
situation.

465
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,100
Uh, you've been treating

466
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,100
him, Dr. Rhodes.

467
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,660
What should we do?

468
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,340
We should keep him

469
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,340
on the ECMO.

470
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,280
It's still our best chance

471
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,280
that he gets those lungs.

472
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,940
Okay.

473
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,240
Yes. That's what we'll do.

474
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,150
All right.

475
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,920
You're being completely

476
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,920
irresponsible.

477
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,660
That kid is going to die

478
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,660
if he doesn't get new lungs.

479
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,920
Only if your ECMO

480
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,920
doesn't kill him first.

481
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,930
He's a snowball

482
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,930
rolling down a hill,

483
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,160
and this is our last chance

484
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,160
to stop it.

485
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,630
So what are we doing

486
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,630
about Mr. Thomas?

487
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,910
Psych's in there right now.

488
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,740
As soon as they declare him

489
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,740
incompetent,

490
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm gonna call Oncology

491
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,840
down here to get started.

492
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,250
Incompetent?

493
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,880
Who cares?

494
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,880
The man is a pedophile, okay?

495
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,120
If he wants to die,

496
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,120
why don't we just let him?

497
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,760
April, we're going

498
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,760
to stop him from dying,

499
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,090
because he's our patient

500
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,090
and because we can.

501
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,970
Did you put him

502
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,970
on a psych hold?

503
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,870
Uh, I'm not ready

504
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,870
to make that decision.

505
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,640
Why? He's suicidal.

506
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,000
He may want to die,

507
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,000
but he is lucid

508
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,770
and understands the

509
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,770
consequences of his choices.

510
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,580
He, he has

511
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,580
a treatable condition.

512
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,670
How lucid can he be if

513
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,670
he's not letting us treat it?

514
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,740
If he was depressed,

515
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,740
you'd put him on a psych hold

516
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,150
and try and treat

517
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,150
his depression.

518
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,620
You're not gonna do

519
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,620
the same for pedophilia?

520
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,880
I just don't know that much

521
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,880
about pedophilia.

522
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,580
Well, you better find out

523
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,580
fast, because he's dying.

524
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,490
"...Department charge nurse

525
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,490
Maggie Lockwood,

526
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,290
"especially providing

527
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,290
incentive."

528
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,430
I don't believe this.

529
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,430
All right, take it easy.

530
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,260
What do you know

531
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,260
about this patient?

532
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,360
I don't.

533
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,130
And I definitely never told

534
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,130
any ambulance driver

535
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,570
to make decisions based on

536
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,570
insurance coverage.

537
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,080
All right.

538
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,080
This driver, John Gates,

539
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,580
do you know him?

540
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,580
Yeah, he's a jerk.

541
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,810
Well, do me a favor,

542
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,810
page me when he comes in.

543
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,040
I wanna talk to him.

544
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,420
Sure.

545
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,420
If I don't kill him first.

546
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,790
I need a doctor in here.

547
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,790
Help him!

548
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,460
He's coagulopathic.

549
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,460
What does that mean?

550
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,300
The combination of

551
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,300
his poor liver function

552
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,100
and the anticoagulants

553
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,100
that we gave him

554
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,040
has disrupted

555
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,040
his ability to clot.

556
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,160
Hang a bag of heparin.

557
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,640
We thinned his blood

558
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,640
for the ECMO, we had to,

559
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,470
but his liver is failing

560
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,470
more quickly than we expected.

561
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,440
You did this,

562
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,440
so take him off that machine!

563
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,500
I am afraid that it is

564
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,500
too late for that.

565
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,080
Too late?

566
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,710
Heparin's running.

567
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,880
We're gonna try

568
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,880
and reverse the bleeding now.

569
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,850
Run the plasma now.

570
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,410
Hold on that.

571
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,320
Wait...

572
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,430
A transfusion is going to

573
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,430
increase his antibody count.

574
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,730
His PRA's already at 50.

575
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,630
If it hits 80,

576
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,630
we can't use those lungs.

577
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,600
You think I don't know that?

578
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,600
We don't have a choice.

579
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,070
We wouldn't be

580
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,070
in this situation

581
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,970
if you hadn't insisted on ECMO

582
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,970
in the first place.

583
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,030
You keep pointing out

584
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,030
problems.

585
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,810
What I need are solutions,

586
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,810
so if you don't have any,

587
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,850
just get out of my way, okay?

588
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,210
Hang the bags.

589
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,260
Dr. Halstead has a point.

590
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,990
Is this man, this pedophile,

591
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,990
really being rational?

592
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,730
Funny enough,

593
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,730
it sounds to me like he is.

594
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,670
So we just have to, uh,

595
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,670
stand by and watch him

596
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,670
kill himself?

597
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,730
Not treating your cancer

598
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,730
is not the same thing

599
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,730
as committing suicide.

600
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,940
I mean, it's his decision.

601
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,940
He's allowed to make it.

602
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,670
More to the point, I think

603
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,670
what he may be trying to do

604
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,840
is looking for a way to...

605
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,510
Escape his urges.

606
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,310
By dying.

607
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,320
Dr. Reese, have you ever seen

608
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,320
a pedophile's P.E.T. scan?

609
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,820
The prefrontal cortex

610
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,820
and the putamen,

611
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,080
they light up.

612
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,990
There's a very good chance

613
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,990
that pedophilia

614
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,990
could be genetically

615
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,990
hardwired into the brain.

616
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,660
There's nothing

617
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,660
he can do about it?

618
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,220
Well, yes and no.

619
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,270
I mean, the thinking is,

620
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,270
you can't change the hardware,

621
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,430
but the software

622
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,430
is another question,

623
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,370
and it sounds to me

624
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,370
like that's what Mr. Thomas

625
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,030
has been trying to do.

626
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,610
If you look at it

627
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,610
from his perspective,

628
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,200
the whole thing

629
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,200
seems quite rational.

630
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,950
Hey, what are you doing here

631
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,950
on your day off?

632
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,750
Don't ask.

633
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,750
Don't ask?

634
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,490
I'm not crazy about

635
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,490
what I'm doing,

636
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
and I will tell you

637
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
the whole thing later,

638
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,930
but right now, I just need

639
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,930
to get something and go.

640
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,490
I'll talk to you later.

641
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,930
Okay.

642
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,970
Hey!

643
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,870
Everyone out, please.

644
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,870
You stay.

645
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,900
John Gates,

646
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,900
this is Sharon Goodwin,

647
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,580
the Executive Director

648
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,580
of Patient Services.

649
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,540
You might stand up.

650
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,180
Did you speak

651
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,180
to anyone recently

652
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,660
regarding a lawsuit?

653
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,590
Yeah, lawyers asked me

654
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,590
some questions.

655
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,260
And what did you say?

656
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,390
I said you guys only wanted

657
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,390
patients with good insurance,

658
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,430
so I brought you

659
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,430
what you wanted.

660
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,000
And where exactly

661
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,000
did you get that idea?

662
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,870
Look around.

663
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,500
Excuse me?

664
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,880
The TV. The pizza?

665
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,280
Everyone knows

666
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,280
this room's just a ploy

667
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,250
to get us to bring in

668
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,250
paying customers.

669
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,710
Get out of here.

670
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,530
Sharon...

671
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,900
I never intended for him

672
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,900
to leave people on the street.

673
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,300
He's not the problem.

674
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,650
Dr. Bekker...

675
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,660
You disagree with Dr. Rhodes'

676
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,660
treatment, don't you?

677
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,890
It's a complicated situation.

678
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,060
Okay.

679
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
I know how hard it must be

680
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,080
watching him go through this.

681
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,840
It is.

682
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,910
And it has been for 12 years.

683
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,140
We tried everything,

684
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,580
modulator therapies,

685
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,580
clinical trials.

686
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,390
It's all we ever

687
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,390
thought about,

688
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,390
but nothing ever worked.

689
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,560
After a while, we just wanted

690
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,560
to let Luke be a kid,

691
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,420
while he still had the chance.

692
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,060
But now, I'm...

693
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,970
Maybe there was more

694
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,970
we could've done.

695
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,070
Did we just let

696
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,070
our little boy die?

697
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,640
There are no right answers

698
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,640
with cystic fibrosis.

699
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,040
It's relentless

700
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,840
and impervious to

701
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,840
whatever we throw at it.

702
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,780
But every decision

703
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,780
you made for your son,

704
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,220
you made out of love.

705
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,200
And I believe that whenever

706
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,200
you do something out of love,

707
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,660
it can never really be wrong.

708
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,310
Dr. Halstead!

709
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,280
Sats are down to 78.

710
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,350
Did you eat this morning?

711
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,930
He might be obstructed.

712
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,930
Laryngoscope on the gills.

713
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,020
Give him a sublingual nitro

714
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,020
and an amp of glucagon.

715
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,300
The food must've gotten

716
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,300
trapped by your tumor,

717
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,600
and it's starting

718
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,600
to block your airway.

719
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,140
I need to break it up.

720
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,140
Oh, please, don't.

721
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,830
What about his DNR?

722
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,740
I'm not tubing him,

723
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,740
I'm just clearing his airway.

724
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,980
Mr. Thomas, I am legally

725
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,980
obligated to do this.

726
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,270
It will only take a moment.

727
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,680
Forceps?

728
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,720
Almost there. Got it.

729
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,390
That's it, Mr. Thomas.

730
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,990
Take a few deep breaths...

731
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,730
Deep breaths.

732
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,160
God damn it.

733
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,700
Why won't you people

734
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,700
just let me die?

735
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,340
Well, I don't see any tumors

736
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,340
or signs of stroke.

737
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,060
Robert Haywood, is he one

738
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,060
of your prison patients?

739
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,750
Um, no. Why?

740
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,420
He's a criminal, right?

741
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,980
Not that I know of.

742
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,260
Decreased activity

743
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,260
in the lower frontal lobe,

744
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,700
significant reductions in

745
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,700
the orbital prefrontal cortex,

746
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,700
which is the regulator of

747
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,700
morality and aggression.

748
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,560
Oh, psychopath.

749
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,660
Well, in my opinion,

750
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,660
the best thing you can

751
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,660
do for this patient

752
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,330
is put a pillow

753
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,330
over his head.

754
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,010
How's he doing?

755
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,850
Not great.

756
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,050
His larynx is still

757
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,050
partially obstructed,

758
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,720
and now I need ENT to come

759
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,720
clear it out completely.

760
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,090
Are you putting him on a hold?

761
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,930
Dr. Charles believes

762
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,930
he is rational. We can't.

763
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,430
So that's that?

764
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,170
What, we just let him die?

765
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,170
Not necessarily.

766
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,460
Since he is rational,

767
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,100
maybe we can reason with him.

768
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,480
Fine, as soon

769
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,480
as he's cleaned up.

770
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,560
Why are you fighting

771
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,560
so hard for this guy?

772
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,430
Because it's not my job

773
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,430
to judge him.

774
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,500
I just got the call.

775
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,500
The lungs are ten minutes out.

776
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,400
His cardiac output is down,

777
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,400
urine, too.

778
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,350
He's in multi-organ failure.

779
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,680
BP's 90 over 50.

780
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,180
He's not going to be

781
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,180
stable enough for surgery.

782
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,780
This doesn't make any sense.

783
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,650
Cystic fibrosis is

784
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,650
a chronic disease.

785
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,550
This is all happening

786
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,550
too fast.

787
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,990
Only since you put him

788
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,990
on the ECMO.

789
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,090
These are symptoms

790
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,090
of under-perfusion.

791
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,760
It shouldn't happen on ECMO.

792
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,700
Unless the problem is

793
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,700
with the ECMO itself.

794
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,330
Let me see your readings.

795
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,240
The flow rate's too slow.

796
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
How long's it been at 2.6?

797
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
Couple hours.

798
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,310
Did you interrogate the line?

799
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,310
Yeah, it was clean.

800
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,850
You think it's

801
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,850
the oxygenator?

802
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,850
Let's find out.

803
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,540
His sats are gonna drop.

804
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,540
We gotta do this fast.

805
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,340
Turn the FiO2 up to 100.

806
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,750
Shut down ECMO.

807
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,980
What? You're turning it off?

808
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,250
I thought it was

809
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,250
keeping him alive.

810
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,350
Sats are down to 80.

811
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,330
We think there might be

812
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,330
a clot in the oxygenator.

813
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,720
It would impede

814
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,720
the blood flow enough

815
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,890
to cause his organs to fail.

816
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,120
75.

817
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,700
Set.

818
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,830
Got it.

819
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,200
It must've happened

820
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,200
when we hung the plasma.

821
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,300
ECMO back on.

822
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,210
Flow rate's at 4.

823
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,450
Sats are coming back up.

824
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,450
83...

825
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,010
85...

826
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,650
Is he gonna be okay?

827
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,120
He's getting oxygen

828
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,120
back to his organs.

829
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,880
The failure should be

830
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,880
reversible.

831
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,190
Oh, thank God.

832
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,600
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker,

833
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,600
the lungs are here.

834
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,960
All right, let's get him

835
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,960
upstairs. Come on.

836
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,370
You can still do

837
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,370
the transplant?

838
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,430
Yes.

839
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,770
Oh!

840
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,770
It's okay.

841
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,800
Come on!

842
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,310
All right, let's go.

843
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,470
You got this!

844
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,140
Good job, Laura. Good job.

845
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,140
You're doing great.

846
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,480
Nat, we've been

847
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,480
pushing for 30.

848
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,180
Come on.

849
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,180
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

850
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,270
I can't.

851
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,270
There you go.

852
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,510
You can do this,

853
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,510
you can do this, okay?

854
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,920
Push, push, push, push,

855
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,920
push, push, push, push...

856
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,960
Good job. There you go.

857
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,150
There you go.

858
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,690
All right,

859
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,690
keep pushing, Laura.

860
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,630
You're doing great.

861
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,630
Keep going.

862
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,630
Okay, I see the head.

863
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,260
Push, push, push, push...

864
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,490
Okay, here it comes.

865
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,490
Here it comes.

866
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,930
Is it out?

867
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,000
Nat...

868
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,300
What's wrong?

869
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,300
Shoulder dystocia.

870
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,010
The head is through

871
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,010
the birth canal,

872
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,740
but the shoulders are too big.

873
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,740
It's stuck.

874
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,010
Stuck?

875
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,010
What do you mean stuck?

876
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,340
Don't worry,

877
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,340
we're gonna get it out,

878
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,940
but we need to hurry.

879
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,940
Call an ambulance.

880
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,420
What? No, I'm not

881
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,420
calling an ambulance.

882
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,950
Call an ambulance.

883
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,950
What are you...

884
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,490
What are you doing?

885
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,490
No, no, what's going on?

886
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,990
You're okay.

887
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,990
What are you doing?

888
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,050
We're just gonna

889
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,050
pick your leg up.

890
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,950
You're gonna be fine.

891
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,560
What are those for?

892
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,560
An episiotomy.

893
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,190
I need to cut a wider hole

894
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,190
for the baby to come out.

895
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,430
I'm sorry,

896
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,430
but this is gonna hurt.

897
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,030
Can't you numb her?

898
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,300
Not with the head this close,

899
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,300
not out here.

900
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,000
I'll push harder.

901
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,000
I'll get it to come out!

902
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,980
Laura, we are past that

903
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,980
right now, okay?

904
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,240
I need you to just be strong

905
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,240
for your baby.

906
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,010
I can't. I can't...

907
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,380
Laura, I promise you

908
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,380
it will be worth it.

909
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,320
Now, are you ready? Yes?

910
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,940
Okay.

911
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,360
All right, you got it.

912
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,920
You got it.

913
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,090
You did it!

914
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,770
You did it. Great job, Laura.

915
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,740
It's a beautiful girl.

916
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,500
Hi.

917
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,450
Hi.

918
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,480
Hi.

919
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,390
Hi.

920
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,330
Pulmonary artery is cut.

921
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,670
Left lung is free.

922
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,730
Yep.

923
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,010
Lungs are coming out.

924
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,940
Keep the heart elevated.

925
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,140
Okay.

926
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,010
All right.

927
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,650
Let's sew these new lungs in.

928
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,690
Dr. Bekker's gonna

929
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,690
take the lead.

930
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,090
Me?

931
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,090
Yes.

932
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,290
But he's your patient.

933
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,290
You are the better choice.

934
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,430
Why would you say that?

935
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,020
You've been fighting me

936
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,020
tooth and nail all day.

937
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,230
Your hands are smaller.

938
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,360
It'll be easier

939
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,360
for you to work

940
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,360
in the confined space.

941
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,410
I see.

942
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,600
And is that the only reason?

943
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,600
The size of my hands?

944
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,800
Also, you are

945
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,800
an excellent surgeon.

946
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,510
All right.

947
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,780
Stitch?

948
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,830
My apologies, Sharon.

949
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,830
This is my fault.

950
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,370
The pizza room was my idea.

951
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,930
No, Maggie, I was in

952
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,930
full support of it,

953
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,840
and never stopped

954
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,840
to think about what

955
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,840
we were encouraging.

956
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,550
How are you feeling?

957
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,710
Just let me go.

958
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,990
Mr. Thomas,

959
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,990
I can't begin to imagine

960
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,760
what your life is like.

961
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,730
But one thing I know is

962
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,730
that it can't get better

963
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,270
unless you let me help you.

964
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,100
Now, I've talked

965
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,100
to the oncologist...

966
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,270
Enough.

967
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,270
And we have a real chance

968
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,280
at getting you into remission.

969
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,640
Please, just take

970
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,640
a few minutes

971
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,640
to at least consider it.

972
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,880
Mr. Thomas,

973
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,880
can I ask you a question?

974
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,020
You have a job, right?

975
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,960
Coworkers, do you get along

976
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,960
with some of them?

977
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,420
Yeah. So?

978
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,190
How about interests?

979
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,930
Reading? Sports?

980
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,300
What's your point?

981
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,930
That you are not

982
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,930
just a pedophile.

983
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,870
There is more to you

984
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,870
than that.

985
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,900
And I understand

986
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,900
that you have been

987
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,950
challenged by your thoughts

988
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,950
your entire life,

989
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,810
but you have overcome them.

990
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,710
Maybe this cancer is

991
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,710
just another challenge,

992
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,260
something that you can

993
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,260
overcome as well,

994
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,850
so you can get back to

995
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,950
all of the parts of your life

996
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,950
that you do like.

997
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,020
Doctor, I have an itch...

998
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,890
Every second of every day.

999
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,800
To scratch it

1000
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,800
would feel so good,

1001
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,240
but I don't, ever.

1002
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,940
Not scratching that itch

1003
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,840
is the worst hell

1004
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,840
that I can imagine,

1005
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,710
and cancer is gonna

1006
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,710
get me out of that hell.

1007
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,880
It isn't another challenge...

1008
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,780
Cancer is my reward.

1009
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,960
So, Bob,

1010
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,960
I know that we haven't

1011
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,800
known each other

1012
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,800
very long at all,

1013
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,500
but from what I've observed

1014
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,500
and our conversations,

1015
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,370
it's my opinion

1016
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,370
that you evident

1017
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,410
some of the hallmark

1018
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,410
characteristics

1019
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,540
of something known as

1020
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,870
Antisocial Personality

1021
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,870
Disorder.

1022
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,810
Huh. Interesting.

1023
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,720
That could explain

1024
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,720
a lot about my life.

1025
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,620
I mean, divorces,

1026
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,990
problems with colleagues.

1027
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,990
Right, right.

1028
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,080
Well, you should know

1029
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,080
that it's very manageable.

1030
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,080
I mean...

1031
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,250
No, I've got things handled.

1032
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,350
I'm okay.

1033
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,350
Are you, though?

1034
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,490
Because, very honestly,

1035
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,490
from what I've seen,

1036
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,870
that you aren't in fact

1037
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,870
always the best judge

1038
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,730
of your own self-interest.

1039
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,710
What do you mean?

1040
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,940
Well, you have

1041
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,940
significant heart disease,

1042
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,140
which, one way or the other,

1043
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,140
is gonna require

1044
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,010
serious long-term care.

1045
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,610
Your plan is to have your

1046
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,610
daughter provide that care,

1047
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,980
a daughter whose father

1048
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,220
has suddenly reappeared

1049
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,220
in her life after 20 years.

1050
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,760
I mean, she's gonna have

1051
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,760
trust issues,

1052
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,260
abandonment issues.

1053
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,560
What I'm saying is

1054
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,560
if you want this

1055
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,560
to work out with Sarah,

1056
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,190
it would be a really

1057
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,190
good idea to discuss

1058
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,190
this personality disorder.

1059
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,060
And why would that help me?

1060
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,670
Well, first of all, I think

1061
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,670
she'd appreciate your candor.

1062
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,000
She'd be comforted

1063
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,000
by your honesty.

1064
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,740
More importantly, it would

1065
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,740
shed a huge amount of light

1066
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,080
on her life,

1067
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,080
on what transpired

1068
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,080
between the two of you.

1069
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,480
I think, ultimately,

1070
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,480
she'd embrace your care,

1071
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,950
she'd throw herself into it,

1072
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,990
and that the time

1073
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,990
you spend together

1074
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,640
would just be much richer

1075
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,640
for the both of you.

1076
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,780
Or she could have

1077
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,780
the opposite reaction.

1078
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,590
Antisocial Personality

1079
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,590
Disorder?

1080
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,630
I mean, that's like saying

1081
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,630
I'm a psychopath.

1082
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,600
I mean, when people

1083
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,600
hear that word,

1084
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,160
they run in the opposite

1085
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,160
direction.

1086
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,640
Labels, semantics

1087
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,640
can be toxic.

1088
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,910
Whatever the case,

1089
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,910
all I'm saying is that

1090
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,810
I think it would be very much

1091
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,810
in your best interest

1092
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,540
to share this

1093
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,540
with your daughter.

1094
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,590
She's so happy.

1095
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,120
All she does is smile.

1096
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,160
Laura...

1097
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,730
We need to take you

1098
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,730
to the hospital.

1099
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,340
You said I could stay here.

1100
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,940
You could give birth

1101
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,940
out here,

1102
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,840
but it's not a safe place

1103
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,840
to keep her.

1104
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,640
It's too cold. She'll freeze.

1105
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,610
But if we come in, we'll

1106
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,610
have to go into foster care.

1107
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,320
She's too good for that.

1108
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,320
I won't let her.

1109
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,920
Laura...

1110
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,550
I'm sorry,

1111
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,550
but we don't have a choice.

1112
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,200
Take her without me.

1113
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,300
What?

1114
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,070
Babies with 16-year-old

1115
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,070
mothers go into foster care.

1116
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,610
But babies on their own...

1117
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,640
Get adopted

1118
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,640
into nice families.

1119
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,850
Laura, this is your baby.

1120
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,930
You'll never see her again.

1121
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,200
I know.

1122
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,460
You don't have to do this.

1123
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,260
You're gonna

1124
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,260
have a good life.

1125
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,240
Hey, thought you'd wanna know

1126
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,240
we're settling that case

1127
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,240
out of court.

1128
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,280
Yeah, I figured the hospital

1129
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,280
wouldn't want the bad press.

1130
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,920
We'll move on.

1131
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,920
Hopefully, it's just

1132
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,920
an isolated incident.

1133
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,080
It should be.

1134
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,780
It turns out the pizza room

1135
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,780
was the source of the problem,

1136
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,290
so I shut it down.

1137
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,350
Wait, what?

1138
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,520
I shut down the pizza room.

1139
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,500
No. No, no, no, the board's

1140
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,500
not gonna let you do that.

1141
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,220
Why not? It was influencing

1142
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,220
the decision-making

1143
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,860
of ambulance crews.

1144
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,470
And it's making this hospital

1145
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,470
a lot of money.

1146
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,230
The E.D. has shown

1147
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,230
a 14% increase in revenue

1148
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,400
since it opened.

1149
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,400
Are you serious?

1150
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,700
Sharon, the pizza room

1151
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,700
stays open.

1152
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,090
His obstruction must be

1153
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,090
eroding into the mucosa.

1154
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,490
Hang two units.

1155
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,020
Vic, you're losing

1156
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,020
too much blood.

1157
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,580
I need to cauterize

1158
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,580
the vessels.

1159
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,750
No... You don't.

1160
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,160
Hey, I'm sorry,

1161
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,160
but I don't have a choice.

1162
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,530
Yes... You do.

1163
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,300
Hanging the blood.

1164
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,630
Get me a cautery.

1165
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,740
There's one in Trauma 3.

1166
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,740
Okay.

1167
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,200
It won't be long.

1168
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,660
Time of death, 19:21.

1169
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,840
Hey, hey.

1170
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,810
How's it going, bud?

1171
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,810
How's it feel?

1172
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,550
Sore, but good.

1173
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,680
Good.

1174
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,520
Well, don't go anywhere, okay?

1175
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,790
I'm gonna be back to check

1176
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,790
on you in just a little bit.

1177
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,430
I have to admit,

1178
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,430
your way worked.

1179
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,090
You got him

1180
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,090
to the finish line.

1181
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,090
I think we both know

1182
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,540
that I couldn't have

1183
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,540
done this without you.

1184
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,530
Say, uh...

1185
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,930
I canceled my plans.

1186
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,380
Um, what do you say

1187
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,380
we go get that drink?

1188
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,280
No.

1189
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,820
Last night was a mistake.

1190
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,120
I was wrong about Laura.

1191
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,300
I don't know if

1192
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,300
I could've done

1193
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,300
what she did.

1194
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,800
Those kids surprise me, too.

1195
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,770
I just hate the thought

1196
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,770
of them out there,

1197
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,400
having to take care

1198
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,400
of themselves.

1199
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,940
Yeah.

1200
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,900
Oh, there's DCFS.

1201
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,310
I got it.

1202
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,310
Okay.

1203
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,150
Hey, I am so sorry

1204
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,150
about earlier.

1205
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,420
Oh, that's okay.

1206
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,390
It's just,

1207
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,390
I had the most awful,

1208
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,860
yet the most incredible day.

1209
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,390
There is this girl

1210
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,390
who lives at...

1211
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,090
Hey, Nat, I'm not really

1212
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,090
in the mood to talk right now.

1213
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,760
Oh, okay.

1214
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,760
Are you all right?

1215
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,130
Yeah, it's just...

1216
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,130
Don't ask.

1217
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,740
Hey.

1218
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,310
That patient...

1219
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,920
I judged him.

1220
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,260
I should've just

1221
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,260
been his nurse.

1222
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,760
Sometimes it's really

1223
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,760
hard not to judge.

1224
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,060
I've been there.

1225
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,960
You mind if we, uh,

1226
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,300
take a rain check

1227
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,300
on dinner tonight?

1228
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,500
Sure.

1229
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,910
Hey, there.

1230
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,050
Everything okay?

1231
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,320
No.

1232
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,590
No, I, uh, I just had

1233
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,590
a long talk with my dad,

1234
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,630
and it turns out he has

1235
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,630
class III heart failure

1236
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,220
from cardiomyopathy.

1237
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,360
Oh, man.

1238
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,360
Very sorry to hear that.

1239
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,270
Yeah, you know, he said

1240
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,270
he wasn't gonna tell me.

1241
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,890
Said he was afraid.

1242
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,170
Afraid?

1243
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,040
That he just came back

1244
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,040
into my life,

1245
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,370
and now if he dies,

1246
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,540
he doesn't know

1247
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,540
what it might do to me.

1248
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,340
Said he worries

1249
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,340
he's giving me issues

1250
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,010
with abandonment and trust.

1251
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,540
Oh. Wow, he said that, huh?

1252
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,650
Yeah, as sick as he is, he...

1253
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,650
He didn't wanna tell me.

1254
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,220
That is so... Selfless.

1255
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:04,960
You were right.

1256
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,230
Maybe I need to look at things

1257
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,230
more from his perspective.

1258
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,660
Dr. Reese, did your...

1259
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,670
Did your father

1260
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,670
tell you anything else?

1261
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,940
No. Why?

1262
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,580
I'm just curious, you know.

1263
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,580
Nothing else?

1264
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,870
No.

1265
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,860
Ethan.

1266
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,860
Hey.

1267
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,800
Why are you here?

1268
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,330
I just wanted to see

1269
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,330
how you're doing.

1270
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,940
Oh.

1271
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,980
Maybe I should've called.

1272
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,280
No, it's okay.

1273
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,040
Your hair's longer.

1274
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,520
Yeah.

1275
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,850
Yours is...

1276
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,020
Shorter.

1277
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,800
Okay if I come in?

1278
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,270
Yeah. Okay.
