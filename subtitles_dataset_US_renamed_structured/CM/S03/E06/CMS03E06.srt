1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,400
I respect LeBron James.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,400
I admire LeBron James.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,960
But compare him

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,960
to Michael Jordan?

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,760
Come on!

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,760
You only think that

7
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,700
because you're

8
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,700
a Chicago chauvinist.

9
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,930
Oh, no.

10
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,930
No, I'm completely objective.

11
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,670
Stats, clutch playing,

12
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,670
it's Jordan all the way.

13
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,680
Will, you are

14
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,680
a very good doctor,

15
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,270
but very limited on your

16
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,270
understanding of basketball.

17
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,870
Give me a kiss.

18
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,580
Dr. Manning,

19
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,580
radiology called.

20
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,580
Yes.

21
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,280
Your scans are up

22
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,280
on the computer.

23
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,510
Okay.

24
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,510
I got it.

25
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,990
Thank you.

26
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,820
Morning, Connor.

27
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,820
Good morning, Will.

28
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,650
Hey, how's Robin?

29
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,650
She's much better, thanks.

30
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,430
Yeah, she's shopping

31
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,430
like a fiend.

32
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,560
She left me about a foot

33
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,560
of space in the closet,

34
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,400
and three hangers.

35
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,400
Uh-oh.

36
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,770
Excuse me.

37
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,070
Maggie.

38
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,070
Yeah?

39
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,940
Do me a favor. Call CT,

40
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,940
tell them I had to leave.

41
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,540
I'll be back as

42
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,540
soon as I can.

43
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,110
You got it.

44
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,160
Hey, Darren.

45
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,970
Sorry about this, Dr. Rhodes.

46
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,970
No, I appreciate the text.

47
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,100
Where is she?

48
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,100
This way.

49
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,170
Okay.

50
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,040
One of my guys caught her

51
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,040
trying to walk out with this.

52
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,870
Had no idea who she was.

53
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,920
We would have called PD

54
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,920
if your dad hadn't been here.

55
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,970
Appreciate that.

56
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,880
Did you really

57
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,880
have to lock her in?

58
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,860
Standard procedure,

59
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,860
Dr. Rhodes.

60
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
Robin.

61
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,640
I don't know what's

62
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,640
the matter with me.

63
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,570
Shh, come here, come here.

64
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,240
It's gonna

65
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,240
be all right, honey.

66
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,670
It's gonna be all right.

67
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,510
I hear Mama hollering

68
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,510
from the bathroom

69
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,140
and I run in and

70
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,140
find her on the floor.

71
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,710
That's when I called 911.

72
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,950
Told her a bus

73
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,950
would suit me just fine,

74
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,690
instead of wasting all

75
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,690
that money on a ambulance.

76
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,120
Well, I'm glad you did

77
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,120
decide to come in,

78
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,120
Ms. Buckley.

79
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,660
Luckily, it's only

80
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,660
your wrist that's broken,

81
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,560
but your X-ray shows what

82
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,560
we call a Colles' fracture.

83
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,730
So we need to reduce it,

84
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,730
re-align your bones,

85
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,270
and then we can

86
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,270
put you in a splint.

87
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,360
If you say so.

88
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,370
Okay. April, draw up

89
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,370
10 milligrams of lidocaine

90
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,700
for a hematoma block.

91
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,210
So, let me guess. Virginia?

92
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,440
North Carolina.

93
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,440
Mmm.

94
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,510
We've been here 20 years.

95
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,510
Guess the Tar Heel never goes.

96
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,850
You all right?

97
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,850
Yeah, it's nothing.

98
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,990
Okay, now this

99
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,990
is gonna hurt.

100
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,500
So I'm gonna have you take

101
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,500
some deep breaths for me,

102
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,500
okay?

103
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,030
All right, you ready?

104
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,030
Mmm-hmm.

105
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,570
Okay, take a deep breath.

106
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,600
Good job.

107
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,600
Now I'm gonna have you

108
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,040
take one more really big

109
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,040
deep breath for me, okay?

110
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,340
Ready? One, two, three.

111
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,800
Ah!

112
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,570
All right,

113
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,570
the hard part's over.

114
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,210
Great job.

115
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,750
Thank you.

116
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,750
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,650
Orthopedics will be down later

118
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
to set you up

119
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
with a cast, okay?

120
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,320
Thank you.

121
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,320
Sorry. Thank you.

122
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,530
How's Noah doing?

123
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,260
He's gonna have a black eye

124
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,260
for a couple days,

125
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,170
but he'll be okay.

126
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,170
He'll be in later today.

127
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,000
Glad to hear it.

128
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,540
Honey, this is

129
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,540
the encephalitis.

130
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,300
This isn't you.

131
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,850
You don't know how it feels.

132
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,850
It is humiliating.

133
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,440
Things like this,

134
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,440
they're gonna pass.

135
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,540
You know that.

136
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,080
You're already better

137
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,080
than you were a month ago.

138
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,480
Am I though?

139
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,050
Really?

140
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,460
God, I've got to

141
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,460
pull myself together.

142
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,550
Dad.

143
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,070
Thank you for

144
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,070
not calling the cops.

145
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,260
Connor, this friend of yours,

146
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,260
she's a kleptomaniac.

147
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,330
No, she isn't.

148
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,270
She's recovering from

149
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,270
an illness that makes her

150
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,110
do things

151
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,110
she wouldn't otherwise do.

152
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,370
Well, still, you have to

153
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,370
admit she's unstable.

154
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,440
You don't know her.

155
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,380
You don't know

156
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,380
anything about her.

157
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,950
So what she did

158
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,950
was sane, reasonable?

159
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,040
After what happened to Mom,

160
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,550
I would say that

161
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,550
you are the last person

162
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,280
that should be discussing

163
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,280
anybody's mental health.

164
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,420
You're making this

165
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,420
about your mother?

166
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,480
Yes, I am.

167
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,080
She's been gone

168
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,080
for 20 years.

169
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,660
Time to move on,

170
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,660
don't you think?

171
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,360
Yeah,

172
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,360
it took you what, a week?

173
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,330
Okay, listen to me.

174
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,930
If she's not unstable,

175
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,930
she's a criminal.

176
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,640
Either way,

177
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,640
fatherly advice,

178
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,980
get rid of her.

179
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,560
Good morning.

180
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,560
Morning.

181
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,260
Hey, so you and April?

182
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,260
Yeah.

183
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,630
How long has that

184
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,630
been going on?

185
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,640
About six months.

186
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,270
You managed to keep it quiet

187
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,270
for six months in this place?

188
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,440
It wasn't easy.

189
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,340
On several occasions, we came

190
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,340
close to blowing our cover.

191
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,970
Hmm.

192
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,420
Sharon?

193
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,420
Yeah?

194
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,350
I'm a charge nurse,

195
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,350
and I'm hanging IV bags.

196
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,320
I know, Maggie.

197
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,320
You're short-staffed.

198
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,550
For a month. When are we

199
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,550
gonna hire more nurses?

200
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,590
We can't afford it.

201
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,590
It's not in the budget.

202
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,560
Sharon, we are required to

203
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,560
have one nurse for two beds.

204
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,490
That's 12 nurses per shift.

205
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,490
Four shifts, that's 48 nurses.

206
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,060
Right now, I only have 42.

207
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,730
Well, even it out

208
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,730
with overtime.

209
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,130
Time and a half?

210
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,200
How is that supposed

211
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,200
to save us money?

212
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,330
It doesn't,

213
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,330
but overtime

214
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,840
comes out of

215
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,840
a different account.

216
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,740
We still look good.

217
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,740
Work with me.

218
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,440
Dr. Halstead, incoming.

219
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,420
Arlo Littman, 20 years old.

220
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,420
Delusional and combative.

221
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,540
Says he's radioactive.

222
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,060
You can't let anyone

223
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,060
touch me, make them stay away!

224
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,650
Negative on

225
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,650
radiation poisoning.

226
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,130
He hasn't vomited

227
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,130
or been nauseated.

228
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,460
Too agitated to get vitals,

229
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,460
restrained in the field.

230
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,590
He on something?

231
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,150
Roommate says no,

232
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,150
he doesn't do drugs.

233
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,000
No one touch me!

234
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,400
Karen, page Psych.

235
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,870
All right, let's get him

236
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,870
on the bed.

237
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,960
Arlo, I'm Dr. Halstead,

238
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm gonna help you.

239
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,940
I'm death, don't touch me.

240
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,230
Yeah, let's get him

241
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,230
on the bed.

242
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,970
Uh-huh.

243
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,970
One, two, three.

244
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,670
Get away from me, no!

245
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,670
Restraints.

246
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,740
Courtney, get his left leg.

247
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,740
Yup.

248
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,080
You'll die, you will all die!

249
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,380
All right.

250
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,420
Let's move him up

251
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,420
a little bit.

252
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,090
Spontaneous movement in all

253
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,090
four limbs, anyone disagree?

254
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,960
Pupils equal,

255
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,960
round and reactive.

256
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,660
Don't touch me,

257
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,660
save yourselves.

258
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,570
Hey!

259
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,570
Okay, easy, buddy.

260
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,040
Try and relax.

261
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,210
Yeah, I didn't sedate him,

262
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,210
didn't want to over-snow him.

263
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,710
Thought you'd want

264
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,710
to hear his spiel.

265
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,570
Five diazepam,

266
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,570
five olanzapine.

267
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,840
Got it.

268
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,440
Hey, I'm Dr. Charles,

269
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm here to help you.

270
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm death.

271
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,620
Let's get him on

272
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,620
the monitors.

273
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,620
U-tox, blood alcohol,

274
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,620
CBC and CMP.

275
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,950
You want the restraints off?

276
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,950
Eh.

277
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,390
Let's leave them on for now.

278
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,120
See what his state of mind

279
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,120
is when he wakes up.

280
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,630
All right, he's all yours.

281
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,460
Thanks, Will.

282
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,460
Yup.

283
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,560
Initial thoughts?

284
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,340
Schizophrenia usually

285
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,340
manifests at his age.

286
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,500
Mmm-hmm. Doris, could you give

287
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,500
us a second, please?

288
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,000
Sure.

289
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,080
You okay?

290
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,080
Yes.

291
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,950
All right, just making sure

292
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,540
you're comfortable

293
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,540
treating the patient.

294
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,190
Yeah, absolutely.

295
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,560
I'll be here if you need me.

296
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,030
Hey, you.

297
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,540
I got to get back to work.

298
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,850
Uh, there's leftovers

299
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,850
in the fridge, if you want.

300
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,550
Turkey, asparagus...

301
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,550
I'm not hungry.

302
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,450
Robin, you should eat.

303
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,450
You'd feel better.

304
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,250
You take good care of me.

305
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,960
I guess you do that

306
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,960
for all your patients.

307
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

308
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,970
hey, hey, hey, hey.

309
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,700
You are not my patient.

310
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,460
I love you.

311
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,830
Do you?

312
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,830
Because I wouldn't love me.

313
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,040
I'd get rid of me.

314
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,250
Listen, my dad

315
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,250
is a son of a bitch.

316
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,960
He likes to destroy things.

317
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,420
And you,

318
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,420
you like to fix things.

319
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,560
People with blocked arteries

320
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,190
or leaky valves.

321
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,470
Unhinged girlfriends

322
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,470
who like to shoplift.

323
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,530
Meaning?

324
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,940
Wanting to save someone,

325
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
needing to save someone,

326
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,340
it's not the same

327
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,340
as loving.

328
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,380
Robin, your illness,

329
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,380
it gives you

330
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,380
a distorted view of things.

331
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,250
Right.

332
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,250
Unhinged.

333
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,920
No.

334
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,400
It is a matter

335
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,400
of brain chemistry.

336
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,530
And obviously, right now it's

337
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,530
not being addressed properly.

338
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,690
So I am going to

339
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,690
make sure that it is.

340
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,130
You're my knight

341
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,130
in shining armor.

342
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,570
I'll be home

343
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,570
as soon as I can.

344
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,550
And this one, too.

345
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,550
Yep.

346
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,150
Dr. Halstead, you're back on.

347
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,100
You're going

348
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,100
to treatment four.

349
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,100
Hey, Monique?

350
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,890
Jessie Rowe, mid-twenties.

351
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,200
Shortness of breath,

352
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,200
abdominal pain.

353
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,260
I'm her husband.

354
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,700
Okay. I'm Dr. Halstead.

355
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,500
Any idea

356
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,500
what might be causing this?

357
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,060
Something you ate?

358
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,060
Did you fall?

359
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,440
No.

360
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,440
Might be the IVF therapy.

361
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,810
We've been

362
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,810
trying to get pregnant,

363
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,110
Jessie's had

364
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,110
three rounds.

365
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,810
Embryo transfer two weeks ago.

366
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,740
Okay, let's see

367
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,740
what's going on.

368
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,150
I'm hearing a slight crackle.

369
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,150
I got it.

370
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,920
Pam, we need an X-ray in here.

371
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,920
Yes, Maggie.

372
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,120
How long

373
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,120
you been feeling this way?

374
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,480
Been bloated a couple days.

375
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,660
Shortness of breath

376
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,660
just this morning.

377
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,930
Heart rate 86, BP 124/73.

378
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,930
O2 sat's at 93%.

379
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,600
That's a little low.

380
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,600
Put her on a nasal cannula.

381
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,100
Jessie, I'm gonna ultrasound

382
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,100
your belly.

383
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,630
Thank you.

384
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,140
Your ovaries

385
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,140
are somewhat enlarged,

386
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,770
but that can happen after IVF.

387
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,440
Can you tell?

388
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,440
Am I pregnant?

389
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,380
Uh, too early

390
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,380
for that to show.

391
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,810
We need a chest.

392
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,810
Yes, Doctor.

393
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,480
Wait. What if she

394
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,480
is pregnant?

395
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,580
The lead apron

396
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,580
will protect her.

397
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,340
Stand back, everybody.

398
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,620
I'm seeing some congestion

399
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,620
in the lungs,

400
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,250
but not enough to concern me.

401
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
This could all just be

402
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
in response to the IVF,

403
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,190
but we're gonna make sure.

404
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,900
Hopefully you'll

405
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,900
feel better soon.

406
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,630
And we'll all cross

407
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,630
our fingers

408
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,630
the embryo transfer took.

409
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,450
Mr. Janichek, I'm Dr. Choi.

410
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,450
I understand you cut yourself.

411
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,480
Yeah, and maybe someone

412
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,480
can finally tell me why.

413
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,810
I see this isn't

414
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,810
the first time.

415
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,350
It's been happening

416
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,350
a lot lately.

417
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,320
I drop things, I fall down.

418
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,320
It's not like me.

419
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,740
Basic vitals are all normal.

420
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,220
You know, I don't care.

421
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,250
Something's wrong with me,

422
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,250
and no one can

423
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,250
figure out what.

424
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,950
Well, let's take a look, huh?

425
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,030
Put your index finger

426
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,030
and thumb together

427
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,530
to make a circle.

428
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,400
Try not to let me break it.

429
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,930
Good. Relax.

430
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,430
Can you feel this?

431
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,470
This, this, this, this?

432
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,680
Your tendons and nerves

433
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,680
are intact.

434
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,940
A gram of ancef,

435
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,940
draw up lidocaine,

436
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,480
and give me the suture kit.

437
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,480
Yep.

438
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,020
That's it?

439
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,020
You're just gonna sew me up?

440
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,220
Well, I don't see anything

441
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,220
else that needs treating.

442
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,520
You're just like

443
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,520
all the other docs.

444
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,850
You don't care.

445
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,850
You don't listen.

446
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,910
You just want

447
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,910
to get me out of here.

448
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,220
I am listening to you,

449
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,220
Mr. Janichek.

450
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,520
I feel crummy.

451
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,520
Crummy?

452
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,920
Yeah, pretty much

453
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,920
all the time.

454
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,530
Doris, let's get

455
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,530
a CBC and CMP.

456
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,590
Yes, Dr. Choi.

457
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,600
Now can I sew you up?

458
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,030
Hi.

459
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,030
A nurse is gonna come by

460
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,870
to start

461
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,870
your discharge paperwork.

462
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,570
Nance, look up the bus

463
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,570
schedule, will you, hon?

464
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,810
Yeah. Ah!

465
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,810
Honey?

466
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,780
Nancy, are you okay?

467
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,880
Let me check your abdomen,

468
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,880
if you don't mind.

469
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,420
How long have you

470
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,420
had this pain?

471
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,180
Uh, I don't know.

472
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,180
A few days?

473
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,660
Is there anything

474
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,660
in particular

475
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,250
that makes it hurt worse?

476
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,620
Eating, twisting, lying down?

477
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,460
Hurts just the same.

478
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,230
Ah. Oof.

479
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah, seems like

480
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,600
appendicitis to me.

481
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,830
I had my appendix out

482
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,830
when I was 14.

483
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,130
Any other surgeries?

484
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,130
C-section, any kids?

485
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,650
No, I always wanted them,

486
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,650
but it never panned out.

487
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,540
Well, it might be a hernia,

488
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,150
but I'd like

489
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,150
to get you into a bed

490
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,380
and examine you

491
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,380
more thoroughly.

492
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,920
Run some tests.

493
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,120
It's probably

494
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,120
just a bellyache.

495
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,380
Listen to the doctor, hon.

496
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,320
You'll be all right?

497
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,320
Of course.

498
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,420
Well, go on.

499
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,690
Come on.

500
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,760
Thank you. Right this way.

501
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,160
Reese.

502
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,800
When was the last time Robin

503
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,800
had a full work-up?

504
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,500
Just before

505
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,500
she was released from rehab.

506
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,970
That was almost

507
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,970
two months ago.

508
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,940
How about a little

509
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,940
follow-up with your patient?

510
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,110
She is not asymptomatic,

511
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,780
but that's to be expected.

512
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,880
Recovery does not happen

513
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,880
overnight, it's a process...

514
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,150
So you reviewed

515
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,150
her medication?

516
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,750
Yes.

517
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,750
With her neurologist?

518
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,660
And her internist,

519
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,660
and her pharmacist.

520
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,750
I've been monitoring Robin

521
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,750
very carefully.

522
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,730
Maybe somebody else should.

523
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,730
Someone with more experience.

524
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,630
Maybe a little more

525
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,630
familiarity

526
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,630
with her condition.

527
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,000
All right, if Robin

528
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,000
wants to change physicians,

529
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,260
that is her right.

530
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,170
But that should be

531
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,170
her request, not yours.

532
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm bringing her in tomorrow.

533
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,040
She's gonna get

534
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,040
a full neuro work up,

535
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,140
plus labs, plus scans.

536
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,140
Understand?

537
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,740
Jessie, I have news for you.

538
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,790
Some of which will

539
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,790
make you very happy.

540
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,050
So we ran a test

541
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,050
to check on your hCG level...

542
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,820
That's pregnancy hormone...

543
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,660
And it indicates that indeed,

544
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,660
you are pregnant.

545
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,870
That's great!

546
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,870
Honey, we did it.

547
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,230
But?

548
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,770
The other tests show that

549
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,770
you're hemoconcentrated.

550
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,470
And that's a thickening

551
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,470
of the blood.

552
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,040
It's a symptom of

553
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,040
a condition called OHSS,

554
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,370
Ovarian Hyper

555
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,370
Stimulation Syndrome.

556
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,910
Now, this can occur when

557
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,910
the hCG

558
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,910
from the IVF treatments

559
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,440
and your pregnancy interacts

560
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,440
adversely with your estrogen.

561
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,180
So because she got pregnant,

562
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,180
she got sick?

563
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,780
Yes.

564
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,780
Is it serious?

565
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,160
The concern is that

566
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,160
you're more likely to clot.

567
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,160
And possibly throw a clot.

568
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,160
So we'll monitor

569
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,160
you carefully,

570
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,700
but I think we can

571
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,700
resolve the OHSS.

572
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,500
We'll continue to hydrate you,

573
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,500
and start you

574
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,500
on a blood thinner.

575
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,800
So everything's

576
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,800
gonna be fine.

577
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,870
Well, you're still

578
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,870
a little short of breath,

579
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,600
so I'd like to send you

580
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,600
for a CT scan

581
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,910
just to play it safe.

582
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,670
Okay.

583
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,940
All right.

584
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,760
Hey, Barry, you're going to

585
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,760
treatment three.

586
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,850
Doctor Choi?

587
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,850
You guys... You guys are...

588
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,420
Hey, I'm okay.

589
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,550
Thirty-three-year-old male,

590
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,550
found in the park.

591
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,100
Alcohol on the breath,

592
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,100
the GCS is 13.

593
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,070
He's a little groggy,

594
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,070
but improving.

595
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,360
Minor head laceration.

596
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,770
I got it, Barry. Thanks.

597
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,770
You got it.

598
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,700
Mags, how about a nurse?

599
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,710
I have no nurses,

600
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,710
I'll be in in a sec.

601
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,910
This patient.

602
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,910
Indigent, no insurance?

603
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,970
Afraid so.

604
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,640
The hospital's gonna

605
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,640
have to eat up the cost.

606
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
What are you gonna do?

607
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,620
We'll give him the best care

608
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,620
humanly possible,

609
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,590
no expense spared, but you

610
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,590
know, it would sure be nice

611
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,710
to balance patients like him

612
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,710
with a few that

613
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,710
have insurance.

614
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,160
So maybe we can

615
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,160
hire a few nurses.

616
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,210
Maggie...

617
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,730
Next time you're in

618
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,730
the Gold Coast

619
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,920
picking up an MI

620
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,920
with a fat wallet,

621
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,460
how about bringing them here?

622
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,570
Just as close

623
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,570
as anyplace else.

624
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,730
Nancy Buckley's results?

625
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,040
Yeah, it's not a hernia.

626
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,540
It's what I thought,

627
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,540
her CT shows appendicitis.

628
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,600
But her charts said

629
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,600
her appendix was removed

630
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,940
when she was a teenager.

631
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,610
That's not

632
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,610
the only thing that's off.

633
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,450
Tubal ligation clips.

634
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,450
She had her tubes tied.

635
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,220
Why wouldn't she put that

636
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,220
in her history?

637
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,490
Maybe she didn't want

638
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,490
her mom to know.

639
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,030
Might be a touchy

640
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,030
subject for them.

641
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,030
You know what, Nancy said

642
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,030
she always wanted kids.

643
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,590
This doesn't feel right.

644
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,430
Well either way,

645
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,430
she's going to need surgery.

646
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,100
Yeah, on an organ

647
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,100
she thinks she doesn't have.

648
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,070
Ms. Buckley, your scan clearly

649
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,070
shows an inflamed appendix.

650
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,170
We need to get you

651
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,170
up to surgery

652
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,550
right away before it ruptures.

653
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,280
Well, how can it be inflamed?

654
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,650
I had it out when I was a kid,

655
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,650
you saw the scar.

656
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,590
Yeah, I understand that

657
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,590
this is very confusing,

658
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,590
but that scar is actually

659
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,590
from a different procedure.

660
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,990
No, I ain't had

661
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,990
no other surgeries.

662
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,490
Ask my mama, she'll tell you.

663
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,730
Dr. Manning.

664
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,730
BP is 75/20 and dropping.

665
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,800
Ms. Buckley? Nancy?

666
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,500
BP's still dropping.

667
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,500
Heart rate spiking to 145.

668
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,000
Her appendix is ruptured,

669
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,000
we need to get her to surgery.

670
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,570
Get her IV wide open,

671
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,570
and call up to the OR

672
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,270
and tell them

673
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,270
we're on our way.

674
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,270
Let's go!

675
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,550
What's wrong with my Nancy?

676
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,190
I'm afraid we had to

677
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,190
send your daughter up

678
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,950
for an emergency appendectomy.

679
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,650
Appendectomy?

680
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,650
Yes, her appendix burst.

681
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,420
Oh.

682
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,660
Ms. Buckley.

683
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,730
Your daughter believes that

684
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,730
she had her appendix out

685
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,730
when she was 14 years old.

686
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,890
Why would she think that?

687
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,240
That's what the doc

688
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,240
said back then.

689
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,800
Well, she does have a scar,

690
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,600
but it's not from

691
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,600
an appendectomy.

692
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,270
Well, uh...

693
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,300
I don't know what to say.

694
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,780
Her appendix is not the only

695
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,780
thing we saw on her scan.

696
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,810
She was a minor.

697
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,660
You would have

698
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,660
had to give consent.

699
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,530
Back home,

700
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,530
in Blue Ridge country,

701
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,330
I was young and poor

702
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,330
when I had her.

703
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,700
Nancy was a wild teenager,

704
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,700
always getting into trouble.

705
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,910
Finally, this judge who

706
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,910
practically ran the county,

707
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,310
he told me if I wanted

708
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,310
to keep Nancy out of jail,

709
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,280
I had to make a choice.

710
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,980
So you agreed

711
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,980
to have her tubes tied?

712
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,310
The way she was going,

713
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,050
she'd have been pregnant

714
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,050
by the time she was 15,

715
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,290
dropped out of school,

716
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,290
come to nothing.

717
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,560
That was my life.

718
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,960
I wasn't about to see

719
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,960
my daughter turn out the same.

720
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,160
Ms. Buckley,

721
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,200
don't you think your daughter

722
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,200
deserves to know the truth?

723
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,380
Well, I thought about it.

724
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,380
What good would it do?

725
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,380
What's done is done.

726
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,380
She always wanted

727
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,380
to have kids.

728
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,950
Knowing what

729
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,950
her mama did to her

730
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,580
would only

731
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,580
bring her more misery.

732
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,720
Please don't tell her.

733
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,560
Hi, Arlo, I'm Dr. Reese.

734
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,560
I'm here to help you.

735
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,100
Please, don't touch me.

736
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,100
You'll be contaminated.

737
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,370
Uh, contaminated with what?

738
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,840
Radium.

739
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,380
How were you exposed

740
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,380
to radium?

741
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,150
My professor,

742
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,150
he works for the CIA.

743
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,650
He put it in my food.

744
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,220
I see. I see.

745
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,890
Do you mind if I take a seat?

746
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,590
Just don't touch me.

747
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,220
All right.

748
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,030
Be careful.

749
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,540
Arlo, I, uh... I appreciate

750
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,540
your concern for me,

751
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,070
but I understand

752
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,070
the risk that I'm taking.

753
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,880
Uh, I just want to help you,

754
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,880
if you will let me.

755
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,390
My arms hurt.

756
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,320
I'm sorry.

757
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,530
Uh, we can remove

758
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,530
the restraints

759
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,120
if you can stay calm.

760
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,120
Can you do that?

761
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,710
Just don't touch me.

762
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,640
We will only touch

763
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,640
the restraints.

764
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,850
I said be careful!

765
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,720
Okay.

766
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,060
Thank you.

767
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,030
Then make room

768
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,030
in the schedule, okay?

769
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,730
She's getting that

770
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,730
scan tomorrow.

771
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,070
Connor.

772
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,100
You okay?

773
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,110
Yeah, uh...

774
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,080
Robin's not having a good day.

775
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,850
Sorry to hear that.

776
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,750
Look, I need a consult,

777
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,750
but I'll ask someone else.

778
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,230
No, I'm good.

779
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,500
Jessie,

780
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,500
this is Dr. Rhodes.

781
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,040
He's a cardiothoracic surgeon.

782
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,600
What did you find?

783
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,270
So the scans showed us this.

784
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,330
What you're looking at is

785
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,140
a partially obstructing

786
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,140
saddle pulmonary embolism.

787
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,440
It's a blood clot.

788
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,280
Now, because of the

789
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,280
location of the clot,

790
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,750
surgical intervention

791
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,750
may become necessary.

792
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,980
But not yet.

793
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,990
The clot is small,

794
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,990
so I'm hoping that if

795
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,290
we up the dose

796
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,290
of the anticoagulants,

797
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,420
switch to a heparin drip...

798
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,420
Mmm-hmm.

799
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,690
That may take care of it.

800
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,520
Okay.

801
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,790
We'll bring you

802
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,790
back down to the ED

803
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,860
and keep a close eye

804
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,860
on you.

805
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,100
Thanks.

806
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,100
You got it.

807
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,960
Mr. Janichek,

808
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,960
I have your test results,

809
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,340
and everything is normal.

810
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,670
You're mildly anemic,

811
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,670
hemoglobin's at 9.5,

812
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,650
but that'll resolve

813
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,650
if you just eat more red meat.

814
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,700
Nothing else?

815
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,270
You look like

816
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,270
a healthy man to me.

817
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,290
Well, what about my symptoms?

818
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,290
The clumsiness, feeling lousy?

819
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,120
I don't see a medical reason

820
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,120
for any of that.

821
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,480
Have you been getting

822
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,480
enough sleep?

823
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,620
Oh, forget it.

824
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,390
I've been through this

825
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,390
dog and pony show before.

826
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,930
I understand it's frustrating

827
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,560
not to get

828
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,560
a definitive diagnosis.

829
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,330
Just let me get out of here,

830
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,330
that's all you want anyway.

831
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,230
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

832
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,430
I don't want to

833
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,430
send you home

834
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,430
feeling that way.

835
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,140
I can call for

836
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,140
a neuro consult if you want.

837
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,300
Yes, anything.

838
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Okay.

839
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,040
Come in.

840
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,010
Sharon?

841
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,110
Hey.

842
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,710
I've been thinking about

843
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,420
how we can hire

844
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,420
more nurses for the ED.

845
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,620
Maggie,

846
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,620
I've already told you...

847
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,180
I know, I know.

848
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,180
No money.

849
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,460
But if the ED

850
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,460
had more patients,

851
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,060
hopefully with insurance, that

852
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,060
would mean more money, right?

853
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,800
Yeah.

854
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,800
So who brings us patients?

855
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,000
The paramedics. And if they

856
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,000
liked coming to Med,

857
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,070
if they were motivated to come

858
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,070
to Med, that's what they'd do.

859
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,940
They'd bring us more patients.

860
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,810
And how do you propose

861
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,110
to motivate

862
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,110
the paramedics, Maggie?

863
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,780
That's really pretty simple.

864
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,460
Hey. What's going on?

865
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,690
Sorry, um...

866
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,500
Did you know that up until

867
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,500
1973 in North Carolina,

868
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,940
women could get sterilized

869
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,600
without their knowledge

870
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,600
or consent?

871
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,270
My patient had

872
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,270
her daughter's tubes tied

873
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,500
when she was 14.

874
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,500
Fourteen.

875
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,570
All because a judge thought

876
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,570
it would be good for her.

877
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,510
Man.

878
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,410
The daughter always

879
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,410
wanted to have kids,

880
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,850
and never knew

881
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,850
why she couldn't.

882
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,720
She never went to a doctor?

883
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,720
No, too poor.

884
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,190
Can you believe

885
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,190
they could do that?

886
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,780
Deprive a woman of her ability

887
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,780
to have children,

888
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,590
something so fundamental.

889
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,150
This woman

890
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,150
who was sterilized...

891
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,600
How do you break

892
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,600
news like that?

893
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,230
I'm asking myself

894
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,230
the same thing.

895
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,370
Mr. Janichek's not exhibiting

896
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,370
any neurologic deficits.

897
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,500
And what about

898
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,500
his clumsiness?

899
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,670
Awfully vague complaint,

900
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,670
hardly warranted a consult.

901
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,240
It's just

902
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,240
the patient's desperate.

903
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,410
He insists there's something

904
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,410
wrong with him.

905
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,710
Since when

906
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,710
do we listen to patients?

907
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,340
Maybe some sort of

908
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,340
heavy metal poisoning,

909
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,050
lead or mercury...

910
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,050
Dr. Choi,

911
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,920
if you want to waste the time

912
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,920
and money ordering

913
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,920
those tests,

914
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,960
you be my guest,

915
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,960
but I'm done here.

916
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,830
I just got a call

917
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,830
from Robin.

918
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,920
She was arrested

919
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,920
for shoplifting?

920
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,560
No, she wasn't arrested.

921
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,800
She got caught trying

922
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,800
to leave the store,

923
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,170
but I took care of it.

924
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,100
Well, apparently it's been

925
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,100
going on for a while, though.

926
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,440
I realize that now,

927
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,440
but I had no idea.

928
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,470
Have there been any signs?

929
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,470
Like, at home, or...

930
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,810
Dr. Charles, a woman has new

931
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,810
clothes and that's suspicious?

932
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,950
She's not a prisoner,

933
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,950
I can't keep her locked up.

934
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,380
She's got a life of her own.

935
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,620
I have a patient to see.

936
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,090
Connor, I appreciate that

937
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,090
you're doing the best you can,

938
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,760
but given the

939
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,760
all-consuming nature of...

940
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,800
Dr. Charles,

941
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,800
Robin and I are fine.

942
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,990
I'm gonna see her

943
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,990
through this.

944
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,160
Will?

945
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,800
Heart rate's 140,

946
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,800
BP's down to 90/70.

947
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,140
Keith.

948
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,140
I'm right here, honey.

949
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,640
O2 sat's down to 85.

950
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,610
Heparin's not working.

951
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,610
She's continuing to embolize.

952
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,510
She's in respiratory failure.

953
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,510
Why? What's happening?

954
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,380
The clot in her lung

955
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,380
has progressed.

956
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,210
It's cutting off blood flow

957
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,210
and straining her heart.

958
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,680
BP's down to 60/30.

959
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,680
Sat's at 75.

960
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,420
Okay, we need to intubate.

961
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,420
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

962
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,680
Maybe you want

963
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,680
to wait outside?

964
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,220
No, I'm not leaving her.

965
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,550
All right, tell the OR

966
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,550
we're on the way up

967
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,250
and to prep the hybrid room.

968
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,250
Yes, Doctor.

969
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,760
Your wife needs surgery now.

970
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,390
We need to remove the clot

971
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,390
from her pulmonary artery,

972
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,830
otherwise it could kill her.

973
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,390
Just save her, please!

974
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm in.

975
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,900
All right, let's go.

976
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,810
We're in a good position.

977
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,340
Let's start the extraction.

978
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,340
Pressure's a little soft,

979
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,340
80/50.

980
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,480
I've been working on that.

981
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,890
Gas looks fine, but I've given

982
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,890
a half liter of crystalloid

983
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,220
to minimum effect.

984
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,220
Starting Neo now.

985
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,450
You let in the anesthetic?

986
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,450
Already done.

987
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,120
She's still dropping.

988
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,400
The catheter must be

989
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,400
obstructing the outflow tract.

990
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,560
Her heart's failing,

991
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,560
we need to open her chest.

992
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,230
Bring in the bypass machine.

993
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,230
Marty, start a second pressor

994
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,730
to buy me some time.

995
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,570
I put in the catheter,

996
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,570
did I make a mistake?

997
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,900
Nope, it's not your fault,

998
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,900
it happens sometimes.

999
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,310
Scalpel and sternal saw.

1000
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,310
Let's move.

1001
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,540
Sternal saw.

1002
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,320
I'm just out of control.

1003
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,510
It's okay.

1004
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,760
It's okay, it's okay.

1005
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,450
I don't know what to do.

1006
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,400
And I feel like

1007
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,400
I will never get past this.

1008
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,560
What, your illness?

1009
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,560
Of course you will.

1010
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,560
You just... You've had

1011
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,560
a setback.

1012
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,560
That's all it is.

1013
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,270
No, Dad. It's more than that.

1014
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,800
It's about

1015
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,800
what I have become to Connor.

1016
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,280
And to everyone, it's like

1017
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,280
I'm someone to be pitied.

1018
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,870
Or taken care of.

1019
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,870
And I am drowning.

1020
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,150
No, no, honey.

1021
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,150
Come here, sweetie.

1022
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,350
It's okay, I'm here.

1023
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,120
I'm gonna help you, okay?

1024
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,120
No, Dad.

1025
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,890
Don't you see that

1026
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,890
I don't want to be helped?

1027
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,690
I am tired of being a disease.

1028
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,530
I want to be a person again.

1029
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,530
Okay.

1030
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,030
Okay, so, um,

1031
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,800
so how you want to do that?

1032
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,580
Mr. Rowe.

1033
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,250
So we tried to remove the clot

1034
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,250
from your wife's lung

1035
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,790
with a minimally

1036
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,790
invasive procedure.

1037
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,330
Unfortunately, her heart

1038
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,330
couldn't tolerate it,

1039
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,760
so we did have

1040
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,760
to open her chest.

1041
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,260
Now, the important thing is,

1042
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,530
we were able to remove

1043
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,530
the clot successfully.

1044
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,440
Her pulmonary artery pressures

1045
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,440
have already come down,

1046
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,470
and I have

1047
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,470
every reason to believe

1048
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,200
that she's gonna make

1049
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,200
a quick and full recovery.

1050
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,240
And the baby?

1051
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,480
No indication that

1052
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,480
the pregnancy was affected.

1053
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,090
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

1054
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,200
I don't know what else to say.

1055
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,140
Keith.

1056
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,840
I'm right here, honey.

1057
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,140
You're gonna be fine.

1058
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,820
It's all good.

1059
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,990
Great.

1060
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,990
Thanks, Connor.

1061
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,790
Nice people.

1062
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,390
Yeah, they've really

1063
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,390
been put through it today.

1064
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,330
Kinda makes you realize

1065
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,430
how small your

1066
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,430
own problems are, huh?

1067
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,770
And that sometimes,

1068
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,770
things work out.

1069
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,010
Who's got three?

1070
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,010
Where's Monique? Monique?

1071
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,050
I need you to turn over three

1072
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,050
and get it cleaned up.

1073
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,180
Here are the files, here.

1074
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,340
Yes, ma'am.

1075
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,340
Oh!

1076
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,820
Ladies and gentleman,

1077
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,820
by unanimous decision,

1078
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,380
and still retaining his title

1079
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,790
as welterweight champion

1080
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,790
of the world,

1081
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,830
Noah "The Doctor" Sexton!

1082
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,630
Welcome back.

1083
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,200
Are you sure

1084
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,200
you should be at work?

1085
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,940
You don't look very good.

1086
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,570
Thanks.

1087
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,570
You look good.

1088
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,710
She's doing well.

1089
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,260
They're weaning her sedation

1090
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,260
and should extubate soon.

1091
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Good.

1092
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Now here comes the hard part.

1093
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,320
You mean

1094
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,320
you're gonna tell her?

1095
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,360
It's her body, April.

1096
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,520
It's her life.

1097
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,520
She has every right to know.

1098
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,190
These two women

1099
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,190
only have each other.

1100
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,600
We drop this on Nancy, she may

1101
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,600
never forgive her mother.

1102
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,410
I understand, but we are

1103
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,410
legally bound to tell her.

1104
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,770
We're gonna

1105
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,770
destroy this family

1106
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,680
over something they

1107
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,680
can't do anything about?

1108
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,310
That is for Nancy to decide.

1109
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,210
She has been denied a choice

1110
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,210
her entire life.

1111
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,550
We cannot change her past,

1112
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,610
but at least we can give her

1113
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,610
a say in her future.

1114
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,620
Seventy-five inches?

1115
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,620
Sixty wasn't big enough?

1116
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,560
You know how it is.

1117
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,560
It's never big enough.

1118
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,530
Accounting is gonna

1119
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,530
raise hell.

1120
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,430
Well, we've got to spend

1121
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,430
money to make money, right?

1122
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,230
Eh, well, let's hope so.

1123
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
Mmm-hmm.

1124
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
This for the doctor's lounge?

1125
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,440
This way.

1126
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,440
Nope.

1127
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,310
I'm sorry,

1128
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,310
it's for the pizza room.

1129
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,670
What's a pizza room?

1130
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,670
Motivational tool.

1131
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,640
Has he been agitated?

1132
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,640
No.

1133
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,250
Any need to put him

1134
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,250
back in restraints?

1135
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,180
No.

1136
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,690
Good, let's transfer him up

1137
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,690
to the psych ward.

1138
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,720
Do you want to examine him

1139
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,720
before we do?

1140
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,190
Uh, no, no.

1141
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,190
I'll check on him upstairs.

1142
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,730
Okay.

1143
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,430
Hey.

1144
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,690
Sarah.

1145
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,870
I got this patient in six...

1146
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,470
Ataxia, clumsiness,

1147
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,470
general malaise.

1148
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,480
I can't find anything,

1149
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,480
and Abrams cleared him.

1150
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,950
Do you want a psych consult?

1151
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,480
The guy's convinced

1152
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,480
he's sick,

1153
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,110
and wasn't happy when

1154
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,110
his labs came back normal.

1155
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,280
Adamant we keep testing.

1156
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,460
Maybe factitious disorder,

1157
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,460
likes being in the hospital,

1158
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,220
doted on, needs people

1159
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,220
to believe he's sick.

1160
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,120
Want to take a run at him?

1161
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,820
Otherwise, I got

1162
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,820
no reason to keep him.

1163
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,920
Sure.

1164
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,630
Thanks.

1165
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,340
Mr. Janichek? I'm Dr. Reese.

1166
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,310
I'd like to ask you

1167
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,310
a few questions.

1168
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,640
What kind of doctor are you?

1169
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,640
I am a psychiatrist.

1170
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,780
A shrink?

1171
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,780
You think I'm crazy?

1172
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,010
No, we just can't find

1173
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,010
a, uh, physical reason

1174
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,110
for the symptoms

1175
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,110
you're describing.

1176
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,150
Which means you think

1177
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,150
I'm crazy or I'm making it up.

1178
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,380
No, we just want to explore

1179
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,380
all the possibilities.

1180
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,430
I don't believe you people.

1181
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,430
I'm a sick man.

1182
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,290
I come here looking for help,

1183
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,290
and no one believes me.

1184
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,860
How many doctors

1185
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,860
do I have to go to?

1186
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,400
Mr. Janichek,

1187
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,400
please back away.

1188
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,130
What do I have to do, huh?

1189
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,130
Why won't you help me?

1190
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,570
Mr. Janichek!

1191
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,070
Sarah, what happened?

1192
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,070
My eyes!

1193
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,840
She sprayed me!

1194
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,840
Oh, my God.

1195
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,480
Get me some water.

1196
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,070
Ah, my eyes!

1197
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,440
Sarah, you should go.

1198
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,810
Go!

1199
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,290
Mr. Janichek, just try to

1200
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,290
breathe normally, okay?

1201
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,460
Dr. Charles isn't answering.

1202
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,400
Where are we on this,

1203
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,400
Dr. Choi?

1204
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,940
We flushed

1205
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,940
Mr. Janichek's eyes.

1206
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,600
There's no sign

1207
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,600
of external injury.

1208
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,540
His vitals are stable.

1209
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,540
He's lucid.

1210
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,440
And extremely pissed off.

1211
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,540
A doctor attacking a patient,

1212
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,540
really?

1213
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,480
Go on, Dr. Choi.

1214
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,140
Mr. Janichek

1215
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,140
hit the gurney when he fell,

1216
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,590
so we're ordering

1217
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,590
an abdominal CT

1218
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,020
to make sure there's no

1219
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,020
internal injuries.

1220
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:25,120
Did he hit his head?

1221
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:25,120
Are you ordering a head scan?

1222
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,690
There's no head injury.

1223
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,690
No indication of concussion.

1224
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,890
Dr. Choi,

1225
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,890
this is CYA time.

1226
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,290
It's bad enough he sues us

1227
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,290
for the pepper spray.

1228
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,890
If we miss something...

1229
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,630
Order a pan scan.

1230
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,930
Yes, ma'am.

1231
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,930
Thank you, Dr. Choi.

1232
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,970
Dr. Stohl, Peter.

1233
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,770
Can you give me any

1234
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,770
explanation for your behavior?

1235
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,880
I'm sorry.

1236
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,390
Dr. Reese, you're suspended

1237
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,390
until further notice.

1238
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,100
I need your pass.

1239
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,270
Go home.

1240
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,480
So this is what?

1241
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,480
A ploy to woo the paramedics?

1242
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,350
Pretty much, yeah.

1243
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,150
It'll work.

1244
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,360
Mmm, pepperoni and sausage.

1245
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,730
Mmm-hmm.

1246
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,730
Nice.

1247
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,090
Mmm!

1248
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,600
Sterilized?

1249
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,980
When?

1250
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,980
But how?

1251
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,540
When you were 14.

1252
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,850
When they said they were

1253
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,850
taking out your appendix,

1254
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,280
they were actually

1255
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,280
doing a procedure

1256
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,320
called tubal ligation.

1257
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,190
Your tubes were tied.

1258
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,190
They did this

1259
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,190
without asking me?

1260
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,930
Did Mama know?

1261
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,960
You'll have to ask her that.

1262
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,160
Oh, my God.

1263
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,270
I'll give you two some time.

1264
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,660
How could she ever

1265
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,660
forgive her mom?

1266
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,110
I lost my baby,

1267
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,110
but I can still have another.

1268
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
If that were

1269
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
taken away from me,

1270
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,770
I don't know

1271
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,770
that I could forgive.

1272
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,280
I don't know.

1273
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,110
People can

1274
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,110
sometimes surprise you.

1275
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,970
Robin?

1276
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,700
Robin?

1277
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,600
Thanks, Dad.

1278
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,270
It's gonna be

1279
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,270
very hard on Connor.

1280
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,170
He cares about you a lot.

1281
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,270
I know.

1282
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,270
But I have to do this.

1283
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,270
I have to get away.

1284
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,220
Gonna miss you.

1285
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,490
I'm gonna

1286
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,490
miss you, too, Dad.

1287
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,700
Make sure you remember to say

1288
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,700
hi to your mom for me, okay?

1289
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,920
Goodbye, honey.

1290
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,630
Bye, Dad.

1291
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,640
Come in.

1292
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,710
Mr. Janichek's scans were

1293
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,710
negative for concussion

1294
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,910
or any other acute injury.

1295
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,790
All right,

1296
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,790
dodged that bullet.

1297
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,350
But we did notice

1298
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,350
something else

1299
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,160
unrelated to his

1300
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,160
being sprayed.

1301
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,090
An enlarged spleen?

1302
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,130
Yes.

1303
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,130
This our fault?

1304
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,960
No.

1305
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,560
I ordered an enzyme activity

1306
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,560
level test to follow up.

1307
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,130
It showed Mr. Janichek

1308
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,130
is suffering

1309
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,500
from a genetic disorder

1310
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,500
called Gaucher's disease.

1311
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,010
An enzyme deficiency

1312
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,010
which presents

1313
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,570
with a vague

1314
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,570
constellation of symptoms,

1315
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,310
malaise, anemia,

1316
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,310
low platelets.

1317
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,110
Please tell me

1318
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,110
there's a treatment.

1319
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,450
Because we cannot

1320
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,450
assault a man

1321
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,610
and then inform him he has

1322
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,610
an incurable disease.

1323
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,550
His spleen

1324
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,550
is dangerously enlarged,

1325
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,220
so it has to be removed,

1326
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,280
but the deficiency itself

1327
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,280
is easily treatable

1328
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,090
with regular

1329
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,090
enzyme replacement infusions.

1330
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,820
All right.

1331
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,820
You'll inform the patient.

1332
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,060
Yes, ma'am.

1333
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,060
Thank you.

1334
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,670
I should say

1335
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,670
that Mr. Janichek

1336
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,470
will find this

1337
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,470
to be good news.

1338
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,200
A genetic disease?

1339
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,930
He's been suffering

1340
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,930
a long time,

1341
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,470
unable to find a diagnosis.

1342
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,410
In fact, I was ready

1343
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,410
to send him home.

1344
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,140
We never would have ordered

1345
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,140
that pan scan

1346
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,850
if Dr. Reese

1347
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,850
hadn't done what she did.

1348
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,680
She might have saved his life.

1349
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,300
Hey.

1350
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,010
I got home,

1351
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,010
and I found this from Robin.

1352
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,630
Did you know that

1353
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,630
she was planning on leaving?

1354
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,580
Connor, she just made

1355
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,580
the decision today.

1356
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,610
She doesn't feel like

1357
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,610
she can get well here.

1358
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,310
And nobody thought to

1359
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,310
involve me in this discussion?

1360
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,780
Well, she didn't

1361
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,780
want to tell you

1362
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,250
because she knew

1363
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,250
you'd try and change her mind.

1364
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,010
You're damn right I would!

1365
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,520
Where is she?

1366
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,620
It's really up to Robin

1367
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,620
to reveal that, I think.

1368
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,220
No, you have no right

1369
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,220
to keep this from me.

1370
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,820
She asked me not to tell you.

1371
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,730
Look, Connor,

1372
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,730
she promised me she'd call you

1373
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,360
as soon as she is

1374
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,360
feeling better.

1375
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,420
Oh, man, I bet you love this,

1376
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,420
don't you?

1377
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,930
What?

1378
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,930
You didn't want me

1379
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,990
to be with her

1380
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,990
in the first place.

1381
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,130
You didn't think

1382
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,130
I was good for her.

1383
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,370
In fact, I bet this was

1384
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,370
all your idea.

1385
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,070
Connor, whatever reservations

1386
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,070
I had about your relationship

1387
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,270
are long past, okay?

1388
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,710
I promise you,

1389
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,710
this was all Robin's decision.

1390
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,270
Fine. I don't care

1391
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,540
if you don't want

1392
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,540
to tell me where she is,

1393
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,810
because I'm gonna find her,

1394
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,650
and I'm gonna

1395
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,650
bring her back.

1396
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,970
Hey, Dr. Charles.

1397
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,740
Thanks, Noah.

1398
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,600
What have I done?
