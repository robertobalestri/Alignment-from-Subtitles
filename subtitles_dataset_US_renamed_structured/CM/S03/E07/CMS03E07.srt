1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,430
Is Owen asleep?

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,200
Yep, coast is clear.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,510
See you in the morning.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,610
See you in the morning.

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,000
So I bought a ticket

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,000
for Minneapolis.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,290
I'm heading out tonight.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,630
Really?

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,500
We'll see what she has

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,500
to say face-to-face.

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,500
Connor, you sure that you

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,500
don't want to...

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,600
I don't know, just, uh,

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,170
think about

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,170
letting it go?

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,070
I'm sorry, Dr. Charles.

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,880
I love your daughter.

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm not going to lose her.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,520
Get it away from me!

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,890
Dr. Choi, Dr. Manning!

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,890
You're going to Three.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,250
I got LeAnn Crawford, 22,

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,390
found attached

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,390
to her newborn

25
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,390
on the sidewalk

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,760
in a pool of blood.

27
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,460
Combative in the field.

28
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,460
I couldn't cut the cord.

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,060
Drugs?

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,060
Wouldn't surprise me.

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,730
Get it away from me!

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,130
Ma'am, this is your baby.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,830
Oh, no, it's a...

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,830
It's a monster.

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,600
She may be in withdrawal.

36
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,600
I need four milligrams

37
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,660
of Versed, IV.

38
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,660
On it.

39
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,900
Not until we cut the cord.

40
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,100
Please get this thing

41
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,100
away from me!

42
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,040
Let's get her in restraints!

43
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,040
Ma'am, I need you to

44
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,880
listen to me.

45
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,880
Get it away!

46
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,540
Whoa, she tore the cord!

47
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,080
All right, let's transfer

48
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,080
on my count.

49
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,760
Ready?

50
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,760
One, two, three.

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,660
Give her the Versed.

52
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,660
She's bleeding out.

53
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,990
We've got to deliver

54
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,990
this placenta now.

55
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,830
No, it's a monster!

56
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,460
Kill it. Kill it.

57
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,660
Baby's temp is 94.

58
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,660
I need more blankets!

59
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,670
Versed's in!

60
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,670
Let's start an IV.

61
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,140
Get two units of O neg

62
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,140
on the rapid transfuser

63
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,190
and start the MTP.

64
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,500
Vitals at 86.

65
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,540
Turn the O2 up

66
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,540
to 10 liters.

67
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,100
I got the placenta.

68
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,740
Heart rate's down.

69
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,740
Pressure's stable.

70
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,410
Baby's starting

71
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,410
to pink up.

72
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,280
Hey. Hey, listen to me.

73
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,150
You just had a baby.

74
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,320
That's your baby.

75
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,850
Baby?

76
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,050
Call Child

77
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,050
and Family Services.

78
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,460
No way she's taking

79
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,460
this baby home.

80
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,330
Baby? Baby?

81
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,310
Okay.

82
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,320
Temperature's back

83
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,320
to 98.

84
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,510
I'll be back to check on him

85
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,510
in a little bit.

86
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,740
Poor thing.

87
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,820
Let me know

88
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,820
if anything changes.

89
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,660
Hey, how's the mom?

90
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,390
Better, apparently,

91
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,390
after a little methadone.

92
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,190
I'm gonna talk to her

93
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,190
about detox.

94
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,800
Tox screen showed heroin.

95
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,360
Great. Odds are the baby's

96
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,360
going to have the same result.

97
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,430
Eh, never know.

98
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,170
Might be a high-stress user.

99
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,230
Baby could be fine.

100
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,230
Maybe.

101
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,410
Ms. Crawford?

102
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,950
I'm Dr. Charles. Uh...

103
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,920
Glad to see you're doing

104
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,920
a little better.

105
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,950
Anything we can get you?

106
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,950
Something to drink?

107
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,680
I just want to go.

108
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,310
I don't blame you,

109
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,310
but we do need to make sure

110
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,050
that you're stable first.

111
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,020
So, you do understand that

112
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,020
the DCFS is on the way

113
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,030
to arrange a custodian

114
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,030
for your child?

115
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,220
Yeah.

116
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,460
Okay.

117
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,030
I was looking

118
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,030
at your tox screen

119
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,030
and I'm just curious.

120
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,400
How long have you

121
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,400
been using for?

122
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,700
Roughly?

123
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,440
The reason I ask is that

124
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,140
we do have a number

125
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,140
of programs here

126
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,770
at the hospital that are...

127
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,770
That are available to you.

128
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,150
One particular, um...

129
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,080
I said

130
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,080
I just want to go.

131
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,850
I understand that, but this

132
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,850
would be an opportunity...

133
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,150
Dr. Charles, can I talk

134
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,150
to you for a second?

135
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,210
Yeah.

136
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,160
Uh, get some rest.

137
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,030
I'll, uh, check in

138
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,030
with you later.

139
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,130
You're wasting your time.

140
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,230
You do understand

141
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,230
that we have an obligation

142
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,000
to try and get addicts

143
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,000
into a program

144
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,800
before they leave

145
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,800
the hospital?

146
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,800
Yeah, but clearly,

147
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,210
she doesn't want our help.

148
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,210
We don't know that.

149
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,010
We almost never get through

150
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,010
on the first shot.

151
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,770
She won't even talk to you,

152
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,770
Dr. Charles.

153
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,510
Ethan, somebody puts up

154
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,510
a wall like that,

155
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,140
they're usually trying

156
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,140
to protect something.

157
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,220
That's often worth

158
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,220
chipping away at.

159
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,990
Barry.

160
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,320
Can you not see

161
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,320
that I'm working?

162
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm just trying to get

163
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,160
a closer look.

164
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,440
Observing the charge nurse

165
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,440
in her natural habitat.

166
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,070
Aren't the paramedics

167
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,070
supposed to drop off

168
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,070
their patients and leave?

169
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,940
Not paramedics

170
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,940
with an agenda.

171
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,040
Mmm.

172
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,980
Have dinner with me tonight.

173
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,240
My answer's the same

174
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,240
as it was last time...

175
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,110
No.

176
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,250
Why not?

177
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,690
We went out for drinks.

178
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,780
Right, drinks.

179
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,390
That's not a date.

180
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,050
Having dinner is dating,

181
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,390
and we are not

182
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,390
having dinner.

183
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, not yet.

184
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,530
It's not even lunchtime.

185
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,770
Hey, Miss Dempsey.

186
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,770
Mr. Goodwin.

187
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,170
Dr. Halstead.

188
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,170
Haven't seen you in a while.

189
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,870
What's going on?

190
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,870
Still no cure

191
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,670
for supranuclear palsy,

192
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,670
as you can see.

193
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,540
But we do therapy

194
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,540
three times a week

195
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,520
and try to get

196
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,520
around the block

197
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,520
every night after dinner.

198
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,640
That's good.

199
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,840
Let's get you onto

200
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,840
the bed here.

201
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,220
Oh.

202
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,850
I see they keep

203
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,850
making these things

204
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,150
higher and higher.

205
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,060
Yeah, it's completely

206
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,060
unacceptable.

207
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,360
I'll look

208
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,360
into it immediately.

209
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,400
How long have you had

210
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,400
that cough?

211
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,060
A few days now.

212
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,070
Temp's 103.

213
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,200
Has the palsy been making it

214
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,200
harder to swallow?

215
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,200
Uh, yeah, in the last

216
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,200
couple of months.

217
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,210
Bert keeps

218
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,210
making me smoothies,

219
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,540
but I sneak in a granola bar

220
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,540
every now and then.

221
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,080
Lean forward for me,

222
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,080
would you?

223
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,550
Sure.

224
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,990
Yeah, you're pretty

225
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,990
clogged up.

226
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,430
Wouldn't surprise me

227
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,430
if something went down

228
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,430
the wrong tube

229
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,490
and turned

230
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,490
into a pneumonia.

231
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,050
Well, you can treat that,

232
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,050
can't you?

233
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,600
Yes. I'm gonna start you

234
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,600
on some antibiotics

235
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,900
while we wait for

236
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,900
the culture results,

237
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,230
but for right now,

238
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,270
you do nothing,

239
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,270
and I'll be back soon.

240
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,430
I can do that.

241
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,530
Good.

242
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,610
Dr. Halstead?

243
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,050
I know she has

244
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,050
a degenerative disease,

245
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,450
and that I won't have her

246
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,450
forever, but, uh,

247
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
her mind's all there.

248
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,750
I want to be able

249
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,750
to take her home.

250
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,090
I promise I'm gonna do

251
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,090
everything I can.

252
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,420
Thank you.

253
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,130
Hey, dinner tonight?

254
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,190
Can't.

255
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,600
Going to watch

256
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,600
Noah's hockey game.

257
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,540
I know that stuff's

258
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,540
not a big deal to you,

259
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,870
but it's important to me.

260
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,470
"That stuff"? You mean

261
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,470
adult rec league sports?

262
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,140
I mean family.

263
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,100
Why do you think family's

264
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,100
not a big deal to me?

265
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,650
I don't know.

266
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,650
You never talk about them.

267
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,150
There's nothing

268
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,150
to talk about.

269
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,380
Okay.

270
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,550
Hey, Ava.

271
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,830
Can you cover

272
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,830
for me tomorrow?

273
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,120
Sure. Are you getting sick?

274
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,990
No, I'm headed

275
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,990
to Minneapolis.

276
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,690
That sounds even worse.

277
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,690
Why are you going there?

278
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,730
Oh, is that where Robin

279
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,730
moved to?

280
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,060
Yeah, it is.

281
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,070
So, this is what,

282
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,070
a misguided attempt

283
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,070
to win her back?

284
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,070
Forget I asked.

285
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,070
No, I'm happy to do it,

286
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,340
mostly because

287
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,340
I find your gift

288
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,340
for self-flagellation

289
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,340
fascinating.

290
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,610
What is that

291
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,610
supposed to mean?

292
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,380
Just that, from what

293
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,380
I gather, this sounds like

294
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,380
a fool's errand.

295
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,640
CT's own Dr. Phil?

296
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,640
Thank you.

297
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,210
Dr. who?

298
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,310
Dr. Rhodes, CFD just called.

299
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,250
They've got a man trapped

300
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,250
in a collapsed building

301
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
and need a surgeon.

302
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
You're on trauma today?

303
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,950
I am.

304
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,950
Good.

305
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,390
Ambo's waiting

306
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,390
to take you there right now,

307
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,160
and take Dr. Bekker, too.

308
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,630
You could use

309
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,630
a second pair of hands.

310
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,190
She is CT.

311
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,190
How about one of the other

312
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,190
trauma surgeons?

313
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,360
I'm already losing you.

314
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,770
I can't afford

315
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,770
to lose another.

316
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,830
I'll let Dr. Latham know

317
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,830
where you are.

318
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,160
Let's move it.

319
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,300
You wanted to see me?

320
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,640
Yeah, uh,

321
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,640
what's the status

322
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,980
on Dr. Reese's probation?

323
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,280
Well, she's been doing

324
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,280
daily individualized therapy

325
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,050
and a course

326
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,050
in hospital safety,

327
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,180
so she should be

328
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,180
in good shape

329
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,180
to start back up.

330
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,250
Uh, good.

331
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,250
I'd like you to give me

332
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,350
a detailed progress report

333
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,350
once she returns to work.

334
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,520
Well, actually, I'm not going

335
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,520
to be supervising her anymore.

336
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,720
She's going to be working

337
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,720
under Dr. Chapman.

338
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,950
Why?

339
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,460
Under my supervision,

340
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,460
Dr. Reese

341
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,590
assaulted a patient

342
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,590
with pepper spray.

343
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,200
You know, and... I don't know.

344
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,200
My clinical approach

345
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,170
might have had something

346
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,170
to do with it, so...

347
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,110
I just think for now,

348
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,110
Dr. Chapman might be

349
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,110
a better fit.

350
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,440
Okay.

351
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,440
Whatever you think is best.

352
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,500
Okay.

353
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,480
Uh, Sharon, I heard that...

354
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,070
That Bert's back

355
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,070
in the hospital today.

356
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,180
Yeah, I heard that, too.

357
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,360
Dr. Manning.

358
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,530
What's going on?

359
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,530
He's inconsolable.

360
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,690
I've tried rocking him,

361
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,690
swaddling him,

362
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,230
singing.

363
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,230
Nothing I do calms him down.

364
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
Oh, hi.

365
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,170
Heart rate's in the 190s.

366
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,970
O2 sats have been dropping.

367
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,370
Has he been feeding?

368
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,700
No, nothing.

369
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,170
Is it possible he's still

370
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,170
in shock from the cold?

371
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,570
I don't think so.

372
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,710
I'll go see

373
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,710
if his labs are back.

374
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,580
That won't be necessary.

375
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,840
He's addicted to heroin.

376
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
He's going

377
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
through withdrawal.

378
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,920
Shh.

379
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,090
I heard about the baby.

380
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,730
Neonatal abstinence syndrome.

381
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,030
That's a...

382
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,030
That's a rough road.

383
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,660
Yeah, I'm giving him

384
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,660
fluids, Ativan,

385
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,210
and aspiration precautions,

386
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,610
but his numbers

387
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,610
aren't getting any better.

388
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,200
How's the mom?

389
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,210
Just wants to get out

390
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,210
and get her next fix.

391
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,270
Why?

392
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,440
Studies show that babies

393
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,440
who are not thriving

394
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,110
actually do

395
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,110
significantly better

396
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,410
when they have

397
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,410
physical contact

398
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,410
with their biological mothers.

399
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,420
So?

400
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,420
So I think we should

401
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,980
have LeAnn hold him

402
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,980
for a little bit.

403
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,320
You can't be serious.

404
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,320
She tried to kill him.

405
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,360
She would be supervised.

406
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,120
Even hearing

407
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,120
the mother's heartbeat

408
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,790
can lower cortisol levels

409
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,790
and stress.

410
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,730
LeAnn had nine months

411
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,730
to do right by her baby.

412
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,730
She lost that chance.

413
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Dr. Charles...

414
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Well, I appreciate

415
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,140
your concern for your...

416
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,140
For your patient,

417
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,140
Dr. Manning,

418
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,640
but I'm also

419
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,640
concerned for mine,

420
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,170
and here's the problem.

421
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,370
That baby's going home

422
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,370
with somebody else.

423
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,730
We let LeAnn bond with him,

424
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,730
and then just rip him away?

425
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,410
Any chance we have

426
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,410
of helping her,

427
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,410
pretty much gone for good.

428
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,210
Dr. Charles, we're talking

429
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,210
about an infant's life.

430
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,150
I'm aware of that,

431
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,150
but I just think that

432
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,160
we should take a beat

433
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,160
and look at all sides of this.

434
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,660
Excuse me, Dr. Manning.

435
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,390
DCFS is on their way.

436
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,760
They've got some

437
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,760
foster parents

438
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,800
that might be interested

439
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,800
in caring for your patient.

440
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,330
Good.

441
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,330
Um, just have them give me

442
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,330
a little bit of time.

443
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,230
Okay? Um, the baby's

444
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,230
not stable yet.

445
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,060
I'll do my best.

446
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,060
Thank you.

447
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,270
Oh, hey, Sharon.

448
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,070
Hello, Bert.

449
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,200
Uh, how's Miss Dempsey doing?

450
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,270
Well, hopefully,

451
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,270
we'll be out of here soon.

452
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,110
Dr. Halstead's

453
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,110
on top of it.

454
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,670
Well, that's good.

455
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,310
And how are you doing?

456
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,680
Me? I'm, you know,

457
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,680
the same,

458
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,220
hanging in there,

459
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,220
trying to help as best I can.

460
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,120
Well, I'm sure it isn't easy.

461
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,750
No, it isn't.

462
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,920
Watching her get

463
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,920
a little worse every day

464
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,590
and struggling

465
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,590
with the things

466
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,600
that were easy

467
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,600
just a few weeks ago and...

468
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,000
Ah.

469
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,540
Anyhow, I...

470
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,540
I should get back.

471
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,660
Yeah.

472
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,580
Once you return to work,

473
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,580
we'll round twice a day,

474
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,010
do a chart review

475
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,010
every morning,

476
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,980
and you'll observe

477
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,980
group therapy every afternoon.

478
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,880
By "observe," do you mean

479
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,880
I will be sitting in?

480
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,320
No, we have

481
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,320
a one-way mirror.

482
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,590
I don't believe in using

483
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,590
house staff as cheap labor.

484
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,960
You first.

485
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,190
Residency is a time to watch

486
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,530
and absorb.

487
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,630
Um, okay.

488
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,360
Uh, though,

489
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,360
speaking about therapy,

490
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,630
I've been reading up

491
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,630
on Erikson's theories,

492
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,770
uh, for strategic interaction,

493
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,770
and it's an interesting take,

494
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,780
focusing on a patient's, uh,

495
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,780
personal strengths,

496
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,830
rather than their pathologies.

497
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,940
Yes, interactional therapy

498
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,940
is interesting,

499
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,980
but you should spend the rest

500
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,980
of your suspension

501
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,180
learning these.

502
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,850
What are they?

503
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,480
Treatment algorithms

504
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,480
for the seven most common

505
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,480
conditions we see.

506
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,550
But these are flow charts.

507
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,420
How do you individualize

508
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,420
the therapy?

509
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,790
Step three.

510
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,800
Is the patient responding

511
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,800
to medication?

512
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,130
Yes, no.

513
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,820
Thursday afternoons,

514
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,820
we do journal club.

515
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,100
You're welcome to listen in.

516
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,500
What happened?

517
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,630
Building's condemned.

518
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,970
Supposed to be empty,

519
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,970
but we thought we heard

520
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,970
somebody inside.

521
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,140
Turned out to be a squatter.

522
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,140
Guy's name is Gary.

523
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,480
He's got a big

524
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,480
chunk of concrete

525
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,480
compressing his left leg

526
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,610
and a piece of rebar

527
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,610
straight up through his groin.

528
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,350
We got pressure on it,

529
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,350
but he's bleeding pretty bad.

530
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,820
If we stop the bleed,

531
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,820
can we get him out?

532
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,880
Hard to say.

533
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,940
Hey, Lieutenant!

534
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,940
Yeah?

535
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,490
Uh, the concrete's a bear.

536
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,260
We can't use the bags on it,

537
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,260
but we might be able to

538
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,820
break it up

539
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,820
with the air chisel.

540
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,990
Be careful.

541
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,990
We haven't been able to

542
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,930
clear a path yet, so we're

543
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,930
gonna have to sneak through.

544
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,990
Watch your heads.

545
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,990
Yeah.

546
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,540
Ah, here we go, Gary.

547
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,540
We got Dr. Rhodes

548
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,540
and Dr. Bekker.

549
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,080
Now, Gary,

550
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,010
we're gonna take

551
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,010
good care of you, all right?

552
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,110
All right.

553
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,110
Hey, you're okay.

554
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,780
All right, draw up

555
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,780
another round of labs,

556
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,080
and hang a gram of vanco.

557
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,080
Yep.

558
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,790
Hey, Ms. Dempsey.

559
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,420
The antibiotics

560
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,420
aren't working, are they?

561
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,020
No, they're not,

562
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,830
and it's possible

563
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,830
the bacteria

564
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,090
has spread from your lungs

565
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,090
into your blood.

566
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,030
Sepsis.

567
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,030
I've been reading.

568
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,870
Yes.

569
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,570
Now, I'm hoping this

570
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,570
new antibiotic we're starting

571
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,980
will turn things around.

572
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,880
But, as you know,

573
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,880
the supranuclear palsy

574
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,610
makes your immune system

575
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,610
less effective,

576
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,580
so there's also a chance

577
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,580
before we get there

578
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,240
your lungs will start

579
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,240
to give out.

580
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,090
Now, if it comes to that,

581
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,720
I am gonna have

582
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,720
to intubate you.

583
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,620
And put me

584
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,620
on a ventilator?

585
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,680
Yes.

586
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,430
But hopefully,

587
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,430
it's only temporary,

588
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,960
until we can clear

589
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,960
the infection.

590
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,360
Okay?

591
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,430
Hang in there.

592
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,630
I'll be back to check on you

593
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,630
in a few minutes.

594
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,610
Dr. Halstead?

595
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,380
I don't want that ventilator.

596
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,050
I understand

597
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,050
this sounds daunting,

598
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,750
but like I said,

599
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,750
if it comes to that,

600
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,120
we may very well be able

601
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,120
to get you off it again soon.

602
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,620
Or you may not.

603
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,820
I know how this all ends.

604
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,990
Lyla,

605
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,400
if your lungs fail

606
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,400
and I don't intubate,

607
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,590
you'll die.

608
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,960
I know.

609
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,700
Okay.

610
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,150
Ms. Crawford?

611
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,910
I told you,

612
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,910
I don't want to talk.

613
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,110
Uh, I'm not here

614
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,110
to discuss detox.

615
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,920
I want to talk to you

616
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,920
about your baby.

617
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,050
What about it?

618
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,820
He's a boy,

619
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,150
and he's withdrawing

620
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,150
from heroin.

621
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,690
He's, um, not eating,

622
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,690
not sleeping.

623
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,900
Breathing and heartbeat

624
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,900
aren't quite as regular

625
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,900
as we'd like.

626
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,430
So give him some medicine.

627
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,970
Well, we have been,

628
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,970
but it is not quite

629
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,970
that simple.

630
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,240
Okay.

631
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,340
Um...

632
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,420
So?

633
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,940
LeAnn, adults have years

634
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,940
to develop

635
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,940
the coping mechanisms

636
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,750
that help us get through

637
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,750
life's trouble spots.

638
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,180
Uh, a newborn

639
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,180
doesn't have any.

640
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,430
You know, for him,

641
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,430
his mother is the only thing

642
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,430
in the world

643
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,090
that makes him feel safe.

644
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,600
Being held by her,

645
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,500
you know,

646
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,500
feeling her skin...

647
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,540
You want me to hold him?

648
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,230
Well, it might be

649
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,230
the best medicine we've got.

650
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,540
I don't...

651
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,610
I don't know

652
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,610
how to hold a baby.

653
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,740
Well, we can show you.

654
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,720
We can teach you

655
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,720
how to do that.

656
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,650
But this baby's sick

657
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,650
'cause of me, right?

658
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,390
There's no way

659
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,390
that more of me

660
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,390
is gonna help it.

661
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,020
Well...

662
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,770
I said no.

663
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,040
Please leave me alone.

664
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,150
Ms. Dempsey?

665
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,710
You wanted to see me?

666
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,360
What can I do for you?

667
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,020
I'm sure I'm the last person

668
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,020
you want to talk to.

669
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,130
I know Bert

670
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,130
didn't do right by you,

671
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,340
but he's a good man.

672
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,090
He shouldn't be alone.

673
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,910
Well, he was fortunate

674
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,910
to have found you.

675
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,340
Thank you.

676
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,180
But he won't have me

677
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,180
for long.

678
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,550
I signed

679
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,550
a do-not-resuscitate order.

680
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,320
I see.

681
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,560
So when my time does come,

682
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,760
would you look after him?

683
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,460
You don't have to

684
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,460
answer now.

685
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,030
Just please think about it.

686
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,280
Let's see what we

687
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,280
got here, all right?

688
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,980
Wait, hold pressure,

689
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,980
hold pressure.

690
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,650
There.

691
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,220
Yep.

692
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,220
Move your hands.

693
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,460
Just a bit.

694
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,860
Can you see it?

695
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,130
No, can't clamp the artery.

696
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,860
Rebar's in the way.

697
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Herrmann, any chance

698
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
of getting him out of here?

699
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,970
We're gonna try

700
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,970
the air chisels,

701
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,170
but it don't look good.

702
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,410
All right, we're gonna

703
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,410
have to do a REBOA.

704
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,500
What?

705
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,640
Gary?

706
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
An ER-REBOA

707
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
is a catheter

708
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,020
with a balloon at the tip

709
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,020
that I can thread into

710
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,020
your aorta.

711
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,520
Once I inflate the balloon,

712
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,320
it'll keep you from bleeding.

713
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,450
Okay.

714
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,090
One moment.

715
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,050
Ready.

716
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,050
Keep pressure there.

717
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,600
Got it.

718
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,600
Yep, hang on.

719
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,500
Watch it.

720
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,500
Hang on, bud.

721
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,900
Connor, we can't do that.

722
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,960
Once you inflate

723
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,960
the balloon,

724
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,770
we'll only have 30 minutes

725
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,770
to get him out of here.

726
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,470
He's lost

727
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,470
too much blood already.

728
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,770
It's gonna take

729
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,770
a lot of movement

730
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,770
to get him out of here,

731
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
and we won't be able

732
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
to maintain pressure.

733
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,000
So you're going to risk

734
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,550
prolonged loss

735
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,550
of circulation instead?

736
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,550
I realize it can

737
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,550
necessitate amputation,

738
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,450
but I promise you,

739
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,610
if we don't place a REBOA,

740
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,180
he's going to bleed out

741
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,180
right in front of us.

742
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,610
Hey.

743
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,420
Yeah?

744
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,420
Hey, what's going on?

745
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,620
Nothing, Gary.

746
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,550
We're gonna get you

747
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,550
out of here

748
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,550
as fast as we can.

749
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,460
Okay.

750
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,120
Okay.

751
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
Easy.

752
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,570
Easy.

753
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,570
Just breathe, buddy.

754
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,840
Hang in there.

755
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,510
All right, here we go.

756
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,520
Come in.

757
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,360
Dr. Reese.

758
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,000
How'd it go

759
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,000
with Dr. Chapman?

760
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,940
Uh, it was fine.

761
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,100
She's fine.

762
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,260
Good.

763
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,040
Is there an issue?

764
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,570
I prefer to come back

765
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,570
to your service.

766
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,120
I understand,

767
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,120
really, I do,

768
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,710
but I think it's very

769
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,710
important that you explore

770
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,260
a different clinical approach.

771
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,260
Yeah, well, Dr. Charles,

772
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,260
I'm not an idiot.

773
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,630
Um, I know you think

774
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,630
my anxiety,

775
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,290
my PTSD, if you will,

776
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,960
stems directly

777
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,960
from your being shot,

778
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,500
that our working together

779
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,500
is negatively affecting

780
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,500
my mental health.

781
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,800
But...

782
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,850
First of all, um,

783
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,110
these are my issues,

784
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,110
and I'm working on them,

785
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,650
and second of all,

786
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,120
you chose to bring me

787
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,120
into psychiatry.

788
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,420
So I'm not about to let you

789
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,420
pawn me off

790
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,260
onto that Dr. Chapman...

791
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,630
When you're the psychiatrist

792
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,630
I want to be.

793
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,230
Um... I mean,

794
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,230
I almost lost you once.

795
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,110
I don't want

796
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,110
to lose you again.

797
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,140
Oh. I...

798
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,310
I very much appreciate

799
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,310
what you're saying,

800
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,980
but as a clinician,

801
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,350
and as a...

802
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,350
Dr. Charles...

803
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,790
And as a teacher,

804
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,790
I just think that this is

805
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,630
the best course of action

806
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,630
that we stick

807
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,630
with Dr. Chapman.

808
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,930
Bert, stop.

809
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,040
Sweetheart,

810
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,040
this isn't right. No.

811
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,370
Mr. Goodwin,

812
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,370
it's not up to me.

813
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,880
Bert, please...

814
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,280
How can you

815
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,280
not do anything?

816
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,210
I explained all her options.

817
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,950
But you're her doctor.

818
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,950
Tell her what's best.

819
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,210
She made her wishes

820
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,210
very clear.

821
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,810
There's nothing else

822
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,810
I can do.

823
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,950
So you're just going to

824
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,950
stand around and let her die?

825
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,530
What the hell

826
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,530
kind of hospital is this?

827
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,820
Bert, Bert...

828
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,820
Bert.

829
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,990
Bert.

830
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,060
She needs another doctor,

831
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,930
one who will do something

832
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,930
if she gets worse.

833
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,490
Bert, this is her choice.

834
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,000
She's got a fever.

835
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,470
She doesn't know

836
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,470
what she wants.

837
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,770
This is hard, I know,

838
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,770
but Dr. Halstead

839
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,110
is doing everything he can

840
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,110
within the scope

841
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,110
of Lyla's wishes.

842
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,780
The best thing

843
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,780
you can do right now

844
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,750
is go back in that room

845
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,750
and be with her.

846
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,160
How are you feeling?

847
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,160
Fine.

848
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,040
You don't think I should

849
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,040
go see my baby, do you?

850
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,140
That's up to you.

851
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,610
They say he's sick.

852
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,720
Yeah, he is.

853
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,280
I never planned

854
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,280
on getting pregnant.

855
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,380
You know?

856
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,760
Whatever.

857
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,770
You think I'm terrible.

858
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,040
I just wish things

859
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,040
had worked out differently

860
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,040
for you and your baby.

861
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,270
Yeah.

862
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,720
But I guess where you're from,

863
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,650
things work out great

864
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,650
for everybody.

865
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,620
Why would you understand?

866
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,120
Actually, I understand

867
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,120
a lot better than you think.

868
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,690
Oh.

869
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,820
Getting hungry yet?

870
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,860
I know you think

871
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,860
this is charming,

872
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,860
but it's not.

873
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,470
Hey, you remember

874
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,470
our first date?

875
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,740
Mmm-hmm.

876
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,740
Mexican food at the mall.

877
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,970
No, I mean afterwards.

878
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,780
We were throwing pennies

879
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,780
into the pond

880
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,510
where people made wishes.

881
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,640
You know what mine was?

882
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,150
A second date

883
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,150
with the pretty woman

884
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,210
sitting next to me.

885
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,050
Hmm. That's a sweet story.

886
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,120
Too bad it ends

887
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,120
with you cheating on her.

888
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,590
I've changed, Maggie.

889
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,590
So you say.

890
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,830
But this time,

891
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,830
I'm smart enough

892
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,830
to draw the line.

893
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,530
Maggie, just...

894
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,530
Barry...

895
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,570
Okay.

896
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,530
We're good.

897
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,530
Keep going.

898
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,690
This place is unstable.

899
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,690
Another shift like that,

900
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,100
and the whole thing's

901
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,100
going to come down, Rhodes.

902
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,470
Guys, you gotta

903
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,470
do something.

904
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,200
We could try coming

905
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,200
from another angle,

906
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,760
but it'll take 20 minutes.

907
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,110
His leg's already cold.

908
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,340
All it's doing now

909
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,340
is preventing us

910
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,680
from getting him to hospital.

911
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,910
Yeah.

912
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,410
Gary,

913
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,980
listen to me.

914
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,350
Your leg is trapped

915
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,220
and we need to get you

916
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,220
out of here.

917
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm afraid that the only way

918
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,760
to do that

919
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,820
is to amputate.

920
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,690
What? No.

921
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,760
Gary, I'm very sorry,

922
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,630
but your leg has gone

923
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,630
without blood for too long.

924
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,710
Is that 'cause of that thing

925
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,710
you put in me?

926
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,060
That balloon?

927
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,440
We had to do that

928
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,440
so you wouldn't

929
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,240
lose even more blood,

930
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,240
but now that it's in,

931
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,570
every minute puts you

932
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,570
in more danger.

933
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,630
No.

934
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,630
Gary...

935
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,700
Dr. Rhodes...

936
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,700
Get away!

937
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,140
Gary, listen to me.

938
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,720
I do not want you to die.

939
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,310
We have to get you

940
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,310
to hospital.

941
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,380
Do you understand?

942
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,020
You are not

943
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,020
taking my leg.

944
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,530
I wish we didn't have to,

945
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,700
but you've lost

946
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,700
a lot of blood

947
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,700
and you are in grave danger.

948
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,090
You can't.

949
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,100
Please.

950
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,600
There's gotta be

951
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,600
another way.

952
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,700
I'm sorry,

953
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,700
there isn't.

954
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,670
And I know

955
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,670
how terrible this seems,

956
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,310
but you have

957
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,310
a lot of years to live

958
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,370
and a lot of life

959
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,370
to experience,

960
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,250
and I don't want you

961
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,250
to miss out on that,

962
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,610
but you will

963
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,610
unless you let us help you

964
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,780
right now.

965
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,010
But it's my leg.

966
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,260
I can't.

967
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
You can.

968
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,590
Good.

969
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,710
Now, Dr. Rhodes is going

970
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,710
to numb you up.

971
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,500
After that,

972
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,500
you won't feel anything.

973
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,040
Just keep looking

974
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,040
at me, Gary.

975
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,450
I've got you.

976
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,440
Dr. Manning.

977
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,040
What's happening?

978
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,040
He's having a seizure.

979
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,670
Give him a bolus

980
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,670
of Ativan.

981
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,410
O2 sats are down to 72.

982
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,540
He can't get any air.

983
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,680
Bolus is in.

984
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,690
He could suffer

985
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,690
an anoxic brain injury.

986
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,790
Give him 0.1 milligrams

987
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,790
of morphine.

988
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,300
Sats down to 67.

989
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,170
He can't go much longer.

990
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,170
Give him another 0.1.

991
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,010
Sats back to 77.

992
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,250
81.

993
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,050
He's breathing.

994
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,820
Get a pediatric

995
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,820
intubation kit.

996
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,950
If this happens again,

997
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,950
we're going to have to

998
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,950
put him on a vent.

999
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:54,960
Right.

1000
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,500
You have a very

1001
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,500
expressive face.

1002
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,740
Easy to read.

1003
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm not sure

1004
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,700
that's a good thing.

1005
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,370
When I told Bert

1006
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,370
that I was terminally ill,

1007
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,610
my greatest fear was

1008
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,610
that he would leave me.

1009
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,060
We had only been dating

1010
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,060
a couple of months.

1011
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,430
But he didn't.

1012
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,430
He stuck with me

1013
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,990
through thick

1014
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,990
and thin.

1015
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,660
He doesn't deserve

1016
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,660
to have me leave him now.

1017
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,310
So if you need to take

1018
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,310
extreme measures

1019
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,140
to keep me alive,

1020
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,470
do it.

1021
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,200
Are you sure?

1022
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,770
Yes.

1023
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,680
And you understand

1024
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,680
that means

1025
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,910
I may need

1026
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,910
to intubate you

1027
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,910
very soon?

1028
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,850
I promise,

1029
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,850
this is my decision,

1030
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,360
not his.

1031
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,130
Okay.

1032
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,870
I'll go change

1033
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,870
the order.

1034
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,380
And he's gonna die.

1035
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,910
He could, yeah.

1036
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,110
And you really think

1037
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,110
that having me hold him

1038
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,110
is gonna help?

1039
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,480
I know it's a lot to ask,

1040
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,210
and I just

1041
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,210
wouldn't be doing it

1042
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,260
if the situation

1043
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,260
wasn't so dire.

1044
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,720
But you're his mother,

1045
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,720
and the baby needs you,

1046
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,620
and if there's

1047
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,620
any chance at all

1048
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,930
that your holding him

1049
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,930
might help him get better,

1050
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,000
I think we should try.

1051
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,130
This was my fault.

1052
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,940
I did this to him.

1053
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,190
Okay.

1054
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,050
Okay.

1055
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,170
He's so small.

1056
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,440
Go ahead.

1057
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,720
Hold him close, now.

1058
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,000
Against your skin.

1059
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,490
Hi. Don't cry.

1060
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,650
Hi. Hi, yeah?

1061
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,010
Yeah.

1062
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,110
Dr. Halstead?

1063
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,890
She's in SVT.

1064
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,890
20 of etomidate,

1065
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,620
50 of cisatracurium.

1066
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,530
Grab the intubation kit

1067
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,530
and charge the paddles to 25.

1068
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,720
What's happening?

1069
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,460
The infection's

1070
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,460
overwhelming her system.

1071
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,900
She rescinded her DNR,

1072
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,900
so I have to

1073
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,030
shock her heart back

1074
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,030
into rhythm and intubate.

1075
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,940
Mr. Goodwin,

1076
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,940
I need you to step back.

1077
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,340
She's doing this

1078
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,340
for me, isn't she?

1079
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,740
She doesn't

1080
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,740
want this. Stop.

1081
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,170
Stop.

1082
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,100
Lyla.

1083
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,710
Lyla, this is

1084
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,710
a shockable rhythm.

1085
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,950
I can try to resuscitate you.

1086
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,950
Do you want me to do that?

1087
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,610
No.

1088
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,060
You heard her.

1089
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,520
Don't do this.

1090
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,490
Don't.

1091
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,000
I love you.

1092
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,640
I love you.

1093
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,080
Baghdad.

1094
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,490
All right, Karen,

1095
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,490
tell the OR

1096
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,490
we're on our way up

1097
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,750
as soon as this rebar's out.

1098
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,190
100 milligrams of ketamine.

1099
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,620
Get me a cut-down kit.

1100
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,060
And hang two units of O neg

1101
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,060
on the rapid transfuser.

1102
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,560
On my count.

1103
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,560
One, two, three.

1104
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,900
All right.

1105
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,900
Thanks, guys.

1106
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,870
Is that a REBOA?

1107
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,610
Couldn't get it down

1108
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,610
in the ambo.

1109
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,550
Pressure tanked

1110
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,550
every time I tried.

1111
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,090
Of course it does.

1112
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,090
A REBOA in the field

1113
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,480
is a problem

1114
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,480
waiting to happen.

1115
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,750
Whose idea was this?

1116
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,750
Mine.

1117
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,760
Dr. Rhodes,

1118
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,760
do you realize...

1119
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,760
It was the right call.

1120
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,660
There was no other way

1121
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,660
to get him out of there alive.

1122
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,160
All right,

1123
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,160
wound looks good.

1124
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,220
Taking down the REBOA.

1125
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,920
Watch the pressure.

1126
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,000
Pressure's holding.

1127
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,100
Vitals are stable.

1128
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,160
All right,

1129
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,160
let's get this thing out

1130
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,800
and get him up to the OR.

1131
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,970
Ready?

1132
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,480
Yep.

1133
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,480
One, two, three.

1134
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,850
No bleeding.

1135
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,850
Let's go.

1136
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,050
Nice job, Dr. Rhodes.

1137
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,340
Yes, that's it.

1138
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,110
Right there.

1139
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,640
Oh, excuse me.

1140
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,950
Can I just have a quick word

1141
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,950
with Ms. Crawford first?

1142
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,550
Okay.

1143
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,590
Hey.

1144
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,620
Oh, wow,

1145
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,620
he looks great.

1146
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,790
A lot better, huh?

1147
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,160
He is great.

1148
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
So, um, we have finally

1149
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
made some room for him

1150
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,060
in the intensive care unit,

1151
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,770
so we're gonna...

1152
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,770
We're gonna take him

1153
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,770
up there now.

1154
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,110
Okay.

1155
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,710
Oh, do I carry him up,

1156
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,750
or do we take him up

1157
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,750
in the warmer?

1158
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,150
Well, um...

1159
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,010
Actually, LeAnn,

1160
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,010
there is a...

1161
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,060
There's a...

1162
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,060
There's a foster couple

1163
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,060
up there

1164
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,120
who is gonna be looking

1165
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,120
after him from here on out.

1166
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,460
But he likes me

1167
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,460
so much.

1168
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,520
I know.

1169
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,700
And he is doing so well.

1170
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,870
So I should

1171
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,870
just keep holding him.

1172
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,430
I really wish you could.

1173
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,100
Really, I do.

1174
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,910
But you said

1175
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,910
that he needs me.

1176
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,880
I know.

1177
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,880
I know I did.

1178
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,950
I know how difficult this is.

1179
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,950
I really do.

1180
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,020
I'm sorry,

1181
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,020
but we need to take

1182
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,020
the baby now.

1183
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,650
No!

1184
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,420
I'm his mother!

1185
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,520
I'm... I'm his mother.

1186
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,490
Dr...

1187
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,490
Dr. Charles, please.

1188
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,930
I'm sorry.

1189
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,930
You know.

1190
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,090
You know. Dr. Charles,

1191
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,600
please, can you help me?

1192
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,600
Please!

1193
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,760
I'm sorry.

1194
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,760
Please, can you help me?

1195
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,860
Please explain.

1196
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,860
That is my baby.

1197
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,630
Dr. Charles, please.

1198
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,970
Please, can you just...

1199
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,870
Dr. Charles,

1200
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,870
can you please...

1201
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,780
I saw Bert.

1202
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,480
He's taking it pretty hard.

1203
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,960
Yeah, I'm gonna send the kids

1204
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,960
over to check on him.

1205
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,660
Mmm.

1206
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,580
What?

1207
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,620
Sharon, do you think

1208
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,620
people can change?

1209
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,570
Maggie, I don't know.

1210
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,670
Go call my kids.

1211
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,790
LeAnn, you lost

1212
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,790
a lot of blood today.

1213
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,790
I'd really rather you stay.

1214
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,080
Listen, it may not

1215
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,080
feel like it,

1216
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,320
but you did

1217
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,320
the right thing today.

1218
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,020
You were there

1219
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,020
for your baby.

1220
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,850
It's unfortunate

1221
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,850
that you can't take him home,

1222
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,950
but there's a methadone clinic

1223
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,950
right upstairs.

1224
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,220
We can help you

1225
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,220
get cleaned up,

1226
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,460
and if you can

1227
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,460
get back on your feet,

1228
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,260
that's the crucial first step

1229
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,260
in getting him back.

1230
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,530
I'm tired.

1231
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,610
You know, I'm...

1232
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,340
I'm just gonna go.

1233
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,840
LeAnn...

1234
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,240
LeAnn.

1235
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,970
We had no choice.

1236
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,970
We had to do

1237
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,880
what's right for the baby.

1238
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,880
Oh, yeah, of course.

1239
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,390
It's just, you know...

1240
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,950
It's sad. It's unlikely

1241
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,950
either of them

1242
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,080
ever really be whole again.

1243
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,800
Ah, the old

1244
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,800
Chapman flow charts.

1245
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,210
Oh, yeah.

1246
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,500
Number seven.

1247
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,500
That there's a doozy.

1248
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,080
Step seven?

1249
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,450
Dr. Reese,

1250
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,450
the truth is,

1251
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,340
I feel responsible

1252
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,340
for letting your situation

1253
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,450
get out of hand

1254
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,450
the way it did.

1255
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,080
It was my job to,

1256
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,080
well, guide you

1257
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,090
and teach you

1258
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,090
and make you a better doctor,

1259
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
and I...

1260
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,820
I let you down.

1261
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,160
Dr. Charles...

1262
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,220
But ultimately,

1263
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,460
some relationships

1264
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,460
are just better...

1265
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,500
kept intact,

1266
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,230
which is why,

1267
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,230
if you'd still like to,

1268
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,710
when you return,

1269
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,710
I would very much welcome

1270
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,710
you back on my service.

1271
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,780
Really?

1272
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,480
Really.

1273
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,420
Hey, Gary.

1274
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,360
How you doing?

1275
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,040
It's weird.

1276
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,200
I can feel it,

1277
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,200
like it's still there.

1278
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,170
Yeah, it's called

1279
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,170
phantom limb pain.

1280
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,230
Uh...

1281
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,980
Takes some time,

1282
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,980
but it will fade.

1283
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,650
Listen, Gary, I am...

1284
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,650
I am very sorry

1285
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,650
about your leg.

1286
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,320
At least I'm alive.

1287
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,830
I'll find a way to move on.

1288
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
All right, bud.

1289
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,340
I'll check on you soon.

1290
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,880
Dr. Charles.

1291
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,220
I didn't want to believe

1292
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,220
that it was over,

1293
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,920
but you were right.

1294
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,920
I need to let Robin go.

1295
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,940
April?

1296
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,170
Hmm?

1297
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,810
Who's that?

1298
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,410
It's my sister.

1299
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,780
What?

1300
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,810
Emily.

1301
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,320
I should've told you.

1302
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,820
I never talk about her.

1303
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,820
It's painful.

1304
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,430
My parents adopted Emily

1305
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,430
when she was four.

1306
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,530
She had a hard life

1307
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,530
before she even came to us.

1308
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,130
Still does.

1309
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,830
She makes bad decisions,

1310
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,830
acts out,

1311
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,240
then blows up

1312
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,240
when I try to help her,

1313
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,510
and I swore the last time

1314
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,510
that I wouldn't let myself

1315
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,510
get involved again.

1316
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,180
When was that?

1317
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,240
It was four years ago.

1318
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,320
Maybe I should

1319
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,320
give her a call.

1320
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,590
Hey.

1321
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,560
Thank you for today.

1322
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,560
Uh, you were great.

1323
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,900
I did feel a bit like

1324
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,900
Bonnie Henna out there.

1325
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,700
Who?

1326
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,610
South African action hero.

1327
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,830
Have a good night.

1328
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,140
Oh, and no need to cover

1329
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,140
for me tomorrow.

1330
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,140
I'll be here.

1331
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,450
You're not going

1332
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,450
to Minneapolis?

1333
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,680
Nope.

1334
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,030
Good evening, sir.

1335
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,030
Can I help you?

1336
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,120
I'm looking for a change.

1337
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,090
What model is this?

1338
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,360
The 911 4S.

1339
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,560
Beautiful car.

1340
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,500
Yes, it is.

1341
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,470
You got the keys?

1342
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,930
I'm sorry,

1343
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,930
but we're actually

1344
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,670
done doing test drives

1345
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,670
for the night.

1346
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,510
I don't want to test drive.

1347
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,440
I want to buy it.

1348
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,450
Oh, of course.

1349
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,450
Just give me a moment.

1350
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,590
Mmm.

1351
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,820
I'll see you

1352
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,820
in the morning.

1353
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,030
Mmm.

1354
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,100
No.

1355
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,370
You should stay.

1356
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,010
Yeah?

1357
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,010
Mmm-hmm.

1358
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,140
What about Owen?

1359
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,540
Mmm.

1360
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,440
He's got to

1361
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,440
find out sometime.

1362
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,680
Are you sure?

1363
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,220
Mmm-hmm. I'm sure.

1364
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,350
This is

1365
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,350
so much better than

1366
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,790
scraping ice

1367
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,790
off my windshield.
