1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,230
This is kinda fun, right?

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,230
It's like being in

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,230
high school again,

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,300
sneaking around to avoid

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,300
getting caught.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,210
Next, staying out

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,210
past curfew.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,380
Ow!

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,380
Aah! Are you okay?

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,610
Yeah, I'm fine.

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,610
Will you just...

12
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,610
Are you sure?

13
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,850
Is this thing

14
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,850
poured in concrete?

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,150
Let me do it.

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,420
All right.

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,420
Now where were we?

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,600
Just block it out.

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,600
Block it out.

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,430
What is that?

21
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,780
Maybe a rain check?

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,400
Wasn't this our rain check?

23
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,210
I hope you brought

24
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,210
your dancing shoes, lady,

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,770
'cause it's gonna get lit.

26
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,980
I know this promoter.

27
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,310
He's getting us

28
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,310
a table at the club.

29
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,420
You're gonna wanna Uber.

30
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,420
Sounds great.

31
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,390
Dr. Choi, you coming

32
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,390
to my birthday party tonight?

33
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,120
Don't think I'm gonna

34
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,120
make it, Doris.

35
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,790
Happy birthday, though.

36
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,790
Hmm.

37
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,260
To be honest, I don't really

38
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,260
care if he comes or not.

39
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,600
That was just

40
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,600
a courtesy invite.

41
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,330
I can't wait for you

42
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,330
to meet my cousin Paul.

43
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,640
Newly single.

44
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,350
Wait, you're not going

45
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,350
to Doris' party?

46
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,440
What're you gonna be doing?

47
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,380
Literally,

48
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,380
anything else.

49
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,380
Why you care what Doris

50
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,380
thinks is beyond me.

51
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,650
Do I really have to

52
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,650
explain myself again?

53
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,980
You wanna keep us

54
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,980
a secret at work, fine.

55
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,890
But I'm not gonna spend

56
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,890
my off-time pretending, too.

57
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,460
But hey, go have fun

58
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,460
with cousin Paul.

59
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,050
Dr. Choi, April, look alive.

60
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,530
You're going to treatment six.

61
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,100
Abena Kwemo, early-20s.

62
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,100
Found dizzy and disoriented.

63
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,400
BP 150 over 95. Temp 103.

64
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,970
She's having a seizure.

65
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,970
Give her two Ativan IV, stat.

66
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,580
Called East Mercy first,

67
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,580
they said they were full up.

68
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,840
Diverted us here.

69
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,180
There you go.

70
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,180
All right, let's get her

71
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,180
in the bed.

72
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,520
Let's transfer on my count.

73
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,060
Ready.

74
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,060
One, two, three.

75
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,200
Nice job.

76
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,200
Yeah.

77
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,960
Where am I?

78
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,960
Abena, hey, I'm Dr. Choi.

79
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,800
You're at Gaffney Chicago

80
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,800
Medical Center.

81
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,900
You just had a seizure.

82
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,900
Has that ever happened before?

83
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,140
Let's get her a liter bolus

84
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,140
of normal saline.

85
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,370
Order a CBC with diff, CMP,

86
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,370
utox and draw blood cultures.

87
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,770
Also, let's get a chest

88
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,770
X-ray and a head CT.

89
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,450
Got it.

90
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,650
Dr. Choi.

91
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,350
I noticed these when I was

92
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,350
starting to gown her.

93
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,650
They're on her back, too.

94
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,560
Abena, has a doctor ever

95
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,560
spoken to you

96
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,720
about these lesions?

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,470
I can't remember.

98
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,300
Abena, these are most likely

99
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,300
Kaposi Sarcoma lesions.

100
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,880
KS is an AIDS-defining

101
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,880
illness.

102
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,810
I'd like to run

103
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,810
a test for HIV.

104
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,440
No, no, no.

105
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,750
Mmm, no.

106
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,610
Look, I know

107
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,610
it sounds scary,

108
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
but AIDS is

109
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
a manageable disease.

110
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,180
With

111
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,180
antiretroviral therapy,

112
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,590
we can prevent

113
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,590
disease progression.

114
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,060
But first, we need

115
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,060
to confirm you have HIV.

116
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,080
No.

117
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,290
Thank you, Doctor.

118
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,290
No test.

119
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,570
I can't have AIDS.

120
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,940
Turns out Abena has been

121
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,940
to East Mercy multiple times

122
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,450
over the past six months for

123
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,450
AIDS-related complications.

124
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,780
Pneumonia, meningitis,

125
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,780
candidiasis.

126
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,450
But she's consistently

127
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,450
refused HIV testing.

128
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,550
CT says she has

129
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,550
toxoplasmosis of the

130
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,550
central nervous system.

131
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,860
If we admit her, that's

132
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,860
a week-long stay, at least.

133
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,660
What do you mean,

134
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,660
"if we admit her"?

135
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,720
What else would we do?

136
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,300
Turf her back

137
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,300
to East Mercy.

138
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
For the record,

139
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm not suggesting we do that.

140
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,600
Of course not.

141
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,630
Dr. Stohl, we are not turfing

142
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,630
someone we know has AIDS.

143
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,970
Ms. Goodwin,

144
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,510
we both know how

145
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,510
this story ends.

146
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,770
She dies,

147
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,680
after countless complications

148
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,680
and tests and treatment,

149
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,910
none of which change

150
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,910
the inevitable.

151
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,720
So why not put our limited

152
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,720
resources behind the ones

153
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,760
we actually have

154
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,760
a shot at saving?

155
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,650
Because I'm not ready to

156
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,650
accept that we can't save her.

157
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,290
Toxoplasmosis can cause

158
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,290
cognitive impairment, no?

159
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,390
Mmm-hmm.

160
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,440
So it's possible that she

161
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,440
lacks capacity to give us

162
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,600
informed consent.

163
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
She was confused

164
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
when she came in.

165
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,170
I supposed we could

166
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,170
pull psych in.

167
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,670
Thank you.

168
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,420
Hey, got your...

169
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,650
I already took my pills,

170
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,650
but thank you.

171
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,480
All right, then.

172
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,060
Wow, new dress, new earrings.

173
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,720
What's the occasion?

174
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,720
No occasion.

175
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,930
Just an impulse buy.

176
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,930
Felt like I needed

177
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,930
a fresh start.

178
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,100
You know what?

179
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,270
It might look a

180
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,270
little better on the floor.

181
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,210
No, no, no, no.

182
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,210
I can't, I can't.

183
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,340
I gotta get moving.

184
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,670
Doesn't your shift

185
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,670
start at 9:00?

186
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,310
Yeah, but I'm on trauma call

187
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,310
today, so they can wait.

188
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,150
Ah! Is that how trauma works?

189
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,420
Come on, whatever happened to

190
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,420
channeling your impulsivity

191
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,850
into other activities?

192
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

193
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,820
My impulsivity?

194
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,320
So what, when I initiate sex,

195
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,520
it's just a symptom

196
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,520
of my illness?

197
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,620
Okay, yes.

198
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,860
Sometimes I still wonder

199
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,860
if I'm getting Robin

200
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,670
or if I'm getting...

201
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,400
Okay, I get it.

202
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,400
I get it.

203
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,900
But just so you know,

204
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,140
I am feeling more and more

205
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,140
like myself every day.

206
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,150
Well, then, how about dinner

207
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,150
and a movie tonight?

208
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,510
Uh, how about dinner

209
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,510
and no movie?

210
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,590
Please, I need someone

211
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,590
to see my daughter.

212
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,220
She can barely

213
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,220
walk in a straight line,

214
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,990
her foot keeps dragging,

215
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,990
she's bumping into things...

216
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,550
Ma'am, please take a seat.

217
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,550
As soon as I have a doctor...

218
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,320
Denise,

219
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,320
come over here, honey.

220
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,060
Do you see what I mean?

221
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,560
Oh, my God.

222
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,830
Need some help over here!

223
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,840
We got her.

224
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,840
Mom!

225
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,000
Hi, there.

226
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,000
I can't feel my leg.

227
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,170
Okay. I'm Doctor Halstead.

228
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,970
We're gonna figure out

229
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,970
why that is, all right?

230
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,570
Okay.

231
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,570
Thank you so much.

232
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,320
She started complaining

233
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,320
on the plane ride home

234
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,320
from Australia.

235
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,780
She said that her feet were

236
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,780
tingling, that her legs hurt.

237
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,620
I thought it was just

238
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,620
from sitting so long.

239
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,710
Did Denise do

240
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,710
any outdoor activities

241
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,710
while you were there?

242
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,090
Hiking, swimming?

243
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,090
No, no hiking.

244
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
We picnicked a couple of days.

245
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,460
Deep tendon reflexes

246
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,460
are absent.

247
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,060
Okay, I'm gonna ask you

248
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,060
to close your eyes

249
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,470
super tight for me, all right?

250
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,470
No peeking.

251
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,170
And when I tap you on the leg,

252
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,570
will you point to which side

253
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,570
I'm tapping on?

254
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,660
Yeah.

255
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,440
Normal sensation

256
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,440
to light touch.

257
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,310
All right, can you lift

258
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,310
your legs for me now?

259
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,680
That's all I can do.

260
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,680
Okay.

261
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,290
Let's get a CBC,

262
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,290
CMP, ESR, utox,

263
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
and a brain

264
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
and spinal CT and MRI.

265
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,850
And do a full body scan for

266
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,850
rashes and insect bites, okay?

267
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,660
Is she paralyzed?

268
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,600
Let's not get

269
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,600
ahead of ourselves, okay?

270
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,400
While she is showing

271
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,400
signs of paralysis,

272
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,990
it's most likely temporary.

273
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,800
It's probably a nerve

274
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,800
compression injury

275
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,100
from the long flight.

276
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,610
We're gonna run these tests,

277
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,610
and we'll take it from there.

278
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,810
We'll be back soon.

279
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,180
Dr. Reese.

280
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,440
Dr. Charles, I thought you

281
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,440
weren't back till tomorrow.

282
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,350
How're you doing?

283
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,350
How's it all been going

284
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,350
on the floor?

285
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,420
Uh, actually, I've been doing

286
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,420
research projects

287
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,920
the past couple of weeks.

288
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,050
Huh.

289
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,050
Um...

290
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,390
So you, uh...

291
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,390
You haven't been

292
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,390
seeing any patients?

293
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,060
Figured I'd wait till

294
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,060
you got back.

295
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,430
Dr. Charles, welcome back.

296
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,430
Mind if I put you to work?

297
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,090
We need a psych evaluation to

298
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,090
determine decisional capacity.

299
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,160
Catch up later?

300
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,470
Oh.

301
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,470
Oh, hey, Sarah.

302
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,800
I was looking for you, um...

303
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,400
I don't know

304
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,400
if you heard or not,

305
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,570
but Doris, she's having a

306
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,570
thing tonight, and...

307
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,810
Dr. Sexton, Dr. Rhodes needs

308
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,810
a resident right now.

309
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,970
MVC incoming.

310
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,570
Okay, uh, think about it?

311
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,840
I'll check your temp later.

312
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,990
Dr. Sexton, now!

313
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,210
Yes, ma'am.

314
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,610
Spencer Bouren.

315
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,610
16-year-old male.

316
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,950
Lost control on

317
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,950
a patch of ice.

318
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,650
Head-on collision

319
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,650
with another vehicle.

320
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,990
Second driver's en route.

321
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,990
All right.

322
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,720
You're going to Trauma 1.

323
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,720
Yep.

324
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,430
He was unconscious

325
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,430
till he woke up in the ambo.

326
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,370
GCS, 15. BP 124 over 88.

327
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,370
HR, 118.

328
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,370
Uh, sats 100%.

329
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,560
Complaining of right hip pain.

330
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,630
All right,

331
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,630
transfer on my count.

332
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,210
One, two, three.

333
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,470
Let's get a chest

334
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,470
and pelvic X-ray.

335
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,910
On it.

336
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,910
We need a fourth one.

337
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,080
Second driver's

338
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,080
rolling in now,

339
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,080
we need you, Dr. Rhodes.

340
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,710
Somebody else

341
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,710
has gotta be avail.

342
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,260
I wouldn't tap you out

343
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,260
if there was.

344
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,020
I got him, go.

345
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,020
Desmond.

346
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,460
Female, mid-30s.

347
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,460
Unrestrained.

348
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,500
Hypotensive in the field,

349
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,500
gave her a liter.

350
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,120
GCS, 8. Tubed.

351
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,820
All right, let's get her in.

352
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,660
Buckles off.

353
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,660
All right.

354
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,460
Gently on my count.

355
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,460
One, two, three.

356
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,580
Is she gonna be okay?

357
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,510
Try to relax, bud.

358
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,510
Just try to relax.

359
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,110
Lungs are clear.

360
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,670
Clear breath

361
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,670
sounds bilaterally.

362
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,680
Trigger the MTP,

363
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,680
hang two of O-neg.

364
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,950
And give me a kit.

365
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,920
I'm gonna get a cordis

366
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,920
in the groin.

367
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,080
Chest X-ray's negative.

368
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,890
What about the pelvis?

369
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,050
Doing it now.

370
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,230
Up.

371
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,030
Dislocated hip.

372
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,930
Must've jammed it when

373
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,930
he slammed on the brakes.

374
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,640
And the longer it's out?

375
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,230
The higher the risk

376
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,230
of avascular necrosis.

377
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,300
Exactly.

378
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,040
Get me the FastSCAN.

379
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,770
You ever reduce a hip?

380
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,870
I've seen it done

381
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,870
a bunch of times.

382
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,040
I'll talk you through it.

383
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,980
70 milligrams of ketamine.

384
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,610
You're gonna pull on that hip

385
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,610
until you feel it pop back

386
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,610
into the socket.

387
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,750
Relax, relax, relax, relax.

388
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,790
Hold tight.

389
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,720
It popped back in.

390
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,720
Good work.

391
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,930
Her belly's full of blood.

392
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,760
BP's dropping.

393
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,760
All right, Maggie.

394
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,270
Call the OR,

395
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,270
tell them we're on our way up.

396
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,040
Copy.

397
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,900
Oh, my God.

398
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,900
Did I kill her?

399
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,640
Next one is,

400
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,080
if I were very sick,

401
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,080
I would like to do everything

402
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,080
possible to prolong my life.

403
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,650
Very true, mostly true,

404
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,650
you don't know,

405
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,650
mostly false...

406
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,160
That's very true.

407
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,160
Very true.

408
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,290
Yeah, the doctors did explain

409
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,290
to you the benefits

410
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,350
of antiretroviral therapy,

411
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,350
didn't they?

412
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,730
That it would

413
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,730
prolong your life.

414
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,000
They say I won't

415
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,000
get sick anymore.

416
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,500
So could you tell me then,

417
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,600
why it is that you

418
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,600
don't wanna take an HIV test?

419
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,000
Auntie.

420
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,270
What are you doing here?

421
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,180
You should be at work.

422
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,240
Are you the doctor?

423
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,310
I am a doctor, yes.

424
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,310
I'm Dr. Charles.

425
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,710
What's wrong with her?

426
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,710
My baby is always

427
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,710
getting sick.

428
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,340
I told you

429
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,340
on the phone, Auntie.

430
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,680
It's just the flu.

431
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,050
I'm going to get better soon.

432
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,060
Right, Doctor?

433
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,790
We are working on it.

434
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,280
All done.

435
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,280
You were so brave.

436
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,680
Okay, Mom, we should have

437
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,680
the results back

438
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,740
within an hour or two.

439
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,350
Um, I don't understand.

440
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,350
You said her tests

441
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,350
were normal.

442
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,960
They were, but...

443
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,960
But she's getting worse.

444
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,120
She can't move her legs

445
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,120
at all anymore.

446
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
We'll have a much clearer

447
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
picture once we receive

448
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,660
the results back on

449
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,660
Denise's cerebrospinal fluid.

450
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,630
And we'll ask the lab

451
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,630
to put a rush on these, okay?

452
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,030
Thank you.

453
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,130
Yeah.

454
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,130
Of course.

455
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,440
Will, you saw that girl's CSF.

456
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,440
It was crystal clear.

457
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,710
The lab's not gonna tell us

458
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,710
anything we don't

459
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,710
already know.

460
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,270
And it's obviously not

461
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,270
encephalitis, meningitis,

462
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,440
Guillain-Barré syndrome...

463
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,440
Hold on.

464
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,280
Let's not rule out GBS.

465
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,580
It fits her clinical

466
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,580
presentation almost to a T.

467
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,350
I mean,

468
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,350
normal blood work,

469
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,620
ascending symmetrical

470
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,620
paralysis, absent reflexes.

471
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,680
Let's just do one more

472
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,680
round of labs first.

473
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,590
All right, test for

474
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,590
heavy metal poisoning,

475
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,590
exotic infection,

476
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,560
and if we don't get

477
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,560
anything from those,

478
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm all for treating it

479
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,300
as GBS, okay?

480
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,200
All right.

481
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,200
Okay.

482
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
You're supposed

483
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
to steer into the skid.

484
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,260
Okay, can you flex

485
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,260
your knee for me?

486
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,280
Never slam on the brakes.

487
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,280
Why couldn't I remember that?

488
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,370
Now bring it to

489
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,370
your chest for me.

490
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,540
There we go.

491
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,520
Dr. Sexton, this is

492
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,520
Spencer's mother, Candace,

493
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,570
and his brother, Terrance.

494
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,710
Goodness.

495
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,180
Is he gonna be okay?

496
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,380
Dislocated his hip,

497
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,380
but other than that,

498
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,260
just scrapes

499
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,260
and bruises.

500
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,630
We did a CT of his abdomen,

501
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,630
pelvis, and head.

502
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,890
All negative for internal

503
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,890
bleeds and fractures.

504
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,070
Thank you.

505
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,070
Doctor Sexton.

506
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,640
Shouldn't have let

507
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,640
you drive by yourself.

508
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,570
He just got his license

509
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,570
last week.

510
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,540
Yeah.

511
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,540
Took him five tries.

512
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,880
Mom, I hit someone.

513
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,740
A pedestrian?

514
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,840
No, the driver, they just

515
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,840
brought her in here.

516
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,210
She was right over there.

517
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,210
She was bleeding real bad.

518
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,810
She's in surgery.

519
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,810
Is she gonna be all right?

520
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,290
I told Spencer the best

521
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,290
trauma surgeon in Chicago

522
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,590
is working on her.

523
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,590
What if she doesn't make it?

524
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,860
Don't worry, she...

525
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,860
She'll make it.

526
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Small liver lac.

527
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,130
Spleen is shattered.

528
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,910
Looks like a Grade 4.

529
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,840
Actively bleeding

530
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,840
from the hilum.

531
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,240
Short gastrics are avulsed,

532
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,240
as well.

533
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,710
Hey, Dr. Rhodes,

534
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,710
it's Noah.

535
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm a little busy here, Noah.

536
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,280
What do you need?

537
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,910
Yeah, I just wanted

538
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,910
to check in

539
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,390
on the status

540
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,390
of the patient.

541
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,920
I don't know yet.

542
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,580
Okay, yeah, sure.

543
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,690
It's just, um,

544
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,130
the kid who hit her

545
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,130
is really freaking out.

546
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,630
Yeah, I can't help that,

547
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,630
Noah.

548
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,180
Well, if I could just

549
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,180
tell them that

550
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,180
she's gonna be okay...

551
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,370
No.

552
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,810
Don't ever do that.

553
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,810
Wait a minute, she won't

554
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,810
consent to being tested

555
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,510
because she'd rather die

556
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,510
than have her family find out

557
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,390
that she has AIDS?

558
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,430
And you're saying

559
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,430
she's capable

560
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,430
of making rational decisions?

561
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,390
Just because you don't like

562
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,390
the decision she's making,

563
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,690
doesn't mean

564
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,690
she's incapable of making it.

565
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,700
Growing up in Africa,

566
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,700
HIV-related stigma

567
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,900
and discrimination

568
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,900
was probably

569
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,900
something she witnessed

570
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,670
on a daily basis.

571
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,440
Is that her aunt?

572
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,440
Vera.

573
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,570
Abena lives with her.

574
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,540
Rest of the family

575
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,540
is back in Ghana.

576
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,100
Well, she knows

577
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,100
she's not being forced

578
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,480
to tell her aunt, right?

579
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,540
She understands we have

580
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,540
strict privacy rules here.

581
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,710
Doesn't matter.

582
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,350
She's convinced that

583
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,350
if she takes the test,

584
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,820
starts the antiretrovirals,

585
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,820
that they'll figure it out.

586
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,880
But the lesions

587
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,880
won't give her away.

588
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,760
Come on, she's living under

589
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,760
the same roof, for chrissakes.

590
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,700
If she wants to continue

591
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,700
concealing this,

592
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,670
she needs to

593
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,670
start treating it.

594
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,670
Well, you gotta convince her.

595
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,860
You have to convince her.

596
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,030
I'm sorry, I can't

597
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,030
just rubberstamp this.

598
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,470
Dr. Choi, Abena is

599
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,470
complaining of nausea.

600
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,040
Great, now she'll need

601
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,040
a GI consult.

602
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,100
Just add it to her tab.

603
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,910
Her tab?

604
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,580
Sharon, I know you're under

605
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,580
a lot of pressure, but...

606
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,310
Daniel, we're trying

607
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,310
to save her life.

608
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,810
Look, just for

609
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,810
argument's sake,

610
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,520
let's say the toxo

611
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,520
is causing impairment,

612
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,060
and we force the test.

613
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,060
Then what?

614
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,980
Somebody shoves pills

615
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,980
down her throat

616
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,150
every day

617
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,150
for the rest of her life?

618
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,660
I mean, no court is

619
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,660
ever going to mandate...

620
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,460
Please someone help!

621
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,460
Please!

622
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,500
My daughter,

623
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,500
she can't breathe.

624
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,560
Okay.

625
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Hey, Denise.

626
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Look at me.

627
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,470
Deep breaths for me, okay?

628
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,470
In and out.

629
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,280
Can you squeeze my hand?

630
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,910
Can you lift your arms

631
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,910
for me?

632
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,580
What's happening?

633
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,910
The paralysis is

634
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,910
moving up her spine.

635
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,980
10 of etomidate

636
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,980
and 50 of sux.

637
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,450
We're intubating.

638
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,290
You're gonna put

639
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,290
that down her throat?

640
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,190
Okay, why don't we give

641
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,190
the doctors some room to work?

642
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,600
No, please, please,

643
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,600
I wanna stay with my daughter.

644
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,130
It's okay,

645
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,130
we'll stay right here.

646
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,260
Okay.

647
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,350
Couldn't do much of a neuro

648
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,350
exam with her sedated

649
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,350
and intubated,

650
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,190
but if I had to guess,

651
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,190
I'd say she's paralyzed.

652
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,120
Thanks, Sam.

653
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,150
Doing the hokey pokey there,

654
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,150
Halstead?

655
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,430
Huh?

656
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,430
Your foot.

657
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,330
Oh. Yeah,

658
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,330
it just fell asleep.

659
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,370
Kinda banged it this...

660
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,370
No, never mind.

661
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,090
You were right.

662
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,970
We should have started IVIG

663
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,970
and plasma exchange

664
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,970
way earlier.

665
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,630
It was a mistake to wait.

666
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,940
No, you called it.

667
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,940
I don't think it is

668
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,940
GBS anymore.

669
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,410
It's progressing too rapidly.

670
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,410
Nothing else it could be.

671
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,540
I mean, GBS is the only thing

672
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,540
on our differential

673
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,810
that makes a modicum of sense.

674
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,750
When did ED doctors get

675
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,750
so polite with each other?

676
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,950
Are you two dating

677
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,950
or something?

678
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,280
Never mind.

679
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,580
Start with IVIG

680
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,580
and plasmapheresis.

681
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,460
At this point I'm ready to

682
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,460
throw the kitchen sink

683
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,460
at this thing.

684
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,190
Page me when

685
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,190
her sedation wears off.

686
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,830
You okay?

687
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,830
Yeah.

688
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,970
Keep your head still.

689
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,200
Eyes forward for me.

690
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,470
Hey there, folks,

691
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,470
I'm Dr. Rhodes.

692
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,540
Spencer, we met when

693
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,540
you first came in...

694
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,880
Did she make it?

695
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,270
Due to patient

696
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,270
confidentiality,

697
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,120
I can't give you any details,

698
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,120
but I did wanna let you know,

699
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,350
she pulled through.

700
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,050
Can I visit her?

701
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,190
Please, I just wanna tell her

702
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,190
that I'm sorry.

703
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,920
Would that be all right?

704
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,530
I'll tell you what,

705
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,530
I'll check with her husband.

706
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,730
She's just coming off of

707
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,730
anesthesia,

708
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
but maybe in

709
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
an hour or two.

710
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,770
Mom, an hour or two?

711
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,070
Coach will have my head

712
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,070
if I'm late.

713
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,430
Oh, big game?

714
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,800
Regionals.

715
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,680
We can't leave

716
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,680
your brother here alone.

717
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,710
Spencer's fine.

718
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,940
Really, and I'll keep an eye

719
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,940
on him while you're gone.

720
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,010
Yeah.

721
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,150
Go. Stay for the game.

722
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,120
Are you sure you're gonna

723
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,120
be okay, honey?

724
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,860
I'm fine.

725
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,750
Thank you, Dr. Sexton.

726
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,600
Thanks, Doc.

727
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,600
Of course.

728
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,170
Excuse me, Dr. Reese.

729
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,370
You drive a silver

730
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,370
Nissan Versa, right?

731
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,440
Yeah, that's my car.

732
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,440
Why?

733
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,150
That's all that's missing?

734
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,090
Just my gym bag.

735
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,090
Nothing of any value.

736
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,350
You know,

737
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,350
I know who did this.

738
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,120
Um, her name is Edith Lake.

739
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,120
She slashed my tires, too.

740
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,280
Hold on a sec.

741
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,920
You witnessed this person

742
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,920
slashing your tire?

743
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,730
No, no, but she...

744
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,730
And how do you know her?

745
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,630
She came into the ED

746
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,630
a few weeks back.

747
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,330
Uh, assaulted me.

748
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,530
Did you report it?

749
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,130
I am reporting it now.

750
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,270
Dr. Reese, I don't think

751
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,270
it was that lady.

752
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,470
This is the fourth break-in

753
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,470
we've had this month.

754
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,640
Whoever did this

755
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,640
probably wasn't targeting

756
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,640
your car in particular.

757
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,910
Well, aren't you gonna dust

758
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,910
for fingerprints?

759
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,710
Here's the address

760
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,710
of the website

761
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,810
to retrieve your

762
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,810
police report.

763
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,150
You can use it to file

764
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,150
a claim with your insurance.

765
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,790
We know she has AIDS.

766
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,790
She knows she has AIDS.

767
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,160
Her aunt must know on some

768
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,160
level, this isn't the flu.

769
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,830
Yeah,

770
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,830
but there's a difference

771
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,830
between knowing something

772
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,830
and saying it out loud.

773
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,230
You say it out loud,

774
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,230
and it's real.

775
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,570
April, it's real whether

776
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,570
it's said or not.

777
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,810
She's having

778
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,810
trouble breathing.

779
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,310
Ma'am, please step back.

780
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,810
Ma'am, please put these on.

781
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,810
Why?

782
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,120
Is she contagious?

783
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,320
It's a universal precaution.

784
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,550
She's got fluid in her lungs.

785
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,960
Sats down to 86.

786
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,990
Okay, let's get her on a mask

787
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,990
with 15 liters.

788
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,970
Let's get a sputum sample

789
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,970
and another chest X-ray.

790
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,130
And call pulmonology.

791
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,900
Excuse me.

792
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,500
Ma'am, please put these on

793
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,500
before you touch your niece.

794
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,100
I'm doing everything I can.

795
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,180
Any improvement?

796
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,350
Denise's Hughes functional

797
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,350
grade is still at 5.

798
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,150
Is she triggering the vent?

799
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,150
No.

800
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,560
The IVIG isn't working.

801
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,730
It's way too soon

802
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,730
to know that.

803
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,730
Give it some time.

804
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,230
I think we need to try

805
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,230
immunosuppressant...

806
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,330
Are you okay?

807
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,330
What the...

808
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,460
What happened?

809
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,600
I don't know.

810
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,000
My foot went numb,

811
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,000
and just gave out.

812
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,750
And I can't move my foot.

813
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,580
All right.

814
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,880
Where are we going, Doc?

815
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,190
Dr. Rhodes got the A-okay

816
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,190
from Melody's husband.

817
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,790
Is that the name

818
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,790
of the woman I hit?

819
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,000
Melody?

820
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah.

821
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,770
Okay, ready to roll?

822
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,770
Yeah.

823
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,330
All right, so now

824
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,330
you can be honest.

825
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
One on one,

826
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
you or your brother?

827
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,830
Definitely me.

828
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,070
You okay, buddy?

829
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,640
Yeah.

830
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,810
I can get you a Tylenol.

831
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,810
Tylenol, please.

832
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,870
Nah, nah. It's...

833
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,940
It's just a...

834
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,420
Stress headache.

835
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,890
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

836
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,890
Spencer?

837
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,890
Spencer.

838
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,320
No pulse.

839
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,320
I need a crash cart over here.

840
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,190
Coming right away.

841
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,190
Here we go.

842
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,650
Left pupil's blown.

843
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,900
Start bagging, amp of epi.

844
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,900
What happened?

845
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,490
I don't know,

846
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,490
he was talking one second,

847
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,730
said he had a headache,

848
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
and then he started

849
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
slurring his words.

850
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,700
All right, charge to 200.

851
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,630
Charging.

852
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,470
Clear.

853
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,080
Resume compressions.

854
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,080
Another amp of epi.

855
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,610
Charge 200 again.

856
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,980
Charged.

857
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,170
Clear.

858
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,190
Asystole.

859
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,220
Come on, bud.

860
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,220
Come on.

861
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,190
Come on.

862
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,460
Noah.

863
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,600
Hey, come on, Spencer.

864
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,260
Noah, stop.

865
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,110
Time of death, 16:29.

866
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,070
We won't know for sure until

867
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,070
we get the ME's report,

868
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,070
but from the looks of it,

869
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,230
I'd say it was

870
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,230
a delayed epidural hematoma.

871
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,640
But Spencer's...

872
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,640
Spencer's CTs were clean,

873
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,640
and...

874
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,040
Must've developed

875
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,040
after the initial scan.

876
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,950
It happens sometimes, Noah.

877
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,950
There's no way

878
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,950
to predict or prevent it.

879
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,580
Maggie, let's get the mom in

880
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,580
here so we can break the news.

881
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,190
I told her Spencer

882
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,190
was gonna be okay.

883
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,890
I don't know what

884
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,890
I'm gonna say to her now.

885
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,360
I can break the news,

886
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,360
if you want.

887
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,800
No.

888
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,300
I appreciate the offer,

889
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,300
Dr. Rhodes,

890
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,540
but I really

891
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,540
should do it.

892
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,580
I'll go lean on the ME

893
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,580
for a cause of death.

894
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,260
No.

895
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,630
I can't feel anything, Sam.

896
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,840
All right, press down on the

897
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,840
gas pedal as hard as you can.

898
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,940
Have you been ill

899
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,940
at all recently?

900
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,980
Is it possible

901
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,980
you're immunocompromised?

902
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,640
How about any interactions

903
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,640
with the patient?

904
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,710
Any needle sticks?

905
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,380
Is there a chance

906
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,380
you exchanged

907
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,380
fluids somehow or...

908
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,150
The only direct contact

909
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,150
I had with the patient

910
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,660
was when she collapsed.

911
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,660
I carried her into the ED.

912
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,650
How about you?

913
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,650
Are you experiencing

914
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,650
any numbness

915
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,850
or tingling in

916
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,850
your lower extremities?

917
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,920
No.

918
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,290
We haven't even established

919
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,290
what Denise has yet,

920
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,830
let alone if it's contagious.

921
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,960
You think it's a coincidence,

922
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,960
your paralysis?

923
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,360
Where are you

924
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,360
with your differential?

925
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,730
We were operating

926
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,730
under the hypothesis

927
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,040
that she had

928
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,040
Guillain-Barré syndrome.

929
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,600
Well, that's obviously

930
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,600
a dead end.

931
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,540
GBS isn't contagious.

932
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,280
I'm gonna get started

933
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,280
on the LP.

934
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,240
Collect everything you've got

935
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,240
thus far on the girl.

936
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,650
Every test you gave her,

937
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,650
you give him.

938
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,310
See if we can find

939
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,310
any patterns.

940
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,480
Now, Dr. Manning.

941
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,900
Let's give her

942
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,900
another bolus of fluids.

943
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,410
She's still

944
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,410
pretty dehydrated.

945
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,950
Sats aren't improving much.

946
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,700
Dr. Choi.

947
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,270
How is Abena doing?

948
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,430
Now it looks like

949
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,430
she's developing

950
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,430
a pulmonary...

951
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,900
Mr. Doctor.

952
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,300
My niece isn't getting

953
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,300
any better.

954
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,140
How can this be the flu?

955
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,270
Ma'am, I completely

956
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,270
understand your frustration.

957
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,610
Don't think I don't know

958
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,610
what's going on here.

959
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,750
We are immigrants

960
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,750
with no insurance,

961
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,190
so you think you don't have

962
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,190
to give us your best care.

963
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,850
Ms. Kwemo, I assure you we're

964
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,850
doing everything

965
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,850
in our power...

966
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,090
Are you?

967
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,290
I don't believe that.

968
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,600
You're right, Ms. Kwemo.

969
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,600
There's more we could do.

970
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,140
There are other tests

971
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,140
we could run.

972
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,800
Tests we need

973
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,800
Abena's consent for.

974
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,740
Dr. Choi, I need to speak

975
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,740
with you in private

976
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,740
for a moment.

977
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,210
Excuse us, please.

978
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,520
You know, Dr. Choi, there's

979
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,520
a pretty important statute,

980
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,180
known as

981
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,180
the HIPAA privacy rule,

982
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,020
that protects every patient's

983
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,020
personal health information

984
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,260
from being shared

985
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,260
with anybody else.

986
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,830
You heard her, Ms. Goodwin.

987
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,100
She wants us

988
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,100
to help her niece.

989
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,870
Still, it's not

990
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,870
for you to tell her.

991
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,240
That's the rule.

992
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,680
With all due respect,

993
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,810
if all we were gonna do

994
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,810
is follow the rules,

995
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,940
we should've done

996
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,940
what Stohl wanted,

997
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,880
and turfed her back

998
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,880
to East Mercy.

999
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,560
Hey, Maggie told me

1000
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,560
about your car.

1001
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,760
Those punks.

1002
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,890
You know,

1003
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,890
I've got this great guy,

1004
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,200
glass, body, repairs.

1005
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,290
Do you wanna give him a call?

1006
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,570
I should really call

1007
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,570
my insurance company.

1008
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,010
Hold off on that.

1009
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,470
Come on, join me on rounds.

1010
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,100
Take your mind off

1011
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,100
of it for a bit.

1012
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,280
I want you to meet

1013
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,280
this Jane Doe.

1014
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,750
You were supposed to

1015
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,750
stay with him.

1016
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,750
You were the one that was...

1017
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,980
You were supposed

1018
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,980
to stay with him...

1019
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,040
You know what?

1020
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,710
I really should get a head

1021
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,710
start with the insurance.

1022
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,340
It always takes forever

1023
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,340
to reach a human.

1024
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,250
All right.

1025
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,720
When you were knocking on the

1026
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,720
other side of the bathroom...

1027
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,730
Spencer's family

1028
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,730
just got here.

1029
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,610
They already suspect

1030
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,610
it's bad news.

1031
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,040
Just don't keep them

1032
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,040
waiting too long.

1033
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,210
Okay.

1034
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,730
Something happened

1035
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,730
to Spencer, didn't it?

1036
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,300
He suffered a cardiac arrest.

1037
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,970
We think there

1038
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,970
might have been

1039
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,710
an acute hemorrhage

1040
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,710
in his brain.

1041
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,670
What are you saying?

1042
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,250
That he's dead?

1043
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,120
We tried our best to

1044
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,120
resuscitate him,

1045
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,710
but there was

1046
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,710
nothing we could do.

1047
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,680
Oh... Oh, my God.

1048
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,290
My...

1049
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,830
My baby boy.

1050
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,600
Oh, God. Oh!

1051
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,130
Ma'am.

1052
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,260
I... I am so sorry

1053
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,260
for your loss.

1054
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,800
You said he would be okay.

1055
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,310
At the time, given the

1056
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,310
information that I knew...

1057
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,500
You killed him.

1058
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,170
I had every reason

1059
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,170
to believe...

1060
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,070
I'm sorry!

1061
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,070
You killed my baby brother.

1062
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,640
You killed him!

1063
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,640
Stop, stop, man.

1064
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,910
Terrance, stop!

1065
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,280
Security!

1066
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,280
Someone, we need help!

1067
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,390
Hey! Hey!

1068
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,430
Get off, get off, get off.

1069
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,460
Oh, my God!

1070
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,460
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1071
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,460
Shh, shh.

1072
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,520
Are you okay?

1073
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,840
That kid got you pretty good.

1074
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,200
Yeah.

1075
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,470
You're looking at two,

1076
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,470
three stitches, tops.

1077
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,180
PD wants to know if you

1078
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,180
wanna press charges, Noah.

1079
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,770
Well, of course he does.

1080
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,770
He was assaulted.

1081
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,080
I asked Noah.

1082
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,910
Nah, I don't wanna

1083
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,910
press charges.

1084
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,480
That family has already

1085
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,480
been through enough.

1086
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,190
Okay.

1087
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,860
You're gonna let him

1088
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,860
get away with this?

1089
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
Sarah, he just found out

1090
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
his brother died.

1091
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,030
How is he supposed to respond?

1092
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,030
Not like that.

1093
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,930
Maggie.

1094
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,930
Mmm-hmm, wait a second...

1095
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,100
Maggie, why wasn't security

1096
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,100
in the room from the start?

1097
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,510
That's not

1098
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,510
the established protocol.

1099
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,010
Well, it should be, okay?

1100
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,010
Reactions to a loved one's

1101
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,010
death can be unpredictable.

1102
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,950
There should always

1103
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,950
be a guard nearby

1104
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,950
when a family member

1105
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,950
is being informed.

1106
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,150
How are we supposed

1107
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,150
to do our jobs

1108
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,520
if we don't feel safe

1109
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,520
and protected?

1110
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,040
Hi, do you mind if I come in?

1111
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,610
My name is Sharon Goodwin.

1112
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,810
I'm in charge of

1113
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,810
Patient and Medical Services

1114
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,970
here at Gaffney.

1115
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,750
Are you the boss?

1116
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,650
Uh, something like that.

1117
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,760
Where's your aunt?

1118
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,760
Cafeteria.

1119
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,450
Went to get dinner.

1120
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,450
Ah.

1121
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,890
Uh, I'd like to share

1122
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,890
something with you.

1123
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,760
Okay.

1124
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,930
Marie Castilla.

1125
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,010
Very bright.

1126
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,370
Expert Scrabble player.

1127
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,850
Beat me every time.

1128
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,250
That's Danny Dimoulas.

1129
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,980
Had this big baritone laugh.

1130
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,580
It would just shake the floor.

1131
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,200
Sometimes I still hear it.

1132
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,960
Felix Ramadei.

1133
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,840
He was a huge sci-fi nerd.

1134
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,600
Wouldn't have much to say,

1135
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,000
but if you got him talking

1136
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,110
about galaxies

1137
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,110
and space travel, well,

1138
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,080
there went

1139
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,080
your whole afternoon.

1140
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,620
These are your patients?

1141
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,090
They were my patients, yes.

1142
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,290
They died in the '80s.

1143
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,750
I was their nurse.

1144
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,730
It was a terrifying time.

1145
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,370
Some days we lost two,

1146
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,370
three patients.

1147
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,500
See, we barely understood

1148
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,500
what AIDS was back then,

1149
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,300
let alone how to treat it.

1150
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't want to see

1151
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,000
these anymore.

1152
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,740
I know.

1153
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,740
It's hard, isn't it?

1154
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,910
I could only imagine

1155
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,910
who they might've been,

1156
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,450
what they might've done

1157
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,450
with their lives,

1158
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,120
if they had a chance.

1159
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,350
They had such promise.

1160
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,560
These patients,

1161
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,560
how many of them died alone

1162
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,120
without their families?

1163
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,970
Far, far too many.

1164
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,800
I don't want to live

1165
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,800
without my family.

1166
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,780
And I'm sure they don't want

1167
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,780
to live without you.

1168
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,370
I can see it in

1169
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,370
your aunt's eyes.

1170
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,750
I know that look.

1171
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,080
She's terrified of losing you.

1172
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,550
You're so young, Abena.

1173
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,260
Don't rob yourself of a future

1174
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,000
that these young people

1175
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,000
could only dream about.

1176
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,430
I lost a lot of patients.

1177
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,310
I don't wanna add you

1178
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,310
to this folder.

1179
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,300
April,

1180
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,300
Abena is asking for you.

1181
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,210
I'll take the test.

1182
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,680
Abena, I need verbal

1183
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,680
confirmation as to what test.

1184
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,190
I want to take the HIV test.

1185
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,850
These just came in

1186
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,850
from Radiology.

1187
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,010
Finally.

1188
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,010
Thank you.

1189
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,940
Damn, I'm not seeing anything.

1190
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,920
Why was Will

1191
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,920
getting a brain MRI?

1192
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,220
What's going on, Natalie?

1193
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,380
Is he okay?

1194
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,560
Dr. Manning.

1195
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,560
Yeah.

1196
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,430
The PICU called.

1197
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,430
It's your patient, Denise.

1198
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,930
They need you upstairs.

1199
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,690
All of a sudden I saw

1200
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,690
her leg move,

1201
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,500
and then she

1202
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,500
reached out for me.

1203
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,870
Reflexes are

1204
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,870
all back to normal.

1205
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,610
Denise, I'm gonna have you

1206
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,610
stand for me now, okay?

1207
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,410
That's great.

1208
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,970
All right, now I'm gonna

1209
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,970
have you walk to me,

1210
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,520
and I'm gonna

1211
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,520
let go, all right?

1212
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,920
Okay.

1213
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,920
Let's go.

1214
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,750
Sam, what am I missing?

1215
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,500
Best guess?

1216
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,500
Some kind of toxin

1217
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,590
needed to work

1218
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,590
its way out of her system.

1219
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,070
But how that got to Will?

1220
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,070
I have no idea.

1221
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,840
Contagion is one thing,

1222
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,300
but this is more

1223
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,300
like a game of tag.

1224
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,100
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

1225
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,480
Well, tag, now you're it.

1226
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,350
Nat, what are you doing?

1227
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,350
You shouldn't be...

1228
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,680
Just look at your MRI.

1229
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,550
You see that bump above

1230
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,550
your coronal suture?

1231
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,610
Yeah.

1232
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,630
First I thought it

1233
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,630
was a mole, but...

1234
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,990
What is it?

1235
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,990
Ah, there it is.

1236
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,400
There what is?

1237
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,560
Nat.

1238
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,760
Gotcha.

1239
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,760
Ow!

1240
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,370
What is that? A tick?

1241
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,370
Uh-huh.

1242
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,700
Wait, is this Lyme disease?

1243
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,430
Nope. Tick paralysis.

1244
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,010
The salivary gland

1245
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,010
produces a nerve toxin.

1246
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,810
This guy came all the way from

1247
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,810
Australia, courtesy of Denise.

1248
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,580
It must've detached

1249
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,580
from her scalp,

1250
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,910
but stayed in her hair,

1251
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,080
and when you picked her up,

1252
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,080
it attached to you.

1253
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,820
But if it was off her by

1254
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,820
the time we got Denise

1255
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,820
into the ED,

1256
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,980
how come the paralysis

1257
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,980
kept moving up her body?

1258
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,960
It typically worsens

1259
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,960
for a few hours,

1260
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,620
once the tick is removed.

1261
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,360
So I'm not out

1262
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,360
of the woods yet.

1263
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,870
Nope, but the paralysis

1264
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,870
is mass-dependent,

1265
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,960
so it shouldn't move

1266
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,960
as quickly up your body.

1267
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,730
But you still have

1268
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,730
to spend the night in the ICU.

1269
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,070
I gotta get this to Serology.

1270
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,670
Don't move.

1271
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,140
Ha-ha.

1272
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,310
Hey, you need

1273
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,310
a ride somewhere?

1274
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,980
No, no, thank you.

1275
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,980
I have a ride.

1276
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,880
You know, I've been wondering

1277
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,720
about something you said

1278
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,720
earlier today about...

1279
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,250
About not feeling

1280
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,250
safe in the ED.

1281
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,260
It was just

1282
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,260
an innocuous comment.

1283
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,760
Heat of the moment.

1284
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,060
Reese, you and me,

1285
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,060
we're both...

1286
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,930
We're both

1287
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,930
psychiatrists, right?

1288
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,730
"Innocuous comment,"

1289
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,730
really?

1290
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,040
Dr. Charles, I know today

1291
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,040
was not my finest hour, but...

1292
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,640
What with my car getting

1293
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,640
broken into and Noah

1294
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,640
getting punched...

1295
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,970
Sarah, I get it.

1296
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,810
You know, this can be

1297
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,810
a very chaotic,

1298
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,280
often downright scary

1299
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,280
work environment.

1300
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,880
And you know what? It's not

1301
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,880
necessarily for everybody.

1302
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,860
I chose emergency psychiatry

1303
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,590
because it was the right thing

1304
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,590
for me at the time.

1305
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,650
I'm sorry,

1306
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,650
are you reassigning me?

1307
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,920
Of course not.

1308
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,590
I'm just saying

1309
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,590
there are other options...

1310
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,530
No. Not for me.

1311
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,160
I want to be in the ED.

1312
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,830
Okay.

1313
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,530
Look, I promise

1314
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,530
we won't need to

1315
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,700
have this

1316
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,700
conversation again.

1317
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,500
I had a bad day.

1318
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,500
That's all.

1319
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,870
It's nothing

1320
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,870
I can't deal with.

1321
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,750
I got lucky, I guess.

1322
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,920
My paralysis hasn't progressed

1323
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,920
up past my knees.

1324
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,420
Lucky?

1325
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,580
Getting latched on by a tick?

1326
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,120
Must've been the red hair.

1327
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,620
There's not a creature in

1328
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,620
the world that can

1329
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,620
resist this.

1330
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,630
That's very true.

1331
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,530
I gotta go.

1332
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,230
Doris is gonna kill me

1333
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,230
if I'm late to her party.

1334
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,800
Thanks, Maggie.

1335
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,800
Have fun.

1336
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,170
Bye.

1337
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,720
Well, you know

1338
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,720
what the best part

1339
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,310
about being in an

1340
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,310
isolation room is?

1341
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,320
The privacy.

1342
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,120
I don't have to be home

1343
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,120
for another couple of hours.

1344
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,260
Oh, really?

1345
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,260
Mmm-hmm.

1346
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,760
Hmm.

1347
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,730
So, you can still feel

1348
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,730
everything above the knees?

1349
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,400
We should

1350
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,400
probably make sure.

1351
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,890
How do you think

1352
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,890
it's going in there?

1353
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,560
I can't tell.

1354
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,880
I mean,

1355
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,880
Vera's still in there.

1356
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,160
She hasn't left.

1357
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,460
That's a good sign, right?

1358
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,460
Yeah.

1359
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,660
Coming, April?

1360
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,960
Yeah, um,

1361
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,040
my boyfriend and I

1362
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,040
will meet you there.

1363
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,970
Good for you.

1364
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,970
Pick up your jaw, Doris.

1365
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,120
What changed?

1366
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,810
Good night.

1367
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,320
Noah.

1368
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,490
Are you okay?

1369
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,960
You're still up

1370
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,960
for Doris' party?

1371
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,300
Nah, I'm...

1372
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm just gonna head home.

1373
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,880
We're the next party of two.

1374
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,870
That's pretty.

1375
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,870
You should get it.

1376
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,580
Meh, I have

1377
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,580
more than enough scarves.

1378
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,950
Oh, this is us.

1379
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,950
Oh.

1380
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,160
You coming?

1381
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,320
Yeah.

1382
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,210
Could I help you, ma'am?

1383
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,410
Um, yeah,

1384
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,410
can you unlock this case?

1385
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,610
Sure.

1386
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,610
You have a FOID card?

1387
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,880
A FOID card?

1388
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,820
A Firearm Owners

1389
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,820
Identification card?

1390
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,820
The application takes

1391
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,820
a couple of months to process.

1392
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,790
That long?

1393
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,790
It's required.

1394
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,720
Uh, we could start

1395
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,720
the paperwork tonight,

1396
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,060
but in the meantime,

1397
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,760
pepper spray

1398
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,760
can make a gal feel safe.
