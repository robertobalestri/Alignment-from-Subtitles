1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,260
I would've

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,260
done the dishes.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,200
You cooked, it's only fair

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,200
that I clean.

5
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,460
It takes you longer

6
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,460
to get ready.

7
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,560
Is that what this is

8
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,560
really about?

9
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,370
You just being considerate?

10
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,430
What do you mean?

11
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,570
Don't think I don't notice.

12
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,070
What?

13
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,070
Navy OCD.

14
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,470
Every single time I wash

15
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,470
a dish, you come behind me

16
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,040
to wash it again.

17
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,040
I do that?

18
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,380
Yes, you do.

19
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,380
No, I don't.

20
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,640
Yes, you do.

21
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,640
I don't do that.

22
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,540
Ethan.

23
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,010
Em, what's going on?

24
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,650
Uh, I got evicted.

25
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,010
What happened this time?

26
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,350
I didn't pay the rent.

27
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,350
Hmm.

28
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,610
It was an act of protest.

29
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,750
The landlord wouldn't fix

30
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,750
the sink.

31
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,590
That's not right.

32
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,360
Can I crash at your place?

33
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,360
Please?

34
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,630
No.

35
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,630
Just for a couple days.

36
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,690
No!

37
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,130
Ethan.

38
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,500
This is your sister.

39
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,970
What is she supposed to do?

40
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,970
Sleep on the street?

41
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,550
There's no one else

42
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,550
you can stay with?

43
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,480
No.

44
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,050
The place is clean.

45
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,790
I expect to find it that way

46
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,790
when we get home.

47
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,660
You will.

48
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,660
That means no friends.

49
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,860
No parties.

50
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,860
I promise.

51
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,830
Ah, thank you, thank you.

52
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,730
Thank you, thank you,

53
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,730
thank you.

54
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,770
You happy?

55
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,040
Please!

56
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,040
My daughter needs help!

57
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,350
Can you help us?

58
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,050
Please.

59
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,530
I don't know what's wrong

60
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,530
with her.

61
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

62
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,360
Take it easy.

63
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,360
I'm not gonna hurt you.

64
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,060
Dr. Charles.

65
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,640
Dr. Haywood.

66
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,640
Are you all right?

67
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,060
No, I'm not all right.

68
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm having ectopic heartbeats.

69
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,470
They just doubled my Lasix.

70
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,450
What do I need to do for you

71
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,450
to put me on that

72
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,450
transplant list?

73
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,570
Look, as we discussed,

74
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,310
I can't put anyone

75
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,310
on the list.

76
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,980
I just make a recommendation.

77
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,290
Have you thought about...

78
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,290
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

79
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,350
I get it.

80
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,320
I know what you want me to do.

81
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,630
Bob.

82
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,470
Bob.

83
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,730
Sarah.

84
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,810
I reconnected with you only

85
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,810
to take advantage of you,

86
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,340
and that did not work out.

87
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,610
I'm no longer asking you

88
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,610
to take care of me

89
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,340
or support me.

90
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,680
I no longer want to be a part

91
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,680
of your life.

92
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,650
We're done.

93
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,780
It's not personal.

94
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,780
It's just the way I'm wired.

95
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,790
Understand?

96
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,680
Good.

97
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,450
There.

98
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,330
Honesty. Self-sufficiency.

99
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,660
Fiscal responsibility.

100
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,860
I think I checked

101
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,860
all the boxes.

102
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,370
I need a psych consult.

103
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,000
Twenty-eight-year-old female,

104
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,410
father found her tied to a bed

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,410
at his ex-wife's house.

106
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,350
Some lacerations,

107
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,350
pressure sores.

108
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,680
She's extremely dehydrated.

109
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,580
Dr. Reese, if you need

110
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,580
to take a moment...

111
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,520
No, no.

112
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,520
No, I'm fine.

113
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm Dr. Charles.

114
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,890
Can you tell me what happened

115
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,890
to your daughter?

116
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,370
It's my crazy ex-wife.

117
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,300
She's been unbalanced before,

118
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,300
but...

119
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,500
Where's my daughter?

120
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,470
Ma'am, you can't...

121
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,470
Katherine!

122
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,530
You were keeping her

123
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,530
prisoner.

124
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,740
Are you insane?

125
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,680
You had no right

126
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,680
to kidnap her.

127
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,370
My daughter needs to be

128
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,370
discharged immediately.

129
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,780
I'm afraid we can't do that.

130
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,480
It's nothing you can

131
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,480
help her with.

132
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,680
I need to get her home now.

133
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,340
You're torturing her!

134
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,290
No, I am not the one

135
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,290
who's harming her.

136
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,820
Who is?

137
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,820
Who is harming her?

138
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,420
The demon

139
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,620
we've been trying

140
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,620
to exorcise.

141
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,360
The mom-wrath! Mom-wrath!

142
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,490
You see?

143
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,770
My daughter is possessed!

144
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,820
She's possessed!

145
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,040
So Ms. Campbell, when did

146
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,040
your daughter

147
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,370
start having these symptoms?

148
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,440
About nine months ago.

149
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,420
And was she experiencing any

150
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,420
emotional stress at the time?

151
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,780
I'm sorry, why are you

152
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,780
speaking to her

153
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,580
as if she's a rational person?

154
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,640
Mr. Ferris, please.

155
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,620
No.

156
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,620
She had just made partner

157
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,520
at her firm,

158
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,520
was seeing a nice guy.

159
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,620
Then out of nowhere, she began

160
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,620
acting strangely.

161
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,090
She couldn't leave the house,

162
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,090
couldn't work.

163
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,290
She couldn't take care

164
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,290
of herself,

165
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,420
and so I brought her home.

166
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,860
There are a couple of tests

167
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,860
that I'd like to run.

168
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,920
There's no point.

169
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,260
I have taken her to countless

170
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,260
doctors, psychiatrists.

171
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,800
They have run all the tests.

172
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,770
No one can figure out

173
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,770
what is wrong with her.

174
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,770
So exorcism is the answer.

175
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,540
It was starting to work.

176
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,540
She was starting to come back.

177
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,840
Look, I am not

178
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,840
a religious person.

179
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,880
But I have exhausted

180
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,880
every other option.

181
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,140
Katherine wets the bed.

182
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,180
She speaks in tongues,

183
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,580
shouts at empty rooms.

184
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,250
There is no such thing

185
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,250
as demonic possession!

186
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,290
I am not interested

187
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,290
in your opinion.

188
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,990
I want her discharged

189
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,990
immediately.

190
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,690
I think it's safe to say

191
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,690
that your daughter

192
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,890
is a potential threat

193
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,890
to herself,

194
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,520
and it would be my advice

195
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,520
to commit her,

196
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,690
at least temporarily until we

197
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,690
can figure out

198
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,690
what's going on.

199
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,290
I have power of attorney over

200
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,290
my daughter's medical care,

201
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,240
and if you put her on

202
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,240
a psychiatric hold,

203
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,430
I will have my lawyer

204
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,430
down here.

205
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,100
Ms. Campbell, your daughter

206
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,100
is severely dehydrated

207
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,370
and malnourished.

208
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,910
At least let us hang

209
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,910
some IV fluids

210
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,540
until we stabilize her.

211
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,510
As soon as she's rehydrated,

212
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,510
I am taking her home.

213
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,920
Dr. Reese, can you please

214
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,920
take Mr. Ferris

215
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,510
to the consultation room?

216
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,920
Thank you.

217
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,150
I love my daughter.

218
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,130
I am sure that you have her

219
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,130
best interest at heart.

220
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,720
Thank you.

221
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,720
We are going to take care

222
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,530
of Katherine as quickly

223
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,530
as we possibly can.

224
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,060
In the meantime,

225
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,060
why don't you try

226
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,500
and get yourself comfortable

227
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,500
in the waiting room.

228
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,830
Thank you.

229
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,380
What are you thinking?

230
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,450
Um, well, the mom seems

231
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,450
kind of rational.

232
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Last possession case

233
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
I read about,

234
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,010
the underlying issue

235
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,010
was actually neurological.

236
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,480
I think maybe we could sneak

237
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,480
her in for a quick MRI,

238
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
see if we can cross it

239
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
off the list?

240
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
Yeah, I'll let radiology know

241
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
she's coming.

242
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,290
Okay.

243
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,230
Foreign.

244
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,770
I was gonna grab a cup

245
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,770
of coffee.

246
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,230
You free?

247
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,830
Oh, thanks, but I actually

248
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,830
just had

249
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,970
my third cup of the day.

250
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,340
Think I've had

251
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,340
enough caffeine.

252
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,110
Probably.

253
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,170
Excuse me.

254
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,880
Uh, Dr. Frisch is on her way,

255
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,210
but can someone take a look at

256
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,210
my daughter?

257
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,190
Her fever seems worse.

258
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,190
Sure.

259
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,520
I'll see you later.

260
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,320
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

261
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,390
It's Lily.

262
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,300
I called Dr. Frisch because

263
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,300
she was short of breath.

264
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,390
The girls are her patients.

265
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,630
Lily's fingers are cold.

266
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,730
You know,

267
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,730
when one girl's

268
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,730
sick,

269
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,740
it might be best not to keep

270
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,740
her in such close contact

271
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,140
with her sister.

272
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,340
We don't really have

273
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,340
a choice.

274
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,520
Which one's Lily?

275
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,950
Lily's on the left.

276
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,530
Hey, Maggs.

277
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,530
Hey.

278
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,590
Your hearing's today?

279
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,200
Yeah. This afternoon.

280
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,600
Ms. Goodwin wanted me to come

281
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,600
early to prep.

282
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,230
I'm sure it'll all work out.

283
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, I don't know.

284
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,540
If they decide to report me

285
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,540
to IDPH,

286
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,970
I could lose my

287
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,970
nursing license.

288
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,270
Don't go there yet.

289
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,270
Yeah.

290
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,040
Thanks.

291
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,040
Um, Mr. Blalock?

292
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,110
Why are you roaming around?

293
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,650
I saw you.

294
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,650
I just wanted to say hello.

295
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
Hello.

296
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
Let's get you situated.

297
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,160
You look funny out of scrubs.

298
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,060
Aren't you working today?

299
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,390
No.

300
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,390
Monique?

301
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,930
Maggie.

302
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,930
Are you back?

303
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,870
Working on it.

304
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,870
There you go.

305
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,340
Mr. Blalock has emphysema

306
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,340
and comes in regularly

307
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,840
to be treated with Atrovent

308
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,840
and Solu-Medrol.

309
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,070
Until his treatment,

310
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,070
he's weak

311
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,270
and a fall risk.

312
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,280
He should have

313
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,280
a yellow bracelet.

314
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,280
Sure. Okay.

315
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,080
You stay in bed till after

316
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,080
your treatment, Mr. Blalock.

317
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,940
Where you going?

318
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,250
Hopefully I'll see you later.

319
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,080
Okay.

320
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,880
Sharon.

321
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,880
Yeah?

322
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,220
I was just on my way up

323
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,220
to see you.

324
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,960
Head on up and make yourself

325
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,960
comfortable.

326
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,290
I'll catch up with you soon.

327
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,290
All right. Hey.

328
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,960
Todd.

329
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,300
Marcy.

330
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,300
Ms. Goodwin, hi.

331
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,110
Dr. Rhodes. Dr. Frisch.

332
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,300
I see you have met

333
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,300
the Cronin twins.

334
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,100
Yep.

335
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,100
They're scheduled for

336
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,410
separation surgery

337
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,410
in ten weeks.

338
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
The hospital has assembled

339
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
a team

340
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,440
from 12 different departments.

341
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,980
Dr. Frisch is their

342
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,980
pediatric cardiologist.

343
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,420
How are they doing?

344
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,080
I detected scattered rhonchi

345
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,080
in both of Lily's lungs.

346
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,460
Intercostal and

347
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,460
thoracoabdominal retractions.

348
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,060
I'm thinking pneumonia,

349
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,890
but I was about to order

350
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,890
a babygram and a CBC.

351
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,360
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

352
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,360
We'll handle it from here.

353
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,970
Sure.

354
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,300
Let's get 'em up

355
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,300
to the PICU.

356
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,770
I want a transthoracic echo

357
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,770
and an EKG.

358
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,780
And blood and sputum

359
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,780
cultures.

360
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
All right, you two.

361
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,510
Let's get going.

362
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,310
Mr. Tucker.

363
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,310
I'm Dr. Halstead.

364
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,120
Hello.

365
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,120
Hi.

366
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,580
Tell me how you're feeling.

367
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,490
Call me Malcolm.

368
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,490
I'm fine.

369
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,120
He gave us quite a scare.

370
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,290
I just need my antibiotics.

371
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,500
Says you've got acute

372
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,500
abdominal pain

373
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,120
and shortness of breath.

374
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,760
Just the belly pain.

375
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,600
The shortness of breath

376
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,600
came on only 'cause I knew

377
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,140
I was dropping at least

378
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,140
a grand on that

379
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,140
ambulance ride.

380
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,500
Dad, can you please stop

381
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,500
complaining

382
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,200
about the ambulance?

383
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,810
So you're not short

384
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,810
of breath?

385
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,010
Maybe a little.

386
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,010
It's probably from the drive.

387
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,550
We just drove in from

388
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,550
Cincinnati to visit our boy.

389
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,140
He just started at

390
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,140
Northwestern this fall.

391
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,780
Congratulations.

392
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,290
Thanks.

393
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,290
Good school.

394
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,660
A scholarship would've

395
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,660
been nice.

396
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,020
Malcolm.

397
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,560
Sorry.

398
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,950
Genius that I am,

399
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,560
I left my antibiotics,

400
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,560
the Flagyl,

401
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,260
at home.

402
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,170
Why are you taking Flagyl?

403
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,830
Diverticulitis.

404
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,170
Look, we're supposed to have

405
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,170
a tour of the campus

406
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,270
in a few hours, so could you

407
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,270
just refill my antibiotics

408
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,370
and we can get out of here.

409
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,570
Well, shortness of breath

410
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,570
isn't usually

411
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,340
a symptom of diverticulitis,

412
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,080
so I need to see what's going

413
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,080
on with that.

414
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,180
I want to run a few tests.

415
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,650
Whoa. What's that gonna cost?

416
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,820
Dad.

417
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,820
Stop being a pain.

418
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,620
You have insurance.

419
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,290
I just want to make sure

420
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,300
we're not dealing with

421
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,300
something else.

422
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,350
Okay.

423
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,300
But just the bare minimum.

424
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,330
This echo shows

425
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,330
significant dilation

426
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,500
of both the right

427
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,500
and left ventricles.

428
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,010
If we look here, at Twin A...

429
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,310
For the record,

430
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,310
Twin A is Lily.

431
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,280
The aortic stenosis

432
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,280
has significantly diminished

433
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,680
forward flow

434
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,880
and has compromised ejection

435
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,880
fraction to 19%.

436
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,380
You're saying, essentially,

437
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,380
that she's in heart failure.

438
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,450
She will die within

439
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,450
the next few hours

440
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,990
without intervention, yes.

441
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,080
And if she does,

442
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,080
she takes Dot with her.

443
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,790
We need to consider moving up

444
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,790
the separation surgery.

445
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,620
We're not prepared.

446
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,860
We haven't rehearsed

447
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,860
the procedure.

448
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,930
And even if we had,

449
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,930
it's not an option.

450
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,130
The surgery is scheduled for

451
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,130
when it is

452
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,800
so the twins can grow.

453
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,570
Well, I'm not taking the word

454
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,570
of a couple fellows.

455
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,030
Page Dr. Latham.

456
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,270
He's gonna tell you

457
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,270
the same thing.

458
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,110
The twins aren't robust enough

459
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,110
yet to survive the surgery.

460
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,710
Go.

461
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,530
The surgery involves

462
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,530
separating the twins'

463
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,930
chest wall and reconstructing

464
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,930
their shared atrium.

465
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,790
However, we still don't have

466
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,790
a clear enough image

467
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,420
of their liver's venous system

468
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,420
to determine

469
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,030
if it can be split.

470
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,730
In addition, Lily is now

471
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,730
immunocompromised.

472
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,330
If you had to estimate

473
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,330
the odds of success...

474
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,440
At this point?

475
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,440
That both survive?

476
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,170
Zero.

477
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,170
Lily is not strong enough.

478
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,940
But if we concentrated

479
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,940
all of our efforts on Dot,

480
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,940
would we be able to save her?

481
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,210
Yes, I believe so.

482
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,270
Hold on a second.

483
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,980
Are we actually discussing

484
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,980
terminating Lily's life?

485
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,610
We are discussing the best

486
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,610
course of action.

487
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,320
Well, if as Dr. Krasny said,

488
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,220
the problem is Lily's

489
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,220
underlying condition,

490
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,520
we should be addressing that.

491
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,580
You mean take them to

492
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,580
the cath lab?

493
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,790
Exactly.

494
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,350
We widen Lily's aortic valve,

495
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,090
increase her blood flow.

496
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,160
Too risky.

497
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,400
We still don't have

498
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,400
a real grasp

499
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,160
of the twins'

500
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,160
vascular anatomy...

501
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,260
The routing,

502
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,260
how open the lumen is.

503
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,770
We're just guessing

504
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,770
until we open them up.

505
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,280
I completely agree we need

506
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,280
a better roadmap.

507
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,310
That's why we should first

508
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,310
perform a transesophageal

509
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,310
echo.

510
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,810
You want to put the twins

511
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,810
under general anesthesia...

512
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,150
Waste one of the few hours

513
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,150
we might have left...

514
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,380
So you can get

515
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,380
a better roadmap

516
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,890
for a procedure too risky

517
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,890
to even try?

518
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,290
Dr. Latham, care to wrangle

519
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,290
your fellow?

520
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,360
Having to surrender

521
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,360
a child is tragic.

522
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,620
I'd be remiss if we didn't

523
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,620
exhaust every opportunity

524
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,490
to try to save her.

525
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,530
I second Dr. Rhodes'

526
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,530
recommendation.

527
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,200
All right.

528
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,200
Let's get the echo.

529
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,570
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker,

530
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,570
a moment.

531
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,110
If we are successful in saving

532
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,110
both the twins,

533
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,240
and the separation surgery can

534
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,240
go as scheduled,

535
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,620
I have decided to name

536
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,620
Dr. Rhodes as my second.

537
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,160
Dr. Bekker, I'd still like you

538
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,160
to be prepared as backup.

539
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,380
Of course.

540
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,290
Congratulations.

541
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,730
Thank you.

542
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,520
So I've written down

543
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,520
a few notes

544
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,260
explaining the situation.

545
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,500
It may not be necessary.

546
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,290
Peter?

547
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,360
So what if I told you

548
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,840
that when you cric'd

549
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,840
Jill Fisher,

550
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,310
you weren't acting as a nurse

551
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,310
but as a licensed paramedic?

552
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,140
I don't get it.

553
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,270
As a nurse you're not

554
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,270
permitted to cric a patient.

555
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,280
You haven't been trained

556
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,280
to do so.

557
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,570
But as a medic?

558
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,380
You received state-approved

559
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,380
training

560
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,390
on how to perform

561
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,390
a cricothyrotomy.

562
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,820
So you were not acting

563
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,820
out of scope.

564
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,230
You were acting

565
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,230
as a licensed paramedic.

566
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,350
Your license is still valid,

567
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,350
I hope.

568
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,750
Yes, I have it at home.

569
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,300
Good. Go get it.

570
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,300
Bring it to the hearing.

571
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,330
Okay, now, there is

572
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,330
a wild card.

573
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
Because if the Fishers were

574
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
to file suit, this would

575
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
all be moot,

576
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,370
and the hospital would have

577
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,370
no choice but to sanction you.

578
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,440
But there's been no

579
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,440
legal action taken,

580
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,040
so keep your fingers crossed.

581
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,480
I will. Thank you.

582
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,480
Thank you both so much.

583
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,780
It's very often

584
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,780
emotional distress

585
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,550
that triggers this kind of

586
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,550
dissociative state.

587
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,090
What kind of

588
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,090
emotional distress?

589
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,520
We were hoping

590
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,520
you could tell us.

591
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,550
To be honest,

592
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,550
we had just begun

593
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,120
to reestablish

594
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,120
a relationship.

595
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,700
I hadn't seen Kat much after

596
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,700
I split with her mother

597
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,960
twenty-two years ago.

598
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,230
Hmm. Why not?

599
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,030
Well, it was a pretty ugly

600
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,030
divorce.

601
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,340
I mean, you've seen how

602
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,340
unstable my ex-wife is.

603
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,740
After we split, she poisoned

604
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,740
my relationship with Kat.

605
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,510
And...

606
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,410
That's really

607
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,410
my biggest regret,

608
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,850
is that I let Samantha push me

609
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,850
out of my daughter's life.

610
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,240
Once I reconnected with Kat,

611
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,450
I swore to her that I would

612
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,450
never let that happen again.

613
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,450
And when was that,

614
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,450
you two reconnecting?

615
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,290
About a year ago,

616
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,290
I reached out to her.

617
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,450
And what prompted that?

618
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,130
I had a heart attack.

619
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,600
And it nearly killed me.

620
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,820
And I swore that I needed to

621
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,820
make up for lost time,

622
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,500
so I would fly in

623
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,500
once in a while.

624
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,100
We went to dinner.

625
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,240
And then she moves back in

626
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,240
with my ex-wife

627
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,510
and then stops returning

628
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,510
my calls and then

629
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,610
I get worried.

630
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,240
And so I fly out here to see

631
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,240
what's going on and...

632
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,450
And now it's all this.

633
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,530
What if Katherine's suffering

634
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,530
from severe separation

635
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,530
anxiety?

636
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,360
From her father?

637
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,340
She lost him once

638
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,340
in the divorce.

639
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,430
He has a heart attack.

640
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,430
She almost loses him again.

641
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,570
Well, according to his

642
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,570
version of events,

643
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,510
I guess that's certainly

644
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,510
possible.

645
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,510
Yeah, I don't know where it

646
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,510
leaves us, though.

647
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,210
It's not like we can get

648
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,210
someone in Katherine's state

649
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,720
to open up.

650
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,190
So Malcolm,

651
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,190
your labs are back,

652
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,630
and I don't think you were

653
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,630
correctly diagnosed.

654
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,760
How is that possible?

655
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,330
I think your

656
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,330
previous physician

657
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,770
was thrown by

658
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,770
the abdominal pain.

659
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,700
But I don't believe we're

660
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,700
looking at diverticulitis.

661
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,430
Then what are we looking at?

662
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,840
I'm not sure yet.

663
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,540
I need to get a CT

664
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,540
of your chest and abdomen.

665
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,670
No way.

666
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,650
Just discharge me, I'll figure

667
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,650
this out when I get home.

668
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,740
Wait, Dad.

669
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,740
This could be serious.

670
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm gonna have to agree

671
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,680
with your son.

672
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,520
Just get me my pills,

673
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,520
all right?

674
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,620
Just get me the hell...

675
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,750
Dad?

676
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,120
Malcolm!

677
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,730
Oh, God.

678
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,600
Lean back, Mr. Tucker.

679
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,730
Just breathe.

680
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,170
His oxygen saturation

681
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,170
is dropping.

682
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
Up his O2 to five liters.

683
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,670
What's happening?

684
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,940
There's fluid in his lungs.

685
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,070
Set me up for a chest tube.

686
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,130
Give him two of Versed.

687
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,910
Got it.

688
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,940
Hang in there.

689
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,170
Oh! What is that?

690
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,500
Lymphatic fluid.

691
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,040
It was putting pressure

692
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,040
on his lung.

693
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,740
He must have ruptured

694
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,740
his thoracic duct.

695
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,000
Ruptured? How?

696
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,070
I don't know.

697
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,310
Has he been in a car accident

698
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,310
recently?

699
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,910
No, nothing like that.

700
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,110
Well, the duct could have

701
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,110
been damaged due to

702
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,620
an inflammatory disease

703
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,620
or a tumor... Let's go.

704
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,350
Maybe heart failure.

705
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,360
You're saying he either has

706
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,360
cancer or heart failure?

707
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,830
Mrs. Tucker, these are all

708
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,830
just possibilities.

709
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,420
We need to run more tests.

710
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,620
Just help my dad!

711
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,830
Her IV bag is almost empty.

712
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,370
Clock's ticking. We're gonna

713
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,370
have to discharge her.

714
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay.

715
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,600
We got to buy

716
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,600
a little more time.

717
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,940
April, hang another bag

718
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,940
of saline.

719
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,070
Ease her off sedation.

720
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,080
I want her as lucid

721
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,080
as possible

722
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,080
when I talk to her.

723
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,140
You're gonna try

724
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,140
talk therapy?

725
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,710
I thought she was

726
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,710
too volatile for that.

727
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,680
Well, I wasn't planning on

728
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,680
necessarily getting

729
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,660
a whole lot of help from

730
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,660
Katherine.

731
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,160
You're gonna talk to

732
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,160
the demon?

733
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,460
What choice do we have?

734
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,800
If she's locked in

735
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,800
a dissociative state

736
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,330
because of some

737
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,330
repressed trauma,

738
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,630
I mean, maybe, you know,

739
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,630
the demon

740
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,960
can give us a clue that might

741
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,960
help us unlock her.

742
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,140
Did I just hear them say

743
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,080
they're going to talk to

744
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,080
a demon?

745
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,740
Speaking of which, I wonder

746
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,740
what my sister's doing.

747
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,280
Think she's burned

748
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,280
my apartment

749
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,280
down yet?

750
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,290
I actually called her

751
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,290
to check in.

752
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,980
And?

753
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,550
She wanted to know where

754
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,550
the laundry detergent is,

755
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,780
even asked if we had anything

756
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,290
we wanted her to throw

757
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,290
in the load.

758
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,790
Really? Emily?

759
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,730
Oh, ye of little faith.

760
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,600
Where do you think

761
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,600
you're going, John?

762
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,070
Just getting some

763
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,070
fresh air.

764
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,240
Uh-huh.

765
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,140
Give me the cigarette.

766
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,220
Oh, come on.

767
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,220
The pack.

768
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,060
I'm down to five a day.

769
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,060
Give me a break.

770
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,750
Seriously, John?

771
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,920
You're being treated

772
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,920
for emphysema.

773
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,990
They said that you got

775
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,990
suspended.

776
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,960
So when are you gonna get

777
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,960
unsuspended?

778
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,970
I doubt that I am.

779
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,100
What?

780
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,670
My paramedic license.

781
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,440
It was supposed

782
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,440
to get me my job back.

783
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,780
Problem is, it expired

784
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,780
two weeks ago

785
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,720
and I didn't know about it.

786
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,120
And they're going

787
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,120
to can you

788
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,120
for that?

789
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,180
This here is your calling.

790
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,720
They all gotta know that

791
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,720
by now.

792
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,860
You better get back

793
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,860
to the ED.

794
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,440
It ain't fair a little piece

795
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,440
of paper, two weeks past due,

796
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,340
gonna say whether you

797
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,340
get to be a nurse.

798
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,010
No, that ain't right.

799
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,790
Hello, Barry.

800
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,790
Maggie?

801
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,400
This is a surprise.

802
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,360
Yeah.

803
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,890
I heard about the suspension.

804
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,200
Sorry for the tough break.

805
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,470
You have a minute?

806
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,200
Sure.

807
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,200
What's on your mind?

808
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,810
You have a friend at the EMS

809
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,810
division of public health,

810
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,870
don't you?

811
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,140
I do.

812
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,080
Well, maybe he could

813
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,080
help me out?

814
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,820
My license... I missed the

815
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,820
renewal deadline by two weeks.

816
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,190
I need it to be current.

817
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,790
What are you saying?

818
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,760
What do you think I'm saying?

819
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,230
You want him to fudge

820
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,230
the date for you?

821
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,430
Two weeks.

822
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,670
I'm not gonna lose my career

823
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,670
for two weeks.

824
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,770
Well, isn't this something?

825
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,670
You weren't so keen on

826
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,670
bending the truth

827
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,180
when I was the one doing it.

828
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,740
Okay, forget it.

829
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,740
I knew this was a bad idea.

830
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,410
Hold on.

831
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,050
You need this when?

832
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,120
My hearing's in two hours.

833
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,950
I'll make the call.

834
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,810
Hey, um...

835
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,810
Hey.

836
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,070
I was just wondering if you

837
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,070
had a moment

838
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,610
to help me with a diagnosis.

839
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,610
Yeah, what's up?

840
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,610
Great.

841
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,710
I got a patient with a muddy

842
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,710
constellation of symptoms,

843
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,840
and I just can't nail down

844
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,840
the cause.

845
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,910
Okay.

846
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,350
A middle-aged guy, diagnosed

847
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,350
with diverticulitis,

848
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,020
you know, but inconsistencies

849
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,020
in his labs

850
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,890
and a sudden chylothorax

851
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,890
tells me it's not.

852
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
I agree.

853
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,020
No evidence of trauma.

854
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,370
So I'm thinking

855
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,370
either lymphoma

856
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,370
or sarcoidosis.

857
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,100
And sarcoidosis is almost

858
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,100
impossible to diagnose,

859
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,200
which is why it should always

860
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,200
be kept on the differential.

861
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,240
That is what they taught us

862
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,240
in med school.

863
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,340
Right.

864
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.

865
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,140
Anyway, uh, because

866
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,140
he's coughing up blood,

867
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm leaning toward sarcoid.

868
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,220
Um, then order an MRI

869
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,220
and a biopsy to confirm.

870
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,450
Yep, already did.

871
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,990
Well, great, it sounds like

872
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,990
you've got it

873
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,460
all under control.

874
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,090
Well, I just wasn't sure

875
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,090
if I was missing something.

876
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,500
Doesn't sound like

877
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,500
you're missing anything.

878
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,660
Look, I've got to get back

879
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,660
upstairs to my patients.

880
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,130
Okay?

881
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,040
Okay. Thanks.

882
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,040
Yeah.

883
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,210
There doesn't appear to be

884
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,210
much calcification

885
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,140
on the valve.

886
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,140
I think I can get a wire in.

887
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,200
Still too risky.

888
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,300
The odds just aren't

889
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,300
in our favor.

890
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,440
As I said earlier.

891
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,570
Taking them to the cath lab

892
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,450
is our only chance

893
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,450
to save both babies.

894
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,780
Or lose both.

895
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,480
There are umpteen things that

896
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,480
could prove fatal.

897
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,990
If the balloon ruptures,

898
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,990
or the catheter perforates

899
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,990
the heart,

900
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,580
both babies would die

901
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,580
instantly.

902
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,720
Believe me, Dr. Rhodes,

903
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,720
I share your disappointment.

904
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,390
It's not the outcome

905
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,390
any of us were hoping for.

906
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,200
But the math doesn't work.

907
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,830
I recommend separating Dot

908
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,830
from Lily immediately.

909
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,890
Let's save the one child.

910
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,300
How about we let

911
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,300
the parents

912
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,300
decide?

913
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,000
It's a tough decision we're

914
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,000
asking them to make.

915
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,770
I don't want to confuse them

916
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,770
with too many alternatives.

917
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,280
It is our duty to explain

918
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,280
both options.

919
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,970
There's only one option!

920
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,310
Separate them now

921
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,310
so Dot can live.

922
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,810
The CT team is unanimously

923
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,810
behind this recommendation.

924
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
Finally, consensus.

925
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,110
Now shall we?

926
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,970
They're being realistic.

927
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,900
Odds are near impossible

928
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,900
to save them both.

929
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,070
This is one time we shouldn't

930
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,070
be playing the odds.

931
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,680
My baby's going to die?

932
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm very sorry, but at least

933
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,920
we can save one of your girls.

934
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,390
No.

935
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,390
There's got to be

936
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,290
something else

937
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,290
that you can try.

938
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,260
Dr. Latham?

939
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,330
Connor?

940
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,530
Oh, my baby.

941
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,140
My baby.

942
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,250
It'll take us a little time

943
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,250
to get prepped.

944
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,110
Be with your girls until then.

945
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,660
Her sedation's worn off.

946
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,660
She should be awake.

947
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,130
Good luck.

948
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,340
Hi. I'm Dr. Charles.

949
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,340
This is Dr. Reese.

950
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,940
Could you...

951
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,940
Could you tell me

952
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,940
your name?

953
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,710
You're in a hospital.

954
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,350
You're safe.

955
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,590
Jub. Jub. Mom-wrath.

956
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,910
Is that your name?

957
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,090
Mom-wrath!

958
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,090
Shun-it! Shun-it!

959
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,390
Shun-it! Shun-it! Shun-it!

960
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,900
Take it easy.

961
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,950
Take...

962
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,720
Little help!

963
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,720
Little help, please!

964
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,800
Jub! Jub! Jub! Jub!

965
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,200
Push two of Versed.

966
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,500
Got it.

967
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,440
Jub! Jub! Jub! Jub!

968
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,940
Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

969
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,220
It's just gibberish.

970
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,950
The manxome...

971
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,950
the mom-wrath...

972
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,360
The manxome...

973
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,360
Mom-wrath...

974
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,100
I'm not so sure about that.

975
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,490
Dr. Rhodes. It's time.

976
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,470
My baby.

977
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,860
My baby.

978
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,970
Joshua, hold on.

979
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,070
Todd, Marcy.

980
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,950
Can I speak to you for

981
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,950
a second?

982
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,220
Dr. Rhodes.

983
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,220
Where are the twins?

984
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,350
The Cronins have changed

985
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,350
their mind.

986
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,990
They want us to perform

987
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,990
the valvuloplasty.

988
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,660
What?

989
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,660
We had a plan going forward

990
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,100
that we all agreed upon.

991
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,460
It's what the parents want.

992
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,860
You went around our backs.

993
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,560
Yeah, because you never gave

994
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,560
them all their options.

995
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,610
You had no right to push your

996
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,610
agenda with the parents.

997
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,270
You told the Cronins what

998
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,270
this procedure entails.

999
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,360
Yes, I did.

1000
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,000
And they understand

1001
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,000
the risks, all the risks?

1002
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,070
Yes.

1003
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,610
Dr. Latham, I walked them

1004
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,610
through it all.

1005
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,710
I'll talk to them.

1006
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,710
Maybe I can walk it back.

1007
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,940
No, it's too late.

1008
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,910
We need to proceed with

1009
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,910
alacrity and confidence.

1010
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,280
Dr. Bekker, prep the hybrid

1011
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,280
suite and notify the team.

1012
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,750
Yes, sir.

1013
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,500
Sharon?

1014
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,630
I'm not late, am I?

1015
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,510
It took me longer than

1016
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,510
I thought to find this.

1017
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,570
You're not late, Maggie.

1018
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,240
There's not going to be

1019
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,240
a hearing.

1020
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,840
What?

1021
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,980
Well, the family's

1022
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,980
not gonna sue.

1023
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,150
The way they see it, you saved

1024
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,150
their daughter's life.

1025
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,310
They actually advocated

1026
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,310
on your behalf.

1027
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,810
You got your job back.

1028
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,390
You didn't need

1029
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,390
that after all.

1030
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,590
Oh.

1031
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,320
That's great.

1032
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,390
Yeah.

1033
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,390
Sometimes the good guys win.

1034
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,420
Yeah.

1035
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,370
I'll see you at work

1036
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,370
tomorrow.

1037
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah.

1038
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,680
Sarcoidosis?

1039
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,980
That's right, an inflammatory

1040
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,980
disease in your lungs.

1041
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,110
The biopsy confirmed it.

1042
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,050
The good news is the MRI shows

1043
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,990
it hasn't affected your

1044
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,990
central nervous system.

1045
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,290
MRI? Biopsy?

1046
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,120
While there's no cure per se,

1047
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,130
most people respond well

1048
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,130
to medication.

1049
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,990
I am hopeful we caught it

1050
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,990
early enough

1051
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,760
so it can still be managed.

1052
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,330
We thought we were gonna lose

1053
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,330
you there for a second, Dad.

1054
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,500
Why don't you and your mom

1055
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,440
give me a moment with

1056
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,440
the doctor?

1057
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,240
Thank you, Dr. Halstead.

1058
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,780
My pleasure.

1059
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,150
What's this all gonna

1060
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,150
cost me?

1061
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,610
How about you just

1062
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,610
concentrate

1063
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,280
on trying to get back on

1064
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,280
your feet?

1065
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,350
No. Give me an estimate.

1066
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,960
The biopsy, the MRI.

1067
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,020
All these tubes.

1068
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,760
What's it all come out to?

1069
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,760
100 grand?

1070
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,520
Two hundred?

1071
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,520
Three?

1072
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,290
I really don't know.

1073
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,170
What is wrong with you?

1074
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,570
How can you call

1075
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,570
for all these tests

1076
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,170
when you have no idea

1077
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,170
how much they cost?

1078
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,240
Your wife said you have

1079
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,240
insurance.

1080
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,310
She doesn't know I switched

1081
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,310
to a cheaper plan

1082
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,410
so we could afford

1083
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,410
our son's tuition.

1084
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,180
This is all out of network

1085
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,180
for me.

1086
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,320
Insurance won't cover

1087
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,320
any of it.

1088
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,950
I am sorry.

1089
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,160
But everything I did

1090
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,160
was to save your life.

1091
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,720
Well, you shouldn't have.

1092
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,130
At least they could've

1093
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,130
collected my life insurance.

1094
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,760
Now what?

1095
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,330
I gotta pull my son

1096
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,330
outta school.

1097
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,310
We're ruined.

1098
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,400
You should've let me die.

1099
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,280
So believe it or not,

1100
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,280
there is, in fact,

1101
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,080
the case to be made that

1102
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,080
your daughter is possessed.

1103
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,380
What?

1104
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,010
Not by a malevolent demon,

1105
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,950
but, well, by her

1106
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,950
six-year-old self.

1107
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,760
Six-year-old self?

1108
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,760
What do you mean?

1109
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,700
We suspect that this could be

1110
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,700
the result of a trauma

1111
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,130
she experienced when she was

1112
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,130
a little girl.

1113
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,530
I don't understand.

1114
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,230
It's called

1115
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,230
dissociative repression.

1116
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,370
Disagreeable memories

1117
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,370
or personality fragments

1118
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,280
are "split off" and then

1119
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,280
pushed down into

1120
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,280
the subconscious.

1121
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,340
Yeah, and in your

1122
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,340
daughter's case,

1123
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,210
this fragment has resurfaced

1124
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,250
and perhaps hijacked

1125
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,250
her entire persona.

1126
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,950
How could you possibly know

1127
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,950
that's what's going on?

1128
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,690
Well, aside from the bed

1129
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,690
wetting and the tantrums,

1130
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,630
the biggest clue

1131
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,630
is her language.

1132
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,530
It took me a while to realize

1133
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,830
this is not all

1134
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,830
gibberish.

1135
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,730
It's, well,

1136
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,730
it's Lewis Carroll.

1137
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,290
There's a poem called

1138
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,290
"Jabberwocky"

1139
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,630
from

1140
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,630
Through The Looking-Glass.

1141
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,970
Do either of you remember

1142
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,970
reading this to her

1143
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,340
when she was a child?

1144
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,810
I didn't.

1145
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,810
Uh...

1146
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,810
No, I don't think so.

1147
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,070
No?

1148
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,740
Wait.

1149
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,740
You did.

1150
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,580
When she was little,

1151
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,580
I remember.

1152
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,460
Mr. Ferris, would you mind

1153
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,460
just reading

1154
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,790
a little bit of this?

1155
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,030
Oh, this is ridiculous...

1156
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,030
Psychobabble.

1157
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,660
Look, my daughter's very ill.

1158
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,370
She's not a child,

1159
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,370
she's a demented adult.

1160
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,600
Just humor me, please.

1161
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,160
No, no.

1162
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,770
We need to get her to a real

1163
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,770
expert and not this quack.

1164
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,570
Just read the damn book,

1165
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,570
Jerome.

1166
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,540
No!

1167
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,540
I'm not going to do it!

1168
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,770
It's ridiculous.

1169
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,950
In that case, uh,

1170
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,950
will you allow me?

1171
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,350
""Twas brillig,

1172
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,350
and the slithy toves

1173
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,660
"Did gyre and gimble

1174
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,660

"All mimsy were the borogoves,

1176
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,790
"And the mome raths outgrabe."

1177
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,960
No, no.

1178
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,800
No.

1179
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,800
Stop it,

1180
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,800
you're upsetting her.

1181
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,900
No, no, no, no.

1182
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,030
""Beware the Jabberwock,

1183
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,030
my son!

1184
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,770
"The jaws that bite,

1185
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,770
the claws that catch!""

1186
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,900
Don't! No!

1187
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,900
No, please.

1188
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,880
Stop this!

1189
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,880
No! No!

1190
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,210
Please, please, please, don't!

1191
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,810
Oh, my God.

1192
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,990
Oh, my God.

1193
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,990
I remember.

1194
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,990
She'd be crying.

1195
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,820
She'd say it was the monster

1196
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,820
from the book,

1197
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,690
and I thought it was all

1198
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,690
in her head, but...

1199
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,880
It was you.

1200
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,620
Now, see what you've done.

1201
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,620
I told you that

1202
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,620
she's unstable.

1203
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,000
I always suspected you, but

1204
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,000
I didn't want to believe it.

1205
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,000
I couldn't believe it.

1206
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,000
I...

1207
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,070
You're insane.

1208
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,070
You touched her?

1209
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,040
Oh.

1210
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,040
You did things to her?

1211
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,240
I heard enough of this.

1212
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,610
I'm not listening to this

1213
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,610
anymore.

1214
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,540
Oh, my poor baby!

1215
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,540
Oh, my God!

1216
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,210
Dr. Reese?

1217
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,560
How could you do that?

1218
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,180
A child.

1219
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,180
A little girl!

1220
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,620
Leave me alone.

1221
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,620
You destroyed her.

1222
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,960
You know that?

1223
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,960
Dr. Reese, enough!

1224
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,720
You're the demon!

1225
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,720
You!

1226
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,930
Dr. Reese!

1227
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,800
You let this go. You hear me?

1228
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,940
He might be a monster,

1229
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,940
he's not the one who hurt you.

1230
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,800
He's not the one you want

1231
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,800
to be yelling at.

1232
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,820
Passing the wire

1233
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,820
into the aortic valve.

1234
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,560
All right, I'm in.

1235
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,560
Balloon.

1236
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,930
Marty.

1237
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,930
Got to run a VTAC.

1238
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,500
You tickled the ventricle.

1239
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,970
Damn it.

1240
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,210
Pull the wire back.

1241
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,910
Carefully.

1242
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,390
Back in sinus rhythm.

1243
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,190
Okay.

1244
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,490
Moving back in.

1245
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,300
Lidocaine.

1246
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,720
Give me the balloon.

1247
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,820
Here.

1248
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,460
Balloon is aligned.

1249
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,540
Dilating the aortic valve now.

1250
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,700
Marty, talk to me.

1251
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,510
Good contractions and

1252
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,510
a better flow

1253
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,510
across the valve.

1254
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,590
Looks like it worked.

1255
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,780
Both girls are stabilized.

1256
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,560
There she is.

1257
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,560
Let's celebrate.

1258
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,130
What's the matter?

1259
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,160
I didn't need this.

1260
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,430
So?

1261
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,430
Take the win and be happy.

1262
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,970
But I betrayed myself...

1263
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,970
What I believe is right.

1264
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,640
Maggie, you did what it took

1265
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,640
to survive, that's all.

1266
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,770
That's not the finest

1267
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,770
motivation.

1268
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,400
Now I have to live with it!

1269
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,440
Let me buy you dinner.

1270
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,440
Come on.

1271
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,980
No.

1272
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,980
Maggie.

1273
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,650
You helped me out.

1274
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,590
Let me buy you dinner.

1275
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,140
I'm sorry.

1276
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,410
Look, you haven't had

1277
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,410
the easiest road.

1278
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,210
Well, certainly not as bad

1279
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,210
as hers.

1280
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,430
How do we even begin to treat

1281
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,430
someone like her?

1282
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,490
Well, same way we treat any

1283
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,490
victim of childhood trauma.

1284
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,630
Try and get those repressed

1285
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,630
feelings up to the surface

1286
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,500
so we can address 'em.

1287
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,650
So my patient, we were right.

1288
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,650
It was sarcoidosis.

1289
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,910
But here's the thing...

1290
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,510
Will, I'm sorry,

1291
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,510
but I'm running late,

1292
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,680
and I need to get home

1293
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,680
to Owen.

1294
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,050
Have a good night.

1295
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,220
Sure. You, too.

1296
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,720
Natalie.

1297
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,830
You avoiding me?

1298
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,030
Will, I told you last week...

1299
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,870
I need a break, okay?

1300
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,360
Good work, and I know

1301
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,360
the board is very happy.

1302
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,760
The twins do seem to be

1303
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,760
responding well

1304
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,420
to the valvuloplasty.

1305
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,960
Perhaps I overestimated

1306
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,960
the risks.

1307
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,730
Dr. Latham, I want this

1308
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,730
diva benched

1309
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,000
for the separation surgery.

1310
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,630
Dr. Bekker can be your second.

1311
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,770
With all due respect,

1312
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,770
Dr. Frisch,

1313
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,500
CT is my department.

1314
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,670
I'll decide who'll be

1315
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,670
my second.

1316
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,460
Thank you for that.

1317
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,420
To perform an operation with

1318
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,420
as many moving parts as this,

1319
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,960
you need confidence

1320
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,960
that the people

1321
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,550
that you are working with

1322
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,600
are pulling in the same

1323
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,600
direction.

1324
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,330
I fear, Dr. Rhodes, that you

1325
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,330
are not a team player...

1326
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,730
That you are, in fact, a diva.

1327
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,510
I'm replacing you with

1328
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,510
Dr. Bekker.

1329
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,540
That is your decision

1330
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,540
to make.

1331
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,840
It's my turn to offer

1332
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,840
congratulations.

1333
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,590
I don't smell smoke,

1334
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,590
that's a good sign.

1335
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,630
Oh, Ethan, give her a chance.

1336
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,270
Hey. Come on in.

1337
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,270
Hi.

1338
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,910
You had chicken

1339
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,910
in the freezer,

1340
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,000
so I made dinner.

1341
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,940
Kind of a cacciatore.

1342
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,710
It smells so good.

1343
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,980
Aren't you gonna join us?

1344
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,180
I don't want to intrude.

1345
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,180
This is your space.

1346
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,450
You're not intruding.

1347
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,390
Em...

1348
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,390
Thank you.

1349
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,260
Yeah, least I could do.

1350
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,820
I'm gonna go wash up.

1351
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,990
Hey.

1352
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,440
Set another place.

1353
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,830
Okay.

1354
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,410
Emily, can I talk to you

1355
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,410
a sec?

1356
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,910
Oh, God.

1357
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,710
I was gonna throw those

1358
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,710
down the toilet,

1359
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,020
but I got afraid

1360
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,020
they'd clog it

1361
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,020
up and I forgot.

1362
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,110
Did you have people

1363
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,110
over here?

1364
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,250
No, just a couple friends.

1365
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,760
Emily, this is his apartment.

1366
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,080
I know, I know.

1367
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,080
I promise

1368
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,150
it'll never happen again.

1369
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,220
Please don't tell Ethan.

1370
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,420
I promise.

1371
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,100
Everything okay?

1372
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,570
Yeah.

1373
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,570
Let's eat.

1374
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,250
Is it over and Natalie just

1375
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,250
doesn't have the heart

1376
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,840
to tell me?

1377
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,490
What the hell is a break

1378
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,490
anyway?

1379
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,880
Yeah, I might be

1380
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,880
the wrong guy to ask.

1381
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,320
The last time a girlfriend

1382
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,320
asked for a break,

1383
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,860
she moved to Minneapolis.

1384
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,260
So...

1385
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,700
All right.

1386
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,260
I got early rounds tomorrow.

1387
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,900
Mmm-mmm.

1388
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,990
No, no, I got this.

1389
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,400
You sure?

1390
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,030
Yeah.

1391
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,030
All right, well,

1392
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,940
thank you.

1393
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,100
Need a lift?

1394
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,510
Nah.

1395
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,050
I'm gonna stay a little

1396
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,050
longer and lick my wounds.

1397
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,950
All right.

1398
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,950
I'll see you soon, bud.

1399
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,110
All right.

1400
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,730
You saving this for someone?

1401
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
It's all yours.

1402
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,270
Halstead, right?

1403
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,270
Maia Frisch.

1404
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,110
I'll have a gin martini

1405
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,810
and another round for

1406
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,810
my friend here.

1407
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,590
You'll join me for one, right?
