1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,390
Hey, guys, I need your

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,390
help over here.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,660
We're going to

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,660
Treatment Six.

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,570
Joanna Harris,

6
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,570
25-year-old female,

7
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,830
22 weeks pregnant,

8
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,830
hemorrhaging vaginally.

9
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,900
What happened?

10
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,840
Nothing. I was working

11
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,840
at my computer,

12
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,500
and then the next thing

13
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,500
I know, I'm bleeding.

14
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,880
Okay, let's get her

15
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,880
transferred on my count.

16
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,880
All right.

17
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,880
One, two, three.

18
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,110
Are you cramping?

19
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,410
Yes.

20
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,210
Maggie, CBC, type RH,

21
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,210
coags, and get her

22
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,810
on the fetal monitor.

23
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,810
Got it.

24
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,990
Heart tones look good,

25
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,990
healthy placenta,

26
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,650
no previa.

27
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,590
Do you want to know

28
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,590
the sex of the baby?

29
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,000
We already do.

30
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a boy.

31
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,530
We're naming him Ian.

32
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,960
All right, I'm going to

33
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,960
check your cervix now, okay?

34
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,060
Okay.

35
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,910
She's one centimeter

36
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,910
dilated, 50% effaced.

37
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,210
Looks like you're

38
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,210
going into labor.

39
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,750
What? What?

40
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,750
It's too early.

41
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,970
Yes.

42
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,040
Bolus a liter of LR

43
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,140
and start her on 30 milligrams

44
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,140
of nifedipine PO.

45
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,690
Got it.

46
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,810
Just try to breathe, okay?

47
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,510
Breathe through it.

48
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,720
We're going to give you

49
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,720
some medication

50
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,720
to stop the contractions.

51
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,050
What if you can't stop labor?

52
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,550
Unfortunately, we don't

53
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,550
consider a fetus viable

54
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,550
until 24 weeks.

55
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,150
And even if he did survive,

56
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,030
he would probably have

57
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,030
severe deficits.

58
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,190
Brain damage, paralysis...

59
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,740
Oh, my God!

60
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,360
Oh, my God.

61
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,360
Oh, my God...

62
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,900
If the baby does come today,

63
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,470
we will need you to decide

64
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,450
if you would like us

65
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,450
to perform all

66
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,450
life-saving measures.

67
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,350
As opposed to what,

68
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,350
just letting him die?

69
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,180
We would provide

70
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,180
comfort measures.

71
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,690
Want to make sure that the

72
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,690
baby doesn't have any pain.

73
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,110
I don't...

74
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,110
I don't know.

75
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,350
I mean, are we just going

76
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,350
to let our baby go?

77
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,120
What kind of life

78
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,120
would we be giving him?

79
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,630
Think about it.

80
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,190
It'd be cruel.

81
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,800
If he's born today, please,

82
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,800
just make him comfortable.

83
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,930
Yes.

84
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,710
Don't let my baby suffer.

85
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,080
We won't.

86
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,140
I promise.

87
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,710
Fred.

88
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,710
Dr. Charles.

89
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,850
Hey, Doc.

90
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,850
How's it going?

91
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,910
What's up, Conway?

92
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,910
How's the baby?

93
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,690
Still not sleeping

94
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,690
through the night.

95
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,920
Have you ever, uh,

96
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,920
tried chamomile tabs?

97
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,790
You can get them at

98
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,790
any health food store.

99
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,130
Hmm.

100
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,130
Thanks for the tip, Doc.

101
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,760
Hey, Dr. Charles.

102
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Dr. Reese, this is

103
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Officer Kowalski.

104
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,500
He will be our escort

105
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,500
for the day.

106
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,040
Hi.

107
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,040
First time?

108
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,230
Mmm-hmm.

109
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,230
You'll be fine.

110
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,830
Just don't feed the animals.

111
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,040
Uh, sign the visitor

112
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,040
waiver, please.

113
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,100
Waiver?

114
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,110
Basically says that if

115
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,110
we, um, get taken hostage,

116
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,280
that the state won't

117
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,280
negotiate our release.

118
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,180
Just standard procedure.

119
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,250
Hey, look.

120
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,990
Your determination

121
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,650
to explore exposure therapy

122
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,360
is nothing less

123
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,360
than admirable,

124
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,560
but it doesn't mean we

125
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,560
have to do it here,

126
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,160
so if you're having

127
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,160
second thoughts,

128
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,000
now would be the time

129
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,000
to tell me.

130
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,630
You're absolutely sure

131
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,630
you want to do this?

132
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,830
Yes.

133
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,570
This is what I want.

134
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,690
Ava!

135
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,230
Hello.

136
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,230
Hello, Dr. Jaffrey!

137
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,860
How great to see you.

138
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,860
Your trip was all right?

139
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,200
Well, as all right as

140
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,200
an 18-hour flight

141
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,200
can possibly be.

142
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,960
You already know Dr. Latham.

143
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
'Course.

144
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
This is Dr. Rhodes,

145
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,870
another CT fellow.

146
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,870
Ah.

147
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,930
Great.

148
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,600
Dr. Jaffrey's not only one of

149
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,910
the world's greatest

150
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,910
heart surgeons,

151
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,140
but was also my mentor

152
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,140
in Cape Town.

153
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,580
Taught me everything I know.

154
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,780
I have read your book,

155
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,780
Dr. Jaffrey.

156
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,120
It's an honor to meet you.

157
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,310
Oh, please.

158
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm just another

159
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,880
patient today.

160
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,320
There's a tumor

161
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,320
on the upper lobe

162
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,790
of Dr. Jaffrey's right lung.

163
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,600
It's invaded his

164
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,600
superior vena cava,

165
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,630
obstructing blood flow to his

166
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,630
head and upper extremities.

167
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,060
We'll need to remove

168
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,060
a portion of the lung

169
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,690
and resect the tumor.

170
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,710
And I want my star pupil

171
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,710
to oversee the procedure.

172
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,740
Thank you for your

173
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,740
confidence, Dr. Jaffrey.

174
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,700
We're getting an OR

175
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,700
prepped as we speak.

176
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,210
Ah, just one thing.

177
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,370
Um...

178
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,940
I don't tolerate

179
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,940
anesthesia well.

180
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,680
Well, we can talk

181
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,680
to the anesthesiologist

182
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,010
about adjusting your cocktail.

183
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,080
Uh, no.

184
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,790
Uh, I think I have

185
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,790
a better idea.

186
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,220
Place a high epidural

187
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,990
and load me up

188
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,460
with bupivacaine.

189
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,030
Hold on.

190
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,030
You would like to be

191
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,690
awake for the surgery.

192
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,870
Well, strictly

193
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,870
as an observer, of course.

194
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,970
No, it's just that we would

195
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,970
be taking an unnecessary risk.

196
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,910
The epidural site

197
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,910
could hemorrhage

198
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,570
from the blood thinners

199
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,570
alone...

200
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
You... You could be paralyzed.

201
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,080
Not if we do it off-pump.

202
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,310
Right.

203
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,880
We can construct

204
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,880
a temporary graft

205
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,250
from the brachiocephalic vein

206
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,690
to the right atrium,

207
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,660
clamp the superior vena cava,

208
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,690
and remove the tumor.

209
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,160
Certainly eliminate

210
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,160
the need for a bypass.

211
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,260
Exactly.

212
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,260
Absolutely.

213
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
We'll do it.

214
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
That is, of course,

215
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,030
if it's okay with Dr. Latham.

216
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,830
Good.

217
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,830
I think Dr. Jaffrey

218
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,340
has alleviated my concerns.

219
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,900
I'll make the arrangements.

220
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,070
Thank you.

221
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,310
Hmm.

222
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,920
I'll let Vorspan know

223
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,920
about the high epidural.

224
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,540
Did we really just agree

225
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,150
to allow a patient

226
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,150
to be fully awake

227
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,990
while we perform

228
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,990
open-heart surgery?

229
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,890
Dr. Jaffrey is well aware

230
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,890
of the risks

231
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
and has given us his consent.

232
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,420
There's no way that

233
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,420
we can guarantee

234
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,960
we'll neutralize

235
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,960
all of his pain,

236
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,620
and even if we do,

237
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,620
every time his lungs inflate,

238
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,890
it'll obstruct our field.

239
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,190
I have faith

240
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,190
in our anesthesiologists

241
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,260
and Dr. Bekker.

242
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,470
Awake surgery

243
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,470
is extremely risky

244
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,030
and should only be performed

245
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,030
when medically necessary.

246
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,340
I understand your concern,

247
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,340
Dr. Rhodes,

248
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,480
but I trust

249
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,480
Dr. Jaffrey's judgment

250
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,880
and respect his desire

251
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,880
to observe.

252
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,010
If I were in his situation,

253
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,990
I certainly would.

254
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,110
Seeing my own beating heart.

255
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,260
Debra McCormick,

256
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,260
14-year-old female,

257
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,530
GCS 13.

258
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,530
Possible overdose.

259
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,570
Dr. Choi, April,

260
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,570
you're going

261
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,570
to Treatment Four.

262
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,630
We got it.

263
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,000
Found her on Lower Wacker,

264
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,000
passed out and freezing.

265
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,130
Probably homeless.

266
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,610
I'm not homeless,

267
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,610
damn it!

268
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,910
I live with my friends.

269
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, can you tell us

270
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,000
what happened?

271
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,270
Nothing.

272
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,270
I tripped and fell.

273
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,370
I'll be fine.

274
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,010
Let's transfer on my count.

275
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,980
Ready?

276
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,980
One, two, three.

277
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,450
Let's get her started

278
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,450
on IV fluids

279
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,050
and order a tox screen,

280
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,050
CBC, CMP,

281
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,390
and a white count

282
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,390
with differential.

283
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,980
Yes, Doctor.

284
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,430
Do you have a family member

285
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,430
we can contact?

286
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,890
No.

287
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,930
You sure?

288
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,300
Call Child Services.

289
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,920
No, please don't do that.

290
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,920
They never help.

291
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,160
They just keep sending me

292
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,160
back to my mom

293
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,830
and her drunk boyfriend,

294
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,830
and he hates me.

295
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,140
For now, you just rest

296
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,140
and get warm, okay?

297
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,970
We'll run some tests

298
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,970
and be back

299
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,970
to check on you soon.

300
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,940
What do we do?

301
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,610
She's a minor.

302
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,610
We have to call

303
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,610
Child Services.

304
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,950
Not if they're just

305
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,950
gonna put her back

306
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,390
in an unsafe environment.

307
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,320
We don't even know

308
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,320
she's telling us the truth.

309
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,550
Ethan, I've seen this

310
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,550
too many times.

311
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,990
Child Services sends

312
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,990
a girl home,

313
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,190
she winds up right back here,

314
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,390
beaten, raped.

315
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,330
There's a little dive

316
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,330
on Roosevelt

317
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,210
that's got the best dry rub

318
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,210
north of Memphis.

319
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,010
Let me take you

320
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,010
to dinner tonight.

321
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,510
I thought we discussed this.

322
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,550
We did, and I decided

323
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,550
to back off,

324
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,550
but then I changed my mind.

325
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,610
Barry...

326
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,610
Come on,

327
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,620
just think about it.

328
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,490
Unless you're gonna

329
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,490
help me with these charts,

330
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,650
I've got work to do.

331
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,890
I'll take that as a "maybe."

332
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,930
What good is calling

333
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,930
Child Services?

334
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She's already been through

335
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the system.

336
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,340
She still ended up

337
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,340
in the street.

338
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,400
So what's the answer?

339
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,400
Just let her be homeless?

340
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,170
14-year-old girl.

341
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,170
Hmm.

342
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,870
Looks like this young lady's

343
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,870
in a tough spot.

344
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,380
Most potential foster parents

345
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,110
are only interested in babies

346
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,110
or young children.

347
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,160
It's nearly impossible

348
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,160
to place a teen.

349
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,920
Does she have

350
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,920
any extended family?

351
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,390
Not that she's told us about.

352
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,860
Well, April's right.

353
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,090
In all likelihood,

354
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,960
Child Services will just

355
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,960
send her back

356
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,970
to the abusive home she fled.

357
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,530
But they'll follow up,

358
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,530
make sure she's safe.

359
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,230
In a perfect world, yes.

360
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,800
In reality,

361
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,800
they don't have the resources.

362
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,010
Let me call some contacts

363
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,010
in Social Services,

364
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,850
see if there isn't

365
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,850
a group home

366
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,850
with a vacancy.

367
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,040
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

368
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,040
Mmm-hmm.

369
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,410
Thank you.

370
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,820
Dr. Manning,

371
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,820
she's having contractions.

372
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,250
We need help here.

373
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,890
What's happening?

374
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,890
What's wrong?

375
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,950
She's fully dilated.

376
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,760
No, you have

377
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,760
to stop the labor!

378
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,460
I'm sorry, but the nifedipine

379
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,460
is not working.

380
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,160
Okay? There's nothing

381
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,160
else we can do.

382
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,430
Need to move her

383
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,430
to labor and delivery.

384
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,200
No time. Maggie,

385
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,200
get a preset pack,

386
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,470
a warmer, and page OB

387
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,740
and tell them

388
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,740
this baby is coming now.

389
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,330
Got it.

390
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,330
Jackie, come with me.

391
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,210
I'm gonna need you

392
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,210
to push for me, okay?

393
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,580
All right, you ready?

394
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,640
Push.

395
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,750
Good. All right,

396
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,750
can you push again?

397
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,610
One more.

398
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,610
And push.

399
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,880
Doing great.

400
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,290
You're doing great.

401
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,290
All right.

402
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,820
Just one more big one.

403
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,820
Can you do that?

404
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,520
Just one more big one.

405
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,520
Ready?

406
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,750
Push.

407
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,750
Go, push.

408
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,190
Push.

409
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,200
The embryonic sac

410
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,200
is still intact.

411
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,870
All right.

412
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,430
Stay with me.

413
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,510
Wait. Where are

414
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,510
you taking him?

415
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,180
Hey, hey, hey.

416
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,780
It's gonna be okay.

417
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,780
Relax.

418
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,840
It's okay.

419
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,930
Will.

420
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,940
He's alive.

421
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,940
And he's active.

422
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,940
Responsive.

423
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,370
Let's get this baby up

424
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,370
to the NICU.

425
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,970
Who's first on your list?

426
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,910
Hector Ramirez.

427
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,010
You're gonna have to wait.

428
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,680
Ramirez is a level three.

429
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,780
We gotta clear the floor

430
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,850
and bring in

431
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,850
additional officers

432
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,650
to escort him out.

433
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
All right, gentlemen.

434
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,290
Let's take it to your cells.

435
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,600
Any particular reason

436
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,600
you tried to sabotage this?

437
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,640
How about we're taking

438
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,640
an unnecessary risk

439
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,870
all so you can rack up

440
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,870
a splashy surgery?

441
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,610
Oh, so it's about the credit.

442
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,810
Jealous, maybe?

443
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,180
No.

444
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,740
No, I am just worried about

445
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,760
Dr. Jaffrey dying

446
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,760
on the table.

447
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,790
He knows what he's doing.

448
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,720
Plus, this "splashy surgery,"

449
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,720
as you call it,

450
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
will be good for the hospital

451
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
and the CT program.

452
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,900
How very selfless of you.

453
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,500
Dr. Bekker, we're ready.

454
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,370
Coming, Dr. Rhodes?

455
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,760
That's my cousin, Kiki.

456
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,190
Hey.

457
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,320
Hey.

458
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,590
Your labs came back negative.

459
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,650
No sign of infection or

460
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,720
any immune deficiencies.

461
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,760
Great. Kiki's come

462
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,760
to take me home.

463
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,400
No, we can only release you

464
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,400
with the permission of

465
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,400
a parent or legal guardian.

466
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,200
Forget it.

467
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm still going.

468
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,180
Kiki, would...

469
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,230
Deb!

470
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
What... What's

471
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
happening to her?

472
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,340
She's seizing.

473
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,340
Step back, step back.

474
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,880
Deb!

475
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,880
Two milligrams Ativan.

476
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,180
Call radiology.

477
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,810
We need to get her upstairs

478
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,810
for a head CT, now.

479
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,880
Ativan in.

480
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,620
You're okay, Deb.

481
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,620
You're okay.

482
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,200
Ready?

483
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,200
Yep.

484
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,240
Parents were clear

485
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,240
about their wishes?

486
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,580
Yes.

487
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,580
They have decided

488
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,670
not to perform

489
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,670
any resuscitative measures.

490
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,340
Mmm.

491
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,750
Is there any chance

492
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,750
this baby could be viable?

493
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,810
Unfortunately not.

494
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,380
His heartbeat's weak

495
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,260
and his weight

496
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,260
is under 500 grams.

497
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,660
Yeah, but at 490 grams,

498
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,660
he's not that far off.

499
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,200
Natalie...

500
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,320
No, his coloring

501
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,320
and muscle tone are good,

502
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,760
and he's making a decent

503
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,760
respiratory effort.

504
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,930
Doesn't that say something?

505
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Not enough.

506
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,600
This baby's not

507
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,600
going to survive.

508
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,610
The best we can do

509
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,610
is make him comfortable.

510
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,250
Eh, she's got a mass

511
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,250
in her sinus,

512
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,350
possibly a tumor.

513
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,350
We need a biopsy.

514
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,230
Yeah, but look at

515
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,230
the cross-sections.

516
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,630
I don't understand.

517
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,300
Neither do we.

518
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,070
It's moving.

519
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,910
You feeling any pain, Deb?

520
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,510
No, it just feels weird.

521
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,340
Stop moving.

522
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,450
What was that?

523
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,980
I have a pretty good idea.

524
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,400
Forceps and speculum.

525
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,260
W... What's happening?

526
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,260
Just... Stay still.

527
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,000
A cockroach.

528
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,540
What?

529
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,610
Oh...

530
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,260
I want to take another look

531
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,260
at that CT.

532
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,950
So, Hector Ramirez,

533
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,350
you know, anxiety, depression,

534
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,150
history of intermittent

535
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,150
explosive disorder.

536
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,950
All clear, Doc.

537
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,420
May I?

538
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,520
Dr. Reese, I really think...

539
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,520
Dr. Charles.

540
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,370
Hello, Mr. Ramirez.

541
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,370
I am Dr. Reese.

542
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,980
I, um...

543
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,910
Dosage.

544
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,220
Right, um,

545
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,620
how have you been feeling

546
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,680
since Dr. Charles

547
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,680
altered your dosage?

548
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,560
Knock it off, Ramirez.

549
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,930
We gotta take a little break.

550
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,830
Let's get Ramirez

551
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,830
back to his cell.

552
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,300
Look at me, look at me.

553
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,300
Take a deep breath.

554
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,170
Take a deep breath.

555
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,170
It'll pass, okay?

556
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,400
It'll pass.

557
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,280
Okay, we need to take

558
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,280
a little break.

559
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,280
Get Ramirez back in his cell.

560
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,880
Okay, please escort

561
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,880
Dr. Reese back outside.

562
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,950
It's okay.

563
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,580
I'll be there in a bit.

564
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,580
It's all right.

565
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,320
Whoo! Whoo!

566
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Your vitals look good,

567
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,100
but we would like to keep you

568
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,100
a few more hours

569
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,100
just for observation.

570
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,870
What about my baby?

571
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,930
Did he...

572
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,670
Your baby was born

573
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,670
just over one pound,

574
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,910
below the threshold of what

575
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,910
experts consider viable.

576
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,350
And you know that for sure?

577
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,950
Defining viability

578
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,950
is not an exact science.

579
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,850
Unfortunately, there's no way

580
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
of knowing anything

581
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
with certainty.

582
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,820
What do you mean?

583
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,820
You... You mean

584
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,820
our baby could survive?

585
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,290
The neonatologist says no.

586
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,630
But you,

587
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,200
do you think he has a chance?

588
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,200
It... It's possible.

589
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,940
But highly unlikely.

590
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,880
Once again,

591
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,880
even if he did survive,

592
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,710
he'd be deprived of

593
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,710
any real quality of life.

594
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,590
It's too much.

595
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,590
It's just...

596
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,250
Too much.

597
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,250
Okay, okay.

598
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,480
It's okay.

599
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,960
Hey, it's okay.

600
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,960
It's okay.

601
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,930
It's gonna be okay.

602
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,930
Come here.

603
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,130
Hey, what were you

604
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,130
thinking in there?

605
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,330
That this baby still

606
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,330
might have a chance.

607
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,490
Well, Dr. Grant,

608
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,490
who deals with this every day,

609
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,060
completely disagrees

610
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,060
with your assessment.

611
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,200
Still, there's

612
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,200
a slight chance

613
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,210
with medical support,

614
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,210
that he could pull through.

615
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,000
Natalie, if we were talking

616
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,000
about any other

617
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,870
terminally ill patient,

618
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,870
would you be telling me

619
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,470
to prolong life at any cost?

620
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,470
Of course not.

621
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,940
We should be helping

622
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,940
these parents

623
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,940
get through this,

624
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,780
not making it harder for them.

625
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,230
But... How did a cockroach

626
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,230
get up my nose?

627
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,890
It crawled.

628
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,770
It was attracted

629
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,770
to the glucose

630
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,230
in your cerebrospinal fluid.

631
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,270
It's sweet.

632
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,270
Eww.

633
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,360
Where do you live?

634
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,360
Uh, never mind.

635
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,500
I'm gonna go

636
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,500
scrub for surgery.

637
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,830
Surgery?

638
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,480
Your cerebrospinal fluid

639
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,910
is leaking into

640
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,910
your nasal cavity

641
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,880
because of a small

642
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,880
cranial fracture.

643
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,780
Have you had

644
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,780
a recent head injury?

645
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,950
Did somebody hurt you?

646
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,360
You can tell us.

647
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,760
Look,

648
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,790
I don't want to

649
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,790
get involved with the police.

650
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,240
Just tell them, D.

651
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,880
My mom's boyfriend.

652
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,670
He hit me.

653
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,670
That's...

654
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,350
That's why I won't go back.

655
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,570
Still think Child Services

656
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,570
is the right call?

657
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,680
Barry...

658
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,910
Nothing has changed.

659
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,970
Hey, I'm here to

660
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,970
drop this off for Deb.

661
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,110
14-year-old

662
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,110
I brought in this morning.

663
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,050
Seemed like she could

664
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,050
use a warmer coat.

665
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,110
Oh.

666
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,060
Client left this in the

667
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,060
ambo a while back.

668
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,360
It's already been

669
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,360
dry-cleaned, so...

670
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,420
I'll make sure she gets it.

671
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,060
Thanks.

672
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,730
Dr. Jaffrey?

673
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,730
Still no discomfort?

674
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,030
Uh, a little pulling.

675
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,440
Some pressure.

676
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,230
Yeah, I can believe that.

677
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,140
Ah, my ventricles.

678
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,440
Contractions still

679
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,440
look strong.

680
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,540
No fatty deposits.

681
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,590
My coronary artery

682
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,590
is pristine.

683
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,580
Very healthy heart,

684
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,580
Dr. Jaffrey.

685
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,550
You eat a lot of oatmeal,

686
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,550
Dr. Jaffrey?

687
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,250
Good one.

688
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,790
I'm ready for the scalpel.

689
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,200
Uh, what?

690
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,630
Why a scalpel?

691
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,260
I need to divide

692
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,260
the azygos vein.

693
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,240
But shouldn't you do

694
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,240
the entire dissection first?

695
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,360
Save that till last?

696
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,130
I... I...

697
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,940
She's got a good angle

698
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,940
on it now.

699
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,910
Yeah, but what happens

700
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,910
if something goes wrong?

701
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,510
I mean, good Lord,

702
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,510
you won't have enough

703
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,880
collateral blood flow

704
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,470
to bypass the obstruction.

705
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,210
Dr. Jaffrey,

706
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,210
I want to remind you

707
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,850
that you're awake to observe

708
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,850
this operation,

709
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,850
not conduct it.

710
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,220
Oh, sorry.

711
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,660
Force of habit.

712
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,050
Sorry.

713
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,060
Please proceed, Dr. Bekker.

714
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,360
I understand.

715
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,360
Thank you.

716
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,300
I got Deb on a couple of

717
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,300
wait lists for group homes,

718
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,340
but none of them have

719
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,340
a room available.

720
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,810
So where does that leave us?

721
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,550
I could speak

722
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,550
to Child Services,

723
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,080
make sure they know about

724
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,080
the abusive boyfriend.

725
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,480
Even if the boyfriend leaves,

726
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,990
odds are the mom's going

727
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,990
to allow him to come back.

728
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,050
But when Deb

729
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,050
gets out of surgery,

730
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,450
she'll need a clean place

731
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,450
to recover.

732
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
She's not gonna get that

733
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
on the street.

734
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,660
Well, you both make

735
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,660
good points,

736
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,960
but as the physician

737
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,960
on this case, Dr. Choi,

738
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,290
it's your call.

739
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
There was a cockroach

740
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
in her nose.

741
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,440
I'm sorry, April,

742
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,240
but we have

743
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,240
to call Child Services.

744
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,230
How's he doing?

745
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,570
He's holding on.

746
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,030
Is he still alive?

747
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,150
Mmm-hmm.

748
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,390
Can I see him?

749
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,200
Yes.

750
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,760
Please.

751
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,680
My God.

752
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,220
He's so small.

753
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,450
He...

754
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,520
Would you like to hold him?

755
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,520
Natalie...

756
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,390
Yes.

757
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,880
His skin...

758
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,380
I can see right through it.

759
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,520
My poor baby.

760
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,820
What's happening?

761
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,820
He's de-satting.

762
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,260
His lungs can't provide

763
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,260
enough oxygen.

764
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm sorry it's...

765
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,200
But it's what we expected.

766
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,390
He's dying?

767
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,160
I'm afraid so.

768
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,730
You... You have to help him.

769
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,130
Are you asking us

770
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,130
to resuscitate?

771
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,410
Yes, please.

772
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,410
Well, hold on.

773
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,000
Mrs. Harris,

774
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,000
I want to remind you

775
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,850
that you and your husband

776
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,850
made a decision already.

777
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,550
You heard her. Nurse!

778
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,550
Can you...

779
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,090
Just save my baby.

780
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,350
I need a 0.5 French ET tube

781
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,350
and a laryngoscope.

782
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,160
Will, see if you can get us

783
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,160
umbilical vein access.

784
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,500
Will, I need access!

785
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,700
Come on, Ian.

786
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,110
His airway's too small.

787
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,170
God...

788
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,080
Oh, God...

789
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,410
There. I'm in.

790
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,550
Sats are back up to 91%.

791
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,130
Does that mean

792
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,130
he's gonna be okay?

793
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,630
For now.

794
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,180
You shouldn't feel bad.

795
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,950
Why not?

796
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,720
I am the one who

797
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,720
asked for this.

798
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,720
It was stupid.

799
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,150
Not stupid.

800
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,690
Ambitious.

801
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,260
I have no business

802
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,060
trying to treat

803
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,060
a patient like that.

804
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,760
I can't help him or myself.

805
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,070
You know, the irony is,

806
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,040
that guy is so much

807
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,040
more scared of you

808
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,100
than you are of him.

809
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,500
I doubt that.

810
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,670
What, are you kidding me?

811
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,400
Guy like Hector?

812
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,850
Not gonna let you in.

813
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,850
A shrink?

814
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,550
He's utterly terrified

815
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,550
of what you might find,

816
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,920
you know, what he might

817
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,920
have to face,

818
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,510
you know, so he does

819
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,510
the jailhouse thing.

820
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,850
What do you mean?

821
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,620
Convicts survive

822
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,620
by demonstrating dominance,

823
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,790
by going straight

824
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,790
to attack mode.

825
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,850
It's how they do it.

826
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,660
So he manipulated me.

827
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,690
These guys are experts

828
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,690
at spotting vulnerability.

829
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,860
You know?

830
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,270
And Mr. Ramirez

831
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,270
exploited yours.

832
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,750
And so he got the response

833
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,750
he was hoping for.

834
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,160
I want to go back in.

835
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,200
How are you feeling?

836
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,590
Okay, I guess.

837
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,300
Dr. Abrams said

838
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,300
everything went great,

839
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,670
and the paramedic

840
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,670
who brought you in

841
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,730
dropped this off for you.

842
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,370
Great.

843
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,120
Did you

844
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,120
call Child Services?

845
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm sorry, Deb.

846
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,620
There was nothing I could do.

847
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
Oh, my God.

848
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,320
Is he in pain?

849
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,900
He might be experiencing

850
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,900
some discomfort

851
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,770
from the ventilator

852
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,770
and the leads.

853
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,760
But it's all necessary,

854
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,760
right?

855
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,500
To keep him alive?

856
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,940
Yes.

857
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,240
Hope this was

858
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,240
the right thing to do.

859
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,650
Honey, look, he's moving.

860
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,710
He's hearing your voice.

861
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,190
He can recognize it, right?

862
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,880
From when he was in the womb?

863
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,590
It's possible.

864
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,900
Put your hand inside.

865
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,260
Uh...

866
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,620
Is that okay?

867
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,400
Yes, of course.

868
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,880
Did you see that?

869
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,910
He's touching my finger.

870
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,680
That's amazing.

871
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,750
What does that mean?

872
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,850
It's likely just a reflex.

873
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,550
But it does show

874
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,550
that your son

875
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,680
has some motor function,

876
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,680
which is a good thing.

877
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,790
Talk to him.

878
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,620
Hey, Ian.

879
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,570
It's me.

880
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,200
Daddy.

881
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,910
I'm coming around

882
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,910
to the anterior edge,

883
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,450
just about ready

884
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,450
to take the last section.

885
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,380
Hand me the bipolar.

886
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,590
W... Surely you don't intend

887
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,390
to use a cautery knife.

888
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,030
I thought it would help to...

889
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,330
It'll help her keep ahead

890
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,330
of the bleeding

891
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,330
while she cuts.

892
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,460
No, no, no.

893
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,630
You do not touch me

894
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,630
with that torture device.

895
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,270
Did I fail to teach you

896
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,270
proper surgical technique?

897
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,340
You always said

898
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,340
it's important

899
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,740
to maintain hemostasis.

900
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,280
Yes, after the cutting and

901
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,410
the tying of the vessels

902
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,410
individually,

903
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,880
not charring them with

904
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,880
a bloody cautery knife.

905
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,580
There's a lot of cooks

906
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,580
in this kitchen.

907
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,950
Yes, well,

908
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,950
my well-being's at stake here.

909
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,860
I understand, Dr. Jaffrey.

910
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,190
I'm fine.

911
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,190
Give me the Metz.

912
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,000
There.

913
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,230
I've got everything.

914
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,510
I'm ready to reconstruct

915
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,510
the vena cava.

916
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,750
Give me a 20-millimeter

917
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,750
Dacron graft

918
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,310
and a 3-0 Prolene stitch.

919
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,010
What?

920
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,010
No, no, no, no, no.

921
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,010
3-0 is far too heavy

922
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,010
for a graft this size.

923
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,850
I-I thought the 3-0

924
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,850
was appropriate.

925
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,260
No.

926
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,260
All right, that's it.

927
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,320
You're out.

928
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,890
That's enough, Dr. Jaffrey.

929
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,300
It's my heart,

930
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,270
and I'll tell you

931
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,270
when it's enough.

932
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,700
Rhodes. Rhodes!

933
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,330
You're in.

934
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,600
Take the instruments.

935
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,700
Now.

936
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,310
Dr. Latham,

937
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,310
I believe that it's time

938
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,870
to put our esteemed patient

939
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,870
under general anesthesia.

940
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,280
What? No!

941
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,340
I think it's in

942
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,340
his best interest.

943
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,410
No, wait a minute.

944
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,550
We had an agreement.

945
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,820
Come on.

946
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,820
Allen, if you would please.

947
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,690
No.

948
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,690
Allen, the...You do not...

949
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,700
You wouldn't dare!

950
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,630
You...

951
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,630
What... No...

952
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,570
How about that?

953
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,610
So quiet you can hear

954
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,610
a heartbeat.

955
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,680
Now, Dr. Bekker,

956
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,680
I believe you were about

957
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,680
to sew in the graft

958
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,270
with a 3-0 stitch.

959
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,280
Suture and DeBakey's.

960
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,030
I apologize for ending

961
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,030
our session prematurely.

962
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,690
If you don't mind,

963
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,690
I would like to continue.

964
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,780
May we proceed?

965
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,090
I'm here to help you, Hector,

966
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,990
but I can't do that

967
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,990
if you keep barking at me.

968
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,060
Calm down! You hear me?

969
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,240
Now, how's your new dosage

970
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,240
of sertraline working out?

971
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,840
Any drowsiness

972
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,840
or changes in appetite?

973
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,810
How about

974
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,810
nausea, diarrhea,

975
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,310
problems sleeping?

976
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,920
Feels like I'm gonna

977
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,920
puke sometimes

978
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,400
Okay.

979
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,960
Okay, I can prescribe

980
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,660
a medication called

981
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,660
Zofran for that.

982
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,470
Well, the surgery went well,

983
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,270
but it's going to be

984
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,270
a few days

985
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,370
before we can discharge her.

986
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,370
Okay.

987
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,710
She has concerns

988
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,710
about being placed

989
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,580
back with her mother,

990
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,580
whose boyfriend is abusive.

991
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,250
We need to find

992
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,250
alternative housing.

993
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,980
Uh, first thing we'll do

994
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,980
is try to create

995
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,280
a plan with

996
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,280
her immediate family.

997
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,750
Excuse me.

998
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,750
Her immediate family

999
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,220
is the problem.

1000
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,420
We'll do everything we can

1001
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,980
to make the home

1002
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,980
safe for Amy.

1003
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,100
Amy?

1004
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,600
Deb.

1005
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,290
The patient's name's

1006
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,290
Deb McCormick.

1007
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,800
Oh.

1008
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,360
Really?

1009
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,810
Ah.

1010
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,940
Here it is.

1011
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,050
Debra McCormick.

1012
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,010
Where to?

1013
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,520
So where is she?

1014
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,890
Call security.

1015
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,060
April, did you help her run?

1016
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,390
No.

1017
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,460
April.

1018
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,700
Okay, she...

1019
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,540
...told me she was

1020
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,540
going to leave.

1021
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,540
I didn't stop her.

1022
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,200
I could write you up

1023
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,200
for this.

1024
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,770
You saw.

1025
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,770
That case worker is clueless.

1026
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,970
He is not equipped

1027
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,970
to help Deb.

1028
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,080
But if you want

1029
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,080
to write me up,

1030
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,080
be my guest.

1031
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,860
Wha...

1032
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,860
What is that?

1033
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,260
What's happening to him?

1034
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,530
Help him!

1035
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,530
He's bradycardic.

1036
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
Page Dr. Grant.

1037
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,470
I'm gonna start

1038
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,470
chest compressions.

1039
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,240
Push 0.5 of epi, IV.

1040
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,330
Come on, come on.

1041
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,330
Please,

1042
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,400
I need you to stand back.

1043
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,840
Don't hurt him.

1044
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,400
Blood pressure's falling.

1045
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,920
Epi in?

1046
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,920
Yes, Doctor.

1047
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,910
Hold compressions.

1048
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,820
No pulse.

1049
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,430
Natalie...

1050
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,170
I am so sorry.

1051
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,860
I shouldn't have pushed them.

1052
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,960
Natalie, it was

1053
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,960
a very tough call.

1054
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,460
You didn't think so.

1055
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,970
I could've been wrong.

1056
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,070
Barry?

1057
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,920
So, I'm not big into

1058
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,920
the Memphis dry rub,

1059
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,150
but if you were to offer me

1060
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,150
some decent seafood...

1061
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,220
Yeah?

1062
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,450
What's gotten into you?

1063
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,930
I don't know.

1064
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,930
Maybe...

1065
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,360
I've lost my mind.

1066
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,750
We were able to

1067
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,750
completely remove the tumor

1068
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,120
and reconstruct

1069
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,120
the superior vena cava.

1070
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,260
Dr. Jaffrey?

1071
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,960
You disappoint me.

1072
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,570
Dr. Jaffrey,

1073
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,570
everything went perfectly,

1074
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,870
all according to

1075
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,870
Dr. Bekker's plan.

1076
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,310
You were right

1077
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,310
to put your trust in her.

1078
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,210
She is a first-rate surgeon.

1079
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,880
Get some rest, Dr. Jaffrey.

1080
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,480
I'll be back

1081
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,480
to check on you soon.

1082
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,110
Connor...

1083
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,310
I have to go put in

1084
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,310
my surgical notes.

1085
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,760
April, that for Deb?

1086
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,770
You told me

1087
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,770
a couple of weeks ago

1088
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,180
about your own sister

1089
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,180
and her struggles.

1090
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,110
If she came in here,

1091
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,110
needing help,

1092
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,080
would you hand her over

1093
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,080
to an agency that

1094
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,250
you knew would only

1095
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,250
make things worse?

1096
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,000
Um...

1097
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,240
You did, um...

1098
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,840
You did very well today.

1099
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,670
Really.

1100
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,070
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

1101
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,370
Thank you.

1102
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,950
I don't know what to say.

1103
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,300
We got to hold our child.

1104
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,300
I only hope that

1105
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,300
he was able to feel our love.

1106
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,070
I'm sure he was.

1107
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,340
Thank you.

1108
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,360
That had to make you

1109
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,360
feel a little better.

1110
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,950
It did.

1111
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,260
But what are you

1112
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,260
gonna do next time?

1113
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,010
What's he doing here?

1114
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,490
Don't worry.

1115
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,490
He's here to help.

1116
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,110
Where's Deb?

1117
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,120
This way.

1118
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,550
I'm not going

1119
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,550
with Child Services.

1120
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,390
I'm not here

1121
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,390
to take you away.

1122
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,120
I brought you antibiotics.

1123
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,120
Twice a day, with a meal.

1124
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,760
Will you make sure

1125
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,760
she takes these?

1126
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,290
April's going

1127
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,290
to show your friends

1128
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,860
how to keep the wound clean.

1129
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,840
Thanks.

1130
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,930
Let me take a look

1131
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,930
at that dressing.
