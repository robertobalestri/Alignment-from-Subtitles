1
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,640
Ahh!

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,510
Help! I need a corpsman.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,850
Game over.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,850
Don't I get a rematch?

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,480
Sorry, shift starts

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,480
in 20 minutes.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,810
How 'bout a kiss though?

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,590
I will take it.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,130
Dr. Choi! You there?

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,700
Dr. Choi!

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,360
Our neighbor, Trent,

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,360
has been stabbed.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,330
I need you.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,330
Show me.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,510
Bitch! Crazy bitch!

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,730
Trent...

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,300
Call 911!

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,220
Oh, God, Ethan.

19
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,310
You know I'm a doctor.

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,310
I'ma take care of you.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,180
She stabbed me!

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,590
Our crazy neighbor.

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,880
Get her!

24
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,880
April, wait.

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,410
April!

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,720
Oh, my arm!

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,890
Help!

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,890
Gonna need a second ambo!

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,090
Evil...

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,760
Trent Gardner is an evil man.

31
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,660
Help is on the way, ma'am.

32
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,660
Ow, my arm.

33
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,860
Where else

34
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,860
are you hurt?

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,230
Ow!

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,410
Mags, where do you want us?

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,410
You're going to Baghdad.

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,640
Naima, talk to me.

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,480
Forty something female,

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,480
GCS, 15.

41
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,640
Fell down a flight of stairs.

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,380
Head lac, possible

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,380
left wrist fracture.

44
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,750
Tried to board and collar,

45
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,750
but too agitated.

46
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,850
He's a monster.

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,410
She's a suspect

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,410
in a stabbing.

49
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,460
Dr. Halstead,

50
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,460
Treatment Four.

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,150
On it.

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,150
I opened the door,

53
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,590
and he was right there.

54
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,960
He wants to kill me.

55
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,960
Who wants to kill you?

56
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,540
Trent.

57
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,890
Watch her arm.

58
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,730
Ready?

59
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,730
Stand by!

60
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,640
One, two, three...

61
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,580
50 of fentanyl

62
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,580
for the pain.

63
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,500
Let's get an AP lateral

64
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,500
X-ray of that arm.

65
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,350
Ma'am, did you hit your head?

66
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,350
Oh, God.

67
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,690
There you go.

68
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,690
Do you know where you are?

69
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,150
He's been trying

70
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,150
to kill me for weeks.

71
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,310
Ma'am, do you know

72
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,310
where you are?

73
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,720
I had no choice.

74
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,720
I had to protect myself.

75
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,820
Argh!

76
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,760
April, let's give Trent

77
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,760
50 of fentanyl.

78
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,160
She's crazy.

79
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,930
Single stab wound

80
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,930
to the epigastrium.

81
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,130
No evisceration

82
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,130
from what I can see.

83
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,670
I need X-rays,

84
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,670
chest and abdomen,

85
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,730
and let's echo the heart.

86
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,960
I didn't do anything, man.

87
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,440
I tried to give her

88
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,440
her mail.

89
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,530
What?

90
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,530
Brittany,

91
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,840
her mail got

92
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,840
mixed up with mine.

93
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,010
Echo's negative.

94
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,010
No pericardial effusion.

95
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,170
Belly's also negative.

96
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,410
Knocked on her door.

97
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,640
And she attacked me.

98
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,510
Everyone stand back.

99
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,350
I know, it sucks.

100
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,350
Ow.

101
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,090
Gonna need a CT,

102
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,090
head and C-spine.

103
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,750
Oh, my God.

104
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,080
Stand back.

105
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,620
Oh, my God.

106
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,800
Yeah, ulnar styloid fracture.

107
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Mags, need a hematoma

108
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
block to reduce.

109
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,860
You got it.

110
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,770
He puts gas

111
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,770
in my air vent.

112
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,770
I can smell it.

113
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,870
We're gonna

114
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,870
take good care

115
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,870
of you, all right?

116
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,740
No, no.

117
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,740
Nothing is safe.

118
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,740
I'm not safe.

119
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,550
I had to stop him.

120
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,550
I had to.

121
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,470
Ow!

122
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
This our victim?

123
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
Yes.

124
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,420
You up to giving

125
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,420
me a statement?

126
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,880
Crazy bitch stabbed me

127
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,880
for no reason.

128
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,890
Page Trauma for

129
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,890
a surgical evaluation.

130
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Trent, we're gonna see

131
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
how best to proceed, okay?

132
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,450
You can talk while we wait.

133
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,160
Oh, God!

134
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,370
Detective Jay Halstead,

135
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,370
Chicago PD.

136
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,240
Why don't you start

137
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,240
with what happened?

138
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,530
Dr. Charles.

139
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,880
Allow me to introduce you

140
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,880
to Dr. Robert Haywood.

141
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,110
Doctor.

142
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,110
Not medical.

143
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,740
Astrophysics, actually.

144
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,040
Oh, way beyond me.

145
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,520
Dr. Haywood is a visiting

146
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,520
professor at Northwestern.

147
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,780
He was at MIT,

148
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,950
and his cardiologist

149
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,950
in Boston

150
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,950
referred him here.

151
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,050
Uh, please, Bob.

152
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,090
Bob asked specifically

153
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,090
to see you.

154
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
Well, I've read

155
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
your papers.

156
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,920
I'm particularly impressed

157
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,060
with psychodynamic

158
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,060
therapeutic applications

159
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,620
in acute medical

160
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,620
environments.

161
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,430
Oh, dear, a masochist.

162
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,070
Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna

163
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,070
leave you two to talk.

164
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,670
Here's that. Sir.

165
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,830
Thank you.

166
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,830
Of course.

167
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,200
Thank you, Doc.

168
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,200
Yep.

169
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,470
So, chronic cardiomyopathy,

170
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,010
from chronic ischemia.

171
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,780
Class-3 heart failure.

172
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,070
Wow, I'm sorry.

173
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,620
My energy is low.

174
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,810
When I lecture,

175
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,810
if I stand too long,

176
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,810
my legs swell.

177
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,290
I can't get an erection,

178
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,860
not that anyone's

179
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,860
clamoring for one.

180
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,900
And I'm on 11 different meds,

181
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,900
as you can see.

182
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,100
And I expect

183
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,100
in the next six months,

184
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,540
I'll be in the ICU

185
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,540
with an inotropic drip,

186
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,240
waiting for a transplant.

187
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,900
Yeah, well, unfortunately,

188
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,900
that is a possibility.

189
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,840
Yeah, so,

190
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,840
it isn't unreasonable

191
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,140
I get a little anxious?

192
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,710
I'd be surprised

193
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,710
if you weren't.

194
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,450
Well, last thing I wanna do

195
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,450
is add to your drug regimen,

196
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,920
but, you know,

197
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,920
we should have

198
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,920
that conversation.

199
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,850
In the meantime, I'm happy

200
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,850
to prescribe you

201
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,950
a mild sedative,

202
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,950
tide you over.

203
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,990
Thank you.

204
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,990
Yeah.

205
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,630
Oh, by the way,

206
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,630
I think you might

207
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,630
know my daughter.

208
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,330
She's a psych resident here,

209
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,760
Sarah Reese.

210
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,930
You're Sarah's father?

211
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,930
Yeah.

212
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,670
Has she mentioned me to ya?

213
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,430
Well, only in passing,

214
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,430
but, um...

215
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,710
We've been estranged

216
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,710
for many years.

217
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,440
I didn't write or call.

218
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,710
That was a mistake.

219
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,840
I should've

220
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,840
at least written.

221
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,780
But, I didn't

222
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,780
wanna interfere

223
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,650
with Sarah's relationship

224
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,650
with her mother.

225
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,050
It was an extremely

226
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,050
bitter divorce.

227
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,750
But, I see my coming

228
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,750
to Chicago as...

229
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,690
Serendipity,

230
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,630
a chance to reconnect

231
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,630
with my daughter.

232
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,790
Sure. I certainly

233
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,790
understand that.

234
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,170
Since you've seen me

235
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,170
professionally, I assume

236
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,000
everything I've told you

237
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,000
is confidential.

238
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,300
I'd prefer

239
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,300
if Sarah didn't know

240
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,300
about my condition,

241
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,280
my need to see

242
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,280
a psychiatrist.

243
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,870
Of course, you have

244
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,870
nothing to worry about.

245
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,610
I will zap this prescription

246
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,610
into the hospital pharmacy,

247
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
and I will get back to you

248
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
with a referral.

249
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,050
In the meantime,

250
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,050
it's lovely to meet you.

251
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,150
I'm a great admirer

252
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,150
of your daughter.

253
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,250
Thanks.

254
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,690
Dr. Sexton.

255
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,400
Paramedics called ahead

256
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,400
with a STEMI alert.

257
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,060
Mr. Murphy got aspirin

258
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,060
and morphine on the ride.

259
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,660
Just started an esmolol drip.

260
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,760
EKG.

261
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,760
Yeah.

262
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,040
Big ST elevations

263
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,040
in the lateral anterior leads.

264
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,540
X-ray?

265
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,210
Uh, normal.

266
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,210
Except for some mild

267
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,210
pulmonary congestion.

268
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,980
Time is muscle,

269
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,980
Dr. Sexton, so?

270
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,920
We get him to

271
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,920
the cath lab for a stent.

272
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,480
Now.

273
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,020
All right, Mr. Murphy,

274
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,020
you're having a heart attack,

275
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,860
but we're gonna take care

276
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,860
of you, okay?

277
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,020
Open up that blocked artery.

278
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,230
Can't believe it.

279
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,360
What's up?

280
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,000
I just got this

281
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,000
from my father.

282
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,670
He's relocated to Chicago.

283
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,040
He wants to get together.

284
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,480
Wow.

285
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,480
Yeah, the nerve.

286
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,310
I mean, I've gotten, like,

287
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,550
two birthday cards

288
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,550
in 20 years.

289
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,020
He totally disappeared

290
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,020
from my life,

291
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,390
and now he thinks he can

292
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,390
just leave me a note

293
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,090
and I'll come running

294
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,090
to see him.

295
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,730
Well, I can

296
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,730
certainly understand

297
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,590
why that would

298
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,590
make you angry.

299
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,690
Right.

300
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,740
What would you do?

301
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,830
Well, I mean,

302
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,830
that's not...

303
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,400
That's not

304
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,400
for me to say.

305
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,970
But...

306
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,970
But what?

307
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,740
Well, I mean, I think,

308
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,740
when a family member,

309
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,340
you know,

310
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,340
somebody important

311
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,340
in your life is...

312
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,980
Wants to seek resolution,

313
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,810
that's never

314
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,810
a bad thing, is it?

315
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,280
So, you think

316
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,280
I should see him?

317
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,650
I didn't say that.

318
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,650
I just...

319
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,950
I think it's

320
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,950
a personal decision.

321
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,080
Well, that still

322
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,080
sounds like a "Yes."

323
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Mmm, I'm not going to.

324
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,700
Hey, Doc, I got a patient

325
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,700
in Four, Brittany Coleman.

326
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
Stabbed her neighbor.

327
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
Cops have her under guard.

328
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,600
Seems pretty nutty.

329
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,600
Wanna take a look?

330
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,500
"Pretty nutty,"

331
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,500
is that a...

332
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,630
Is that

333
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,630
a clinical term?

334
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,510
She's had fentanyl,

335
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,510
but no sedation.

336
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,570
I'll be right there.

337
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,450
Dr. Bekker,

338
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,450
what do we got?

339
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,390
Meet Mr. Murphy.

340
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,850
Some genius in the E.D.

341
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,620
sent him to the cath lab

342
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,620
with a STEMI.

343
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,950
Take a look at his aorta.

344
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,860
Damn, it's blue.

345
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,860
Aortic dissection?

346
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,530
That's what

347
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,530
I'm afraid of.

348
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,760
Where's that echo, Marty?

349
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,760
Coming up now.

350
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,460
Yep. Type-A proximal

351
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,460
aortic dissection.

352
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,030
This guy's in big trouble.

353
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,210
Diagnosis should've

354
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,210
been made an hour ago.

355
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,970
Heart's been ischemic

356
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,970
for too long.

357
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,070
He's gonna need

358
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,070
a bentall procedure

359
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,070
to repair.

360
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,850
Hope your dance card's free.

361
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,850
I can't go it alone.

362
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,610
You're in luck.

363
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,680
Put him into deep

364
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,680
hypothermic arrest.

365
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,450
Let's take us down

366
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,450
to 18 degrees.

367
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,290
Put the cooling wrap

368
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,290
on his head.

369
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,320
Let's see if we can't

370
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,320
save this guy's life.

371
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,030
Somehow, at night,

372
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,030
he gets in my apartment,

373
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,470
and he moves

374
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,470
my things around.

375
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,030
Okay.

376
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,070
He poisoned my food,

377
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,540
my water.

378
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,910
Is he alive?

379
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,910
Where is he?

380
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,850
He is alive.

381
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,850
Oh, my God.

382
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,490
.5 of Ativan,

383
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,490
please, Maggie.

384
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,350
Well, don't let him near me!

385
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,980
Oh, we won't. We will not.

386
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,980
What is she doing?

387
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,220
She's just giving you

388
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,220
something to make you

389
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,220
a little bit calmer.

390
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,090
Thank you, Maggie.

391
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,660
You know, he...

392
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,000
He started by killing the pets

393
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,000
in my neighborhood.

394
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,440
Brittany, I can

395
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,440
promise you this,

396
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,440
you're safe here.

397
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,170
You have nothing

398
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,170
to worry about.

399
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,780
What I'd like you to do

400
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,780
is try and get a little rest,

401
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,240
and then I'm gonna

402
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,240
come back later,

403
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,180
and we can talk

404
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,180
some more, okay?

405
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,150
I'll see you in a bit.

406
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,880
Head case?

407
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,690
Well, Ms. Coleman

408
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,690
certainly appears

409
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,230
paranoid and delusional,

410
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,560
but I'd like to know

411
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,560
what's driving it.

412
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,560
What are the labs saying?

413
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,060
Tox screen

414
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,060
is negative,

415
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,230
but she is malnourished

416
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,230
and extremely dehydrated.

417
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,930
She definitely has

418
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,930
some kidney damage.

419
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,130
Yeah, that's

420
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,130
not surprising.

421
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,180
I mean, she hasn't been

422
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,180
drinking water or eating.

423
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,110
She thinks Mr. Gardner's

424
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,110
trying to poison her.

425
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,970
Says she acted

426
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,970
in self-defense.

427
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,440
Yeah, but how

428
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,440
can we believe her?

429
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,000
You just more or less said

430
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,000
she's crazy, right?

431
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,140
Can't have it

432
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,140
both ways.

433
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,710
Well, Jay, he's saying

434
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,710
we don't know yet.

435
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,380
Yeah, I mean, just because

436
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,380
you're paranoid

437
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,480
doesn't mean

438
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,480
they're not after you.

439
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,650
All right, well, in any case,

440
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,650
I wanna get her statement

441
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,990
and get a tech down here

442
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,990
to take her prints

443
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,990
to match 'em to the knife.

444
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,420
Get a much clearer

445
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,420
picture for you

446
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,650
if we let her

447
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,650
calm down a bit.

448
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,890
I'm sorry, guys.

449
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,630
She admitted

450
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,630
to stabbing someone,

451
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,290
so it doesn't matter

452
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,290
if you certify her or not,

453
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
compos mentis,

454
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
she's a suspect.

455
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,130
Fair enough.

456
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,860
All right,

457
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,860
lead the way.

458
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,860
Okay.

459
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,770
Hey, Mags?

460
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,770
Mmm-hmm?

461
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,470
You know Barry's

462
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,470
court appearance

463
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,470
is today.

464
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
And you're

465
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
telling me this why?

466
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,750
Well, I just thought,

467
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,750
maybe you'd wanna go.

468
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,010
I don't.

469
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,010
Look, Maggie,

470
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,780
I understand,

471
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,780
but still I...

472
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,350
Nat, he had

473
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,350
plenty of chances

474
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,350
to tell me the truth,

475
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,310
but he didn't.

476
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,310
I get it,

477
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,320
but the only reason

478
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,320
why you know

479
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,320
the truth now,

480
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,690
is because

481
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,690
he used a gun

482
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,690
to save my life.

483
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,930
Infant with

484
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,930
a bad cough in Two.

485
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,430
Go. Please go.

486
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,530
Okay.

487
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,770
Ms. Campos?

488
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,770
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

489
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,400
Why don't you tell me

490
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,400
about your little girl,

491
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,600
Abby?

492
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,050
About a week ago,

493
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,050
she came down

494
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,050
with a cold,

495
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,340
and it kept getting worse,

496
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,010
and now she has

497
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,010
this really bad cough.

498
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,880
And it sounds

499
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,880
so strange.

500
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,880
Is that normal?

501
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,250
My sister, Wendy.

502
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,250
Hi.

503
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,520
Um, I'm gonna take

504
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,520
a listen to her chest,

505
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,180
but you can hold her

506
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,180
while I do that, okay?

507
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,890
Of course.

508
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,890
Temperature's 101.2

509
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,620
Thank you.

510
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,190
Hey, it's okay.

511
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,290
It's all right.

512
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,530
Okay, so, that sound

513
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,530
that you're hearing,

514
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,470
it's what we call

515
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,470
stridor cough.

516
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,910
Uh, it could be

517
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,910
caused by croup,

518
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,640
but more likely pertussis,

519
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,640
whooping cough.

520
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,340
I'm pretty sure that's

521
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,340
what we're looking at here.

522
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,510
Abby already had

523
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,510
her first DTaP shot.

524
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,080
She's not due for

525
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,080
the second one.

526
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,490
Unfortunately,

527
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,490
she doesn't have

528
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,490
full immunity yet.

529
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,980
Oh, God.

530
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,390
Is it, uh, really serious?

531
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,390
It can be,

532
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,290
but Abby doesn't seem

533
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,290
to be doing too badly.

534
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,530
I'd like to start her

535
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,530
on antibiotics,

536
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,070
give her some Tylenol

537
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,070
for her fever,

538
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,760
and run some labs

539
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,760
just to confirm.

540
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,370
Let's get a babygram,

541
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,370
a CBC, BMP,

542
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,270
and do a nasal swab

543
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,270
for cultures and a PCR.

544
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,600
Right.

545
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,600
Thank you.

546
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,810
Is there anyone

547
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,810
you'd like us

548
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,810
to contact?

549
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,500
My husband's

550
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,500
out of town

551
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,500
on business.

552
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,600
I'll give him a call.

553
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,310
All right, just hang tight

554
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,310
a little while longer.

555
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,610
I'll be back to check soon.

556
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,810
Thank you.

557
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,810
Yeah.

558
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,620
So, I saw this patient.

559
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,960
Guy is taking big doses

560
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,960
of acetaminophen

561
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,430
for back pain, right?

562
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,430
Then he gets a cold,

563
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,430
and starts taking

564
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,430
an over-the-counter

565
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,430
cold medication,

566
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,730
also with acetaminophen.

567
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,960
He comes in with...

568
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,960
Liver damage.

569
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,960
Yeah, people don't read

570
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,960
the labels.

571
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,670
What's up?

572
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,700
My dad is trying

573
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,700
to get in touch with me.

574
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh, really?

575
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,540
Finally.

576
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,150
I mean,

577
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,150
that's a good thing, right?

578
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,750
No... It isn't.

579
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,160
My, uh...

580
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,160
I wrote my Mom about it,

581
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,560
and, uh,

582
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,560
this is what she said.

583
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,760
"Stay away from him.

584
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,760
He'll only hurt you."

585
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,100
Hmm. That's rough.

586
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,300
My mom is a mess.

587
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,640
Yeah, she hates my Dad.

588
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,640
I never should've written her.

589
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,510
Oh, hey, my patient,

590
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,510
Joe Murphy,

591
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,570
how'd his stent go?

592
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,120
Uh...

593
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,120
Any word?

594
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,750
Give me a sec.

595
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,080
Oh, he didn't get a stent.

596
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,560
He went straight

597
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,560
to the O.R.

598
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,190
But why?

599
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,830
Well, he didn't have

600
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,830
a heart attack.

601
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,120
What do you mean?

602
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,190
He didn't have

603
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,190
a heart attack.

604
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,070
Aortic dissection?

605
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,070
Mmm-hmm.

606
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,980
Okay, I'm...

607
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,980
No, no, no.

608
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,010
I'ma head up to surgery.

609
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,010
Text me if you need me,

610
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,070
okay?

611
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,070
Okay.

612
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,690
Dr. Rhodes, how's he looking?

613
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,660
Your patient, Doctor?

614
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,470
Yeah.

615
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,470
Brilliant.

616
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,600
Repairs to the heart

617
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,600
are complete.

618
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,740
Let's wean him off pump.

619
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,470
Cutting to two liters.

620
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,100
All right.

621
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,540
He's tolerating it.

622
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,740
Take him off pump.

623
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,380
Off pump.

624
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,720
Damn it,

625
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,720
right heart failure.

626
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,990
Yeah, heart's ballooning.

627
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,320
Echo confirms.

628
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,190
Mean arterial pressure's

629
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,190
down to 30. He's crashing.

630
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,920
Put him back on pump.

631
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,920
I'm on it.

632
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,200
He had all the symptoms

633
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,200
of a heart attack.

634
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Marty, where are we at

635
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
with drugs?

636
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,300
He's maxed out on everything.

637
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,300
Dopamine, dobutamine,

638
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,300
milrinone.

639
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,700
All right, let's add epi.

640
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,700
Up inhaled nitric to 20.

641
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,280
And two amps of bicarb.

642
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,280
He's severely malperfused.

643
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,180
You're gonna kill his organs.

644
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,180
I'm aware, Dr. Rhodes.

645
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,240
Is this why

646
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,240
you brought me in?

647
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,940
So I could share

648
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,940
in your disaster?

649
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,610
April?

650
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,150
Heart rate's 110.

651
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,150
Oh, I don't feel good.

652
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,490
Let's get another

653
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,490
blood pressure.

654
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,680
Why is this happening?

655
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,520
Started out a normal day.

656
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,190
Oh, God, how did

657
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,190
I end up here?

658
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,490
Nobody expects

659
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,490
to wind up here,

660
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,090
but I promise

661
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,090
we'll take

662
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,090
good care of you.

663
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,890
BP's 108 over 76.

664
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,890
Wait...

665
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,230
Knife must've

666
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,230
nicked his stomach.

667
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,670
Didn't show up

668
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,670
on the scan.

669
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,670
Trent, I'm sorry,

670
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,940
but we have to

671
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,940
get you to surgery.

672
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,670
Let the O.R. know

673
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,670
we're sending him up

674
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,040
for an emergency laparoscopy.

675
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,950
Dr. Manning, this is

676
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,950
my husband, Aaron,

677
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,140
our son.

678
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,080
Ben, say hello to Dr. Manning.

679
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,590
Hi.

680
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,550
You know, it's

681
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,550
a little tight in there.

682
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,150
Would you guys

683
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,150
mind waiting

684
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,150
out in the lobby?

685
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,220
Sure.

686
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,660
You'll let me know

687
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,660
how Abby's doing?

688
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,630
Yeah.

689
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,630
Come on, buddy.

690
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,630
I know.

691
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,970
Hi.

692
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,970
She sounds worse.

693
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,840
All right,

694
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,840
let me take a listen.

695
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,030
Hi.

696
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,670
All right.

697
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,050
Maybe the antibiotics

698
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,050
aren't working.

699
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,690
They just need

700
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,690
some more time.

701
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,650
Let's start her

702
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,650
on the nebulizer.

703
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,750
What's that?

704
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,230
It's gonna open up her lungs,

705
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,230
make her more comfortable

706
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,890
until the antibiotics

707
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,890
start to work.

708
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,390
Go ahead.

709
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,390
Okay.

710
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,060
Are you ready?

711
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,930
Thank you.

712
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,560
So, I'm gonna have you

713
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,560
hold this right here,

714
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,770
just like that.

715
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,770
Okay.

716
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,270
Yeah?

717
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,270
That's perfect.

718
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,540
All right, you let us know

719
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,540
if you need anything, okay?

720
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,310
Thank you.

721
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,310
Yeah. Thanks.

722
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,450
The first microsecond

723
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,450
of the Big Bang,

724
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,880
the inflationary epic

725
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,880
of the universe,

726
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,550
when it went from

727
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,550
the size of an atom

728
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,780
to the size of a marble,

729
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,920
lasted 10 undecillions

730
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,920
of a second.

731
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,860
That's 10

732
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,860
to the negative 36th.

733
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,730
That's just slightly longer

734
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,730
than the attention span

735
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,000
of the average

736
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,000
college student.

737
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,610
So, we can get

738
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,380
a few of the "hows"

739
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,380
of the universe.

740
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,590
As to the "whys," well,

741
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,590
that's a question for Siri.

742
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,020
See you all next week.

743
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,800
Sarah.

744
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,210
How do you even know

745
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,210
what I look like?

746
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,520
Look, you have every right

747
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,520
to be angry with me.

748
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,080
What do you want?

749
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,590
Just another chance.

750
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,480
Just... Wait.

751
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,480
Dr. Charles,

752
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,480
this is Ms. Sutton,

753
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,080
a friend of your patient's,

754
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,080
Ms. Coleman.

755
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,320
Alana.

756
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,320
Nice to meet you, Alana.

757
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,660
I was hoping

758
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,660
I could see Brittany.

759
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,660
Would it be all right?

760
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,630
Do you mind if I ask you

761
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,630
a few questions first?

762
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,640
Oh, of course.

763
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,640
You're a psychiatrist.

764
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,730
Yes.

765
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,810
Um, so, how do you

766
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,810
know Brittany?

767
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,430
I'm a very close friend.

768
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,600
Uh-huh, so then,

769
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,600
you know why she's here?

770
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,040
Yeah, I heard.

771
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,040
It's terrible.

772
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,580
I mean,

773
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,580
what would make her

774
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,580
do such a thing?

775
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,010
Well, that's what

776
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,010
we're trying to figure out.

777
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,780
You know, have you

778
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,780
noticed anything unusual

779
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,480
in her behavior recently?

780
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,250
She has seemed

781
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,250
a little more nervous,

782
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,980
and I do know that she's had

783
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,980
problems with her neighbor.

784
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,860
He's a very unpleasant man.

785
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,390
Could he have

786
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,390
threatened her?

787
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,960
Well, the police

788
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,960
are investigating all that.

789
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,020
Good.

790
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,960
By the way,

791
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,960
did she mention anything

792
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,960
about a check for me?

793
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,630
Sorry?

794
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,760
I'm thinking

795
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,760
it might not be

796
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,830
a good time to bring

797
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,830
it up with her.

798
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,000
I mean, it's not important.

799
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,000
Can I see her now?

800
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,740
Yes, um, I think

801
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,740
that she might find

802
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,110
your presence reassuring.

803
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,380
Thank God you're here.

804
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,440
You poor dear.

805
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,110
Poor dear.

806
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,160
Help! We need

807
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,160
a doctor! Help!

808
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,390
She's having

809
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,390
some kind of fit.

810
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,930
She's seizing.

811
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,930
Get me some suction.

812
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,360
Got it.

813
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,360
Ativan?

814
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,800
.05 mgs per kilogram IV.

815
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,800
Right.

816
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,060
Oh, my baby.

817
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,140
Oh, my God.

818
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,140
Oxygen.

819
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,340
I can't stand

820
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,340
to see her like this.

821
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,380
Isn't there anything else

822
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,380
you can do for her?

823
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,580
Lauren, we are

824
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,580
doing everything

825
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,120
that we can for her, okay?

826
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,020
We'll be back to check

827
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,020
on her again soon.

828
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,320
Dr. Manning?

829
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,320
Yes?

830
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,120
A couple of weeks ago,

831
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,920
we visited my sister

832
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,920
and the baby,

833
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,160
and my son, Ben,

834
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,160
he, um, he had

835
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,160
a little bit of a cold.

836
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,290
But that couldn't

837
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,290
cause this, right?

838
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,390
The whooping cough?

839
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,060
No, not if it was

840
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,060
just a cold.

841
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,690
Okay.

842
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,470
A mild case of whooping cough

843
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,470
can present as a cold,

844
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,270
but I'm assuming that

845
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,270
your son is vaccinated?

846
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,000
Wendy?

847
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,740
He isn't.

848
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,490
Then, yes.

849
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,490
Your sister's baby

850
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,020
could've caught this

851
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,020
from your son.

852
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,180
Oh, my God.

853
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,550
Has your son had any

854
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,550
of his childhood inoculations?

855
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,790
No, my husband

856
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,790
doesn't believe in it.

857
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,900
Not this guy?

858
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,900
Excuse me? Can I talk to you?

859
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,990
Yeah.

860
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,740
So, your wife tells me

861
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,740
that Ben hasn't had

862
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,540
any of his childhood

863
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,540
vaccinations.

864
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,610
Oh, God, here we go.

865
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,610
Really? You had to tell her?

866
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,310
You know how these

867
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,310
people think, honey.

868
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,670
Yeah, I had to tell her.

869
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,910
If you notice, Doctor,

870
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,910
our son is doing just fine.

871
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,850
Yeah, maybe he's just fine,

872
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,010
but your niece is in there

873
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,010
with whooping cough,

874
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
most likely

875
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
because of him,

876
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,560
because of you.

877
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,560
You don't know that.

878
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,790
That baby is

879
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,790
suffering horribly.

880
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,490
She could die.

881
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,490
Aaron!

882
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,500
Look, I'm sorry,

883
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,590
but I have to do

884
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,590
what I think is right.

885
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,760
I have to protect my son.

886
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,340
Oh, you think

887
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,340
you're protecting him?

888
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,040
Do you have any idea

889
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,040
how dangerous an E.D. is

890
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,900
for a child without immunity?

891
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,480
Do not assume

892
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,480
that there aren't

893
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,140
more idiots

894
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,140
like you out there.

895
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,440
Excuse me?

896
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,440
And who knows

897
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,640
what these kids might have.

898
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,940
Measles, mumps, polio?

899
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,750
Get your son out of here.

900
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,650
I'm serious.

901
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,650
Get your son

902
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,650
out of here, now!

903
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
Ben, come on, let's go.

904
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,260
Dad...

905
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,260
Now, come on.

906
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,860
Let's go.

907
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,860
I'm staying with Lauren.

908
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,620
Wendy?

909
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,200
And, honey,

910
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,200
go with your dad, okay?

911
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,500
I'll be home

912
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,500
as soon as I can.

913
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,790
Okay.

914
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,280
Mean arterial

915
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,280
pressure is 53,

916
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,850
58, 65.

917
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,980
It's coming up.

918
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,980
Bypass.

919
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,280
Now.

920
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,230
We're still giving

921
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,230
blood products?

922
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,890
No.

923
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,890
How about meds?

924
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,590
He's still on

925
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,590
maximal support,

926
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,060
but his urine output

927
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,060
has improved.

928
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,200
Profusion's improving.

929
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,900
I think he's stable enough

930
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,900
to decannulate.

931
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,260
I agree.

932
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,800
He's looking good.

933
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,500
Great.

934
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,500
No thanks to you.

935
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,300
Let's just close him up.

936
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,620
Trent, we understand

937
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,620
the surgery went well.

938
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,190
We'll get you up

939
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,190
to your own room,

940
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,350
as soon as

941
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,350
a bed opens up.

942
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,450
Thank you.

943
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,690
What's she doing here?

944
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,900
The woman

945
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,900
who attacked you,

946
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,900
she was injured.

947
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,770
But don't worry,

948
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,770
she's under guard.

949
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,030
No, no, not her,

950
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,030
the other one.

951
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,270
I think she's a friend.

952
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,000
Keep her away from me.

953
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,500
Keep her away.

954
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,850
Dr. Charles,

955
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,850
I went to see my Dad.

956
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,750
What made you

957
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,750
change your mind?

958
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,920
I don't know.

959
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,260
Maybe, because my mother

960
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,260
told me to stay away from him.

961
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,990
Ah.

962
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,990
But it's not just about

963
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,990
me being rebellious.

964
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,730
All these years,

965
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,730
I've wondered who he is,

966
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,960
why he left.

967
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,470
You always tell me

968
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,470
there are two sides

969
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,470
to a story.

970
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,560
I wanted to hear my dad's.

971
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,870
Makes sense.

972
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,780
Oh, and just so you know,

973
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,780
my dad said he did write me.

974
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,010
Really? He said that?

975
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,080
Yeah, yeah.

976
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,080
My mom must've thrown

977
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,080
the letters away.

978
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,540
Huh.

979
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,720
He's not really the monster

980
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,720
she made him out to be.

981
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,520
He's a professor

982
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,520
of astrophysics.

983
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,220
He's brilliant,

984
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,220
his students love him.

985
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,060
He's, um, taking me

986
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,060
to dinner tonight,

987
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,290
at the Faculty Club.

988
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,300
Maggie, what's the, uh...

989
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
The new extension

990
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
for the pharmacy again?

991
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,300
4482.

992
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,740
This is Dr. Charles.

993
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,580
I sent in a prescription

994
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,580
this morning,

995
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,450
for a Robert Haywood.

996
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,110
Lorazepam.

997
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,380
He pick that up yet?

998
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,610
He didn't?

999
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,720
You sure?

1000
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,290
Okay, thank you.

1001
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,270
Dr. Charles, my patient,

1002
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,270
Mr. Gardner,

1003
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,700
you know,

1004
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,700
he was more upset

1005
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,700
seeing the friend

1006
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,070
of the woman

1007
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,070
who stabbed him.

1008
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,030
The friend?

1009
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,480
Alana?

1010
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,480
Yeah.

1011
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,970
He says she filed

1012
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,970
a crazy lawsuit

1013
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,970
against him

1014
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,310
to get possession

1015
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,310
of his apartment.

1016
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,120
It cost him

1017
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,120
thousands of dollars

1018
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,120
to get it dismissed.

1019
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,190
He says

1020
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,190
he often sees her

1021
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,190
outside our building,

1022
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,490
staring up at his place.

1023
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,590
Somehow, she's

1024
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,590
got it in her head

1025
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,290
that his apartment

1026
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,290
belongs to her.

1027
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,630
Poison! Get it away!

1028
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,830
Ma'am, you need to

1029
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,830
get back on the bed, now.

1030
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,160
I got this.

1031
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,160
And he poisoned me!

1032
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,530
I told you! I told you!

1033
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,830
Calm down.

1034
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,830
He's trying... I told you.

1035
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,140
He has poison.

1036
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,140
Brittany.

1037
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,670
.5 of Ativan.

1038
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,670
Look at me.

1039
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,180
I'm not gonna

1040
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,180
let anyone hurt you.

1041
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,410
I told you.

1042
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,410
He's trying to kill me.

1043
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,380
I'm not safe. He...

1044
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,440
No.

1045
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,410
No, I can't...

1046
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,460
So, tell me again

1047
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,520
how you figured out

1048
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,230
that your neighbor

1049
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,230
was poisoning you.

1050
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,530
Well, you can't taste it.

1051
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,640
It's just a little bit,

1052
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,310
but it builds up

1053
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,310
in your body

1054
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,310
and it kills you.

1055
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,270
And...

1056
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,640
Alana saw him do it.

1057
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,120
Oh, Alana saw him?

1058
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,120
Yeah.

1059
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,980
Uh-huh.

1060
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,980
She knows what he's up to.

1061
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,050
I got it.

1062
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,430
You two are, uh...

1063
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,430
You're very close,

1064
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,430
aren't you?

1065
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,020
Oh, yes.

1066
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,690
How long have

1067
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,690
you known her for?

1068
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,260
I don't know,

1069
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,260
a couple of years.

1070
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,270
We met at the farmer's market.

1071
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,360
Ah.

1072
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,540
I don't know

1073
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,540
what I would do

1074
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,540
without her.

1075
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,940
Alana looks after me.

1076
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,640
You know, if she lived...

1077
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,310
Next to me,

1078
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,310
instead of that man,

1079
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,310
I would be safe.

1080
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,850
She wants to be close,

1081
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,460
so she can protect me.

1082
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,390
Hey there.

1083
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,120
How's Brittany?

1084
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,120
Better.

1085
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,720
Thank God.

1086
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,170
When will she be able

1087
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,170
to come home?

1088
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,300
I'm not so sure

1089
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,300
that she will.

1090
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,630
I mean, not

1091
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,630
right away anyway.

1092
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,840
She's gonna definitely

1093
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,840
need more therapy,

1094
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,930
and, well, frankly,

1095
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,770
there's a

1096
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,770
very good chance

1097
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,770
she gets arrested.

1098
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,830
Arrested?

1099
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,240
Yeah.

1100
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,240
That's terrible.

1101
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,180
Who's gonna drive me

1102
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,180
to exercise class?

1103
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,170
Excuse me?

1104
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,080
I don't have a car.

1105
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,080
Brittany drives me.

1106
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,080
Very nice of her.

1107
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,800
Did you say something

1108
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,800
before, about a check?

1109
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,500
Did I?

1110
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,500
Yeah.

1111
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,690
Oh, well,

1112
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,300
Brittany is helping me

1113
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,300
with this month's rent.

1114
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,600
Oh.

1115
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,110
I'm not very good with money.

1116
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,640
She really is such a...

1117
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,140
A kind, agreeable person,

1118
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,140
isn't she?

1119
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,200
Mmm-hmm.

1120
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,880
Chauffeuring you around

1121
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,880
and giving you money.

1122
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,210
She lends me money.

1123
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,440
Of course.

1124
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,320
I'm a very good

1125
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,320
friend to her.

1126
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,790
There is no doubt

1127
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,790
in my mind.

1128
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,190
You know, um,

1129
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,190
I should have

1130
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,560
some news

1131
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,560
for you very soon.

1132
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,530
Why don't we find you

1133
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,530
a warmer place to wait?

1134
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,620
Okay.

1135
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,660
BP's stable.

1136
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,100
Let's start titrating

1137
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,100
down the epinephrine.

1138
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,500
Nice job.

1139
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,380
How could I

1140
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,380
have missed that?

1141
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,490
I did a chest X-ray

1142
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,490
and an EKG...

1143
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,520
Neither of which showed

1144
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,520
the aortic dissection.

1145
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,790
Look, every indication

1146
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,790
was that the guy was

1147
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,790
having a heart attack.

1148
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,350
What if I had just done

1149
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,350
a bedside echo?

1150
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,420
Why?

1151
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,290
Look, you thought

1152
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,290
your priority was

1153
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,350
to get him

1154
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,350
to the cath lab.

1155
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,760
But that was wrong.

1156
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,270
Look, we're all taught

1157
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,270
to see things a certain way,

1158
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,400
and most of the time,

1159
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,400
that works, just...

1160
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,830
Not all the time.

1161
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,310
It is a very,

1162
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,310
very hard thing

1163
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,000
to see past

1164
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,000
our assumptions.

1165
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,910
Believe me,

1166
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,910
I'm still learning.

1167
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,920
Code blue.

1168
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,920
Code blue.

1169
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,980
Oh, my God.

1170
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,560
She's cyanotic.

1171
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,560
She needs more oxygen.

1172
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,650
Oh, no.

1173
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,460
Sats at 88,

1174
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,460
86... 80.

1175
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,300
We need to intubate.

1176
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,300
Intubate? A tube?

1177
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,770
Yes, I'm sorry.

1178
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,770
.14 of atropine,

1179
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,470
2 of etomidate, 14 of sux.

1180
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,340
What are you doing?

1181
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,640
Is she gonna make it?

1182
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm in.

1183
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,620
Take over bagging, Monique.

1184
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,880
Did it work?

1185
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,430
Heart rate's back up to 110.

1186
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,230
Sats at 98. She's stable.

1187
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,550
It's all my fault.

1188
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,100
It's all

1189
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,100
my fault that she's sick.

1190
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,470
What are you

1191
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,470
talking about?

1192
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,040
I am so sorry!

1193
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,960
I'm so sorry.

1194
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,030
What?

1195
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,170
Ben. We thought

1196
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,170
he just had a cold.

1197
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,270
What?

1198
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,810
We never gave him his shots.

1199
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,750
Shots? You mean,

1200
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,750
Ben had whooping cough?

1201
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,150
It seems likely.

1202
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,150
He never had his shots,

1203
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,150
and you let him near Abby?

1204
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,550
I didn't know.

1205
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,250
How could you?

1206
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,190
I am so sorry.

1207
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,390
You did this

1208
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,390
to my baby! Get out!

1209
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,560
Get out!

1210
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,140
I think we're dealing

1211
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,140
with a case of folie à deux.

1212
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,110
And that is...

1213
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,110
A shared delusion.

1214
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,780
Heads up, guys,

1215
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,780
I got an arrest warrant

1216
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,280
for Brittany Coleman,

1217
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,280
attempted murder.

1218
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,080
Gonna transfer her

1219
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,080
to the psych ward

1220
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,080
at Cook County.

1221
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,590
Before you do that,

1222
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,590
there's somebody

1223
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,590
I'd like you to meet.

1224
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,640
Two minutes.

1225
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,250
Alana.

1226
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,420
This is Detective Halstead.

1227
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,890
I thought it would be

1228
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,890
very important

1229
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,900
for him to get

1230
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,900
your perspective

1231
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,900
on how this all unfolded.

1232
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,290
How do you do?

1233
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,890
Uh, maybe we should talk

1234
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,890
somewhere more private?

1235
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,230
Oh, all right.

1236
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,230
Great.

1237
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,000
So, how can I help?

1238
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,370
So, I understand

1239
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,370
that you were the one

1240
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,810
who warned Ms. Coleman

1241
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,810
about her neighbor, right?

1242
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,400
That he was

1243
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,400
poisoning her food,

1244
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,210
putting gas

1245
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,210
through the vents.

1246
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,510
And he's a child molester.

1247
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,510
Did you know that?

1248
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,920
I haven't seen

1249
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,920
any indication

1250
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,920
of a criminal record.

1251
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,760
Huh. Now, what about

1252
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,760
Mr. Gardner's apartment?

1253
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,080
What do you mean?

1254
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,820
Well, that you think

1255
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,820
it should be yours.

1256
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,630
Who told you that?

1257
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,890
We're just trying

1258
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,890
to understand

1259
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,800
all the different factors

1260
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,800
that might've prompted

1261
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,770
Brittany to attack

1262
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,770
her neighbor, that's all.

1263
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,210
I hope you don't

1264
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,210
think that...

1265
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,840
I don't know

1266
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,840
what he has been telling you,

1267
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,310
or how he has twisted things,

1268
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,350
but I have only wanted

1269
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,350
to protect Brittany.

1270
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,520
Here's the thing,

1271
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,520
you could look at this case

1272
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,240
and come to

1273
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,240
a different conclusion.

1274
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,220
That maybe you didn't really

1275
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,220
care that much about Brittany,

1276
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,980
and you just wanted her

1277
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,980
to kill her neighbor,

1278
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,580
so that you could

1279
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,580
have his apartment.

1280
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,130
He's out of his mind.

1281
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,060
You keep lying,

1282
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,790
and something really bad

1283
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,790
might happen to you.

1284
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,730
Ma'am, was that a threat?

1285
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,240
No, of course not.

1286
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,070
You sure know how to

1287
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,070
bring out the best in people.

1288
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,550
Yeah, it's a gift.

1289
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,250
So the way I see it,

1290
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,590
Alana is who we refer to

1291
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,590
as the inducer.

1292
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,230
So, is Brittany insane?

1293
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,730
I think she's malleable,

1294
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,730
impressionable,

1295
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
maybe a little paranoid,

1296
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
but without Alana's influence,

1297
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,020
she would let go

1298
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,020
of the delusion

1299
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,430
and probably

1300
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,430
even be remorseful

1301
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,430
for what she did.

1302
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,230
Was Alana making

1303
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,230
the whole thing up,

1304
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,900
or did she really think

1305
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,900
Trent was evil?

1306
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,640
Well, evil in the sense

1307
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,640
that he was standing

1308
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,640
in her way.

1309
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,640
And she did all that

1310
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,640
for an apartment?

1311
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,310
I would diagnose Alana

1312
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,310
as a psychopath.

1313
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,380
I mean, they get off

1314
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,380
on playing those kinda games.

1315
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,020
I'm sorry, guys,

1316
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,020
I still got to

1317
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,020
arrest Brittany.

1318
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,280
But Jay, is she really

1319
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,280
the criminal here?

1320
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,220
We might be able to charge

1321
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,220
Alana with accountability,

1322
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,660
bur for now, I got

1323
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,660
a signed complaint

1324
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,660
from the victim.

1325
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,570
Here you go.

1326
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,570
Thank you.

1327
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,300
Hey.

1328
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,740
That guy who didn't

1329
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,740
immunize his kid,

1330
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,040
did I hear you

1331
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,040
call him an idiot?

1332
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,340
That was a very

1333
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,340
Will Halstead moment.

1334
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,680
I just... I can't stand it.

1335
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,920
No matter how much science

1336
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,920
we give people,

1337
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,290
no matter how much proof,

1338
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,960
they just go on believing

1339
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,960
what they wanna believe.

1340
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,000
I mean, the guy who started

1341
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,000
this whole anti-vac thing

1342
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,190
has been completely

1343
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,190
discredited.

1344
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,900
So, what is wrong

1345
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,900
with people?

1346
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,530
Why do they keep clinging

1347
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,530
to this myth?

1348
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,170
Mass hysteria.

1349
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,070
Yeah, and that baby

1350
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,070
pays the price.

1351
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,940
See ya.

1352
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,940
All right.

1353
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,020
I had my arraignment today.

1354
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,520
I know.

1355
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,690
I pleaded guilty.

1356
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,920
Sentencing's next week.

1357
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,200
I wanna explain, Maggie.

1358
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,160
I was barely 17.

1359
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,270
Barry, I've heard

1360
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,270
a lot of stories today.

1361
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,700
I'm really not up to

1362
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,700
hearing another one.

1363
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,140
I got busted

1364
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,140
for aggravated battery.

1365
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,740
Juvie records are sealed,

1366
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,680
but state agencies

1367
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,680
still have access.

1368
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,110
I never would've gotten a job.

1369
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,620
So, I changed my name.

1370
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,620
I thought...

1371
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,190
That's not the point.

1372
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,850
All the time

1373
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,850
we were together,

1374
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,850
you never told me.

1375
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,480
I'm trying...

1376
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,130
I don't know who you are.

1377
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,090
I don't know. Just...

1378
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,470
Hi.

1379
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,570
So, good news.

1380
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,570
Abby's latest labs

1381
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,050
show her white count

1382
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,050
has come down,

1383
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,950
and I am also very encouraged

1384
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,950
by her latest chest X-ray.

1385
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,040
Really?

1386
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,040
Yeah.

1387
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,050
So, I'd like to do

1388
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,050
what we call

1389
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,590
a spontaneous breathing trial.

1390
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,160
I'll see if she can

1391
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,160
breathe on her own

1392
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,490
without the ventilator.

1393
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,820
Okay.

1394
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,820
Go ahead and turn it down.

1395
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,770
She's breathing.

1396
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,900
Sats are holding.

1397
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,070
Respiratory rate

1398
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,070
and tidal volumes are good.

1399
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,510
Hmm, I think she's turned

1400
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,510
the corner.

1401
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,240
Oh, thank God.

1402
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,240
Monique?

1403
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,580
Oh, my baby.

1404
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,520
Have you seen my sister?

1405
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,520
Do you know

1406
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,520
if she's still here?

1407
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,950
She is.

1408
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,820
Dr. Haywood.

1409
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,330
Dr. Charles.

1410
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,430
I'm taking Sarah

1411
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,430
out to dinner.

1412
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,670
So she said.

1413
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,080
I was there

1414
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,080
when she got

1415
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,080
your note.

1416
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,850
I played dumb.

1417
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,850
Thank you.

1418
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,280
She told me

1419
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,280
about your ex-wife.

1420
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,370
Uh, kinda disturbing

1421
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,280
that she destroyed

1422
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,280
all your letters.

1423
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,990
Uh, yeah, it was a, uh...

1424
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Nasty divorce.

1425
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,490
I know all about those.

1426
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,290
Listen, your prescription

1427
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,290
is waiting for you

1428
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,290
in the pharmacy.

1429
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,560
Great.

1430
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,560
Anytime you're ready.

1431
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,660
Thank you.

1432
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,990
You know, frankly,

1433
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,730
just talking to you

1434
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,730
this morning

1435
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,240
made me feel

1436
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,240
a whole lot better.

1437
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,530
Well, good.

1438
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,330
Just so I know,

1439
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,010
did you decide to share

1440
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,010
your condition with Sarah?

1441
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,550
No, not yet.

1442
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,810
I don't wanna make her think

1443
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,370
I might need

1444
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,370
something from her.

1445
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,380
Well, like what?

1446
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,010
Uh, well...

1447
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,180
You know, honestly,

1448
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,090
I don't have many friends,

1449
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,780
no other family.

1450
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,690
My ex-wives refuse

1451
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,690
to even talk to me.

1452
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,730
You might say

1453
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,730
I've burned all my bridges.

1454
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,520
Right.

1455
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,390
When your health starts

1456
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,390
to deteriorate,

1457
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,270
who are you gonna turn to

1458
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,270
to take care of ya?

1459
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,840
Well, it's natural, isn't it?

1460
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,430
Daughter taking care

1461
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,430
of her father?

1462
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,740
Plus, I admit,

1463
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,740
I'm not very good

1464
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,740
with money,

1465
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,410
so I could use Sarah's help

1466
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,410
in that department.

1467
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,280
Uh, everything I tell you

1468
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,280
is confidential.

1469
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,910
Of course. Of course.

1470
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,010
Good.

1471
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,490
A-ha! Here she is.

1472
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,020
You met my dad.

1473
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,020
Yes, I did.

1474
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,930
Ready?

1475
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,930
Yes.

1476
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,000
Good night, Dr. Charles.

1477
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,640
Nice to meet you.

1478
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,640
Nice to meet you too.

1479
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,520
You were throwing in

1480
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,520
some beautiful stitches

1481
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,520
back there.

1482
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,250
Fast.

1483
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,390
No, you moved right with me.

1484
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,790
Spot-on with the graft.

1485
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,650
Yeah.

1486
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,290
So, which of your

1487
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,290
myriad girlfriends

1488
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,660
gets Dr. Rhodes tonight?

1489
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,030
Yeah, no.

1490
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,770
Tonight, it is just

1491
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,770
me and Jimmy Fallon.

1492
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,140
I've gotta... I gotta

1493
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,140
pace myself, you know?

1494
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,640
You're a real mystery.

1495
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,480
You used to be

1496
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,480
such a one-woman guy.

1497
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,640
Yeah, well,

1498
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,640
that didn't work out

1499
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,910
particularly well, did it?

1500
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,980
Ah.

1501
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,080
Aortic dissection.

1502
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,060
Very often fatal.

1503
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,560
Mazel tov to you both.

1504
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,980
Thank you.

1505
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,070
I emailed you a case,

1506
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,070
conjoined twins.

1507
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,900
We plan to separate them

1508
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,900
in about a month.

1509
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,260
It's going to be a long

1510
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,260
and difficult procedure,

1511
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,840
involving several departments.

1512
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,530
I am putting together

1513
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,530
our team.

1514
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,900
I look forward to it.

1515
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,640
Actually, I haven't decided

1516
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,650
which of my fellows

1517
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,650
I'm going to include,

1518
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,340
but I wanted everyone

1519
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,340
to be au courant.

1520
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,740
Sure.

1521
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,650
You know,

1522
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,650
we often say "mazel tov"

1523
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,380
as an offer

1524
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,380
of congratulations,

1525
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,690
but it literally means

1526
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,690
"good luck."

1527
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,030
It sounds like

1528
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,030
he's only going

1529
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,030
to bring on one of us.

1530
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,330
Yeah.

1531
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,430
You shouldn't have invited me

1532
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,430
into the aortic dissection.

1533
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,470
You could've grabbed

1534
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,470
all the glory for yourself.

1535
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,900
Gotten a leg up.

1536
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,840
That's what I get

1537
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,840
for hedging my bet.

1538
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,550
Yeah, it's better

1539
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,550
to go all-in.
