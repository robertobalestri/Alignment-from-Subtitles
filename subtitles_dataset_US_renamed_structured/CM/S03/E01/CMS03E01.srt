1
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,350
Robin, look at me.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,350
No!

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,510
Robin. No, no, no, no!

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,510
Robin, do you know

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,510
where you are?

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,650
Help me.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
Her symptoms,

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
they're not consistent

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,920
with a psychiatric disorder.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,620
A tumor?

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,620
So I was crazy.

12
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,190
Your dad's hardly

13
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,190
left your side.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,230
His name is Jack Kellogg.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,530
Behavior indicates

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,530
a malignant narcissist.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,830
He threaten to hurt anybody?

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,200
Is Dr. Charles ready

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,200
to see me?

20
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,000
He had a family emergency.

21
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,800
Tell him that I'm not going

22
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,800
to be treated this way.

23
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,180
Dr. Charles.

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,180
Mr. Kellogg?

25
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,340
Daniel.

26
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,410
You secured the gun?

27
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,780
Yes, ma'am.

28
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,780
Check him.

29
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,020
Daniel. Daniel, I'm here.

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,350
Oh, God.

31
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,350
It's okay.

32
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,550
It's okay.

33
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,790
Do you know who I am?

34
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,860
Uh, Sharon.

35
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,830
Yes, yes.

36
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,830
Do you know where you are?

37
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,760
Uh, Med.

38
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,760
Yes, that's right.

39
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,390
That's right.

40
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,390
He's alive.

41
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,770
But heavy scalp bleeding.

42
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,770
What the hell happened?

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,040
He got shot in the abdomen.

44
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,670
He's lost a lot of blood.

45
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,670
Baghdad.

46
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,080
No, we're going straight

47
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,080
to the OR.

48
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,940
Tell them we're on our way up.

49
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,010
Hang on, Daniel.

50
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,010
Stay with me.

51
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,950
We're going to take good care

52
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,950
of you, Dr. Charles.

53
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,820
Stay with me, Daniel.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,970
So, it's been a few months.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,970
How are you feeling overall?

56
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,570
You know, pretty good.

57
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,570
Really, pretty good.

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,850
I might get a little tired

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,850
towards the end of the day,

60
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,940
but, uh...

61
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,940
You could have taken

62
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,210
a little bit more time off.

63
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,780
I was going nuts.

64
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,820
How are you doing

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,820
emotionally?

66
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,120
Hey, who's the shrink here?

67
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,620
I'm doing fine, thank you.

68
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,620
Thank you for asking.

69
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,460
So you had some pain

70
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,460
when I palpated your abdomen.

71
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,060
So I'd like you to get a CT

72
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,060
and a CBC with white count

73
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,160
and make sure that you

74
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,160
don't have an abscess.

75
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,430
Can't do it today.

76
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,160
It's actually

77
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,160
Jack Kellogg's trial,

78
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,730
and I'm testifying.

79
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,730
Oh, crap.

80
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,400
Boy. Guy could've died.

81
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,840
It would've made everybody's

82
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,840
life a little easier, huh?

83
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,880
Please tell Robin

84
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,880
that I'm truly sorry

85
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,980
that I can't be there

86
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,980
when you bring her home.

87
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,380
Yeah, sure.

88
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,450
Thank you, Doctor.

89
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,450
Not a worry.

90
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,620
Dr. Reese, Dr. Charles left,

91
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,420
said you should do rounds

92
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,420
without him.

93
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
He doesn't know when they're

94
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
gonna call him in to testify.

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,800
It is awful he has

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,800
to relive that night.

97
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,360
Yeah. Right.

98
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,360
As long as it helps

99
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,430
put that schmuck away.

100
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,870
The hubris, trying to get off

101
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,930
with an insanity plea.

102
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,930
Yes.

103
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,030
It's ironic, isn't it?

104
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,410
By saving lives, we put

105
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,410
our own in jeopardy.

106
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,050
I guess.

107
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,050
You know,

108
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,640
nothing's been done

109
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,640
to improve security.

110
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,150
We need a police

111
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,150
presence here,

112
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,210
both inside and outside

113
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,210
the ED.

114
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,880
I'm all for cops, Dr. Stohl,

115
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,050
but the people you most

116
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,050
need to worry about,

117
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,210
they're not afraid of guns.

118
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,520
Which reminds me, what do you

119
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,520
want to about your gunshot,

120
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,290
Mr. Jameson?

121
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,290
The wound is through

122
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,630
and through, not serious.

123
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,630
He needs some in-home care,

124
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,130
but there's no reason for him

125
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,130
to be taking up space here.

126
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,230
Discharge him.

127
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,230
All right.

128
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,430
Hey.

129
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,130
Natalie!

130
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,130
Hi.

131
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,830
We thought we lost you

132
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,830
for good.

133
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,050
Why? It was just

134
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,050
a little sabbatical.

135
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,910
We didn't hear from you

136
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,910
for three months.

137
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm sorry.

138
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,280
I should have called.

139
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,150
I just got caught up

140
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,150
with family stuff.

141
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,650
Dr. Halstead.

142
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,390
Look who decided to come back.

143
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,660
Hey, Nat.

144
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,810
Hey.

145
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,420
Good to see you.

146
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,850
You, too.

147
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,850
Uh-oh.

148
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,920
You're gonna have

149
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,920
to catch up later.

150
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,990
Incoming.

151
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,760
Welcome home.

152
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,000
Brian Cutler, early 40s.

153
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,940
High speed crash,

154
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,940
prolonged extrication,

155
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,530
unresponsive,

156
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,530
unable to intubate.

157
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,770
You're going to Trauma 3.

158
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,770
GCS 5,

159
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,640
heart rate 78,

160
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,640
BP is 120 over palp.

161
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,050
His wife is right behind us.

162
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,110
Natalie, take the husband?

163
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,580
Doris, Noah with me.

164
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,580
Yep.

165
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,810
Brian. Brian.

166
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,810
Judith Cutler,

167
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,790
GCS 15, vitals stable.

168
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,790
My husband, Brian.

169
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,920
Seatbelt sign

170
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,920
on her right neck.

171
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,890
Go to trauma one.

172
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,890
It's okay.

173
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,890
He's being treated.

174
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,950
I'm Dr. Halstead.

175
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,950
I said terrible things.

176
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,020
I'm going to take

177
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,020
good care of you.

178
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,390
Oh, God. Brian.

179
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,390
Monique, let's go.

180
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,570
On my count, one, two, three.

181
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,500
All right, Doris,

182
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,500
take over bagging.

183
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,430
I need to intubate.

184
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,430
100 of sux, 20 of etomidate.

185
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,130
FAST him, Dr. Sexton.

186
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,130
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,200
And also I need

188
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,200
a chest x-ray.

189
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,340
Yes, Doctor, flying in.

190
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
All right.

191
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,820
We were fighting.

192
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,820
He didn't see the other car.

193
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,520
Mrs. Cutler, are you

194
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,520
always this hoarse?

195
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,220
What? Uh, no.

196
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,520
We got seatbelt sign.

197
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,600
Chest wall tenderness.

198
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,490
Hey, I want a 4-vessel CT

199
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,490
angiogram

200
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,500
with laryngeal cuts

201
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,500
and a CT c-spine,

202
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,630
chest, abdomen, pelvis.

203
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,690
Right.

204
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,860
Help Brian.

205
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,860
The things I said...

206
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,670
I didn't mean them.

207
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,670
Have to tell him I'm sorry.

208
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,840
Don't worry. We're taking

209
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,840
good care of him.

210
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,140
You'll see him soon.

211
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,240
FAST is clear.

212
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,080
I'm in.

213
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,020
Chest is clear.

214
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,360
All right, let's send him up

215
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,360
to CT for a panscan.

216
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,730
You have to tell him.

217
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,730
Have to tell him

218
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,570
All right.

219
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,570
Have to tell him.

220
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,010
You'll still experience some

221
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,010
symptoms of the encephalitis,

222
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
but to a lesser

223
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
and lesser degree.

224
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,910
What kind of symptoms?

225
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,910
Memory loss,

226
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,920
phonemic paraphasia,

227
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,920
Substituting "Ken"

228
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,320
for "pen," that kind of thing.

229
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,010
You might also experience

230
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,450
sleep issues, hypersomnia.

231
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,650
Impulsivity, disinhibition,

232
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,650
irritability.

233
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,420
Sounds great, huh?

234
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,190
Look, nothing

235
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,190
a vintage bottle

236
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,160
of Clicquot can't fix,

237
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,160
right?

238
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,030
Champagne? No. Alcohol is

239
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,030
definitely contraindicated.

240
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,090
You'll still be on

241
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,090
prednisone, Ativan, Geodon,

242
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,230
Trileptal, and labetalol,

243
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,140
and you'll be receiving

244
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,140
bi-weekly at-home

245
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,230
immunoglobulin infusions.

246
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,230
Nice.

247
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,470
Can I get some of that?

248
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,270
Thank you, Sarah.

249
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,270
I get the picture.

250
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,280
Okay.

251
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,280
I'll check in with you.

252
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,550
You know what would make me

253
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,550
feel better than champagne?

254
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,850
I'm with you.

255
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,850
Mmm-hmm.

256
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,290
Yeah, sorry, we can't

257
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,290
lock the door.

258
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,400
Well, we'll be home

259
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,400
in a couple of hours.

260
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,230
Yeah, but who wants to wait?

261
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,500
Yeah.

262
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,710
Dr. Manning.

263
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,210
It's good to have you back.

264
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,580
Thanks, Ms. Goodwin.

265
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,580
Glad to be back.

266
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,620
Sent the husband

267
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,620
for a panscan.

268
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,520
Wife's getting a CT, too.

269
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,520
Good.

270
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,290
Enjoy your sabbatical?

271
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,450
Yeah.

272
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,720
It's good to get away,

273
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,130
gives you perspective

274
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,130
on things.

275
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,720
Oh, yeah?

276
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,670
There was a lot going

277
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,670
on here.

278
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,170
I had a lot to think about.

279
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,740
Hey, Sarah.

280
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,740
Where you going?

281
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,180
I got us some sliders.

282
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,670
Uh, courthouse.

283
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,670
I want to be there

284
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,720
when Dr. Charles testifies.

285
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,720
Oh, right, right.

286
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,340
I get it. Moral support.

287
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,120
Yeah, he's the reason

288
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,120
I went into psychiatry.

289
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,520
Dr. Charles taught me

290
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,520
everything I know.

291
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,950
Yeah, he's kind

292
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,950
of like your dad getting shot.

293
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,320
My dad? Okay, my dad.

294
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,880
I have not seen my dad

295
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,880
since I was six.

296
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,220
There's no comparison

297
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,660
between him and Dr. Charles.

298
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,530
Dr. Charles, can you identify

299
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,530
the man who shot you

300
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,700
the night of May 11th?

301
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,530
Uh, yes. He's sitting

302
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,630
right there, Jack Kellogg.

303
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,670
We're all very grateful you

304
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,670
pulled through, Dr. Charles.

305
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,110
There's certainly

306
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,110
no one here would blame you

307
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,880
for wanting to see Mr. Kellogg

308
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,640
pay for the physical

309
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,640
and emotional distress

310
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,840
he's caused you.

311
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,020
Now, just a few weeks

312
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,020
before Mr. Kellogg shot you,

313
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,880
he'd been a patient of yours,

314
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,880
right?

315
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,950
Yes.

316
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,260
And at that time,

317
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,520
his actions and his behavior

318
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,330
warranted enough concern

319
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,330
to place him

320
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,130
on a 72-hour psychiatric hold

321
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,130
for further observation.

322
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,130
That's right.

323
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,130
So you were aware

324
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
that Mr. Kellogg was

325
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
a severely troubled man?

326
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,130
Yes. Yes, I was.

327
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,670
The jury's already

328
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,670
heard testimony

329
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,180
from some other experts

330
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,180
who claim

331
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,940
that Mr. Kellogg's

332
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,940
mental state

333
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,210
does not meet the threshold

334
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,480
of what would be considered

335
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,480
legally insane.

336
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,980
But they weren't able

337
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,980
to evaluate him

338
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,020
until well after the incident,

339
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,020
correct?

340
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,390
That's correct.

341
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,890
And they weren't there

342
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,890
in the moment

343
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,820
when Mr. Kellogg shot you

344
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,820
and then himself,

345
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,360
were they?

346
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,360
No. They were not.

347
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,930
Then would you say

348
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,520
they're qualified

349
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,520
to evaluate Mr. Kellogg?

350
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,360
No. In fact, I wouldn't.

351
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,130
With all due respect

352
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,130
to my colleagues,

353
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,610
I feel that I am uniquely

354
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,610
qualified to answer

355
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,470
the question at hand which is

356
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,310
what was Jack Kellogg's

357
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,310
mental state

358
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,010
at the time that he fired

359
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,010
those bullets.

360
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,680
And I believe

361
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,550
that he was legally insane

362
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,990
at that time.

363
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,890
So, in your

364
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,890
expert medical opinion...

365
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,360
I think that Jack Kellogg

366
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,360
should be declared not guilty

367
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,620
by reason of insanity.

368
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,500
Thank you, Dr. Charles.

369
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,990
Hey.

370
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,200
Why would you

371
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,200
perjure yourself

372
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,200
up there?

373
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,830
I didn't perjure myself.

374
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,740
You said that Jack Kellogg

375
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,740
is legally insane.

376
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,040
We both evaluated him,

377
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,640
and we concurred

378
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,640
that he was, and I quote,

379
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,340
"a malignant narcissist

380
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,340
with overt sadistic impulses."

381
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,940
Toxic, yes, and in definite

382
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,940
need of treatment,

383
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,080
but not something that rises

384
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,550
to the definition

385
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,550
of legal insanity.

386
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,420
Sarah, I revised

387
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,420
my diagnosis.

388
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,020
Why?

389
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,020
And why didn't you tell me?

390
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,090
Because Mr. Kellogg

391
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,090
began to present

392
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
with definitive signs

393
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
of dissociation and paranoia.

394
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,130
In other words,

395
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,130
after he shot me,

396
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,890
it occurred we might

397
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,890
have missed

398
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,400
some underlying

399
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,400
psychotic disorder.

400
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,370
You said he'd hid the gun

401
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,370
in his pocket.

402
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,140
Concealing it alone suggests

403
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,140
an awareness of impropriety.

404
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,230
You want to know

405
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,230
why I didn't tell you?

406
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,830
It's cause of this.

407
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,670
You're emotional

408
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,670
about the shooting.

409
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,040
And while I

410
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,040
very much appreciate

411
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,670
the sentiment behind that,

412
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,670
really I do,

413
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,650
I also think it's affected

414
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,650
your objectivity.

415
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,980
Objectivity? You think

416
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,980
you're being objective?

417
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,960
Look, I got to get back

418
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,960
in there for cross.

419
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,720
You know how you can help me?

420
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,580
Go back to the hospital

421
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,580
and treat patients.

422
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,230
Okay? I'll be back at the end

423
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,230
of the day,

424
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,920
and we'll talk some more.

425
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,870
It started a couple of weeks

426
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,870
ago with a headache,

427
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,870
and next thing I know,

428
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,410
he's fiery like a furnace.

429
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,960
101.

430
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,580
Hey, Ryan, I'm Dr. Choi.

431
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,510
So I hear this has been going

432
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,510
on a few weeks?

433
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,770
I know I should have brought

434
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,770
him in sooner.

435
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,040
I got laid off last year,

436
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,040
and we lost our coverage.

437
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,810
Everything is out-of-pocket

438
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,810
right now,

439
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,620
so until I'm working again...

440
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,290
Sorry about this, Mom.

441
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,660
Honey, I told you there is

442
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,660
nothing to be sorry about.

443
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,290
It's okay, Ryan.

444
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,290
Dr. Choi will fix you

445
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,290
right up.

446
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,450
April, let's get a CBC, CMP.

447
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,450
Oh, no.

448
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,750
Not again.

449
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,360
Also start him on fluids.

450
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,060
And Doris, grab some towels.

451
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,940
Let's clean this up, okay?

452
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,940
Yeah.

453
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,980
So I picked up roast chicken

454
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,980
and some hummus,

455
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,610
unless you want

456
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,610
to unpack first?

457
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,750
I got a better idea.

458
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,030
I guess lunch can wait.

459
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,030
Mmm-hmm.

460
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,030
Okay, good news.

461
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,940
Abdomen and pelvis scans

462
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,940
were clean.

463
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,400
Your laryngeal CT did indicate

464
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,400
some mild swelling,

465
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,670
but your arteries look good.

466
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,410
No damage to

467
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,410
the major vessels.

468
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,640
Hi.

469
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,620
Hey.

470
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,650
Mrs. Cutler, I'm Dr. Manning.

471
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,310
I've been treating

472
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,310
your husband Brian.

473
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,150
Can I see him?

474
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,150
He's still unconscious.

475
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,090
The panscan showed his spine,

476
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,090
chest, and belly were clear.

477
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,630
However, his head CT showed

478
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,630
diffuse bilateral

479
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,630
intraparenchymal bleeding.

480
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,930
I'm afraid we're talking

481
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,930
about a bleed in the brain.

482
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,390
Oh, God.

483
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,500
This is not something

484
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,500
we can resolve surgically.

485
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,510
So we've taken your husband

486
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,510
to the ICU.

487
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,070
The hope is that we can

488
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,070
control the bleeding

489
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,970
and the pressure enough

490
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,970
so that he will wake up.

491
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,940
He has to.

492
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,310
Please, I...

493
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,510
I have to tell him I'm sorry.

494
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,750
I said such horrible things.

495
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,450
Mrs. Cutler,

496
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,450
since you're still hoarse,

497
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,850
I've just paged the ENT

498
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,850
to scope your larynx

499
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,860
just to make sure there's no

500
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,860
damage to your vocal chords.

501
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,390
As soon as we do that,

502
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,790
we're gonna take you up

503
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,790
to see your husband.

504
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,730
Thank you.

505
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,730
What was that all about?

506
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,730
Tell him she's sorry?

507
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,530
Yeah. they were

508
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,530
having a fight

509
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,510
when the accident

510
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,510
occurred.

511
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,480
She's afraid she won't

512
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,480
get the chance to

513
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,780
tell him how she really feels.

514
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,980
Were you aware that

515
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,980
Dr. Charles was testifying

516
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,320
in Kellogg's defense?

517
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,320
I found out today.

518
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,460
Dr. Charles wants him remanded

519
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,460
to a psychiatric facility.

520
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,190
Which means

521
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,190
he won't go to jail.

522
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,930
That's absurd.

523
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,930
The man came here

524
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,700
and tried to kill a mental

525
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,700
health professional

526
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,170
because he wanted attention.

527
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,300
Well, I'm as upset

528
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,300
as you are.

529
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,530
I'm the one who found him

530
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,530
bleeding on the sidewalk.

531
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,440
Jack Kellogg is

532
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,440
a devious sociopath.

533
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,610
He'll con his way out

534
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,610
of a mental institution

535
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,980
and be back on the streets.

536
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,980
We have a responsibility,

537
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,420
a public responsibility,

538
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,850
to make sure

539
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,850
that doesn't happen.

540
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,320
Unfortunately, Dr. Reese,

541
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,450
there's nothing you

542
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,450
or I can do.

543
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,790
It's up to the jury.

544
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,490
Help! He can't breathe.

545
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,130
Heart rate's spiking,

546
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,130
statting at 88%.

547
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Get him on oxygen.

548
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Got it.

549
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,670
All right, breath sounds

550
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,670
diminished on the left.

551
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,910
Give me the ultrasound.

552
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,910
Yes, Doctor.

553
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,380
Hey, hey. Why don't we wait

554
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,380
outside, okay?

555
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,640
Left side's full of fluid.

556
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,340
Let's give him four morphine

557
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,340
and two of versed.

558
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,010
We need to get

559
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,010
in a chest tube now.

560
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,450
Lidocaine?

561
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,400
Need the tube, now!

562
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,400
Got it.

563
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,640
Stats are coming up.

564
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,640
He's stabilizing.

565
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,710
April, let's get a blood

566
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,710
sample for cultures,

567
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,160
and Doris, when you finish

568
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,160
taping the tube in place,

569
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,210
get that pus off the wall

570
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,280
before environmental services

571
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,280
has a fit.

572
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,260
I'm sick of this.

573
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,630
Getting stuck

574
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,630
with the dirty work.

575
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,060
Cleaning up pus and vomit

576
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,400
while you get to run labs.

577
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,400
What?

578
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,940
Just 'cause you and Ethan

579
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,940
are sleeping together.

580
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,240
Excuse me?

581
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,580
Mr. Wilson.

582
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,190
A little short of breath?

583
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,310
Afraid so.

584
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,680
Let's get him

585
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,680
on a nasal cannula.

586
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,750
Yes, Doctor.

587
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,350
Dr. Bardovi, the patient's

588
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,350
cardiac index

589
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,760
is 1.8 by Fick.

590
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,760
What would you suggest?

591
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,090
Increase dobutamine

592
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,070
from 3 to 4 to improve

593
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,070
cardiac output.

594
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,120
Correct.

595
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,460
Mr. Wilson, we'll be back

596
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,460
to check on you later.

597
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,800
Thank you, Dr. Latham.

598
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,270
So, any thoughts?

599
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,640
Normal presentation

600
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,640
of non-compaction syndrome.

601
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,870
The patient's in non-ischemic

602
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,870
heart failure.

603
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,750
And?

604
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,750
With his tachycardia,

605
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,380
we can't increase

606
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,380
inotropic support

607
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,220
without risking

608
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,220
cardiogenic shock.

609
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,860
That gives us, at best,

610
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,860
a few more days

611
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,290
to find him a new heart.

612
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,220
Unfortunately, yes.

613
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,460
Carry on.

614
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,320
Dr. Bekker.

615
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,190
Busy day.

616
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,190
How are we progressing?

617
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,990
I completed

618
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,990
my valve replacement,

619
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,660
triple bypass

620
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,660
is being prepped now,

621
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,100
and Dr. Rhodes'

622
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,100
pulmonary thrombectomy

623
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,440
is set for this afternoon.

624
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,730
Robin was discharged

625
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,730
this morning.

626
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,280
Dr. Rhodes will be here as

627
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,280
soon as he gets her settled.

628
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,450
You know, Dr. Latham,

629
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,450
I'm thinking

630
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,150
my bypass patient is stable.

631
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,120
In fact, he could probably

632
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,120
use another day or two

633
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,020
for his heart to rest.

634
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,020
And?

635
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,920
Pulmonary thrombectomy,

636
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,920
that's a difficult procedure.

637
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,980
With everything Dr. Rhodes

638
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,980
is dealing with today,

639
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,880
I could take some

640
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,880
of the pressure off

641
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,620
and perform his thrombectomy.

642
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,320
With your permission,

643
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,320
of course.

644
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,930
That's very considerate

645
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,930
of you.

646
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
We're a team.

647
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,960
Hmm.

648
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,100
Yes. Take the thrombectomy.

649
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,230
I'm sure Dr. Rhodes

650
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,230
will appreciate it.

651
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,170
Oh, come... Do you really

652
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,170
have to go?

653
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,420
It's a pulmonary

654
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,420
thrombectomy.

655
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,050
It's not something

656
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,050
you see every day.

657
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,990
That's a high-profile case.

658
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,930
Did you have to wrestle

659
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,930
Cruella for it?

660
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,690
Ava Bekker?

661
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,720
No, it hasn't quite come

662
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,720
to that yet.

663
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,230
You want to wrestle with me?

664
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,230
Oh...

665
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,070
Well, that is very,

666
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,070
very tempting.

667
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,300
But I really do have to go.

668
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,930
Come on, it will be quick.

669
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,930
No.

670
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,340
I wish I could.

671
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,810
You know, I never understood

672
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,810
why women in movies

673
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,280
have sex on kitchen tables.

674
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,250
It just... It seems so

675
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,250
uncomfortable to me, but...

676
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,310
I don't know.

677
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,420
Maybe we ought to try it.

678
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,030
See what we've been missing

679
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,030
out on, right?

680
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,000
What's the matter?

681
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,970
I shouldn't be late tonight.

682
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,170
Connor.

683
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,350
You'd tell me if something

684
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,350
were wrong, wouldn't you?

685
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,780
Robin, don't worry.

686
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,000
Maggie.

687
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,000
I need some help here.

688
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,560
Barry, what's going on?

689
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,670
Dr. Stohl discharged

690
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,670
this patient.

691
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,170
Mr. Jameson, are you okay?

692
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,170
What happened?

693
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,270
Nothing.

694
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,270
I couldn't leave him at home.

695
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,700
Why not?

696
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,700
First off,

697
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,800
his brother was supposed

698
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,800
to be there

699
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,140
to take care of him.

700
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,140
He wasn't.

701
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,470
Couldn't get away from work

702
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,470
so he's coming tomorrow.

703
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,840
Number two, there's guys

704
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,840
hanging around

705
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,900
waiting to pop him again.

706
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,810
He needs his brother

707
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,810
as back-up.

708
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,610
For real.

709
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,610
Garfield Park.

710
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,650
And there's no place else

711
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,650
for you to go

712
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,710
until your brother gets there?

713
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,450
But...

714
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,150
Okay, 24 hours.

715
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,690
That's all you have, okay?

716
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,890
I'll be back

717
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,890
for him tomorrow.

718
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,330
You better be.

719
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,330
Could use something to eat.

720
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,330
What?

721
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,070
Hey, Reese, I need

722
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,070
to ask you something.

723
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,200
You mentioned, uh,

724
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,200
disinhibition, impulsivity

725
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,150
as things that Robin

726
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,150
might experience.

727
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,050
Can you get a little more

728
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,050
specific for me?

729
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,420
Uh, impulse buying, gambling,

730
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,420
maybe hypersexuality,

731
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,390
hyperphagia...

732
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,390
Hypersexuality?

733
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,890
Are you concerned

734
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,890
about Robin?

735
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,690
Yeah,

736
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,690
of course I'm concerned.

737
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,560
You're sure that she was ready

738
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,560
to be discharged?

739
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,160
Yes.

740
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,160
You're confident about that?

741
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,690
I am, and if my opinion

742
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,690
isn't good enough,

743
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,100
her neurologist and internist

744
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,100
both concurred, okay?

745
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,160
I am trying to figure out

746
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,040
if I'm dealing with Robin

747
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,040
or her antibodies here.

748
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,840
Look, if you're not up

749
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,840
to managing her care,

750
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,900
we can find...

751
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,900
I am.

752
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,640
I'll talk to my husband about

753
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,640
that and we'll see if we can

754
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,640
do it on Thursday.

755
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,410
Beth, where're you going?

756
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,410
We've got a case.

757
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,850
Oh, they gave it

758
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,850
to another team.

759
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,980
The patient's already

760
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,980
in surgery.

761
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,390
Dr. Latham.

762
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,790
Uh, the pre-op team said

763
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,200
that my pulmonary thrombectomy

764
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,260
was already taken to surgery.

765
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,320
I don't understand.

766
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,390
Dr. Bekker kindly offered

767
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,490
to take the case.

768
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,490
I okayed it.

769
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,090
Why?

770
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,600
With Robin's discharge

771
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,600
this morning,

772
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,970
Dr. Bekker thought

773
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,970
you'd be relieved

774
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,270
to have such a difficult

775
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,270
procedure taken off

776
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,270
your plate.

777
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,240
Really?

778
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,240
How considerate of her.

779
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,740
Ah, that's what I said.

780
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,110
It's gratifying, Dr. Rhodes,

781
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,450
to see the two of you working

782
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,450
so well together.

783
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,780
Yeah.

784
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,930
Dr. Choi,

785
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,930
Ryan's labs came back.

786
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,990
White count of 16,000

787
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,990
with a left shift,

788
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,160
plus bicarbs are up...

789
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,160
He's dehydrated.

790
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,630
Let's give him

791
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,630
another liter of fluid

792
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,260
and check on his gram stain.

793
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,690
Um...

794
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,670
Doris thinks

795
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,670
we're sleeping together.

796
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,870
She does?

797
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,570
Did you say something?

798
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,370
No.

799
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,370
Ethan.

800
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,250
April.

801
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,780
I swear I didn't say a word.

802
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,280
Hey, if it's out, great.

803
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,320
No, don't.

804
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,340
Come on.

805
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,820
Why do we have

806
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,820
to keep sneaking around?

807
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,480
Because you're a doctor.

808
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm a nurse.

809
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,890
Not the first time

810
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,890
this ever happened.

811
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,220
Exactly.

812
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,290
I do not want to be

813
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,290
that cliché.

814
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,720
Is that what you think

815
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,720
of us?

816
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,590
No.

817
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,100
But other people will.

818
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,470
Who cares?

819
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,470
That's really easy

820
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,740
for you to say,

821
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,740
'cause you're the doctor.

822
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,810
Someone help my son!

823
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,750
Somebody help my son.

824
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,810
He's having a seizure.

825
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,810
April, push two of Ativan.

826
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,050
On it, two of Ativan.

827
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,590
He's burning up.

828
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,590
We need to get him upstairs

829
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,530
for a head CT now.

830
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,590
Yes, Doctor.

831
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,410
April, let's move.

832
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,410
Okay, here we go.

833
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,110
What is happening to my son?

834
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,510
Ma'am, I promise you,

835
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,510
we're going to find out.

836
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,880
Intracranial pressure's

837
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,880
way up.

838
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,080
Henry, five of morphine.

839
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,210
BP's spiking.

840
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,350
Heart rate's down to 42.

841
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,220
Cushing's response.

842
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,950
Give him another 70

843
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,950
of mannitol.

844
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,120
Will, his pupils are blown.

845
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,960
Veronica, turn up the vent

846
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,960
and hyperventilate him.

847
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,700
Will, we've lost him.

848
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,560
Damn it.

849
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,800
We maxed out on his meds.

850
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,340
There was nothing we could do.

851
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,140
I know.

852
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,700
Dr. Manning.

853
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,700
Yeah?

854
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,220
I understand you just lost

855
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,220
a patient

856
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,510
to an intraparenchymal bleed.

857
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,980
Yes, Brian Cutler.

858
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,540
And we're about

859
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,540
to inform his wife.

860
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,780
Ah, well, there's something

861
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,780
I need you to ask her.

862
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,590
Can I go see

863
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,590
my husband now?

864
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,910
Mrs. Cutler, I'm afraid

865
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,910
we have some very bad news.

866
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,370
Your husband.

867
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,370
Oh, my God...

868
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,370
We were unable to control

869
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,370
the bleeding in his brain.

870
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,710
He suffered what we call

871
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,710
herniation.

872
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,950
That's when pressure on the

873
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,950
brain cuts off blood supply.

874
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,790
Brian is...

875
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,050
He's brain dead.

876
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,830
Unfortunately,

877
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,830
it's irreversible.

878
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,390
Oh, no.

879
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,390
No, no, no, no.

880
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,130
We're very sorry.

881
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,830
But I... I never told him...

882
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,500
No... No...

883
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,500
Mrs. Cutler.

884
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,910
We know this is

885
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,910
a terrible time for you,

886
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,600
but we need to ask.

887
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,370
Your husband was not

888
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,370
registered as an organ donor.

889
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,070
This can't be happening.

890
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,940
There's a young man

891
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,940
in this hospital

892
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,420
who needs your

893
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,420
husband's heart,

894
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,420
but we need your consent.

895
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,680
Brian.

896
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,150
Mrs. Cutler,

897
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,260
your husband's heart will save

898
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,260
this young man's life,

899
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,230
and the sooner we act,

900
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,230
the better.

901
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,260
May we have your permission?

902
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,560
Yes.

903
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,560
Thank you.

904
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,120
This is my case.

905
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,120
Was your case.

906
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,280
And I don't need

907
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,280
to your assistance.

908
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,340
And you open him up?

909
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,640
I had him scheduled

910
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,710
for interventional radiology.

911
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,090
To resect a saddle embolus?

912
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,090
No, that would have been

913
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,090
a great idea

914
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,100
if you were trying

915
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,100
to kill him.

916
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,530
You poached my case and

917
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,530
now you changed the procedure.

918
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,000
Dr. Rhodes. Outside now.

919
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,190
Please.

920
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,970
I can make better use

921
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,970
of your time than kibitzing

922
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,570
with Dr. Bekker.

923
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,570
Dr. Latham...

924
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,120
She is eminently skilled

925
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,120
and qualified

926
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,580
to perform the thrombectomy.

927
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,980
Yeah.

928
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,980
We have a patient

929
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,310
in cardiac failure.

930
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,750
A heart has just been

931
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,750
procured

932
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,990
for transplantation,

933
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,990
but it presents

934
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,860
a significant size mismatch.

935
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,760
So you will have

936
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,760
to completely reconstruct

937
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,260
both the

938
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,260
in and outflow tracks.

939
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,660
No. You will have

940
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,660
to reconstruct them.

941
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,230
It's your case.

942
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,120
Dr. Charles, prosecution's

943
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,120
calling a rebuttal witness.

944
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,480
What do I need to know

945
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,480
about Sarah Reese?

946
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,750
What?

947
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,930
Tell me your own resident

948
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,430
isn't here to poke holes

949
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,430
in your testimony.

950
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,570
So you also

951
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,570
treated the defendant,

952
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,570
Mr. Kellogg.

953
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,630
Yes, I did.

954
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,140
Dr. Reese, is it safe to say

955
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,140
that you disagree

956
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,140
with Dr. Charles?

957
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,640
Yes.

958
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,080
We want to believe

959
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,350
that the only thing

960
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,350
that can explain

961
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,560
aberrant behavior

962
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,560
is some sort of insanity.

963
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,460
But even in my short time

964
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,460
as a psychiatric resident,

965
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,860
I've found that that's not

966
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,860
always the case.

967
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,090
And it is certainly not

968
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,090
the case with Mr. Kellogg.

969
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,230
Lying bitch!

970
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,230
Sit down.

971
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,570
You're a lying bitch.

972
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,870
Deputies, restrain

973
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,870
the defendant.

974
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,640
Let me go. You're a liar.

975
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,640
A damn liar!

976
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,710
Mr. Kellogg, control yourself!

977
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,710
Let go!

978
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,870
You're a liar!

979
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,510
Order in this court!

980
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,510
You'll pay for this.

981
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,240
Get off of me.

982
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,580
Get off of me.

983
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,380
Off of me.

984
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,980
You're a liar!

985
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,720
Let go of me.

986
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,720
Get off of me!

987
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,090
You're a liar, damn it!

988
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,190
Ryan has an infection

989
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,190
in his brain?

990
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,630
It's called

991
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,630
a subdural abscess.

992
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,130
He contracted an infection,

993
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,130
and as it spread,

994
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,400
a small collection of pus was

995
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,400
walled-off inside his brain.

996
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,530
How does this happen?

997
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,730
We're hoping you might be

998
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,730
able to help us answer that.

999
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,900
Mrs. Potter, can you think

1000
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,900
of anywhere Ryan

1001
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,710
may have been exposed

1002
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,710
to a fungus or parasite?

1003
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,080
Did Ryan go camping?

1004
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,710
Possibly swimming

1005
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,710
in a lake or river.

1006
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,080
No.

1007
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,080
Nothing like that.

1008
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,380
Any dental work?

1009
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,150
We haven't been

1010
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,150
to the dentist in ages.

1011
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,090
Never. It's too expensive.

1012
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,930
Severe tooth decay

1013
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,930
on the left posteriors.

1014
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,470
Small abrasion on the surface

1015
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,470
of the gums.

1016
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,300
Could have allowed bacteria

1017
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,300
to enter the bloodstream

1018
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,360
and travel to his brain.

1019
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,970
Am I going to be okay?

1020
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,270
We'll start you

1021
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,270
on antibiotics,

1022
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,870
but you'll likely need surgery

1023
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,100
to drain the abscess.

1024
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,370
I'll get you a referral

1025
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,440
for an oral surgeon.

1026
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,810
How could this happen?

1027
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,040
He never even complained

1028
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,040
of a toothache.

1029
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,020
Mr. Jameson,

1030
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,020
why are you still here?

1031
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,960
Uh, there was an issue.

1032
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,690
Maggie.

1033
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,690
Yes.

1034
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,960
Why is Mr. Jameson sipping

1035
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,960
on a juice box in my ED?

1036
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,030
He couldn't be left at home.

1037
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,940
Maggie, we are not

1038
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,940
running a hotel here.

1039
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,400
But if he goes home

1040
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,400
by himself,

1041
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,810
he could get shot again.

1042
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,140
However unfortunate

1043
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,140
that situation may be,

1044
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,510
it is not our problem.

1045
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,920
We treat 'em, we street 'em.

1046
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,920
That's what we do.

1047
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,610
Treat 'em

1048
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,610
and street 'em is fine

1049
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,520
for people who live

1050
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,520
on your street.

1051
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,750
Not his.

1052
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,450
Maggie, I'm not...

1053
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,450
Dr. Stohl.

1054
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,850
You're rightfully concerned

1055
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,490
about someone getting shot

1056
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,490
in the ED,

1057
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,120
but what about

1058
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,120
the people who live

1059
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,100
with that kind

1060
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,100
of thing every day?

1061
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,770
I cannot correct

1062
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,770
society's ills.

1063
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,100
I patch people up.

1064
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,100
Now discharge Mr. Jameson.

1065
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,080
So you got plans tonight?

1066
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,080
You and Dr. Choi?

1067
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,730
Why you trying

1068
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,730
to start something?

1069
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,390
Am I wrong, April?

1070
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,160
You're not sleeping together?

1071
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,860
Yes, you're wrong.

1072
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,930
Don't blame my mom.

1073
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,160
She didn't know.

1074
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,470
It was just a toothache.

1075
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,510
I shouldn't have

1076
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,510
kept it a secret.

1077
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,480
Just a toothache?

1078
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,340
I can't imagine how much

1079
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,340
that hurt.

1080
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,540
She's always worried

1081
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,540
about money.

1082
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,650
I didn't want to worry

1083
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,650
her more.

1084
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,850
It's my fault.

1085
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,850
No.

1086
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,650
You did what you thought

1087
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,650
was best.

1088
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,660
I know what you're thinking.

1089
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,220
About secrets.

1090
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,270
All I'm thinking is

1091
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,270
that's one brave kid.

1092
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,500
Our secret...

1093
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,240
It's up to you, April.

1094
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,410
I want you to be comfortable.

1095
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,620
You said you'd

1096
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,620
keep him 24 hours.

1097
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,250
The Chief

1098
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,250
of Department said no.

1099
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,520
You have to go home.

1100
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,520
He's helpless.

1101
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,960
They'll kill him.

1102
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,600
What do

1103
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,600
you want me to do?

1104
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,360
Maggie.

1105
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,900
Bring the patient over here.

1106
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,740
You feel that?

1107
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,410
Yeah.

1108
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,310
Push your foot

1109
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,310
against my hand.

1110
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,290
Can you feel that now?

1111
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,160
Um, no.

1112
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,590
I suspect there

1113
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,590
may be nerve damage

1114
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,830
we didn't pick up earlier.

1115
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,740
I'd like to admit Mr. Jameson

1116
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,430
for inpatient physical

1117
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,430
and occupational therapy.

1118
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,340
Hmm.

1119
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,120
Robin. Hey, you okay?

1120
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,460
Yeah, I was thinking

1121
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,460
about this afternoon and...

1122
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,300
You just seemed...

1123
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,330
I don't know.

1124
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,070
Everything's good

1125
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,070
with us, right?

1126
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,630
Uh, yeah, everything's good.

1127
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,110
So, I'm just being paranoid.

1128
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,730
Do you know what, never mind.

1129
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,780
Don't... Don't answer that.

1130
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,280
Um, if you want I could look

1131
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,280
pasta for dinner tonight.

1132
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,380
You mean "cook"?

1133
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,420
Cook, yes.

1134
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,620
Cook pasta.

1135
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,750
Honey.

1136
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,550
Are you taking your meds?

1137
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,760
Yes, I'm taking my meds.

1138
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,760
Wha...

1139
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,130
I'll be home before long,

1140
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,130
okay?

1141
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,770
Okay.

1142
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,180
I hear you one-upped me.

1143
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,710
Heart transplant with a

1144
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,710
significant size mismatch.

1145
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,680
That looks good on the CV.

1146
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,210
Guess you have me to thank,

1147
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,880
taking that thrombectomy

1148
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,880
off your hands.

1149
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,750
Ava, I'm really not

1150
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,750
in the mood.

1151
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,290
You should go home

1152
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,290
and get some sleep.

1153
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,070
Oh, there you are, Dr. Reese.

1154
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,910
Uh, you'll be happy to know

1155
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,910
that Mr. Kellogg

1156
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,910
was found guilty.

1157
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,410
I'm not happy, but I am

1158
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,410
satisfied with that verdict.

1159
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,280
He'll still receive treatment

1160
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,280
in jail.

1161
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,010
Through the Department

1162
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,010
of Corrections?

1163
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,980
You have any idea

1164
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,980
what their success rate is?

1165
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,250
In that environment?

1166
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,820
His chances of rehabilitation

1167
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,820
are practically nil.

1168
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,130
Not that it really matters,

1169
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,130
because more than likely

1170
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,060
his temper will get him killed

1171
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,060
within a week.

1172
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,720
Those outbursts are an act

1173
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,770
calculated to convince

1174
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,770
you he's crazy.

1175
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,500
Is that what he was doing?

1176
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,440
Dr. Reese,

1177
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,440
I've been evaluating

1178
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,440
psychiatric patients

1179
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,440
for more than 30 years.

1180
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,770
Is it conceivable to you

1181
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,770
that I might have more insight

1182
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,140
into his behavior than you do?

1183
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,650
Daniel.

1184
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,840
Give us a moment, Dr. Reese.

1185
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
Daniel.

1186
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,730
You recruited her

1187
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,760
because you liked

1188
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,760
that she thought for herself.

1189
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,800
Don't hold

1190
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,800
that against her now.

1191
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,100
Sharon,

1192
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,100
Kellogg is not a criminal.

1193
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,370
He's a confused guy in a lot

1194
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,370
of pain who needs some help.

1195
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,000
Like someone else I know.

1196
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,470
What's that supposed to mean?

1197
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,870
Look, I didn't say anything

1198
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,380
when you insisted upon

1199
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,380
returning to work

1200
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,180
before you were cleared to,

1201
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,180
because I got it.

1202
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,510
It was important to reclaim

1203
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,510
your agency.

1204
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,040
But now here you are,

1205
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,040
the one person in Chicago

1206
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,820
willing to champion the cause

1207
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,830
of the man who tried

1208
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,830
to kill you.

1209
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,490
I got to say, it concerns me.

1210
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,260
Why? 'Cause I want

1211
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,260
to send him to an asylum?

1212
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,290
Not a day spa,

1213
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,290
instead of a prison?

1214
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,130
Because I want... I want

1215
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,130
to treat his illness

1216
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,430
instead of punishing

1217
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,430
him for it?

1218
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,560
It's still my patient.

1219
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,560
Very noble, Daniel,

1220
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,670
but I don't think

1221
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,670
that's what this is about.

1222
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,640
I think this is about

1223
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,640
your guilt and your ego.

1224
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,050
You had a killer

1225
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,050
on your hands,

1226
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,050
and you missed the signs.

1227
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,310
And now you're trying

1228
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,310
to make up for your mistake.

1229
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,520
You're trying to fix it

1230
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,520
and get back in control.

1231
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,030
You've been through so much,

1232
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,030
Daniel.

1233
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,490
Let it go.

1234
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,800
Stop torturing yourself.

1235
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,180
Dr. Rhodes.

1236
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,810
I've been thinking about

1237
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,810
your pulmonary thrombectomy.

1238
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,050
I can't help but wonder

1239
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,050
if Dr. Bekker didn't...

1240
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,120
What's the word? Manipulate

1241
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,120
me for her own gain.

1242
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,720
I wouldn't worry about it,

1243
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,720
Dr. Latham.

1244
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,950
I know that fellows compete

1245
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,950
for the most challenging cases

1246
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,930
to improve their resumes.

1247
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,460
Perhaps in the end, you fared

1248
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,460
better than Dr. Bekker.

1249
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,500
Is that why you gave me

1250
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,500
the transplant?

1251
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,500
I'm not sure.

1252
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,540
Sometimes my motivations are

1253
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,540
a mystery to me, to be honest.

1254
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,550
Good night, Dr. Rhodes.

1255
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,680
Good night, Dr. Latham.

1256
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,320
Mrs. Cutler.

1257
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,160
The transplant was successful.

1258
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,890
The young man, the recipient

1259
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,890
of your husband's heart,

1260
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,300
he's doing well.

1261
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,500
The last thing Brian

1262
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,500
heard me say

1263
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,240
was that I didn't love him.

1264
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,350
May I see him?

1265
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,950
The young man.

1266
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,790
The heart recipient?

1267
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,790
Yes.

1268
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,930
Please.

1269
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,010
Closer. Please.

1270
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,060
I'm so sorry, Brian.

1271
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,630
I love you.

1272
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,010
Sorry I wasn't here to help

1273
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,010
ease you into civilian life.

1274
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,410
I mean,

1275
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,410
for all the good it did,

1276
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,550
I probably should've skipped

1277
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,550
testifying all together.

1278
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,420
It's okay, Dad.

1279
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,490
I wish I could have

1280
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,490
been there for you.

1281
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh...

1282
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,560
I mean, at least

1283
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,560
I knew you were

1284
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,330
in Connor's

1285
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,330
very capable hands.

1286
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,810
What? What is it?

1287
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,310
He doesn't trust me.

1288
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,720
What do you mean?

1289
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,060
I saw a look on his face.

1290
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,950
He thinks my feelings

1291
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,950
for him are part

1292
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,950
of my disease.

1293
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,900
Oh, honey.

1294
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,830
Is he right?

1295
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,040
Or is this just...

1296
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,280
All in my head,

1297
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,240
and that's part of

1298
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,240
the disease?

1299
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,280
Dad,

1300
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,280
how do I know what's real?

1301
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,150
Come here.

1302
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,620
I mean,

1303
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,620
we're all driven by so many

1304
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,160
different things.

1305
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,290
Truthfully, a lot of the time

1306
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,290
I don't have a clue

1307
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,930
why I do the things that I do.

1308
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,830
But I mean, even if you can't

1309
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,830
always trust your brain...

1310
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,280
In my experience,

1311
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,280
you're usually pretty safe

1312
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,370
trusting your heart.

1313
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,240
You know?

1314
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,360
Good night, Dr. Choi.

1315
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,360
Good night, April.

1316
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,340
I feel for that woman.

1317
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,640
Having to live

1318
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,640
with those regrets.

1319
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,050
Yeah.

1320
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,240
Well, good night, Will.

1321
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,550
Night.

1322
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,480
Natalie.

1323
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,420
When you left, you knew

1324
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,420
about me and Nina.

1325
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,690
But I didn't get a chance

1326
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,690
to tell you

1327
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,390
why I broke up with her.

1328
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,830
It was because of the feelings

1329
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,830
I have for you.

1330
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,810
Those feelings haven't

1331
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,810
gone away.

1332
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,780
You don't have to say

1333
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,780
anything.

1334
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,640
I don't have any

1335
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,640
expectations.

1336
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,010
I just...

1337
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,280
I felt I had to tell you.

1338
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,780
My, um...

1339
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,860
My sabbatical.

1340
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,830
The things I needed to

1341
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,830
think about...

1342
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,360
It's you.
