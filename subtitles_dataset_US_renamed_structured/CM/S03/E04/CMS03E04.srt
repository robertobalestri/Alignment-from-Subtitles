1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,300
Don't worry.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,900
You'll see, it'll be

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,900
like you never left.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,070
Connor, last time

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,070
people from work saw me,

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,840
I was strapped to a gurney,

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,840
screaming about rats.

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,580
Look, they understand.

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,310
You were sick,

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,310
and now you're not.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,920
Everything's gonna be fine.

12
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,220
And if you need me,

13
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,220
which you won't,

14
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,310
I'm on trauma service today,

15
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,310
so I will be in the ED,

16
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,310
okay?

17
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,090
Mmm-hmm.

18
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,690
But you have to tell me.

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,290
And violate the sacred oath?

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,130
It's not like you're

21
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,130
guarding the Holy Grail.

22
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,170
It's a holiday gift exchange.

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,170
That we call "Secret Santa"

24
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,070
because we're supposed

25
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,070
to keep it a secret.

26
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,900
Okay, so who is it?

27
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,900
Is it April?

28
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,870
I'm not gonna tell ya.

29
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,410
Fine, don't tell me,

30
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,570
but it's only a matter of time

31
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,570
before you crack.

32
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,640
Not a chance.

33
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,640
Mmm-hmm.

34
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,780
Can I grab you for a sec?

35
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,750
Something to show you.

36
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,750
Sure.

37
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,810
Oh, look who it is.

38
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,550
Hi.

39
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,520
Robin?

40
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,520
Welcome back.

41
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,230
There she is.

42
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,230
Hello, Robin.

43
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,430
You look great.

44
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,430
Doesn't she?

45
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,130
Wait till she snaps again.

46
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,930
She was cleared

47
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,930
to come back to work.

48
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,060
She's Dr. Charles's daughter.

49
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,060
They're gonna say no?

50
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,610
You, too.

51
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,210
See, I told you

52
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,210
it would all be fine.

53
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,210
Coffee at 11:00?

54
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,110
Yeah.

55
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,110
All right.

56
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,580
There you are.

57
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,720
You look great, honey.

58
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,720
I'd be a lot better

59
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,720
if everyone stopped

60
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,720
telling me that.

61
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,120
Help!

62
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,120
I need a doctor! Hurry!

63
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,980
We need some help over here!

64
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,980
Dr. Choi, with me.

65
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,360
Uh, he's having chest pain.

66
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,120
Sir, can you hear me?

67
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,900
Sir?

68
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,900
No pulse. Get on his chest!

69
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,940
Grab his arms.

70
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,370
All right, on my count.

71
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,370
Ready? One, two, three.

72
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,250
What's the matter with Santa?

73
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,250
It's all right, honey.

74
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,800
Let's get him to a room.

75
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,870
Uh, gurney.

76
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,870
We're on it.

77
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,110
He thought it was

78
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,110
just indigestion.

79
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,950
I told him we should

80
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,950
call an ambulance.

81
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,550
Is Santa going to die?

82
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,550
No, no, sweetie,

83
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,820
we're going to take

84
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,820
very good care of him.

85
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,550
Still no pulse.

86
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,550
We gotta move.

87
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,860
Let's get a

88
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,860
crash cart ready!

89
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,600
Massive MI. We hit him

90
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,600
with five rounds of epi.

91
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,700
There was no

92
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,700
bringing him back.

93
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,240
Poor man.

94
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,240
Name's Bill Cooper.

95
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,870
He's been Santa-in-residence

96
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,870
at Water Tower Place

97
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,680
for the past 25 years.

98
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,110
Saint Nick dying

99
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,110
in our waiting room?

100
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,920
Not a good look for us.

101
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,480
You let me know

102
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,480
the second his family arrives.

103
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,130
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,130
Incoming!

105
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,590
Monique, you're on deck.

106
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,590
Dr. Rhodes?

107
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,430
Pedro Suarez,

108
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,430
30-year-old male.

109
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,090
Fell 20 feet off his roof

110
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,090
stringing Christmas lights.

111
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,200
GCS of 8.

112
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,200
King airway in the field.

113
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,740
Initially hypotensive,

114
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,740
but responded to

115
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,740
a liter of fluids.

116
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,570
Please tell me

117
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,570
my son is gonna be okay.

118
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,730
Mr. Suarez, I promise you

119
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,800
we're gonna do

120
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,800
everything we can.

121
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,440
All right,

122
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,440
everybody on my count.

123
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,140
One, two, three.

124
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,710
Thank you.

125
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,710
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,890
Sats are 86 and falling fast.

127
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,150
I'm not getting

128
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,150
breath sounds on the left.

129
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,490
He's got a tension

130
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,490
pneumothorax.

131
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,090
Let's decompress him

132
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,090
and put a chest tube in.

133
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,460
Needle?

134
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,660
Straight up.

135
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,360
Sats and blood pressure

136
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,360
are coming up.

137
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,900
All right.

138
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,900
I'm gonna place the tube.

139
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,130
Scalpel.

140
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,980
Okay, come on.

141
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,680
That's not blood.

142
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,680
Nope.

143
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,050
That's...

144
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,020
That's fecal matter.

145
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,790
Fecal matter? How did

146
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,790
he get poop in his chest?

147
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,890
Vincent Kramer, went through

148
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,890
a stained-glass window.

149
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,130
Found him wandering

150
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,130
the streets.

151
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Mr. Kramer,

152
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
can you tell me what happened?

153
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,700
They're coming for me,

154
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,700
the demons!

155
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,070
GCS, 13.

156
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,070
BP, 86 over palp.

157
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,540
Arterial bleed in his forearm.

158
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,310
Tourniquet applied

159
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,310
in the field,

160
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,310
but he's still bleeding.

161
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,940
Okay, let's transfer

162
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,940
on my count,

163
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,110
and watch out for

164
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,110
the glass, okay?

165
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,620
Ready? One, two, three.

166
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,950
Doris, let's take

167
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,950
a look at his arm.

168
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,610
Wait, did you see them?

169
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,610
The demons?

170
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,090
Try to stay calm, Mr. Kramer.

171
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,420
They're after me!

172
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,420
Heart rate, 134.

173
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,460
BP, 86/52.

174
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,330
That's hypotensive.

175
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,330
Bolus a liter of LR,

176
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,730
and give him two units

177
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,730
of uncrossmatched blood

178
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,170
on the rapid transfuser.

179
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,170
Yes, Doctor.

180
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,500
Ah!

181
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,500
Oh!

182
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,330
All right,

183
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,330
it severed his radial artery.

184
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
Give me a hemostat

185
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
and a silk tie.

186
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,930
We need to get control

187
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,930
and tie it off.

188
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,770
They're here.

189
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,770
Please believe me.

190
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,330
We got you, Mr. Kramer.

191
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,330
Just try to stay calm.

192
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,640
No, no, no.

193
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,580
No, no, no.

194
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,580
Got it.

195
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,580
Bleeding's under control.

196
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,210
Can't you see them?

197
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,480
Blood pressure's

198
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,480
improving.

199
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,220
Oh! Demons, everywhere.

200
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,920
Help me.

201
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,460
We're going to, Mr. Kramer.

202
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,130
Let's get him

203
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,130
in soft restraints,

204
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,430
and we're gonna need

205
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,430
a psych consult.

206
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,030
Get away from me.

207
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,400
Get away from me.

208
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,040
Okay, when did the fever

209
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,040
start, Mr. Rosenblatt?

210
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,840
Uh, I felt funny Sunday,

211
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,380
but that went away.

212
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,080
I definitely had

213
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,080
a fever Tuesday.

214
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,140
Okay.

215
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,420
Well, how specific

216
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,420
should I be?

217
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,960
Just answer

218
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,960
the question, Harold.

219
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,680
Tuesday.

220
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,680
Tuesday. Okay.

221
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
And don't forget

222
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
about the rash.

223
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,690
Oh... Oh.

224
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,690
Oh.

225
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,130
Okay, let's get

226
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,130
a chest X-ray,

227
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,570
CBC, blood cultures,

228
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,570
and start him on fluids.

229
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,620
He's jaundiced.

230
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,000
A liver panel and a CT scan

231
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,000
probably couldn't hurt.

232
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,670
Thank you, nurse. That's what

233
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,670
I was about to suggest.

234
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,570
Let, uh, Radiology know

235
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,570
that we're sending him up.

236
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,180
All right, Mr. Rosenblatt,

237
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,180
can you please put that on?

238
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,710
And you might wanna leave

239
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,710
any valuables you have

240
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,150
with your wife.

241
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,150
Wife?

242
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,550
She's my sister.

243
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,050
And housemate

244
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,310
who told you we should've

245
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,310
come in earlier.

246
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,450
Give it a rest, Sylvia.

247
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,450
Fine.

248
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,620
Next time,

249
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,620
I'll just let you die.

250
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,460
How does that work for you?

251
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,650
Anything is better than

252
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,650
listening to you.

253
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,360
Okay, um, we'll be back

254
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,090
to check on you guys

255
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,090
after that scan.

256
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,540
You wanted to see me?

257
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,540
Yes, uh, Daniel...

258
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,010
Uh, I'm afraid

259
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,010
I've got some bad news.

260
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,270
The man who shot you,

261
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,270
Jack Kellogg,

262
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,110
was killed in prison

263
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,110
this morning.

264
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,280
How?

265
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,280
All I know is that

266
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,720
he was murdered

267
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,720
by another inmate.

268
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,750
You predicted

269
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,750
something like this.

270
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,590
You didn't think he should go

271
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,590
to prison in the first place.

272
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,690
No, I didn't.

273
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,690
And you were upset

274
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,460
with Dr. Reese for testifying

275
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,460
for the prosecution.

276
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,030
And?

277
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,900
I just hope

278
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,700
you don't take this

279
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,700
out on her.

280
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,270
Do you really think

281
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,270
I'd do that?

282
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,470
I'm sorry,

283
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,640
but given how upset you were

284
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,640
that she testified,

285
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,850
I didn't know

286
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,850
how you would react.

287
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,150
I know this is difficult.

288
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,480
Why don't you just

289
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,480
take a few days off?

290
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
Oh, so not only

291
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
am I vindictive,

292
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,520
I'm emotionally unstable?

293
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,250
You know what,

294
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,250
I'd rather work.

295
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,730
But I sure do

296
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,730
appreciate the offer.

297
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,030
Daniel...

298
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,160
Come on...

299
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,760
Daniel.

300
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,500
Fever, rash, jaundiced skin.

301
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm sure you noticed

302
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,500
his conjunctivitis.

303
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,940
I was getting there.

304
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,170
By any chance,

305
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,170
was the rash purple?

306
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,710
Yeah. Why?

307
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,710
Stohl had a patient

308
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,450
with the exact same symptoms

309
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,450
three days ago.

310
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,480
The cultures just came in.

311
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,120
Leptospirosis?

312
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,630
It's bacterial, right?

313
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,630
Yeah.

314
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,660
Stohl's guy went into DIC.

315
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,530
Disseminated intravascular

316
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,530
coagulation.

317
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
I know what it is.

318
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,860
Are we looking at an outbreak?

319
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,130
I'll page Robin Charles.

320
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,310
So, his colon's

321
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,310
in his chest?

322
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,310
Diaphragm ruptured

323
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,310
from the impact of the fall.

324
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,480
Stomach, spleen and colon

325
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,480
were ripped from

326
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,480
the abdominal wall,

327
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,540
and migrated

328
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,540
into the left chest.

329
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,810
I hate when that happens.

330
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,790
The OR is being prepped

331
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,790
for surgery right now.

332
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,320
You'll do the thoracotomy,

333
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,320
while I open his abdomen.

334
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,050
All right.

335
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,050
Oh, and just as a reminder,

336
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,530
uh, I am on

337
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,530
trauma service today,

338
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,460
and this is

339
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,460
a trauma surgery, so...

340
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,660
So you'll be attending

341
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,660
on the case,

342
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,830
and you're going to get

343
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,830
your kicks out of

344
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,830
calling the shots?

345
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm delighted to assist you,

346
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,200
Dr. Rhodes.

347
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,070
I'm glad to hear that.

348
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,130
Shall we?

349
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,130
Okay.

350
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,730
Boss.

351
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,680
Dr. Charles?

352
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,610
Um... I, um...

353
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,250
I heard about Jack Kellogg.

354
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,840
I am so sorry.

355
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,390
It's exactly what you said

356
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,390
would happen.

357
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,720
Uh, he was a very

358
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,720
troubled man

359
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,250
who brought things

360
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,250
on himself.

361
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,450
Yes, but if he

362
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,450
had been remanded

363
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,760
to a psychiatric facility,

364
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,760
like you wanted, uh...

365
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,330
I... I just feel so awful.

366
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,160
Look, Dr. Reese,

367
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,160
if you're thinking

368
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,670
that in some way,

369
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,670
this might've been your fault,

370
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,340
it just wasn't.

371
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
He was a very

372
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
self-destructive guy,

373
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,300
and there's just no guarantee

374
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,900
the outcome would've been

375
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,900
any different,

376
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,510
no matter where he ended up.

377
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,510
Dr. Charles... Excuse me.

378
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,140
Um, you available

379
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,140
for a consult?

380
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,980
Yes, we are.

381
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,250
Name is Vincent Kramer,

382
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,250
homeless man.

383
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,290
Delusional, combative.

384
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,290
We have him in restraints.

385
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,490
I'm the only one

386
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,490
trying to help you.

387
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,930
Don't you see them?

388
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,930
The demons!

389
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,550
They're here.

390
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
No one is safe.

391
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,400
Why don't you listen?

392
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,400
Actually, Dr. Charles,

393
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,370
there's some patients

394
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,370
I need to check on upstairs.

395
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
That is why

396
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
they keep coming back.

397
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,740
Okay.

398
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,740
They won't stop.

399
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,240
They will find me.

400
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,240
They were looking for me.

401
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,300
The paramedics say he somehow

402
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,300
went through a window.

403
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,780
Oh...

404
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,780
No one is safe!

405
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,250
Poor fella.

406
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,680
Mr. Kramer?

407
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm Dr. Charles.

408
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,480
I can't stop them.

409
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,480
Nobody can stop them.

410
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,450
They're gonna find me here.

411
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,510
Them?

412
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,510
The demons.

413
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,460
You know what,

414
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,460
I can understand how...

415
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,390
How demons would be

416
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,390
very frightening.

417
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,990
They're gonna

418
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,990
take me with them.

419
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,530
I'm not gonna

420
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,530
let that happen.

421
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,530
You're safe here.

422
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,530
Five of Olanzapine.

423
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,590
Yes, doctor.

424
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,590
Safe?

425
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,930
We're giving you something

426
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,330
that's gonna

427
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,330
calm you down a bit,

428
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,030
and you should be

429
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,030
feeling better pretty soon.

430
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,340
Better?

431
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,340
Yeah.

432
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,470
I'm just gonna

433
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,470
step out for a bit,

434
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,910
and when I come back,

435
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,910
you and I,

436
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,510
we're gonna start

437
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,510
to figure this out, all right?

438
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,250
Okay?

439
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,690
Gonna let the Olanzapine

440
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,690
mellow him out a bit,

441
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,520
and, uh, come back

442
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,520
and see if I can get

443
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,580
a better picture

444
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,580
of what's going on.

445
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,060
Yeah.

446
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Uh, Leptospi-what?

447
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Leptospirosis.

448
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
It's a bacterial infection.

449
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,840
We're starting you on

450
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,840
a broad spectrum antibiotic.

451
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,700
It's all that pork you eat.

452
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,010
Moo shu, bacon, it's treif.

453
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,740
Treif?

454
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,740
Not kosher.

455
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,810
Actually, the disease is

456
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,810
most commonly carried

457
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,150
by rodents, rats,

458
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,150
rat urine, specifically,

459
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,310
usually through water

460
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,310
that's been contaminated.

461
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,560
What the hell have you

462
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,560
been drinking, Harold?

463
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,390
Will you stop nagging

464
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,390
and let her finish?

465
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,430
There have been

466
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,430
a couple cases recently.

467
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,020
I need to ask you

468
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,020
some questions

469
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,430
to see if your case

470
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,430
is connected.

471
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,500
Okay, can you think

472
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,500
of anywhere

473
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,500
you have been recently

474
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,540
where you may have come

475
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,540
in contact with rats?

476
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,940
Uh, like an attic

477
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,940
or basement?

478
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,870
Anywhere you might've been

479
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,870
exposed to contaminated water?

480
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,210
Oh. You've been

481
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,210
swimming at the Y.

482
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,050
I told you to join the JCC.

483
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,810
She's talking to me, Sylvia.

484
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,460
Okay, we'll see if the Y has

485
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,460
reported a recent infestation.

486
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,790
Anything else

487
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,790
you can think of?

488
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,420
You sure it's not the pork?

489
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,020
I'm so sorry for your loss.

490
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,560
My sister would like to

491
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,560
move him to a funeral home.

492
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,270
How long do you need

493
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,270
to keep him here?

494
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,930
Normally, a day or two,

495
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,740
but I'll ask

496
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,740
the medical examiner

497
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,040
to release his body

498
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,040
this afternoon.

499
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,940
Oh, thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

500
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,450
Hey, Dr. Rhodes,

501
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,860
just wanted to let you know

502
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,860
Radiology's uploading

503
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,790
your patient's latest scans.

504
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,790
Thank you.

505
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,830
Hey, will you do me a favor?

506
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,830
If you see Robin,

507
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,590
will you tell her that

508
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,590
I got pulled into surgery?

509
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,070
I'm not gonna make

510
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,070
our coffee date.

511
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,930
Sure, but she's

512
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,930
probably busy, too.

513
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,670
Three cases of Leptospirosis.

514
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,970
Lepto?

515
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,540
Isn't that a rat disease?

516
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,100
Yeah, it can be.

517
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,880
Just what she needs today.

518
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,120
I was doing the laundry,

519
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,120
and the next thing I know,

520
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,280
I started cramping.

521
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,850
Are these contractions?

522
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,850
I'm only 22 weeks.

523
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,130
Okay, um, let's get a CBC

524
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,130
and UA with culture.

525
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,760
Is there anyone

526
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,760
we should call?

527
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,490
My husband's away

528
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,490
at a legal conference,

529
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,830
but he was having trouble

530
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,060
catching a flight

531
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,060
out of Buffalo.

532
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,470
Is everything okay

533
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,470
with my baby?

534
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,230
Let's take a look, okay?

535
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,880
All right,

536
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,880
there's the heartbeat.

537
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,250
Head circumference measuring

538
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,250
at about 178 millimeters.

539
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,450
Looks like a normal, healthy

540
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,450
22-week-old fetus to me.

541
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,990
Thank God.

542
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,650
All right,

543
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,650
so we'll run those tests

544
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,820
and go from there, okay?

545
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,820
And don't worry, Shannon,

546
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,160
we're gonna take really good

547
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,160
care of you and your baby.

548
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,030
Okay?

549
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,070
Thank you.

550
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,230
Harold? Harold?

551
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,110
We need to intubate.

552
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,580
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

553
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,580
Oh, my God.

554
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,880
Ms. Rosenblatt, it's okay.

555
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,880
Please, wait out here,

556
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,350
until we're finished.

557
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,350
Harold!

558
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,310
Get me an ET tube.

559
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,310
Harold...

560
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,220
I... I can't.

561
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,220
I can't get it in.

562
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,690
It's... It's too much

563
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,690
blood. Suction.

564
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,830
Sats are down to 76.

565
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,060
I still can't get it in.

566
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,960
Noah...

567
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,200
I'll get another doctor.

568
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,530
No!

569
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,270
He needs a surgical airway.

570
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,270
A crich? Really?

571
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,070
Splash prep on his neck.

572
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,310
Sterilizing.

573
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,650
Give me a knife.

574
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,020
I'm in. Bag him.

575
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,460
Heart rate's 140.

576
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,230
BP, 124/82.

577
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,500
You did it.

578
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,930
Of course I did it.

579
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,480
Shannon?

580
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,360
How are you feeling?

581
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,360
All better now.

582
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm so sorry

583
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,360
I wasn't here sooner.

584
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,350
I canceled all my meetings,

585
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,350
got on the first flight out.

586
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,620
How's the baby?

587
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,320
Dr. Manning

588
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,320
was just explaining.

589
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,700
Hi, um...

590
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,700
Hi.

591
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,960
Well, I think

592
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,960
it's just a case of

593
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,560
Braxton Hicks contractions,

594
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,560
practice contractions.

595
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,230
Nothing to be concerned about.

596
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
However, I would like to

597
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
just run one more test,

598
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,440
just to ensure that

599
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,440
it's not pre-term labor.

600
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,540
If that's all clear,

601
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,540
then you should be good to go.

602
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,840
What a relief.

603
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,380
Man, is it me

604
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,380
or is it hot in here?

605
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,410
Mr. Kim, everything okay?

606
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,040
Throat's just a little dry.

607
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,580
Is there any way

608
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,580
I can get some water?

609
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,350
Definitely.

610
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,350
Your color is a bit off.

611
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,620
Have you had any fever,

612
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,620
headaches?

613
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,720
I'm probably just worn down

614
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,720
from the travel.

615
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,390
Well, how 'bout I give you

616
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,390
a quick look-see,

617
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,450
run a few tests?

618
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,450
But Shannon...

619
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,130
Oh, go ahead, honey.

620
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,130
You do look a little pale.

621
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,570
Oh, I'll have you

622
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,570
back in no time.

623
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,570
Honey, I won't be far.

624
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,770
Right this way.

625
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,770
Thanks.

626
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,180
First time dads.

627
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,710
Are you sure Robin was ready

628
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,710
to come back to work?

629
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,940
Let's get that tube out

630
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,750
before it contaminates

631
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,750
his chest.

632
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,060
I only ask because we had

633
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,060
an anti-NMDA patient

634
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,720
at Groote Schuur.

635
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,420
She had psychotic episodes

636
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,420
for a full year

637
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,930
after the tumor was removed.

638
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,720
Tubes out.

639
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,860
Staple the colon, before it

640
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,860
leaks any more stool.

641
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,170
Already on it.

642
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,070
Tough on you, huh?

643
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,300
Always wondering

644
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,300
if she'll flip out again?

645
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm gonna pull the colon

646
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,610
back down into the abdomen.

647
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,420
You'll need to guide it

648
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,420
from the top.

649
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,750
Got it.

650
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,690
All right, colon is

651
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,690
repaired and reduced.

652
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,560
Dr. Bekker,

653
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,560
let's irrigate the chest

654
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,600
with 10 liters of saline.

655
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,600
Right away, Dr. Rhodes.

656
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,600
And open a 10-by-20

657
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,600
Gore-Tex patch

658
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,660
to reconstruct the diaphragm.

659
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,070
I will be back to put it in.

660
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,070
Where are you going?

661
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,400
It'll take you at least 30

662
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,400
minutes to clean out

663
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,400
the chest.

664
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,840
I'll be back then.

665
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,850
He's going to check

666
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,850
on his girlfriend.

667
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,050
I think I should get a manual

668
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,050
differential on his CBC.

669
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,980
And maybe

670
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,980
another chest X-ray.

671
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,620
Of course.

672
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,620
I know that.

673
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,060
Right.

674
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,020
And I'm sure you won't forget

675
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,020
about sputum cultures.

676
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,860
Will you stop it?

677
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,860
What?

678
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm sick of you telling me

679
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,560
how to do my job.

680
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,790
I'm just trying to help.

681
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,790
Well, you're not.

682
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,900
I don't need

683
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,900
a big sister here.

684
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,200
I know what I'm doing.

685
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,700
Back off.

686
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,720
That's two cases

687
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,720
in the last week,

688
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,350
and you know of one

689
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,350
at East Mercy?

690
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,100
Have you found

691
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,100
a common vector?

692
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,400
Yeah. Are they

693
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,400
clustered geographically?

694
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,370
Okay, I'll need

695
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,370
charts on all of them,

696
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,810
and let me know

697
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,810
if any more turn up. Thanks.

698
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
Robin?

699
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,780
What happened?

700
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,510
Nothing. I'm fine.

701
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,180
What are you doing out here?

702
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,330
Uh, just my office...

703
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,330
I needed some air.

704
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,330
Robin, what's going on?

705
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,120
Connor...

706
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,120
What?

707
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,290
I heard them again.

708
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,770
Rats?

709
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,770
In my office, and...

710
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,670
Okay. Oh, honey.

711
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,040
Don't worry...

712
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,710
I'm gonna take

713
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,710
care of you, okay?

714
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,920
But you're not

715
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,920
seeing 'em now?

716
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,150
They're gone.

717
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,790
What do you think they want,

718
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,790
the demons?

719
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,260
To get inside me.

720
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,260
Oh.

721
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,320
That's what they do.

722
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,190
They get inside people,

723
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,330
make them do things.

724
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,570
They got inside of my friend.

725
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,500
I had to get away.

726
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,360
Yeah. And that's

727
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,360
when you hurt yourself?

728
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,880
Yes.

729
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,740
The window, I had...

730
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,600
I had to get through it.

731
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,810
How long have they

732
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,810
been after ya?

733
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,690
A long, long time.

734
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,350
Years.

735
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,550
Running all that time,

736
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,720
hiding, I mean,

737
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,720
it sounds exhausting.

738
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,030
You must be very tired.

739
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,130
Tired...

740
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,340
I am so tired.

741
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,340
Yeah.

742
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,000
You know, Vince,

743
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,340
I can provide you with

744
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,340
a place where you can rest.

745
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,940
Would you like that?

746
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,570
Clean bed, shower,

747
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,220
a place where

748
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,220
you can feel safe.

749
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,350
Yes, I would like that.

750
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,350
Okay.

751
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,360
Okay.

752
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,030
Great.

753
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,420
So?

754
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,900
Hallucinations, paranoia,

755
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,530
hyper-religiosity.

756
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,100
This is definitely some kinda

757
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,100
delusional disorder.

758
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,470
Bipolar 1, maybe?

759
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,810
I'll wanna have him admitted,

760
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,810
you know, for a full

761
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,810
psychological evaluation.

762
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,780
Okay, I'll start working on

763
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,780
the transfer order.

764
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,650
Thanks.

765
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,650
Sure.

766
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,960
Uh, you said

767
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,960
you travel a lot,

768
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,720
so I thought of

769
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,720
West Nile Virus.

770
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,490
I ran a mosquito panel.

771
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,330
Good news is

772
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,330
you don't have West Nile.

773
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,300
Here's the thing,

774
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,300
you did test

775
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,300
inconclusive for Zika.

776
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,530
Really? Zika? How?

777
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,390
I'm wondering that myself.

778
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,100
I mean, there hasn't been

779
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,100
a case of Zika reported

780
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,730
north of the Mason-Dixon line.

781
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,540
Have you visited

782
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,540
anywhere else recently?

783
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,770
Maybe somewhere tropical?

784
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
There have been a few cases

785
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
reported in South Florida.

786
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,540
No, I haven't

787
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,540
been to Florida.

788
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,280
Okay, well...

789
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,480
Regardless, the first thing

790
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,480
we have to do is test Shannon.

791
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,320
Shannon? Why?

792
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,290
Well, since Zika can be

793
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,290
sexually transmitted,

794
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,220
Shannon could contract it,

795
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,230
leaving the fetus at risk

796
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,230
of developing microcephaly,

797
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,660
a devastating birth defect

798
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,490
where the baby's brain

799
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,490
doesn't form properly.

800
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,670
But we haven't

801
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,670
had sex in a week.

802
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,960
I've been out of town.

803
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,100
And you couldn't have

804
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,100
gotten Zika in Buffalo,

805
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,610
so you must've picked it up

806
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,610
before that.

807
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,240
It's important we test her.

808
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,380
I don't wanna scare her

809
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,380
needlessly.

810
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,810
Besides,

811
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,810
I'm feeling much better.

812
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,180
Probably just had

813
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,180
a touch of the flu.

814
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,180
Mr. Kim...

815
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,180
I really need to

816
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,180
get back to Shannon.

817
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,580
I'm sorry, am I...

818
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,580
Am I missing something here?

819
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,680
Okay. I wasn't in Buffalo.

820
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,290
I was in Aruba

821
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,920
with a lady friend.

822
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,150
Look, I'm not concerned

823
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,150
with your personal life.

824
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,060
I only care about my patient,

825
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,060
and in this situation,

826
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,730
we have to consider your wife.

827
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,070
No. She does not

828
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,070
find out about this.

829
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm not risking my marriage

830
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,400
over an inconclusive test.

831
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,200
I don't think you understand.

832
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,200
Your baby's at risk.

833
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,510
Shannon needs to know.

834
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,510
Dr. Halstead...

835
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,640
They teach you about

836
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,640
doctor-patient confidentiality

837
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,080
in med school?

838
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,480
'Cause they definitely

839
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,480
covered it in law school.

840
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm your patient, too, now,

841
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,220
and I'm telling you

842
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,220
to keep your mouth shut.

843
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,330
Why do I have to do an MRI?

844
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,330
We all know what is going on.

845
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,230
The MRI will allow us

846
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,230
to see the extent

847
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,640
of any lingering

848
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,640
inflammation.

849
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,680
This episode could end up

850
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,680
being a blessing.

851
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,270
It'll help us

852
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,270
adjust your meds.

853
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,170
And there's nothing

854
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,170
to worry about.

855
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,650
This is all part of

856
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,650
your recuperation process.

857
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,150
Which is endless.

858
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,780
I'll let the tech know

859
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,780
we're ready.

860
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,110
Thank you.

861
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,450
At least you don't have to

862
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,450
restrain me this time.

863
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,680
Maybe later tonight.

864
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,460
Hey, look, I have to

865
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,460
get back to the OR,

866
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,620
but I promise you,

867
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,720
I will not be very long.

868
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,340
We're starting another round

869
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,340
of antibiotics,

870
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,350
hoping he'll turn

871
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,350
a corner soon.

872
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,180
I hate seeing him like this.

873
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,850
Stubborn old fool.

874
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,750
But he's still

875
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,750
my baby brother.

876
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,020
He's lucky to have you.

877
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,020
I love him,

878
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,530
and I don't know

879
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,530
what I'd do without him.

880
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,560
But he hocks me a chainik.

881
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,800
This mishegas with Christmas.

882
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,670
Forgive me, but enough

883
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,670
with all the lights,

884
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,210
jingle bells, eggnog.

885
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,970
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

886
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,410
Harold's late wife,

887
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,410
Mary, lovely woman

888
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,950
but she was a gentile.

889
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,480
Catholic.

890
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,680
They celebrated Christmas.

891
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,120
He still does.

892
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,690
Maybe it's his way

893
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,690
of remembering her.

894
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,180
I suppose.

895
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,550
Seems kinda sweet.

896
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,660
Yeah...

897
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,760
I guess it is.

898
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,540
You were gone a while.

899
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,540
Everything okay?

900
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,470
Where are we?

901
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,450
Just coming around

902
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,450
the posterior medial.

903
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,180
You're just in time

904
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,180
for the hard part.

905
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,050
Good.

906
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,090
Every time the lung inflates,

907
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,090
the patch moves.

908
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,260
Do you have an angle on it?

909
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,620
No.

910
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,530
All right, then we need

911
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,530
to deflate his lung.

912
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,090
No. No way.

913
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,090
Sats are too low.

914
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,430
What if I use

915
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,430
a long Allis clamp

916
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,910
to get behind the lung

917
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,910
and hold the patch?

918
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,770
No, it's fine.

919
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,770
I've got it.

920
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,070
I've got room.

921
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,070
I can do it.

922
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,310
All right, go.

923
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,610
Clamp.

924
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,680
Patch is in place.

925
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,680
Stitch away.

926
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,650
No, I still can't reach

927
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,650
the crus of the diaphragm.

928
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,920
Can you give me

929
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,920
some more torque?

930
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,290
No, but I can finish

931
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,290
the stitches from here,

932
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,130
if you hold

933
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,130
the patch in place.

934
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,290
Okay, your call.

935
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,000
All right. Fine.

936
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,740
I can't get in

937
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,740
the last few stitches.

938
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,480
All right, Allis coming off.

939
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,250
All right, finish the run.

940
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,090
Look at you two, getting it

941
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,090
done like Jordan and Pippen.

942
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,310
Your scan was clean.

943
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,470
No residual edema or permanent

944
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,470
damage to your brain tissue.

945
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,010
Great, so I'm just

946
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,010
losing my mind?

947
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,020
Robin, this is good news.

948
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,020
It is?

949
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,010
If it would make you

950
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,010
feel better,

951
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,820
there are more tests

952
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,820
we can run,

953
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,050
an EEG, an autoimmune

954
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,050
antibody assay,

955
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,290
a lumbar puncture...

956
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,290
Ooh, a spinal tap.

957
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,490
Wow, that'll cheer me up.

958
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,790
Robin, we are going

959
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,790
to figure this out.

960
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,920
No, it's all pretty clear.

961
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,920
It's all in my head,

962
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,330
and there's nothing

963
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,330
that you or Connor

964
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,060
or anyone else can do.

965
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,410
Hey.

966
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,670
How's Shannon's husband?

967
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,500
Bruce Kim?

968
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,070
Turns out he wasn't

969
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,070
in Buffalo.

970
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,090
He was in Aruba

971
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,090
with another woman.

972
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,050
Tested inconclusive for Zika.

973
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,050
What?

974
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,950
Well, we have to test Shannon.

975
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,950
We can't,

976
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,320
not without violating

977
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,320
his confidentiality.

978
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,990
He refuses to tell her.

979
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,990
That's ridiculous.

980
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,330
I mean, if he was

981
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,330
HIV positive, we could

982
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,330
break confidentiality.

983
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,990
Doesn't Zika get

984
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,990
the same exemption?

985
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,400
No. Unfortunately,

986
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,400
Zika's so new,

987
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,960
there's no legal precedent.

988
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,000
But what if they have sex?

989
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,540
What if he infects the fetus?

990
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,870
I mean, you've seen babies

991
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,870
with microcephaly.

992
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,570
Natalie,

993
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,570
I have spent the last hour

994
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,480
trying to find

995
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,480
a way around HIPAA.

996
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,850
I've got nothing.

997
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,850
He'll come after the hospital,

998
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,990
and my license, incidentally.

999
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,850
So you're just giving up?

1000
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,850
There's nothing we can do.

1001
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,320
We can't justify

1002
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,320
breaking the law

1003
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,880
over an inconclusive

1004
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,880
test result.

1005
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,430
I know what you're thinking.

1006
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,430
Don't do anything.

1007
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,500
Desmond, talk to me.

1008
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,500
Father Luke Novak,

1009
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,540
parish priest

1010
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,540
over at St. Emmelia.

1011
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,040
Multiple stab wounds.

1012
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
You're going to Trauma 1.

1013
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
Ben, you're in.

1014
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,630
GCS, 3.

1015
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,630
Intubated in the field.

1016
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,800
Heart rate, 137.

1017
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,800
BP, 70 over palp.

1018
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,970
Well, how did this happen?

1019
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,070
Somebody broke

1020
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,070
into the church.

1021
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,410
The priest must've

1022
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,410
confronted him.

1023
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,010
All right,

1024
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,010
let's transfer on my count.

1025
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,780
One, two, three.

1026
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,720
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1027
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,250
Call for two units.

1028
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,690
Stephanie,

1029
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,690
take over compressions.

1030
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,660
Is that stained glass?

1031
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,700
Did you get the guy

1032
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,700
who did it?

1033
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,700
Not yet.

1034
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,300
I'm gonna get someone

1035
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,300
to look at it, I promise you.

1036
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,310
$16,000?

1037
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,310
Sir...

1038
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,470
What in God's name?

1039
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,010
Sir, please,

1040
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,010
lower your voice.

1041
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,770
Excuse me, uh,

1042
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,770
what seems to be the problem?

1043
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,580
This.

1044
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,980
Tell me how

1045
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,980
I'm going to explain

1046
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,680
a $16,000 bill to my sister,

1047
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,740
who's already mourning

1048
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,740
the death of her husband?

1049
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,080
He died in the waiting room.

1050
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,820
$16,000...

1051
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,820
Yeah.

1052
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,790
You're as bad as

1053
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,790
the pharmaceutical companies,

1054
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,490
profiting from our losses.

1055
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,490
Mr. Williams, I promise you,

1056
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,760
I will personally

1057
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,760
look into this.

1058
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,700
You're not gonna do

1059
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,700
a damn thing.

1060
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,800
$16,000.

1061
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,770
I'd be mad, too.

1062
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,070
So, we've got a mechanic,

1063
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,070
a dry cleaner,

1064
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,110
a retiree,

1065
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,110
and now three other patients,

1066
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,610
but they all live in

1067
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,610
different parts of the city.

1068
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,680
Well, they have to be

1069
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,680
connected somehow.

1070
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,680
Well, last Lepto outbreak

1071
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,680
in Cook County

1072
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,010
was five years ago,

1073
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,310
a contaminated water

1074
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,310
facility in Schaumburg.

1075
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,540
And 10 years before that,

1076
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,990
migrant workers picked it up

1077
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,990
on a farm downstate,

1078
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,190
so I've been thinking about

1079
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,190
more than just water.

1080
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,850
Maybe contaminated soil,

1081
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,490
but this time of year,

1082
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,490
there's not a lot

1083
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,490
of gardening.

1084
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,390
Hmm. Well, it is Christmas.

1085
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,390
What about Christmas trees,

1086
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,730
with everyone

1087
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,730
bringing them home?

1088
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,860
Yeah, I thought

1089
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,860
about that as well,

1090
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,240
but Harold

1091
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,240
and Lydia Rosenblatt?

1092
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,600
I mean, they're Jewish, right?

1093
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,660
Would they get

1094
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,660
a Christmas tree?

1095
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,180
Harold may be Jewish,

1096
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
but I know for a fact

1097
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
he celebrates Christmas.

1098
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,810
Huh...

1099
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,780
Our job is to treat patients,

1100
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,780
not to bankrupt them.

1101
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,580
The man died

1102
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,580
in the waiting room.

1103
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,140
After which

1104
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,140
you had him transferred

1105
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,780
to a trauma room

1106
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,780
and thoroughly examined.

1107
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,720
Okay, "Position fee,

1108
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,720
room charge, supplies,

1109
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,890
"maintenance to clean

1110
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,890
and sterilize the room."

1111
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,360
These charges are

1112
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,360
all legitimate.

1113
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,990
His wife has suffered enough.

1114
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,760
Can't we just

1115
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,760
look the other way

1116
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,230
on some of these things?

1117
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,270
You know as well as I do,

1118
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,270
the ED is

1119
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,270
hemorrhaging money,

1120
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,740
and you wanna

1121
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,740
hand out freebies?

1122
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,330
I'm just asking

1123
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,330
to adjust the bill.

1124
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,040
Ms. Goodwin...

1125
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,780
What's the big deal?

1126
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,780
His insurance will cover this.

1127
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,310
And what if

1128
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,310
he doesn't have insurance?

1129
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,750
Then they'll cry poverty

1130
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,550
and negotiate a lower bill.

1131
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,780
That's how it's done.

1132
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,320
At least we'll look

1133
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,320
responsible.

1134
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,580
Responsible?

1135
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,020
Fiscally responsible.

1136
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,960
Ms. Goodwin...

1137
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,550
I'm looking out for you.

1138
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,230
Get away from me!

1139
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,230
No one is safe!

1140
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,330
Kramer, you need

1141
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,330
to come with us.

1142
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,030
Listen to me,

1143
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,030
the demons are here!

1144
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,470
Detective, what are

1145
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,470
you doing to my patient?

1146
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,600
Dr. Charles,

1147
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,600
you don't understand.

1148
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,370
Why didn't you page me?

1149
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,370
You said I'd be safe.

1150
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,440
Dr. Charles,

1151
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,440
let us do our job.

1152
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,910
No, no, you give me a moment

1153
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,910
and let me do mine.

1154
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,510
Vince, nobody's gonna

1155
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,510
hurt you.

1156
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,610
I'm not gonna let 'em

1157
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,610
hurt you, all right?

1158
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,510
You can't stop them!

1159
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,220
Call a code silver!

1160
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,720
Get away from me!

1161
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,720
Vince, look at me,

1162
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,150
look at me.

1163
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,150
You lied to me.

1164
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,950
No, I didn't lie to you,

1165
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,950
I promise.

1166
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,480
There's been

1167
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,480
a big misunderstanding.

1168
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,690
Vince, look at me, look at me.

1169
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,690
Right here. Nobody else.

1170
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,890
Ignore everybody else.

1171
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,890
Look at me.

1172
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,020
What I need you to do,

1173
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,230
I need you to lower

1174
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,230
the paddles, okay,

1175
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,770
so we can talk this out.

1176
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,400
I promise you,

1177
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,400
everything is gonna be okay.

1178
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,460
All right?

1179
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,740
So just slowly...

1180
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,740
There you go.

1181
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,910
There you go.

1182
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,910
Nice and easy.

1183
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,180
Liar!

1184
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,180
No!

1185
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,350
No, don't!

1186
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,350
Dr. Charles!

1187
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,960
Dr. Charles, can you hear me?

1188
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,640
Are you okay?

1189
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

1190
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,540
Daniel, stop.

1191
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,540
You were shocked.

1192
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,200
Let me check your

1193
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,200
heart rhythm, run an EKG.

1194
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,340
I'm fine.

1195
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,340
Don't be stubborn.

1196
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,070
Dr. Charles,

1197
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,070
you could've been killed.

1198
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,680
Where are you taking him?

1199
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,680
What are the charges?

1200
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,410
Stop him. Can't you stop him?

1201
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,410
No.

1202
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,650
And the what the hell were you

1203
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,650
thinking, risking your life?

1204
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,020
It's a police matter.

1205
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,750
How did it become

1206
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,750
a police matter?

1207
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,160
He's my patient.

1208
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,160
Let me explain...

1209
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,950
Look, what, that it's

1210
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,950
a good idea to lock a man up

1211
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,150
who's in serious need

1212
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,150
of treatment?

1213
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,760
Put him behind bars, blow any

1214
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,760
chance we have of helping him?

1215
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,920
Dr. Charles, please.

1216
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,920
What did he do?

1217
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,160
He broke a window.

1218
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,160
He stabbed a priest.

1219
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,160
What?

1220
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,170
Father Novak died

1221
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,170
in our trauma room.

1222
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,080
He was covered in the same

1223
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,080
stained glass as Vince.

1224
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,750
You... You know why he did it?

1225
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,150
Don't you?

1226
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,150
It was because

1227
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,150
of Jack Kellogg.

1228
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,420
He couldn't save Jack Kellogg,

1229
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,830
so he tried to

1230
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,830
save this man.

1231
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,860
I can't help but feel...

1232
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,630
It's not your fault,

1233
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,630
Dr. Reese.

1234
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,570
The antibiotics are working,

1235
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,570
Mr. Rosenblatt.

1236
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,200
Your white blood cell

1237
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,200
count has improved.

1238
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,310
Now, we still have

1239
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,310
a ways to go,

1240
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,680
but things are looking good.

1241
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,320
All because of

1242
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,320
a Christmas tree.

1243
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,750
Actually, it was

1244
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,750
the Christmas tree lot.

1245
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,050
The trees were cultivated

1246
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,050
in infected soil.

1247
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,450
Still, if you hadn't

1248
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,450
brought that thing home...

1249
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,830
Sylvia...

1250
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,590
Could we take a night off?

1251
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,860
Of course.

1252
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,860
You need your rest.

1253
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,930
Tomorrow, I'm gonna fix you

1254
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,900
a fresh pot of split pea.

1255
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,330
And if you're good,

1256
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,330
I'll throw in a ham bone.

1257
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,600
I'll be back

1258
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,600
to check in on you later.

1259
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,180
Okay, so Robin wants us

1260
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,180
to update his chart

1261
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,840
so she can send it

1262
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,840
to the health lab.

1263
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,610
You can do it.

1264
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,610
You don't need my help.

1265
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,180
Oh, really?

1266
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,610
That's a change.

1267
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,790
Okay, sometimes,

1268
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,790
you need my help...

1269
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,980
Oh, okay.

1270
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,980
But...

1271
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,490
You know what?

1272
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,580
I need you, too.

1273
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,330
Where's this coming from?

1274
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,730
I've just been thinking.

1275
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,270
Okay.

1276
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,670
So, what do you say,

1277
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,570
when we get to be their age,

1278
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,570
we move in together.

1279
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,540
Not on your life.

1280
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,950
Okay. Thank you.

1281
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,950
Let's go.

1282
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,150
Oh, these flowers

1283
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,150
are so beautiful.

1284
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,990
Okay, let's go.

1285
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,500
Thank you for everything,

1286
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,500
Dr. Manning.

1287
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,590
Bruce brought me these.

1288
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,590
Aren't they pretty?

1289
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,400
Mmm. Um, uh...

1290
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,640
Um, before you go,

1291
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,640
there's just one more thing.

1292
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,430
What?

1293
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,100
Since you're approaching

1294
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,100
your delivery date,

1295
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,610
I think it's really important

1296
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,670
that you be cautious

1297
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,670
with physical activity.

1298
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,680
Um, try not to lift

1299
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,680
anything heavy,

1300
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,220
limit your stress, and, um...

1301
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,810
Avoid sexual contact.

1302
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,480
Why? None of the books say

1303
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,480
anything about avoiding sex.

1304
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,620
We're done here.

1305
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,160
Uh, I'm sorry, I...

1306
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,160
I think...

1307
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,630
I think there's something

1308
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,630
you should know.

1309
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,690
Um, you...

1310
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,690
Mr. Kim...

1311
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,560
This is Dr. Ellen Hart,

1312
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,560
Epidemic Intelligence

1313
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,760
Service Officer for the CDC.

1314
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,530
May I speak to you

1315
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,530
in private, Mr. Kim?

1316
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,300
No, you can't. My wife

1317
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,300
and I are on our way out.

1318
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,170
I'm sorry,

1319
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,170
but federal law requires

1320
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,870
that I speak to you

1321
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,870
about your test.

1322
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,510
What...

1323
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,510
What's going on?

1324
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,670
Uh, Dr. Hart

1325
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,670
will fill you in.

1326
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,240
Why don't we step

1327
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,240
in here please?

1328
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,760
What did you do?

1329
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,760
I made some calls.

1330
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,760
Since Zika's

1331
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,760
a public health emergency,

1332
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,640
the CDC has to investigate

1333
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,640
all inconclusive test results.

1334
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,810
I'm impressed.

1335
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,910
Natalie, back there,

1336
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,910
were you gonna...

1337
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,300
Let's just say

1338
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,300
it is a good thing

1339
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,900
you showed up when you did.

1340
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,280
So, are you keeping

1341
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,280
anything from me?

1342
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,880
Well, I haven't

1343
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,880
been to Aruba,

1344
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,820
if that's what

1345
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,820
you're wondering.

1346
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,250
Actually, there is one thing,

1347
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,750
and this is just between us.

1348
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,890
Goodwin.

1349
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,760
I'm her secret Santa,

1350
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,760
all right,

1351
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,430
and I have no idea

1352
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,430
what to get her.

1353
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,740
I'm really glad

1354
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,740
you shared that with me.

1355
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,300
You know, she once told me

1356
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,370
that the first thing she does

1357
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,370
when she gets home

1358
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,910
is take off her shoes.

1359
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,510
So...

1360
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,510
House slippers.

1361
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,740
I'll help you pick 'em out.

1362
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,430
Sharon, I mean,

1363
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,430
what the hell?

1364
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,020
You blackmailed the board?

1365
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,290
All I did was explain that

1366
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,290
it'd be very bad publicity

1367
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,490
if it got out that

1368
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,490
we gave Santa's widow

1369
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,590
a bill for $16,000

1370
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,600
one week before Christmas.

1371
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,900
If it got out.

1372
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,770
The board took that

1373
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,770
as a threat.

1374
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,370
What are they gonna do?

1375
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,370
Well, they got no choice

1376
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,410
but to forgive the charges.

1377
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,410
Good.

1378
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,040
No, it's not good,

1379
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,510
They're not happy,

1380
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,510
and believe me,

1381
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,850
they would have no qualms

1382
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,850
about replacing you

1383
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,220
with someone who would

1384
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,220
gladly bill Santa,

1385
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,310
the Easter Bunny,

1386
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,310
and the Tooth Fairy.

1387
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,280
You need to watch your step.

1388
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,960
I hear you, Peter.

1389
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,530
Now, we were able to

1390
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,530
remove all the stool contents

1391
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,040
from his chest cavity

1392
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,040
and repair his diaphragm.

1393
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,100
It might be a little while

1394
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,100
before he's back on a ladder,

1395
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,540
but he should make

1396
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,540
a full recovery.

1397
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,240
Thank you for saving my son.

1398
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,150
Uh, thank you both.

1399
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,150
Of course.

1400
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,380
We made a pretty

1401
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,380
good team today.

1402
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,610
We did.

1403
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,820
Thank you, Doctor.

1404
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,820
And sign this.

1405
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,030
What do you say we go

1406
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,030
have a drink and celebrate?

1407
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,360
You wanna get a drink

1408
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,360
with me? Seriously?

1409
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,260
You know,

1410
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,260
a little Don Corleone,

1411
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,990
"Keep your friends close,

1412
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,990
but your enemies closer."

1413
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,000
Goodnight, Dr. Bekker.

1414
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,270
Yeah, goodnight, Dr. Rhodes.

1415
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,810
Dr. Charles?

1416
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,410
Are you okay?

1417
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,450
Yes. I'm okay.

1418
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,920
Uh, I mean, with everything

1419
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,920
that's happened.

1420
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,360
I'm worried about you.

1421
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,620
You know, that's funny,

1422
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,620
because...

1423
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,360
I've actually been

1424
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,360
worried about you.

1425
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,500
What? Why?

1426
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,430
You know, this morning, when

1427
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,430
they brought Mr. Kramer in,

1428
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,260
I thought you seemed...

1429
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,060
Anxious about treating him.

1430
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,060
No. No, I told you,

1431
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,060
I had patients to see.

1432
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,900
Okay.

1433
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,570
I, um...

1434
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,770
I guess I just hope that...

1435
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,050
That that's really the case.

1436
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,690
Um, goodnight,

1437
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,690
Dr. Charles.

1438
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,980
Night.

1439
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,530
Come in.

1440
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,290
Hey.

1441
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,000
So, uh...

1442
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,900
Yeah, things got a little

1443
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,040
out of hand today,

1444
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,040
and, um...

1445
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,210
You know, if the offer's still

1446
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,210
good, I was thinking that...

1447
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,010
Maybe I could use

1448
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,010
a few days off.

1449
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,650
The offer's still good.

1450
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,610
Okay. Thank you.

1451
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,650
You're welcome.

1452
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,960
Don't stay away too long.

1453
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,220
We need you here.

1454
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,170
Tough day?

1455
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,230
We billed $16,000

1456
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,500
to a family of a man

1457
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,500
who died in the waiting room.

1458
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,110
I managed to quash it, but...

1459
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,210
The system's broken, Daniel.

1460
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,350
Well, don't know

1461
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,350
anybody better

1462
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,350
with a glue gun than you.

1463
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,320
Well, enjoy your holidays.

1464
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,150
You, too.

1465
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
Why don't we take it easy

1466
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
tonight, all right?

1467
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,560
We'll get the fire going...

1468
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,400
Let me just get my stuff.

1469
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,400
All right.

1470
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,970
Hey, sorry for the intrusion.

1471
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,380
I had to get up

1472
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,380
through your office.

1473
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,980
Heating unit is on the fritz.

1474
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,680
The heater?

1475
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,680
Defective check valve.

1476
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,620
Noise must've been

1477
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,620
driving you crazy.

1478
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,450
It's all fixed now.

1479
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,650
Thank you.

1480
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,150
It's good news.

1481
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,430
Let's get out of here.

1482
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,430
Yeah.

1483
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,370
So, what did you

1484
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,370
wanna show me?

1485
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,060
In here.

1486
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,750
Kiss me.

1487
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,310
Shamrocks?

1488
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,180
Uh, wasn't any mistletoe,

1489
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,990
but I found a box of

1490
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,990
St. Patty's decorations.

1491
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,580
It'll do.

1492
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,770
Merry Christmas.
