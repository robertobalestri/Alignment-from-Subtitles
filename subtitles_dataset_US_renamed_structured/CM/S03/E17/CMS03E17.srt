1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,300
She still isn't answering.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,270
She's probably not allowed

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,270
to have her phone

4
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,270
at the poker table.

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,170
She shouldn't be

6
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,170
at the poker table

7
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,170
at 7:00 a.m.

8
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,400
She should be back

9
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,400
with my car,

10
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,400
so I can get to work.

11
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,200
Babe, it's your day off.

12
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,400
From the hospital.

13
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,340
Emily knows I check

14
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,340
on the kids

15
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,340
at the homeless encampment.

16
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,500
They count on me.

17
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,740
They'll understand

18
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,740
if you're a few minutes late.

19
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,300
If Emily's gonna live here,

20
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,300
she needs to get

21
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,300
her act together,

22
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,470
make a plan.

23
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,810
This isn't some vacation.

24
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,310
Come on,

25
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,310
I'll give you a ride.

26
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,670
I've come to recognize

27
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,670
your expressions pretty well.

28
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,360
This one's my least favorite.

29
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,890
I wish I had better news.

30
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,540
But look...

31
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,340
Even though

32
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,340
your cardiac output

33
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,340
is decreasing,

34
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,240
you are still highest status

35
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,240
on the transplant list.

36
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,470
You're first in line.

37
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,420
I appreciate your optimism,

38
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,210
Dr. Rhodes,

39
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,550
as always.

40
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,110
Hang in there, Bob.

41
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,110
Uh-huh.

42
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,680
You know, for my part,

43
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,420
I'm just not seeing

44
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,420
any organic causes.

45
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,960
Excuse me, I...

46
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,960
Sorry to interrupt.

47
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,300
Um... Sarah,

48
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,300
I've just been up

49
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,300
to see your father.

50
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,300
His stroke volume,

51
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,300
systolic arterial pressure,

52
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,830
and pulse pressure have all

53
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,830
decreased since yesterday.

54
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,640
I just can't keep

55
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,640
the fluid off of his lungs.

56
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,730
I see.

57
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,780
I promise you,

58
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,780
we're doing everything we can

59
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,840
to find him

60
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,840
a new heart, but...

61
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,410
If you wanna say good-bye,

62
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,920
I would consider

63
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,920
doing it today.

64
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,980
I'm very sorry.

65
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,350
Okay.

66
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,140
How long have

67
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,140
you had a fever?

68
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,400
A few days now.

69
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,380
And are you always

70
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,380
this short of breath?

71
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,110
Lately, yeah.

72
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,240
Athena, stop!

73
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,750
Hey, Dr. Choi.

74
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,380
Hey, Deb. Can I take

75
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,380
a look at your legs?

76
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,550
Yeah, sure.

77
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,880
How long have you been

78
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,880
getting these spots?

79
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,990
Why? Are they bad?

80
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,990
I'm not sure,

81
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,190
but I'd like to prick your

82
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,190
finger to check your blood.

83
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,320
Okay, yeah.

84
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,500
All right.

85
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,960
Ethan, I know, I'm sorry,

86
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,960
I promised I'd be home,

87
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,270
but I had half the table

88
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,270
on tilt,

89
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,870
and I just

90
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,870
lost track of time.

91
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,780
Whatever. Take the car.

92
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,780
I'll get a cab.

93
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm not gonna just

94
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,140
leave you here.

95
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,340
What can I do to help?

96
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,110
I don't want your help.

97
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,040
Ethan, you don't

98
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,040
have to be like that.

99
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,250
He doesn't have

100
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,250
to be like that.

101
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,050
Hi. Emily.

102
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,720
Josh.

103
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,720
Nice to meet you.

104
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,660
Uh, cute dog.

105
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,660
Thank you.

106
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,130
What kind of tent do you use?

107
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,130
Uh, it's an old Coleman.

108
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,560
Has a rain fly.

109
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,560
Nice.

110
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,160
Hold on.

111
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,660
Josh...

112
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm seeing some cells

113
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,660
in your blood

114
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,470
called lymphoblasts.

115
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,510
That plus your other symptoms

116
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,510
make me concerned enough

117
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,570
that I'd like to bring you

118
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,570
into the hospital.

119
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,050
Why? What do you think it is?

120
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,480
It could be

121
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,480
all sorts of things...

122
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,580
But what I'm worried

123
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,580
about is leukemia.

124
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,090
Isn't that a kind of cancer?

125
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,090
It is.

126
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,710
Josh, this is important.

127
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,320
Look, I mean,

128
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,320
Athena needs me out here.

129
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,120
And if I go back with you,

130
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,120
you're gonna have to

131
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,120
call my parents,

132
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,750
the people that adopted me,

133
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,300
and I don't think I want that.

134
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,030
Did they mistreat you?

135
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,030
No, no, no, they're okay.

136
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,570
It's just, uh...

137
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,570
Things didn't really work out

138
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,570
with them, you know?

139
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,540
You don't have to call

140
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,540
his parents, right?

141
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,040
Em...

142
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,840
Is that true?

143
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,610
You're only 16.

144
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,980
Legally, they need

145
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,980
to be notified.

146
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,540
I mean, if his life

147
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,540
is on the line,

148
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,520
you could make an exception.

149
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,490
I mean, if you could do that,

150
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,490
I'm sure I could get Deb

151
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,750
to watch Athena, if it's just

152
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,750
for the afternoon.

153
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,460
We could run

154
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,460
some tests first,

155
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,390
make sure we know

156
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,390
what's going on.

157
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,160
Hey, Deb,

158
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,700
could I ask you a favor?

159
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,390
You shouldn't have done that.

160
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,270
Eventually I'm gonna

161
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,270
have to call his parents.

162
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,740
What are you

163
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,740
busting on me for?

164
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,400
Got him to come in,

165
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,400
didn't I?

166
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,840
Wow.

167
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,540
One of our patients

168
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,540
is well-loved.

169
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,020
Actually, they came for me.

170
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,490
Really?

171
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,490
Mmm.

172
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
The enchanting Dr. Bekker.

173
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,250
What?

174
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,660
Uh, seems they're

175
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,660
from your father.

176
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,370
My father?

177
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,370
Yeah.

178
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,070
Uh, you've been seeing him?

179
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,610
Is, uh... Is that a problem?

180
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,870
No, no, it's not a problem.

181
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,780
Just... Uh, he's just...

182
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,080
You know what, forget it.

183
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,750
Enjoy the flowers.

184
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,060
Are you two still at it?

185
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,730
At what?

186
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,530
I've barely seen

187
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,530
you speak two words

188
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,160
to each other in a week.

189
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,840
Whatever this is,

190
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,840
you need to work it out.

191
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,140
Everything's fine.

192
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,140
Oh, everything's fine?

193
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,580
Mmm-hmm.

194
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,580
Good.

195
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,380
Dr. Manning, Dr. Halstead,

196
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,140
you're up, Treatment Four.

197
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,980
Hey.

198
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,220
Kevin Parks.

199
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,220
He's 10 years old.

200
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,050
He woke up with

201
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,050
8 out of 10

202
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,050
abdominal pain

203
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,820
and a fever of 103.

204
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,160
We gave him Tylenol

205
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,160
and a cool bath,

206
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,130
but nothing's worked.

207
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,130
Okay.

208
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,430
All right, Kevin,

209
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,430
let's get you up on the bed.

210
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,970
Ow, ow. That hurts.

211
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,400
That hurts? All right.

212
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,400
All right, you got it.

213
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,940
We're gonna figure out why.

214
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,940
There you go.

215
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,940
Hi, Kevin, I'm Dr. Manning.

216
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,940
This is Dr. Halstead.

217
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,340
Can you show us

218
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,340
where it hurts?

219
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,140
Right here?

220
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,140
Right there? Okay.

221
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,680
Has anything like this

222
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,680
ever happened before?

223
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,740
No, never.

224
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,750
Abdomen is tender

225
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,750
but not rigid,

226
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,760
with no rebound.

227
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,790
Bowel sounds are decreased.

228
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,790
I don't like it.

229
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,420
It could still be

230
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,420
his appendix,

231
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,420
Crohn's disease,

232
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,930
ulcerative colitis.

233
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,490
Temp's up to 104.

234
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,290
Give Ibuprofen

235
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,290
to start cooling measures.

236
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,300
Is there any other medical

237
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,300
history we should be aware of?

238
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,740
Yes, he's been

239
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,740
diagnosed with PANDAS.

240
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,170
PANDAS?

241
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,170
Uh, Pediatric Autoimmune

242
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,170
Neuropsychiatric Disorder

243
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Associated with

244
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Streptococcal Infection.

245
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,080
Kevin started getting

246
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,080
tics and OCD

247
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
after a strep infection

248
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
two years ago.

249
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,650
Nobody else could figure out

250
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,650
what it was,

251
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,840
until finally Dr. Kravitz

252
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,840
diagnosed him.

253
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
Okay, we'll be sure

254
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
to give him a call.

255
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,050
I've heard of Dr. Kravitz.

256
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,850
He sees a lot of kids

257
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,850
with PANDAS, right?

258
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,890
He's one of the nation's

259
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,890
top experts.

260
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,650
I'm guessing

261
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,650
Dr. Kravitz put Kevin

262
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,290
on long-term

263
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,290
prophylactic antibiotics

264
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,730
to fight the residual strep?

265
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,090
Yes, he did.

266
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,830
CBC, chem panel,

267
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,830
blood cultures,

268
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,200
abdominal CT, and hang

269
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,200
a gram of vanco, stat.

270
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,140
We're gonna start him

271
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,140
on some medication

272
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,370
while we run some tests

273
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,100
to try to figure out

274
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,100
what's going on, okay?

275
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,770
We'll be back

276
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,770
to check on him shortly.

277
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,170
Thank you.

278
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,880
Hey, you've heard

279
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,880
of this Dr. Kravitz.

280
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,680
He labels every kid's

281
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,680
neurological condition

282
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,680
as PANDAS.

283
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,750
It's not even an officially

284
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,750
recognized diagnosis.

285
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,120
Either way, right now,

286
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,390
that child is in real pain

287
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,390
with a real fever.

288
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,550
Right, because he's been on

289
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,550
three different antibiotics

290
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,860
for over 12 months,

291
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,090
which we both know

292
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,090
has wiped out

293
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,790
all the healthy flora

294
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,790
in his gut,

295
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,160
causing a massive

296
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,160
superinfection.

297
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,700
I mean, all because

298
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,700
his parents

299
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,700
shopped around for a doctor

300
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,740
willing to blame Kevin's

301
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,740
neurologic tics on strep,

302
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,100
instead of admitting

303
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,800
they most likely passed it on

304
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,800
to him genetically.

305
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,470
Okay, but dismissing them

306
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,470
isn't gonna help.

307
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,910
They are upset and worried.

308
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,110
And what they're doing

309
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,110
to try and fix him

310
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,480
might wind up killing him.

311
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,480
Dr. Sexton,

312
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,480
Treatment Six is open.

313
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,480
You're up.

314
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,180
We got Frank Larson, 74.

315
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,980
He was found unconscious

316
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,980
in an abandoned warehouse.

317
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,180
Bradycardic at 45,

318
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,180
BP's 90 over 60,

319
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,090
respiration's 10,

320
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,090
and satting at 91%.

321
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,790
Mr. Larson,

322
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,790
do you know where you are?

323
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,590
Let's move him

324
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,590
on one, two, three.

325
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,180
Dad? Dad, what happened?

326
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
Is he... Is he all right?

327
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,110
That's what we're trying

328
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,110
to figure out.

329
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,120
Frank, can you hear me?

330
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,120
Can you hear me, Frank?

331
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,280
He goes around

332
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,280
feeding the stray cats,

333
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,820
but he has dementia

334
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,820
and he gets lost.

335
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,290
Does he have any other

336
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,290
medical conditions?

337
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,720
No.

338
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,720
You're the one examining him.

339
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,050
What do you think it could be?

340
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,180
It's hard to say right now.

341
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,730
We need to let the doctor

342
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,730
run some tests.

343
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,090
It looks like

344
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,090
he doesn't have any injuries,

345
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,130
but, yes, I would like

346
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,130
to run some more tests

347
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,860
to figure out

348
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,860
what's going on.

349
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,860
Okay.

350
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay?

351
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay.

352
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,530
Dad, I'll be

353
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,530
right here, okay?

354
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,130
I'm right here.

355
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,130
I'm not going anywhere.

356
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,110
Sorry. Big sister moment.

357
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,110
Yep.

358
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,080
Anyway, let's get an EKG,

359
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,240
CBC, chem panels, troponins,

360
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,710
tox screens, and a head CT.

361
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,640
We'll figure this out.

362
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,120
Dr. Reese,

363
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,120
I was just, um...

364
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,060
I was just

365
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,060
heading up to...

366
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,550
To check on your dad.

367
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,420
Okay.

368
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,760
Listen, I, um...

369
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,030
I know you've had a very

370
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,030
complicated relationship,

371
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,730
and this is really

372
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,730
none of my business,

373
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,770
but... I think that

374
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,770
if he should die

375
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,280
before you have a chance

376
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,280
to speak to him,

377
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,010
that could very

378
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,010
possibly be something

379
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,880
you would come to regret.

380
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,050
My father

381
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,050
has clearly stated

382
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,920
that he doesn't want me

383
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,920
to be a part of his life,

384
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,760
so, uh, whatever regrets

385
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,760
I may have...

386
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,790
I just don't think

387
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,790
any of them will be resolved

388
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,090
by me talking to him.

389
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay.

390
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,500
You, uh...

391
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,500
You accepting visitors?

392
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,410
It depends.

393
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,370
Is it professional

394
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,340
or is it personal?

395
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,280
Uh... Personal?

396
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,140
Then by all means.

397
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,490
I, um...

398
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
I heard about

399
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
your situation. Mmm.

400
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,120
Really so sorry

401
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,120
that it's come to this.

402
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,290
Yeah, what can I say?

403
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,260
It's been kind of

404
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,260
a chess game

405
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,260
between the two of us,

406
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,860
hasn't it?

407
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
I regret that you see it

408
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
that way.

409
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,970
Uh... I would hope

410
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,970
that you would...

411
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,870
Ha.

412
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,240
It's ironic.

413
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,270
You made me cut Sarah

414
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,270
out of my life

415
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,180
to get a heart,

416
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,080
and I end up

417
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,080
with neither.

418
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,060
Robert, it was

419
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,060
never my intention

420
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,030
to have you cut Sarah

421
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,030
out of your life.

422
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,530
Semantics.

423
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,060
Uh, in any case,

424
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,120
you play a good game.

425
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,140
Dr. Bekker...

426
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,210
You're looking lovely.

427
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,210
Thank you.

428
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,220
And thank you

429
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,220
for the flowers.

430
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,090
That was

431
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,090
quite unnecessary.

432
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,350
Did you like them?

433
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,590
They're beautiful.

434
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,860
Though, I must admit,

435
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,860
the money would've been

436
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,860
better spent

437
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,090
as part of your donation

438
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,090
to the department.

439
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,220
Speaking of which,

440
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,220
I glanced

441
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,220
at that information

442
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,130
you gave me concerning...

443
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,730
Da Vinci robotic

444
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,730
surgical system?

445
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,900
Yes, that's, uh...

446
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,900
It was very impressive,

447
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,910
but a little technical

448
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,910
for a layman like myself.

449
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,070
Perhaps you could explain

450
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,070
the details to me?

451
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,240
Of course.

452
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,240
How 'bout tonight?

453
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,310
Over dinner?

454
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,780
Mr. Rhodes...

455
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,560
The flowers? Dinner?

456
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,290
Is it me or are you trying

457
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,290
to make your son crazy?

458
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,660
Dr. Bekker, you are

459
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,830
an intelligent,

460
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,590
attractive, dynamic woman,

461
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,100
and if this

462
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,100
makes Connor crazy,

463
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,940
then so be it.

464
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,140
Look, I and the entire

465
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,140
cardiothoracic department

466
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,680
truly appreciate

467
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,680
your patronage,

468
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,080
but you and I are going

469
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,080
to keep our relationship

470
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,850
on a professional level.

471
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,010
Oh. All right.

472
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,150
I'll have the head of

473
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,150
philanthropy services

474
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,850
give you a call

475
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,850
this afternoon.

476
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,910
Thank you.

477
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,260
Dr. Rhodes,

478
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,260
Trauma Three.

479
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,260
Yep.

480
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,490
All right, Brett,

481
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,490
what do we got?

482
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,030
David Gray,

483
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,030
50-year-old bystander

484
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,030
in an attempted robbery.

485
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,900
He got shot in the head.

486
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,900
GCS, 6.

487
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,800
He's only responding

488
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,800
to painful stimuli.

489
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,000
We couldn't intubate

490
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,000
in the field.

491
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,300
All right, give me

492
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,300
an intubation kit.

493
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,900
150 of mannitol,

494
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,900
500 of keppra.

495
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,900
Got it.

496
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,170
All right, on my count,

497
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,620
one, two, three.

498
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,890
Entry wound,

499
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,890
left parietal skull,

500
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,890
no exit.

501
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,590
Get neurosurg

502
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,590
down here ASAP.

503
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,360
And get me a Cordis kit.

504
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,360
Yep.

505
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,130
There we go.

506
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,730
No reactions to light.

507
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,760
All right, I'm in.

508
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,570
No corneal reflex either.

509
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,570
We're losing him.

510
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,670
Cordis kit.

511
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,100
Brainstem reflexes

512
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,100
are completely absent,

513
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,840
and his pupils are

514
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,840
fixed and blown.

515
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,540
He was responding to pain

516
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,540
in the ambo.

517
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,680
Dr. Rhodes, he's GCS 3.

518
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,250
Dr. Rhodes,

519
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,250
he's braindead.

520
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,250
Is he a donor?

521
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,330
Yeah.

522
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,390
Okay, let's get an angio

523
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,390
to confirm brain death,

524
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,690
then get a cardiac echo.

525
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,330
I've got a patient

526
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,330
who needs a heart.

527
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
You're wasting your time

528
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
on this one, Dr. Rhodes.

529
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,840
I heard significant mitral

530
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,840
regurg on auscultation.

531
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,400
There's no way

532
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,400
that heart is viable.

533
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,610
Maybe not now, but that

534
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,610
doesn't mean I can't fix it.

535
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,040
Let's get him up

536
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,040
to Radiology now.

537
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,280
A drug overdose?

538
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,280
Opioids.

539
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,820
Your father's tox screen

540
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,820
showed extremely high levels.

541
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,860
Bolus him with 2 of narcan,

542
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,860
then start a drip.

543
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,260
It can't be.

544
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,260
My dad doesn't do drugs.

545
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,890
I mean, he... He never has.

546
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,890
He doesn't even drink.

547
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,760
What about pain medication?

548
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,760
He doesn't take anything.

549
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,460
You need to run

550
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,460
some more tests.

551
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,970
Ma'am, Dr. Sexton has run

552
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,970
all the appropriate...

553
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,570
Is there anything

554
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,570
around the house?

555
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,240
Um, Vicodin?

556
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,240
Tylenol with codeine?

557
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,370
No, I... I cleaned

558
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,370
all the medicine cabinets out.

559
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,570
We don't have anything.

560
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,880
Hmm, then he may have

561
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,880
gotten it outside the house.

562
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,440
What? You think I'm letting

563
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,440
him shoot up or something?

564
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,890
No, I'm just saying...

565
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,890
Look, your test is wrong.

566
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,080
You need to redo it.

567
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,690
These tests, they are

568
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,690
usually pretty accurate...

569
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,390
And I know my father.

570
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
Look, if you need to consult

571
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
with another doctor,

572
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,100
then maybe...

573
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,100
No.

574
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,730
I'll redo the test.

575
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,400
But in the meantime,

576
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,400
I'm gonna give him

577
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,400
some medicine

578
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,030
to reverse the opioids,

579
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,470
just so we can try

580
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,470
and wake him up.

581
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,470
Okay.

582
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,470
Thanks.

583
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,480
Administer the narcan.

584
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,790
Hi.

585
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,090
So, Kevin's scans indicate

586
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,090
toxic megacolon.

587
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,030
It's a dangerous

588
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,030
intestinal infection

589
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,530
caused by an overgrowth

590
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,530
of opportunistic bacteria.

591
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,430
Which is most likely due to

592
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,430
his long-term antibiotic use.

593
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,530
So the new medicine you're

594
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,530
giving him should fix it?

595
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,200
It's not that simple.

596
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,640
Kevin's bowel is so inflamed,

597
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,270
it's become

598
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,270
dangerously dilated.

599
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,840
And if it perforates,

600
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,840
it's a life threatening

601
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,840
situation,

602
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,350
which is why

603
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,350
we need to release

604
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,350
the pressure from his colon

605
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,850
to try and prevent that.

606
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,080
We appreciate your help,

607
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,280
but we've spoken

608
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,280
with Dr. Kravitz,

609
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,450
and he wants Kevin

610
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,450
transferred over there.

611
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,290
Dr. Kravitz says

612
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,290
if we treat him incorrectly,

613
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,660
it's only going to

614
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,660
make Kevin's

615
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,660
neurologic symptoms worse.

616
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,390
He wants to give him

617
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,390
an infusion of IVIg

618
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,450
to prevent that.

619
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,730
Kevin's tics are the least

620
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,730
of his problems right now.

621
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,170
We need to focus on

622
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,170
treating his infection.

623
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,330
We want that too,

624
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,740
but Kevin's tics

625
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,740
are a big problem.

626
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,110
They're odd,

627
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,110
and the kids at school

628
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,670
are starting

629
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,670
to stare at him.

630
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,100
We just don't

631
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,100
wanna do anything

632
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,120
to compromise his future.

633
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,120
I understand, but...

634
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,240
We'll do the IVIg here.

635
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,380
Natalie...

636
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,410
That would work.

637
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,420
Great, we'll get started

638
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,420
right away.

639
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,320
Thank you so much.

640
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah.

641
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,650
Why are you indulging them

642
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,650
like this?

643
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,750
Indulging them?

644
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,460
You know full well the IVIg

645
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,930
will have exactly zero

646
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,930
therapeutic benefit.

647
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,560
It's keeping Kevin

648
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,560
in the hospital.

649
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,070
Why are you being

650
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,070
so negative?

651
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,540
I'm just being realistic.

652
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,970
The more you humor them,

653
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,970
the less likely

654
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,970
they'll ever be

655
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,670
to seek out an actual

656
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,670
effective therapy

657
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,710
for what is most likely

658
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,710
a genetic

659
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,710
neurologic condition.

660
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,010
So what do you want

661
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,010
me to do, Will?

662
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,740
Have them sign out and leave?

663
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,340
Nah, you should just

664
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,340
give them a placebo. IVIg.

665
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,580
If that's what's gonna

666
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,580
allow us to do our job,

667
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,450
then that's exactly

668
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,450
what I'm gonna do.

669
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,020
Just a little bit longer.

670
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,560
I need to get back to Athena.

671
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,250
I'm still waiting on

672
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,250
a few more tests,

673
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,090
so please,

674
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,090
don't go anywhere yet.

675
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,400
Dr. Charles...

676
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,710
I've got a runaway kid

677
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,710
with confirmed leukemia,

678
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,570
but I can't get him

679
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,570
to give me his parents'

680
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,570
contact information,

681
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,550
and Oncology

682
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,550
won't begin treatment

683
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,880
till they're sure

684
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,880
he's not gonna be living

685
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,580
in a tent on the streets

686
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,580
during his recovery.

687
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,040
Figure his parents

688
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,040
might have abused him?

689
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,610
Apparently not.

690
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,380
He's adopted, but he says

691
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,380
they're nice people.

692
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,860
It just wasn't a good fit.

693
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,290
And you're sure

694
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,290
he understands

695
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,290
the danger here?

696
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,260
Cancer? Life or death?

697
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,560
Says he does,

698
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,560
but I don't know.

699
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,670
Let me have a chat with him.

700
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,670
Thanks.

701
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,300
There's too much

702
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,300
retrograde flow.

703
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,500
The leaflet's

704
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,500
totally eaten away.

705
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,400
Shame to have an otherwise

706
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,400
perfectly good heart

707
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,400
go to waste.

708
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,970
It's not gonna go to waste.

709
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,880
Excuse me?

710
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,610
This heart

711
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,610
is an HLA match

712
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,610
for my patient.

713
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,750
I'm gonna do a valve repair.

714
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,280
You're joking.

715
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,620
Get him prepped

716
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,620
for surgery, thanks.

717
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,730
You're going to do

718
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,730
major surgery on this heart,

719
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,820
which by itself contains

720
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,820
significant morbidity

721
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,230
and mortality,

722
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,230
and then turn around

723
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,830
and transplant it

724
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,830
into someone else?

725
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,000
Uh-huh.

726
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,500
You'll kill the recipient

727
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,500
on the table.

728
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,240
So don't scrub in.

729
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,400
I'm sure with

730
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,400
your active social life,

731
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,280
there are things

732
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,280
you'd rather be doing anyways.

733
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,470
Now, if you will excuse me,

734
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,610
I am going to prep

735
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,610
for my valve repair.

736
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,820
Ms. Larson,

737
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,730
the retests once again show

738
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,730
high levels of opioids.

739
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,160
I'm sorry.

740
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,530
Well, then why

741
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,530
isn't he waking up?

742
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,230
Should we be doing

743
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,230
something else?

744
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,740
Well, with overdoses

745
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,740
that large,

746
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,740
it can sometimes...

747
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,900
Dr. Sexton...

748
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,300
Okay, um,

749
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,300
we need to step out.

750
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,680
Let's clear the room.

751
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,680
Wha... What's going on?

752
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,680
Step out.

753
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,090
That white powder

754
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,090
on his jacket,

755
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,720
I'm guessing

756
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,720
that's fentanyl.

757
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,680
What's that?

758
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,680
A synthetic opiate.

759
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,990
Now, he could have

760
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,990
either inhaled it

761
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,580
or even just touched it,

762
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,650
but it's 100 times stronger

763
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,650
than heroin.

764
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,060
That could explain why

765
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,060
the narcan's moving so slow.

766
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,190
But how did he get it?

767
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,660
They smuggle it in

768
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,660
from China

769
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,400
and cut it

770
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,400
in abandoned buildings.

771
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,370
All your dad had to do

772
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,370
was brush up against some

773
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,870
while he was feeding

774
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,870
stray cats.

775
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,170
We're notifying CPD, CFD,

776
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,730
anyone who might've

777
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,730
come in contact.

778
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,680
Now, um, you have to test it,

779
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,680
but I think we have fentanyl.

780
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,410
Okay, I'll set up

781
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,410
the decon protocol

782
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,850
out in the ambulance bay,

783
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,850
and I'll call Goodwin.

784
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,970
Doris, door.

785
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,970
Okay, got it.

786
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,050
We will get you back in

787
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,050
the room, but please come.

788
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,740
You gotta strip.

789
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,870
I feel fine.

790
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,870
Come on, Maggie.

791
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,710
You come on.

792
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,080
Even absorbed

793
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,080
through the skin,

794
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,080
fentanyl can cause

795
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,550
mental status changes

796
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,550
and respiratory distress.

797
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,010
Strip.

798
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,010
She's right, Cesar.

799
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,640
Go get some clean clothes.

800
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,950
I don't like this

801
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,950
at all, Maggie.

802
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,960
We got too many sick people

803
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,960
in here to take any chances.

804
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,830
We need to scrub down

805
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,830
the back half of the ED,

806
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,200
and put us on bypass

807
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,200
until we get the go-ahead

808
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,290
from the decontamination team.

809
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,930
Yes, ma'am.

810
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,930
All right.

811
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,040
All finished.

812
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,040
You okay, Kevin?

813
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,170
Can I have a word?

814
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,580
Kevin's latest scans show

815
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,580
increasing edema

816
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,120
across the wall of his bowel,

817
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,850
indicating lack of blood flow.

818
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,860
At this point, we need to

819
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,860
consider surgical resection.

820
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,150
Surgery?

821
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,390
Shouldn't we finish

822
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,390
the IVIg first

823
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,390
to see if it helps?

824
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,230
He can keep getting it,

825
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,230
but we really need

826
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,230
to move him upstairs.

827
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,930
We need to call Dr. Kravitz.

828
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,530
Mr. and Mrs. Parks,

829
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,530
your son

830
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,530
is running out of time.

831
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,930
My wife works tirelessly

832
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,770
to try to fix

833
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,770
our son's problems,

834
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,940
and if she has

835
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,940
any hesitation at all,

836
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,480
then we need

837
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,480
to listen to her.

838
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,870
How 'bout I call Dr. Kravitz

839
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,550
and explain the situation

840
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,550
to him, okay?

841
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,110
Could you do that?

842
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,110
Of course.

843
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,310
Is there a bathroom nearby?

844
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,310
Right down the hall.

845
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,080
So, you're just gonna

846
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,080
keep encouraging them

847
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,350
to follow this quack?

848
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,520
Now is not the time to start

849
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,520
an argument with them.

850
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,520
You know, it must be nice

851
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,520
always being right.

852
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,790
I'm sorry?

853
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,100
From the moment

854
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,100
we started this case,

855
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,360
everything's been your way.

856
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,770
"We can't do this,

857
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,770
we have to do that."

858
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,000
What are you talking about?

859
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,660
I'm talking about everything

860
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,660
always being done your way.

861
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,900
How we treat patients,

862
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,380
what we can

863
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,380
or can't tell them...

864
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,430
What?

865
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,450
Whether you and I are

866
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,450
together or split up

867
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,450
or on a break.

868
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,740
Is that what this is about?

869
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,740
You and me?

870
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,980
Because it definitely

871
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,980
wasn't my idea

872
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,110
to go hook up with

873
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,110
some woman in a bar.

874
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,050
I told you,

875
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,050
it went nowhere.

876
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,610
Oh, and that's supposed

877
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,610
to make me feel better?

878
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,880
I made a mistake.

879
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,450
I'm not perfect.

880
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,360
But at least I admit it.

881
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,690
I don't think I'm perfect.

882
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay, all I can say, Natalie,

883
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,000
is that it's very hard

884
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,090
for us mere mortals

885
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,090
to measure up to you.

886
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,000
Thanks, Officer Burgess,

887
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,000
I appreciate your help.

888
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,440
What are you still

889
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,440
doing here?

890
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,980
I wanted to see

891
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,980
how Josh is doing.

892
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
He's not letting us

893
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
treat him.

894
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,780
Luckily, PD's got a lead

895
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,780
on his parents.

896
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
Wait, you said you weren't

897
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
going to call his parents.

898
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,850
I said I'd end up

899
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,850
calling them eventually.

900
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,220
Yeah, but you don't have to.

901
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,220
I mean, there are

902
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,220
other ways to do this.

903
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,850
This is what Josh needs

904
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,850
to stay alive.

905
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,150
You don't know

906
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,150
what Josh needs.

907
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,720
And you do?

908
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,990
Look, you're not adopted.

909
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,630
You don't know what it's like.

910
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,160
Josh needs

911
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,160
a bone marrow transplant,

912
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,430
and he won't get it

913
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,430
if he's living

914
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,430
on the streets.

915
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,540
So you're just gonna do

916
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,540
whatever you want?

917
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,230
Yeah, because you always

918
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,230
know better than everyone.

919
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,000
No, I don't,

920
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,770
but I do know that

921
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,770
when his immune system

922
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,680
is obliterated by chemo,

923
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,680
he's gonna need to recover

924
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,150
in a stable,

925
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,150
clean environment,

926
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,180
and if you're

927
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,180
too irresponsible

928
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,180
to understand that,

929
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,480
then stay out of my way.

930
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,790
Mrs. Parks?

931
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,970
I'm sorry,

932
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,970
I was just finishing up.

933
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,390
Are you all right?

934
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,810
I'm just stressed.

935
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,880
Does that help?

936
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,880
What?

937
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,210
The handwashing.

938
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,850
It used to...

939
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,420
In high school,

940
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,620
but I stopped for a long time,

941
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,620
till Kevin got sick.

942
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,960
Having a child with

943
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,960
uncontrollable tics

944
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,500
must be so stressful.

945
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,930
That's why we've seen

946
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,930
so many doctors.

947
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,130
My husband likes answers.

948
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,070
Does he know about this?

949
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,680
He's already got enough

950
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,680
that he didn't sign up for.

951
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,010
What would be the point?

952
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,480
It might help you and Kevin.

953
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,040
I don't see how.

954
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,210
Kathy, you have OCD,

955
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,210
like Kevin,

956
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,880
and it's not caused by

957
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,880
any bacterial infection.

958
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,250
It's genetic,

959
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,990
something a child inherits

960
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,990
from the parents.

961
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,130
I appreciate your concern,

962
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,890
but please,

963
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,830
just take care of

964
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,830
Kevin's intestines.

965
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,230
I'll worry about the rest.

966
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,920
Excuse me, are you all right?

967
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,190
Um, sorry,

968
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,190
I'm... I'm fine.

969
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,090
I'm Dr. Reese

970
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,090
from Psychiatry.

971
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,090
Can I help?

972
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,690
Uh, my dad ran into

973
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,690
some trouble today.

974
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,560
He has dementia.

975
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

976
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,930
I know that's really hard.

977
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,470
It's completely normal

978
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,470
to feel overwhelmed.

979
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,300
It's like

980
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,300
he's a different person.

981
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,010
And sometimes,

982
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,010
I wonder if maybe...

983
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,190
If maybe it would be

984
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,190
better if he...

985
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,750
Does that make me

986
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,750
a horrible person?

987
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,290
No.

988
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,760
No, it doesn't

989
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,760
make you horrible.

990
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,770
Almost anyone in your position

991
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,770
would have these thoughts.

992
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,710
Talked to your patient.

993
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,710
Nice kid.

994
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,150
Is he still insisting on

995
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,010
going back to

996
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,010
the homeless encampment?

997
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,780
He feels pretty strongly

998
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,780
about it.

999
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,010
Is he suicidal?

1000
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,350
Nope, he definitely

1001
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,350
seems to wanna live.

1002
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,320
Then he shouldn't

1003
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,320
object so much

1004
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,320
to me calling his parents.

1005
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,560
I need to spend

1006
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,560
a little more time with him,

1007
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,290
but off the top of my head,

1008
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,290
I'd say that

1009
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,290
Josh is dealing with

1010
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,890
a classic case of

1011
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,890
attachment disorder.

1012
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,460
Does that explain

1013
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,460
why he'd rather

1014
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,460
risk his life

1015
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,730
than live with his parents

1016
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,730
for a couple of months?

1017
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,100
I know it seems bizarre,

1018
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,830
but those two years

1019
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,830
that he was at the orphanage,

1020
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,100
it's that critical period

1021
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,740
when babies need

1022
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,740
parental affection the most.

1023
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,440
And if they're in a facility

1024
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,440
where they don't get it,

1025
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,880
their brains actually

1026
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,880
become wired differently,

1027
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,020
leaving them poorly adapted

1028
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,020
to cope with the complexities

1029
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,450
of giving and receiving love,

1030
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,010
I mean, sometimes

1031
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,010
for the rest of their lives.

1032
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,120
I hear what you're saying,

1033
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,120
Dr. Charles...

1034
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,960
But Josh has his whole life

1035
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,520
to live as far from

1036
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,520
his parents as he wants,

1037
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,070
if we treat his cancer.

1038
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,830
Scissors to Dr. Bekker.

1039
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,830
Scissors.

1040
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,540
So, what's the story

1041
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,540
with you and my friend

1042
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,540
with the flowers?

1043
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,110
I'm definitely picking up

1044
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,110
on some rancor.

1045
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,140
How do I put this? Uh...

1046
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,140
My father and I

1047
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,140
have always had an

1048
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,950
unhealthy competition.

1049
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,950
Competition?

1050
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,820
You're a cardiothoracic

1051
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,820
surgeon.

1052
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
What is there

1053
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
to compete over?

1054
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,220
Well, next time

1055
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,220
you two get together,

1056
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,760
you can ask him about it.

1057
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,220
Snip.

1058
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,460
Let's take him off pump.

1059
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,460
Paddles.

1060
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,440
And clear.

1061
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,780
No retrograde flow.

1062
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,010
Congratulations,

1063
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,010
we have a working valve.

1064
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,910
I'm gonna go let

1065
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,910
my patient know

1066
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,540
that he's about

1067
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,540
to get a new heart.

1068
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,020
Okay, I'll let her know.

1069
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,930
Sharon?

1070
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,930
Yeah?

1071
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,220
That was Peter Kalmick.

1072
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,290
Apparently the board

1073
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,290
is refusing to let us

1074
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,290
go on bypass.

1075
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,400
They're overriding

1076
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,400
my decision?

1077
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,900
They didn't find

1078
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,900
sufficient reason

1079
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,900
to take such drastic action.

1080
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,940
There were enough opioids

1081
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,940
on that man's coat

1082
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,510
to drop

1083
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,510
a herd of elephants.

1084
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,510
Yep.

1085
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,300
You keep us on bypass.

1086
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,210
I'll deal with the board.

1087
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,210
I got you.

1088
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,780
Mr. and Mrs. Logan?

1089
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,650
I'm Dr. Choi.

1090
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,650
I've been taking care of Josh.

1091
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,280
Thank you so much

1092
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,280
for contacting us.

1093
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,790
Of course. Please.

1094
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,490
Uh, he's run away before,

1095
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,490
but he'd always come back,

1096
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,190
and then this time...

1097
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,730
We contacted the police.

1098
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,860
We tried every way

1099
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,860
we could to find him.

1100
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,490
I do have to warn you,

1101
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,030
calling you was

1102
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,030
my idea, not his,

1103
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,060
but he's very ill

1104
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,060
and he needs help,

1105
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,330
so please,

1106
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,330
no matter how this goes,

1107
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,670
try to understand

1108
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,670
and be patient.

1109
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
Of course.

1110
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,170
He's right over here.

1111
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,380
April...

1112
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,450
My patient in Two didn't go

1113
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,450
for anymore tests, did he?

1114
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,880
Doesn't look like it.

1115
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,360
I'm sorry.

1116
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,360
Just give me a minute.

1117
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,100
Leah, did you see

1118
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,100
my patient?

1119
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,970
Sixteen-year-old boy,

1120
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,970
tall, brown hair?

1121
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
Yeah, I think so.

1122
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,710
Left with a young woman

1123
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,710
about 20 minutes ago.

1124
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
Now, this shows distribution

1125
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
of aggregate hospital costs

1126
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,040
and stays by payer

1127
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,040
for our last fiscal year.

1128
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,150
Excuse me...

1129
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,960
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1130
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,420
Ms. Goodwin.

1131
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,720
As Executive Director of

1132
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,720
Patient and Medical Services,

1133
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,460
the safety of

1134
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,460
our staff and patients

1135
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,300
is my responsibility.

1136
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,370
There are few substances

1137
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,500
more dangerous and terrifying

1138
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,500
than fentanyl.

1139
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,070
Even a minute amount inhaled

1140
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,050
or absorbed through the skin

1141
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,210
can cause an overdose

1142
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,210
and even death,

1143
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,250
and while I understand

1144
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,250
going on bypass

1145
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,820
costs this hospital money,

1146
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,590
if just one person

1147
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,590
goes into respiratory failure

1148
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,790
from coming in contact

1149
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,790
with this drug,

1150
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,190
I guarantee

1151
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,590
that the damage to

1152
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,590
this hospital's reputation

1153
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,530
will be far costlier.

1154
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,760
So, I'm sure

1155
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,760
you'll all agree

1156
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,270
that keeping us on bypass

1157
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,000
is medically and fiscally

1158
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,510
the best course of action.

1159
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,100
Well...

1160
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,770
Since you put it like that...

1161
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,410
Thank you.

1162
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,210
I'll be in my office

1163
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,250
if anyone has

1164
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,250
anymore questions.

1165
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,090
Sharon...

1166
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,790
You shouldn't have done that.

1167
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,260
I don't see that

1168
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,260
I had a choice.

1169
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,770
Listen, I'm up here

1170
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,770
with them, okay?

1171
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,170
I hear which way

1172
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,170
the wind is blowing,

1173
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,430
and lately, the board feels

1174
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,340
that you are

1175
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,340
not making decisions

1176
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,310
that are aligned with

1177
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,310
this hospital's interests.

1178
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,070
Well, I'm sorry, Peter,

1179
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,170
but I thought this hospital's

1180
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,170
foremost interest

1181
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,370
was in treatment of patients.

1182
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,180
You're not hearing me,

1183
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,180
and you keep taking

1184
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,310
an adversarial position

1185
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,310
vis-à-vis the board

1186
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,080
and they will fire you.

1187
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,200
Hey, Dad.

1188
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,940
Sarah...

1189
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,730
So nice of you to come.

1190
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,340
I just wanted to, um,

1191
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,340
see how you're doing.

1192
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,700
Did you?

1193
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,410
No ulterior motive?

1194
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,410
What?

1195
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,940
Sure you didn't come here

1196
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,940
to make yourself feel better

1197
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,320
by doing the right thing?

1198
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,050
That this visit

1199
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,050
isn't all about you?

1200
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,150
Dad...

1201
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,710
Maybe I'm not the only one

1202
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,060
with personality disorder.

1203
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,460
Are you serious?

1204
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,330
Oh, don't be so sensitive.

1205
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,190
Come now.

1206
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,360
Let's see what I can do

1207
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,700
to leave you with

1208
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,700
a good memory.

1209
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,170
Okay, this was

1210
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,170
clearly a mistake.

1211
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,100
Should we sit and reminisce?

1212
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,770
Perhaps order

1213
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,770
some hot cocoa?

1214
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,140
Goodbye, Dad.

1215
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,550
No, stay.

1216
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,410
Let's focus

1217
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,350
on getting you some closure.

1218
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,480
I found your dad a heart.

1219
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,590
Thank you.

1220
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,360
We're gonna take him

1221
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,360
to do the transplant now.

1222
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,110
Dr. Choi?

1223
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,110
Please wait here a second.

1224
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,070
What do you think

1225
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,070
you're doing?

1226
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,380
He wanted to come

1227
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,380
back to Athena,

1228
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,420
so I called us an Uber.

1229
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,420
Em, I get it.

1230
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,480
He needs his dog,

1231
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,480
and I don't

1232
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,480
wanna take that from him,

1233
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,050
but right now,

1234
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,050
he needs our help even more.

1235
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,150
This isn't a game.

1236
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,150
Like I don't know that?

1237
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,200
But you don't

1238
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,200
understand him. I do.

1239
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,120
I've been there.

1240
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,300
What do you mean?

1241
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,300
You've been homeless?

1242
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,800
Yeah.

1243
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,730
But that's not important.

1244
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,470
What matters is that this dog

1245
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,410
is the only thing in the world

1246
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,410
Josh can relate to.

1247
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,210
I think he needs her so much

1248
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,210
that if he had to

1249
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,210
go on without her,

1250
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,650
he'd rather die.

1251
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,550
All right.

1252
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,390
Tell Josh to pack his clothes,

1253
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,390
and we'll take the dog

1254
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,390
with us.

1255
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,090
Help! Somebody!

1256
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,260
Uh, what's going on?

1257
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,260
What's happening?

1258
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,400
His lungs are full of fluid.

1259
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,400
He must've been coming to

1260
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,800
and inhaled against

1261
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,800
his glottis.

1262
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,970
Sats down to 83.

1263
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,610
He lost his IV.

1264
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,640
Uh, do something!

1265
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,640
Save him!

1266
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,070
Just so you understand,

1267
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,070
with the lack of oxygen,

1268
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,780
there's no guarantee

1269
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,780
that he won't have

1270
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,580
new physical

1271
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,580
or neurological deficits.

1272
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,980
Just save him, please.

1273
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,490
Do you understand

1274
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,490
what Dr. Sexton is saying?

1275
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,220
He's my father.

1276
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,220
Please, don't let him die.

1277
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,920
Okay, give 20 of Lasix,

1278
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,920
20 of etomidate, 50 of sux.

1279
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,260
Open an intubation kit

1280
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,260
and a central line kit, now.

1281
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,490
Can you intubate?

1282
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,490
Yeah.

1283
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,730
Sats at 65.

1284
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,940
He's in PEA. Bag him.

1285
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,340
Give me a milligram of

1286
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,340
epinephrine. I'll start CPR.

1287
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,480
Epinephrine's in.

1288
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,780
He's still in PEA.

1289
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,780
Another milligram.

1290
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,180
Second milligram in.

1291
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,180
Come on, Dad.

1292
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,950
Still in PEA.

1293
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,950
Another milligram.

1294
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,460
Third milligram's in.

1295
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,100
What? No.

1296
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,100
No, no, no, no.

1297
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,600
I'm sorry.

1298
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,130
Daddy!

1299
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,070
Time of death, 17:13.

1300
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,080
I'm sorry.

1301
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,010
His abdomen's more distended,

1302
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,510
and his pain is getting worse.

1303
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,870
Like I was saying, we need

1304
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,870
to take him up to surgery.

1305
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,840
Dale, maybe

1306
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,840
we should let them.

1307
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,500
Are you sure that

1308
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,500
that's necessary?

1309
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,410
Did you even talk

1310
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,410
to Dr. Kravitz?

1311
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,420
He says that

1312
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,420
general anesthesia will

1313
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,420
exacerbate Kevin's PANDAS.

1314
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,780
You're not hearing me.

1315
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,950
At the moment, that is

1316
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,950
not our biggest concern.

1317
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,120
But Dr. Kravitz says...

1318
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,120
Forget about Dr. Kravitz.

1319
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,560
Kevin doesn't have PANDAS.

1320
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,290
His tics are from me.

1321
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,190
What are you talking about?

1322
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,330
He has OCD.

1323
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,960
It's not from strep.

1324
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,960
It's genetic.

1325
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,930
He inherited it from me.

1326
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,840
It's a far more

1327
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,840
likely explanation.

1328
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,410
So the antibiotics,

1329
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,410
the... All of it...

1330
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,250
He never needed them.

1331
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,810
It's... It's my fault.

1332
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,320
All my fault.

1333
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,080
Why didn't you tell me

1334
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,080
you had OCD?

1335
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,210
I thought if you knew

1336
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,210
something was wrong with me,

1337
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,850
you wouldn't love me.

1338
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,430
Do the surgery.

1339
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
Dale, wait...

1340
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,460
We'll get Kevin

1341
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,460
ready to go upstairs.

1342
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,850
His temperature is 99.6.

1343
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,750
It could signal

1344
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,750
the onset of infection,

1345
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,390
which would be

1346
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,390
a contraindication

1347
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,950
for performing the transplant.

1348
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,460
He won't get the heart?

1349
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,270
No, I'm sorry.

1350
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,080
He always runs warm.

1351
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,710
What?

1352
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,710
My dad, um...

1353
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,980
His temperature

1354
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,980
always runs high.

1355
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,140
It's normal for him,

1356
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,950
which would mean that

1357
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,950
this isn't an infection.

1358
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,720
You're sure?

1359
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,720
Because if that's the case,

1360
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,490
then he could

1361
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,490
still get the heart.

1362
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,860
Yes, I'm sure he's fine.

1363
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,290
Let's get Dr. Haywood

1364
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,290
up to the O.R.

1365
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,690
Yes, sir.

1366
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,280
All right.

1367
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,410
Ejection fraction looks good.

1368
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,250
Normal rate and rhythm.

1369
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,690
I think we did it.

1370
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,290
Well done, Dr. Rhodes.

1371
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,290
You as well.

1372
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,630
Dr. Mehta,

1373
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,630
will you please close?

1374
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,360
Yes, sir.

1375
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,360
Thank you.

1376
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,740
I must admit,

1377
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,740
despite your

1378
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,740
overall surliness,

1379
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,210
your determination today

1380
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,370
in the face of great odds

1381
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,370
was admirable.

1382
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,040
I will take that

1383
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,040
as a compliment.

1384
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,140
You should.

1385
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,180
I'm gonna go take

1386
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,180
my flowers home.

1387
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,910
Ava...

1388
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,520
It's not that it's my dad

1389
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,520
you're dating...

1390
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,760
I wish that you weren't

1391
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,760
dating anybody at all.

1392
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,240
As long as we're making

1393
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,240
confessions,

1394
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,840
I was never

1395
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,840
dating your father.

1396
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,380
But you didn't mind me

1397
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,380
thinking so.

1398
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,080
No, I didn't mind.

1399
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,930
Oh, Josh.

1400
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,800
Hello, Josh.

1401
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,800
Hi.

1402
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,000
Uh, Dr. Choi told us

1403
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,000
about what's going on,

1404
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,090
and we're gonna get through

1405
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,090
this, honey, together.

1406
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,210
I'm sorry I caused you

1407
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,210
so much trouble.

1408
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,380
We're just glad

1409
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,380
to see you again,

1410
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,100
and that you're safe.

1411
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,410
Josh will need to stay here

1412
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,410
for about two weeks,

1413
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,010
but after that, he's agreed

1414
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,010
to go home with you,

1415
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,820
if you let him bring his dog.

1416
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,760
Of course.

1417
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,760
Anything.

1418
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,220
What's its name?

1419
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,220
Athena.

1420
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,430
Well, we'll take

1421
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,430
care of Athena.

1422
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,990
Please follow me.

1423
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,840
Uh, we'll get Athena

1424
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,840
after we settle Josh in.

1425
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,340
Of course.

1426
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,440
He's never really

1427
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,440
gonna be able

1428
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,440
to love them back, is he?

1429
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,620
By our definition?

1430
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,220
Unlikely.

1431
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,120
I don't know who to feel

1432
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,120
more sorry for,

1433
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,790
the parents or him.

1434
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,540
Thanks.

1435
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,760
Really?

1436
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,770
For what?

1437
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,400
You did good today.

1438
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,850
Maybe we could use you

1439
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,850
around here.

1440
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,120
Athena...

1441
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,400
It'd be so hard

1442
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,400
to do that all alone.

1443
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,230
What?

1444
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,210
It's just...

1445
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,710
I know when mom

1446
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,710
and dad get old,

1447
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
at least we'll face it

1448
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
together.

1449
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,360
Kevin's fever

1450
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,360
is coming down,

1451
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,590
and his numbers

1452
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,590
all look great.

1453
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,760
I think he's gonna be okay.

1454
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,760
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

1455
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,770
At least they can

1456
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,770
start getting Kevin

1457
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,150
the help he needs.

1458
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,150
Yeah.

1459
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,620
Hey, Will...

1460
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,620
I'm not perfect.

1461
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,050
I have got a million

1462
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,050
fears and insecurities

1463
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,060
about being

1464
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,060
a doctor, a mother,

1465
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,190
everything.

1466
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,530
It's exhausting.

1467
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,390
But, yes, sometimes, I

1468
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,170
push it too far.

1469
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,100
It's okay.

1470
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,510
I understand.

1471
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,010
Good.

1472
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,720
It still doesn't mean you get

1473
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,720
a pass for the other night.

1474
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,830
Looks like he's gonna live.

1475
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,920
Yeah.

1476
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,160
Now what?
