1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,060
And why don't you check

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,060
the drawer next to the pantry?

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm sorry, Robin,

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,000
then I don't know

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,160
where they are.

6
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,160
I'll tell you what,

7
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,270
I'll get another set made

8
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,270
on my way home.

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,800
Look, babe,

10
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,800
I really have to go.

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,580
Yeah, sure, that's fine.

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,980
Okay, I love you, too.

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,340
Bye-bye.

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,640
My apologies.

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,850
Everything okay?

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,820
Yeah, Robin just couldn't

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,820
find her keys.

18
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,790
Rough morning? Perhaps I

19
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,790
should take over the pre-op?

20
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,620
That will not be necessary.

21
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,390
Shall we?

22
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,390
Please.

23
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,890
Just a heads-up,

24
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,900
the board is gonna push you

25
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,900
for more growth.

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,700
The bottom line

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,700
has them concerned.

28
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,470
When hasn't it?

29
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,470
Can set my watch

30
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,530
over their money worries.

31
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,700
I'll be fine.

32
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,110
It's different this time.

33
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,480
C-Suite feels

34
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,480
we can better recognize

35
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,810
how medicine and business

36
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,810
are one and the same.

37
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,210
Ah, let me guess,

38
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,080
scale back on outreach,

39
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,520
combine responsibilities,

40
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,520
outsource?

41
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,220
So basically,

42
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,220
sacrifice patient care?

43
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,050
I won't do that, Peter.

44
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,650
Well, Sharon,

45
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,650
you have to do something,

46
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,360
because the ED

47
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,360
is hemorrhaging cash,

48
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,590
and if the bleeding

49
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,590
doesn't stop,

50
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,430
it's not going to be good

51
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,430
for anybody.

52
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,600
Mmm.

53
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,600
Need I remind you

54
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,070
Randall Memorial

55
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,070
closed their ED?

56
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,380
Dr. Halstead, Doris,

57
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,380
you're with me.

58
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,070
Copy that.

59
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,070
Barry?

60
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,780
Alex Mayer, 23.

61
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,840
Slash and stab.

62
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,840
Large diagonal lacerations

63
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,910
of the abdomen.

64
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,350
He's a little tachy.

65
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,350
GCS 15.

66
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,410
Get it out!

67
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,480
You're going Baghdad.

68
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,540
Get it out!

69
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,610
The weapon still in?

70
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,990
I don't know.

71
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,990
Wasn't even a call.

72
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,050
We were a few blocks away,

73
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,530
I saw him on the street,

74
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,530
bleeding,

75
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,820
loaded him in the ambo

76
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,820
and rolled.

77
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,690
I can feel it inside me!

78
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,690
Whoa, whoa!

79
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,820
Alex, keep your hands down.

80
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,490
I got you, Dr. Halstead.

81
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,690
Let's transfer.

82
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,130
On my count.

83
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,130
One, two, three!

84
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
Two of Versed

85
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
to calm him down.

86
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,130
Thank you, boys.

87
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,640
How's that Versed coming?

88
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,640
On it, Doctor.

89
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,780
Gaping diagonal incision

90
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,780
of the right upper quad.

91
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,250
Evidence of evisceration?

92
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,450
No, I can see the base.

93
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,780
Abdomen's still intact.

94
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,780
Just a flesh wound.

95
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
It's really clean, though.

96
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,480
Wash it out

97
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,480
and stitch it up.

98
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,550
Irrigation.

99
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,120
Sir, you're a lucky man.

100
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,160
Whoever knifed you

101
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,160
didn't do any serious damage.

102
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,230
Look at this.

103
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,230
Betadine's smeared

104
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,230
all over the abdomen.

105
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,960
The skin was prepped

106
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,960
before the cut.

107
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,870
I'm telling you,

108
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,870
that incision is precise.

109
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,070
Back-alley surgery

110
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,070
gone wrong?

111
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,040
Alex, what happened?

112
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,410
I was desperate.

113
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,010
Dr. Halstead, his hand,

114
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,100
under the blood.

115
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,140
More Betadine.

116
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,180
So he doused his own hands.

117
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,950
Alex, did you cut

118
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,950
into yourself?

119
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,610
I had to!

120
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,610
I had to get it out!

121
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,940
Get what out?

122
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,250
The person living inside me!

123
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

124
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,060
Are you all right?

125
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,060
I was just trying

126
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,060
to say "hi."

127
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,730
Um, it's Edith Lake.

128
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,710
Your insulin patient?

129
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,440
The woman

130
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,440
who slashed my tires?

131
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,540
Oh, the woman you think

132
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,540
slashed your tires.

133
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,380
Who else?

134
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,010
I saw her yesterday,

135
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,010
across the street

136
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,010
from my apartment.

137
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
You really think it was her?

138
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,620
Looked like her.

139
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,950
Next.

140
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,090
Dr. Latham,

141
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,090
this is Ray Preston, 53.

142
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,830
Fell short of breath

143
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,830
while jogging.

144
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,240
I was only two miles in.

145
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,870
I'm always good

146
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,870
for at least five before

147
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,870
I start to get tired.

148
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,170
Ray lives in Galena.

149
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,400
It's about three

150
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,400
and a half hours

151
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,400
west of Chicago.

152
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,640
His cardiologist

153
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,640
performed an EKG,

154
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,620
stress test,

155
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,620
and cardiac cath.

156
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
Told me to skip

157
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
the community hospital

158
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,350
and come straight here.

159
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,820
Dr. Rhodes,

160
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,820
I know we're getting

161
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,080
pretty close

162
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,080
to show time here,

163
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,220
but are you

164
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,220
absolutely sure

165
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,220
I need this surgery?

166
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,490
I'm positive.

167
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,290
But I'm not in any pain.

168
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,620
I know, that's the danger.

169
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,600
Severe three-vessel disease,

170
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,600
complicated by...

171
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,360
Heavy calcification

172
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,360
and extremely poor targets.

173
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,830
CABG is still doable,

174
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,930
but it will be more

175
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,930
challenging than normal.

176
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,030
Indeed.

177
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,630
You're a lucky man,

178
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,630
Mr. Preston.

179
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,140
Keeping fit bought you

180
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,140
the time

181
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,300
to notice something was wrong.

182
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,600
Yeah.

183
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,600
Well, Dr. Rhodes said

184
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,170
people with arteries

185
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,170
as damaged as mine

186
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,340
usually just drop dead.

187
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,470
He's absolutely right.

188
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,650
Not to worry, Ray.

189
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,650
We'll take great care of you.

190
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,120
To streamline costs,

191
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,120
Dr. Stohl and I

192
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,660
are implementing a system

193
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,660
to track supplies

194
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,250
to know exactly

195
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,250
what we've used.

196
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,200
Everything will be barcoded

197
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,860
and logged into Pyxis.

198
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,660
It will operate

199
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,660
by finger scan,

200
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,400
like we do for medications.

201
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,730
That's easy enough

202
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,730
for minor treatments,

203
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,070
but what about emergencies?

204
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,370
Not a lot of time to stop down

205
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,370
and scan your prints

206
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,370
during a trauma.

207
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,070
A tech will take note

208
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,070
of what was used in the moment

209
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,140
and then scan

210
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,140
after the fact.

211
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,140
"In the moment."

212
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,140
They'll follow us

213
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,140
into the trauma bay?

214
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,290
Between nurses and equipment,

215
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,290
we're already tight on space.

216
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,340
Another body...

217
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,720
We'll find the room

218
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,720
because we have to.

219
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,960
Not to worry, Miss Goodwin.

220
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,490
All right, uh,

221
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,490
let's get back to work.

222
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,590
Thank you for your time.

223
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,760
Doctors, one more thing

224
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,760
before you go,

225
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,630
while I have you here,

226
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,630
charting.

227
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,890
When I was in Attending,

228
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,900
it was pen, paper,

229
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,900
and long-form.

230
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,930
Today, it's... It's tablets

231
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,930
and shorthand.

232
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,230
I get it.

233
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,800
Tech saves time,

234
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,370
but details get lost

235
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,370
in translation,

236
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,580
so please be explicit

237
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,580
in procedure notes.

238
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,650
Okay? Document everything.

239
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,420
If you do it,

240
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,420
write it down.

241
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,480
Okay?

242
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,920
I clean up nice, don't I?

243
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,020
I haven't noticed.

244
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,030
I saw that.

245
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,660
Why don't you believe me?

246
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,130
I'm not crazy.

247
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,680
Something lives inside of me,

248
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,680
right here.

249
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,800
I hear you.

250
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,800
I understand.

251
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,970
Then get it out!

252
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,040
I feel it all the time!

253
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,540
Alex...

254
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
We're gonna help you,

255
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
I promise.

256
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,040
Sedative?

257
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,650
No, no, no.

258
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,650
Wait, wait, wait.

259
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

260
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,050
I'm telling you the truth.

261
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,590
I can feel it inside of me.

262
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,650
Please.

263
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,560
Please...

264
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,600
What'd you give him?

265
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,700
Five of Versed.

266
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,200
Hmm.

267
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,650
Two probably

268
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,650
would have sufficed.

269
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,710
He put hands on you.

270
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,710
I was being cautious.

271
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,450
So what are you thinking?

272
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,920
Schizophrenia.

273
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,110
Yeah, that was

274
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,110
my initial thought,

275
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,250
but now I'm not so sure.

276
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,990
Seriously?

277
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,990
His, uh, paranoia

278
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,490
that there's something

279
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,490
living inside him,

280
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,930
and his attempt

281
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,930
to remove it

282
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
is literally a textbook

283
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
definition

284
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
of a somatic

285
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
delusional disorder.

286
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
I'm stuck on the level

287
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
of premeditation.

288
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,930
You know, sterilization

289
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,930
with Betadine,

290
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the clean incision,

291
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
doing it near a hospital...

292
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,470
All that kind of forethought,

293
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,910
it's just not consistent

294
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,910
with schizophrenic psychosis.

295
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,140
So he's a germophobe

296
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,140
with a steady hand.

297
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,150
It doesn't mean

298
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,150
he's not schizophrenic.

299
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,180
Mmm, could be true, too.

300
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,940
So, um,

301
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,250
start him on anti-psychotics

302
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,750
and reassess

303
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,750
when his mind's clear?

304
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,020
I'm just not there yet.

305
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,020
My gut tells me it's chemical.

306
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,920
You know, like maybe

307
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,920
a methamphetamine overdose.

308
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,930
Before we go any further,

309
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,930
let's run a tox screen,

310
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,330
see if he's just... high.

311
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,200
What's with you?

312
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,200
You look half-dead.

313
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,340
Yeah, these 90-hour weeks

314
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,340
are killing a brother.

315
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,310
Law says you can't do

316
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,310
more than 80.

317
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,340
When Dr. Stohl

318
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,340
asks you to volunteer,

319
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,980
you don't say "no."

320
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,180
Game is rigged.

321
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,180
All part of being

322
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,180
a big-shot doc.

323
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,520
Big shot, right.

324
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,990
Big shot, living off of

325
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,990
ramen and cheeseburgers.

326
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,830
What?

327
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah, that's all

328
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,200
I got time for.

329
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,260
You are getting

330
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,260
a steady paycheck now.

331
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,490
Sign up

332
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,490
for one of those

333
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,490
meal delivery services.

334
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,440
You're gonna need the fuel.

335
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,230
That's not a bad idea.

336
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,280
Hey, um...

337
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,510
Do you mind

338
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,510
setting it up for me?

339
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,300
What? You...

340
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,370
You always know what I like.

341
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,550
Sure.

342
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,550
Thank you.

343
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,050
Thank you, thank you.

344
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,050
I'ma try to get some Zs

345
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,060
before the troll hawks me

346
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,060
for more rounds.

347
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,900
Don't give me that look.

348
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,060
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

349
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,460
Thank you, Helen.

350
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,870
Bye.

351
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,130
Good news,

352
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,470
Helen's gonna

353
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,470
watch Owen tonight.

354
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,570
Watch as in all night?

355
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,910
Mmm-hmm.

356
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,910
Yes.

357
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,480
Just one thing I ask.

358
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,480
Anything.

359
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,020
That you shave.

360
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,490
You don't like

361
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,490
the sandpaper feel, huh?

362
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,580
Mmm-mmm.

363
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,560
You ask a lot.

364
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,560
Mmm.

365
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,130
But okay.

366
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,330
Thank you.

367
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,330
Yeah.

368
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,960
Proximal anastomosis

369
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,960
is complete.

370
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,170
That looks good.

371
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,170
Let's move on to the base.

372
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,070
Do you have

373
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,070
a suitable landing spot?

374
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,200
Yeah.

375
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,210
Lighter calcification

376
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,210
in this area.

377
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,770
Potts, please.

378
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,100
I'd go more distal.

379
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,170
Vessel's bigger.

380
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,170
You'll get a cleaner target.

381
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,520
This area of vessel

382
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,520
is perfect.

383
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,840
If you say so.

384
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,180
8-0 Prolene.

385
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,950
The artery could probably

386
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,950
handle the 7-0.

387
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,480
I prefer the 8-0.

388
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,890
Just thought

389
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,890
the larger stitch

390
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,090
might be easier for you

391
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,090
to work with.

392
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,530
I don't understand

393
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,530
the debate.

394
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,090
The difference between

395
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,090
vessel location,

396
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,930
and now suture choice,

397
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,930
is negligible.

398
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,130
Good point, Dr. Latham.

399
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,530
Dr. Rhodes,

400
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,530
you're lead surgeon.

401
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,530
I'm only assisting.

402
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,260
I defer to your preference.

403
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,270
Thank you, Doctor.

404
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,700
Now, how about

405
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,700
from here on out,

406
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,410
we keep the background noise

407
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,410
to a minimum?

408
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,250
Myra Adams, 20.

409
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,910
Passed out in her bathroom

410
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,910
washing her face.

411
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,250
Struck her head as she fell.

412
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,310
Chamber two.

413
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,290
GCS 6. BP 128 over 60,

414
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,290
heart rate 102.

415
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
Her brother Eric's

416
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
a step behind.

417
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,460
Total wreck.

418
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,460
Hey, uh, what's...

419
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,720
What's wrong with her?

420
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
She's tensing up.

421
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
Decorticate posturing.

422
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,820
Can you hear me?

423
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,820
Excuse us.

424
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,890
Can you tell me your name?

425
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,400
Responds to pain.

426
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,230
All right, we're gonna

427
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,230
transfer on my count.

428
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,470
One, two, three.

429
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,440
Uh, she was complaining

430
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,440
about her stomach last night.

431
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,070
I told her it was, like,

432
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,070
uh, something that she ate.

433
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,410
It's okay.

434
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,410
Please give the doctor

435
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,740
some room to examine her.

436
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,210
Okay.

437
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,550
Clear breath

438
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,550
sounds bilaterally.

439
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,610
CBC, CMP, coags, and u-tox.

440
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,090
Nat, belly's soft.

441
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,620
All right, nasal airway

442
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,620
and a head CT.

443
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,390
And while we're there,

444
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,390
let's scan her C spine

445
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,390
and belly, okay?

446
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,450
We're on it.

447
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,930
All right, let's move her.

448
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,590
Look, I should have

449
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,590
brought her in last night.

450
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,130
Uh, why... Why is this

451
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,130
happening to her?

452
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,540
Look, we're gonna do

453
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,540
everything we can

454
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,010
to help your sister, okay?

455
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,340
She's lucky you found her

456
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,340
when you did.

457
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,140
I gotta, uh,

458
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,140
call my parents.

459
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,340
Sure.

460
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,540
This level of posturing...

461
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,980
Has to be some sort

462
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,980
of brain injury.

463
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,490
Yeah.

464
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,860
Thank you.

465
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,860
Uh, we're looking for

466
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,860
our daughter, Myra Adams.

467
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,190
Our son called.

468
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,190
Is she all right?

469
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,100
Come with me, please.

470
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,100
Dr. Manning, Dr. Choi.

471
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,930
These are Myra's parents.

472
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,370
What happened?

473
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,370
We talked to her two days ago.

474
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,370
She was fine.

475
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,600
Myra? Myra, honey!

476
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,660
Oh, please,

477
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,660
I'd like to see her.

478
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,240
Yes, of course, please.

479
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,740
Honey.

480
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,740
What's going on?

481
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,940
I don't know.

482
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,350
You poor baby.

483
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,590
Myra?

484
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,890
Honey? We're here.

485
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,010
What's wrong with her?

486
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,520
We don't know yet.

487
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,390
She collapsed in the bathroom

488
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,390
and hasn't regained

489
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,390
consciousness.

490
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,300
We don't think

491
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,300
it's a brain injury.

492
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,030
Myra's CT scans were clear.

493
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,900
Last month, her friends

494
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,900
brought her in to the ED.

495
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,830
Could that have something

496
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,830
to do with this?

497
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Honey, that doctor said

498
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
she was just dehydrated.

499
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,030
She, uh, got an IV.

500
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,030
She was, uh...

501
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,970
She was fine.

502
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,340
We checked her chart.

503
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,110
Back then, Myra's tox screen

504
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,110
and blood work

505
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,310
was normal, except

506
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,310
she was slightly anemic.

507
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,210
Same as now.

508
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,210
She vegetarian?

509
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,280
Vegan.

510
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,680
As long as I can remember.

511
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,250
Never liked meat.

512
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,660
Well, that would

513
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,660
explain the anemia.

514
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,680
Is there anything else

515
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,680
you can tell us?

516
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Uh, she, um...

517
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,590
What?

518
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,760
No, it's just, uh,

519
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,760
it was finals week,

520
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,960
so she wasn't

521
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,960
really, like, eating,

522
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,500
or sleeping much

523
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,500
at all.

524
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,470
She always worked so hard.

525
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,070
I tell her all the time,

526
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,070
she needs to rest.

527
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,970
How do you know all that?

528
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,880
I've been staying with her.

529
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,540
Since when?

530
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,380
Myra?

531
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,580
She's tachycardic

532
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,580
and tachypneic.

533
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,950
That means

534
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,950
her heart is racing

535
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,010
and she's having

536
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,010
trouble breathing.

537
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,080
We need to intubate her.

538
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,280
Please let the doctors

539
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,280
help her, okay?

540
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,790
My baby, no, oh, God.

541
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,790
Please, okay?

542
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,900
Let's get an EEG and LP,

543
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,520
an antibiotics and antiviral,

544
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,520
just in case.

545
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,590
Gram of Ceftriaxone,

546
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,230
500 milligrams Acyclovir.

547
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,930
Why is it happening? Why?

548
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,140
And lift.

549
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,810
I still would've

550
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,810
landed the grafts

551
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,810
more distal,

552
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,780
but your way worked, too.

553
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,890
I'll take that

554
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,890
as a "nice job."

555
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,950
Didn't know my approval

556
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,950
meant so much to you.

557
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,420
Always on, aren't you?

558
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,850
"Always on."

559
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,850
What does that mean?

560
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,790
Nothing.

561
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,790
It's just, um...

562
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,560
Steel sharpening steel.

563
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,000
Hmm, can't say

564
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm any more enlightened.

565
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,470
BP's falling.

566
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,470
We're in to the 80s.

567
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,840
Anterior lateral

568
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,840
ST elevations.

569
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,340
Damn it.

570
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,340
Cardiac ischemia.

571
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,310
One of your grafts

572
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,310
must have went down.

573
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,440
All right, get him back

574
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,440
on the table.

575
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,770
I'll go back in

576
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,770
to fix the graft.

577
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,840
No, we've already

578
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,840
broken down the room.

579
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,010
By the time we re-prep,

580
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,010
we'll have lost too much time.

581
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,410
IR's a better option.

582
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,250
What about

583
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,250
the hybrid room?

584
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,190
I have it booked for

585
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,190
a stenotic dialysis arm graft.

586
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,420
I'll bump it and cath Ray.

587
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,210
If I can't fix the issue

588
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,210
noninvasively,

589
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,090
room's already prepped

590
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,090
for us to reopen him up.

591
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,590
Dr. Rhodes?

592
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,960
It's a good idea.

593
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,230
Okay, let's go.

594
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,710
Myra's lumbar puncture

595
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,710
was negative.

596
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,900
There's no infection.

597
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,910
However, her EEG

598
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,910
was positive for seizures.

599
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,410
We've put her on Ativan,

600
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,410
but unfortunately,

601
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,410
they haven't subsided.

602
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,080
Myra's always been

603
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,080
so healthy.

604
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,450
I just don't understand.

605
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,420
But the Ativan,

606
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,420
it'll work, right?

607
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,120
Well, we're gonna do an MRI

608
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,120
to get a closer look

609
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,120
at her brain,

610
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,160
see if there's something

611
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,160
that the CT didn't pick up.

612
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,420
Oh, my God.

613
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,420
What... What's happening?

614
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,060
She's posturing again.

615
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,970
I'm afraid whatever's going on

616
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,970
in her brain is getting worse.

617
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,630
Her pupils are sluggish.

618
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,140
Bolus another five milligrams

619
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,140
of Ativan on top of the drip

620
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,610
and get her

621
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,610
up to MRI, quickly.

622
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,400
Hey, can I...

623
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,400
Can I go with her?

624
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,670
Sure.

625
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,670
No, no.

626
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,070
Eric, you stay with us.

627
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,850
I'm gonna order an echo,

628
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,850
check for heart vegetations.

629
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,110
You're thinking sepsis,

630
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,590
but her white blood cell count

631
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,590
was totally normal.

632
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,450
Everything was normal

633
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,450
the last time

634
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,450
she was here, too,

635
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,010
but she's back,

636
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,010
even worse than before.

637
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,650
Ethan, these two ED visits

638
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,650
could be totally unrelated.

639
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,390
No, I think they missed

640
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,390
something last time.

641
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,450
Missed what?

642
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,550
I don't know.

643
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,900
Don't beat

644
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,900
yourself up, Connor.

645
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,490
Grafts fail,

646
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,470
often in patients

647
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,470
with far less calcification

648
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,470
than Ray.

649
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,670
Doesn't make any sense.

650
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,710
I checked every graft

651
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,710
before I closed.

652
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,580
They were solid.

653
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,580
They still are.

654
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,050
Good flow through all

655
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,050
repaired vessels.

656
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,550
One, two, three.

657
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,950
The problem is here.

658
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,450
Clot of the left anterior

659
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,450
descending artery.

660
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,580
Likely a bad reaction

661
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,580
to the protamine

662
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,420
administered

663
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,420
during anesthesia.

664
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,750
Recommendations

665
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,750
on how to proceed?

666
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,020
Treat noninvasively

667
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,020
with heparin.

668
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,420
Thin the blood, let his heart

669
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,550
clear the clot out

670
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,550
on its own.

671
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,760
Too conservative.

672
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,760
Clot's already stopped up

673
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,760
the vessel.

674
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,820
The LAD is the widow-maker.

675
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,960
If it's down much longer,

676
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,960
Ray's not coming back.

677
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,830
We've got to suck it out.

678
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,600
I agree with Dr. Bekker.

679
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,080
Thrombo-aspiration,

680
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,080
though the riskier procedure,

681
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,840
ensures complete removal

682
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,840
of the blockage.

683
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,000
Excuse me, Dr. Rhodes.

684
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,690
Alex's tox screen's

685
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,690
negative for methamphetamine.

686
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,450
Negative for all drugs,

687
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,450
in fact, he's clean.

688
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,050
Yeah, I saw the report.

689
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,360
So now can we start him

690
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,360
on a course

691
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,360
of anti-psychotics?

692
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,990
I'm just still not convinced

693
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,990
it's schizophrenia.

694
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,860
How? He's presented with

695
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,860
more than enough evidence

696
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,860
of a thought disorder

697
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,090
to warrant the diagnosis.

698
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,570
Yeah, but even so,

699
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,570
before today,

700
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,160
I mean,

701
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,160
his medical record's clean.

702
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,170
History doesn't track

703
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,170
with schizophrenia.

704
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,770
Or meth addiction.

705
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
He doesn't fit the profile

706
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
of a user, either.

707
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,640
Just 'cause he's clean today,

708
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,640
doesn't mean he's free

709
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,640
of the drug.

710
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,440
So that's what the fan

711
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,440
is for?

712
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,310
White noise, Dr. Charles?

713
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,310
Really?

714
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,910
Yes, really.

715
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,920
White noise

716
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,920
has been proven to trigger

717
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,920
auditory hallucinations

718
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,250
in meth users.

719
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,050
How long have you

720
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,050
been waiting

721
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,110
for something to happen?

722
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,660
Hmm, seven or eight minutes.

723
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,590
How long does it

724
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,590
usually take?

725
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,830
Two or three.

726
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,960
Probably not meth.

727
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,960
Go ahead,

728
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,960
start anti-psychotics.

729
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,300
Two of Haldol.

730
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,740
Dr. Charles...

731
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,510
Oh, my God.

732
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,050
Alex. Get his hand,

733
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,050
get his hand!

734
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,650
I needed it gone.

735
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,650
Just see... Wait!

736
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,780
Help!

737
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,780
We need some help in here!

738
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,380
What happened?

739
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,830
He used a pen

740
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,830
to pop the stitches

741
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,090
and chisel through

742
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,090
his abdominal wall.

743
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,390
Clearly.

744
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,430
All right, no time to repack.

745
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,430
Got to scoop and move.

746
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,430
Saline.

747
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,730
Okay, call OR. Tell them

748
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,730
we're coming immediately.

749
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,860
Let's go!

750
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,540
Okay, go, go, go!

751
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,750
Hmm, sweet potato

752
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,750
or quinoa?

753
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,950
Noah's menu.

754
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,020
Why don't you feed yourself

755
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,860
before the next wave of orders

756
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,860
come down?

757
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,420
You've been ripping

758
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,420
and running all day.

759
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,720
Exactly why I need

760
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,720
to get this done now.

761
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,200
Dr. Manning?

762
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,200
Yes.

763
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,460
We think we know

764
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,460
what might have caused this.

765
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,530
Eric.

766
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,130
Myra got sick

767
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,130
while he was

768
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,130
staying with her.

769
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,470
We never wanted him

770
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,470
around our daughter.

771
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,030
He's a bad influence.

772
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,030
He never applied himself.

773
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,100
He's the opposite of Myra.

774
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,740
No job, hangs out with

775
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,740
a bunch of deadbeats.

776
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,780
We kicked him out because

777
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,780
he was stealing from us.

778
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,580
He takes drugs.

779
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,410
I'm sorry.

780
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,410
I'm... I'm not following.

781
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,890
He probably slipped

782
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,890
her something.

783
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,120
A drug of some sort.

784
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,560
There's no evidence of that.

785
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,780
Well, are you sure?

786
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,780
Because if you knew

787
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,780
what it was...

788
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,450
I understand that this is

789
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,450
a very difficult time,

790
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,450
but the best thing

791
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,450
we can do right now

792
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,120
is wait for the MRI

793
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,120
to come back.

794
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,790
And I promise,

795
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,790
as soon as we hear anything,

796
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,170
you will be the first

797
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,170
to know.

798
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,790
Okay?

799
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,200
All right.

800
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,240
They're blaming Eric

801
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,240
for this?

802
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,440
How is this his fault?

803
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,710
They're desperate,

804
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,710
looking for answers,

805
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,870
and we don't know

806
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,870
the whole story.

807
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,980
Family dynamics

808
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,980
can be complicated.

809
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,540
Doesn't matter.

810
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,540
It's family.

811
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,410
It's blood.

812
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,410
Time like this,

813
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,550
they should be

814
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,550
banding together,

815
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,490
not ostracizing

816
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,490
one of their own.

817
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,590
I'd expect you to say that.

818
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,990
This again? Really?

819
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,550
Here we go.

820
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,700
You've got a soft spot

821
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,700
for family,

822
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,560
sometimes at your own expense.

823
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,730
Planning meals for Noah

824
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,730
when you're slammed at work,

825
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,730
for example.

826
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,770
Helping my brother

827
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,770
when he's exhausted,

828
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,400
that's a bad thing

829
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,400
in your eyes?

830
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
The day I turned 18,

831
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
it was sink-or-swim.

832
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,920
Noah's a grown man, April.

833
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,380
You're not doing him

834
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,380
any favors

835
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,110
by constantly picking up

836
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,110
his slack.

837
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,590
Some point,

838
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,590
we've all got to learn

839
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,590
to go it alone.

840
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,560
I'd expect you to say that.

841
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,040
All right,

842
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,040
think we're there.

843
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,410
Vacuuming.

844
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,700
Got it.

845
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,410
Ah, blood flow's good.

846
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,050
BP's holding.

847
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,650
Nice job.

848
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,720
Thanks.

849
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,750
Look, I know I have

850
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,750
a tendency to step on toes,

851
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,590
not personal.

852
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,590
I just want to...

853
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,650
Win?

854
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,990
What happened?

855
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,970
Artery ruptured.

856
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,970
Blood is pouring

857
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,970
into his chest.

858
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,940
Blood flow was blocked,

859
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,940
and now it's out of control.

860
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,240
All right, help me

861
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,240
stent the leak

862
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,800
before he arrests.

863
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,800
Where's the rupture?

864
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,470
Distal LAD.

865
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,470
Are you kidding?

866
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,530
That's not even

867
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,530
where the clot was.

868
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,050
It's an entirely different

869
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,050
section of vessel.

870
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
Murphy's Law.

871
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,490
How's he doing?

872
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,900
A few more feet to go,

873
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,900
but no perforations

874
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,900
to the bowel.

875
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,360
I was just standing there.

876
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,070
Meanwhile,

877
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,070
he was ripping himself open

878
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,660
with a pen? Wait.

879
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,600
The extra Versed.

880
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,330
It completely

881
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,330
tranqed him out.

882
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,000
But if I hadn't

883
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,000
given it to him, who knows?

884
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,050
I mean, Alex was intent

885
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,050
on harming himself.

886
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,580
He could have attacked

887
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,580
one of us.

888
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,150
What the hell?

889
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,080
There's something embedded

890
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,080
deep in his left gutter,

891
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,280
next to the colon.

892
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,420
What is it?

893
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,930
I have no idea.

894
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,460
Did you see this?

895
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,460
Myra's MRI.

896
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,030
Global edema in the brain.

897
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,930
Two hours ago,

898
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,930
there was no sign of swelling.

899
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,070
Echo was clean, too.

900
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,070
It's not sepsis.

901
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,770
Or encephalitis, meningitis,

902
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,250
HSV, CMV.

903
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,350
We need to brainstorm zebras.

904
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,950
Paraneoplastic syndrome?

905
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,950
Usually presents with a fever,

906
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,950
but there could be

907
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,950
cancer cells

908
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,950
in her spinal fluid.

909
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,810
Or another autoimmune,

910
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,810
lupus,

911
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,760
sarcoid,

912
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,760
some kind of tumor.

913
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,290
What about

914
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,290
FilmArray PCR tests?

915
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,890
I'll draw paraneoplastic

916
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,890
and autoimmune panels.

917
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,230
Have the lab

918
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,230
put a rush on 'em.

919
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,290
I'll talk to hem-onc,

920
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,290
get bone and PET scans.

921
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,660
Okay.

922
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,400
Myra's mom says

923
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,400
she's been busting her ass

924
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,800
for this fellowship

925
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,800
in New Zealand.

926
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,800
She got it.

927
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,540
She's just

928
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,540
starting her life.

929
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,610
We keep testing

930
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,610
till we find out

931
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,610
what's wrong.

932
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,240
Yeah.

933
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,250
Dr. Halstead,

934
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,250
I've been reviewing

935
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,250
your write-up

936
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,450
of our self-surgery patient,

937
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,450
Alex.

938
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,780
Not bad, but I think

939
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,190
some small additions

940
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,190
to the chart are in order.

941
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,720
Additions?

942
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,490
Perhaps "elaborations"

943
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,490
is the better word.

944
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,820
Regarding the initial intake,

945
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,820
you noted,

946
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,300
"Wound lavaged and closed."

947
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,300
I was there.

948
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,730
It was a little more

949
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,730
than that.

950
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,930
I think we should say,

951
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,930
"We lavaged and irrigated

952
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,930
with chlorhexidine

953
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,000
"and two liters

954
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,000
of normal saline." Okay?

955
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,770
"Six-inch lacerations

956
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,770
repaired in two layers

957
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,370
"with 60 interrupted

958
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,240
"2-0 nylon sutures."

959
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,140
You don't think that's

960
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,140
overdoing it a little bit?

961
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,820
Absolutely not.

962
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,820
This is exactly what we did.

963
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,350
So you'll adjust?

964
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,720
Yes?

965
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,720
Yes.

966
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,510
Residence charts, too.

967
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,880
Yes.

968
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,160
Good man.

969
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
The art of charting.

970
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,300
The one thing

971
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,300
I didn't learn

972
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,300
in residency.

973
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,170
I'll look them over.

974
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,000
Thanks.

975
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,200
I don't understand.

976
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,580
What are you...

977
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,580
What are you saying?

978
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,080
We did what's called

979
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,080
a nuclear blood

980
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,080
flow study

981
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,480
and it showed no circulation

982
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,480
to her brain.

983
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,580
Well, there must be

984
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,580
some other test you can run.

985
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,050
They've all been negative.

986
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,190
Something else you can do.

987
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,820
I'm sorry.

988
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,820
There isn't.

989
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,670
We've done everything we can,

990
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,600
but unfortunately,

991
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,600
your daughter is brain-dead.

992
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,700
No.

993
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,760
No.

994
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,600
Okay.

995
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,140
Our little girl.

996
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,140
I'm so sorry...

997
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,200
No, no,

998
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,200
no, no, no.

999
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,610
She's gonna wake up.

1000
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,610
She's gonna be fine.

1001
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,680
Myra? Myra...

1002
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,450
My baby.

1003
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,490
Myra.

1004
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,420
She's gone, sweetie.

1005
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,520
Your little girl's gone.

1006
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,450
We'll give you

1007
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,450
some time with her.

1008
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,820
No. Our baby.

1009
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,890
Oh, baby.

1010
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,540
Excuse me.

1011
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,540
Mr. Adams.

1012
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,180
Our daughter was always

1013
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,180
doing things for other people.

1014
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,420
She told us if anything

1015
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,420
ever happened to her,

1016
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,120
she, uh,

1017
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,390
wanted to donate her organs.

1018
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,890
Of course.

1019
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,300
We'll get that started.

1020
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,320
We want her life

1021
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,320
to have meant something.

1022
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,370
We understand.

1023
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,900
Thank you.

1024
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,900
Of course.

1025
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,900
You're high.

1026
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,900
Look at you!

1027
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,970
You're high.

1028
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,640
Your sister's dead

1029
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,640
and you're high!

1030
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,210
Wait, Myra's, uh, de...

1031
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,480
She's dead?

1032
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,610
Ah...

1033
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,780
This is your fault,

1034
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,780
isn't it?

1035
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,250
You did this.

1036
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,950
See?

1037
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,950
I told you he is no good.

1038
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,620
He is a drug addict.

1039
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,160
What did you give her?

1040
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,050
Nothing.

1041
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,400
We told you.

1042
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,400
Myra's tox screen

1043
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,400
was negative.

1044
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,670
You worthless piece of...

1045
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,210
Oh.

1046
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,210
Whoa.

1047
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,300
Get out.

1048
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,940
Get out!

1049
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,590
He's moving

1050
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,590
in the wrong direction.

1051
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,130
He'll turn around.

1052
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,000
Your optimism

1053
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,000
is enchanting.

1054
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,570
Reality, though,

1055
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,570
between the clot,

1056
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,570
then the bleed,

1057
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,070
his heart is dying.

1058
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,070
We should push

1059
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,070
for a transplant.

1060
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,010
We're only

1061
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,010
a few hours post-op.

1062
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,510
We are miles away

1063
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,510
from that discussion.

1064
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,500
Normally, yes,

1065
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,610
but a hit-and-run

1066
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,610
just died in surgery.

1067
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,920
His heart is an HLA match.

1068
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,580
You already tested

1069
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,580
for compatibility?

1070
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,850
Ray's not even on the list.

1071
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,860
Anything that could go wrong

1072
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,860
with Ray has.

1073
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,590
We fix one thing,

1074
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,590
something else breaks.

1075
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,350
A heart has fallen

1076
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,350
into our laps.

1077
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,020
Let's use it

1078
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,020
and steal a win.

1079
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,030
Is that our priority?

1080
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,630
You want his death

1081
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,630
on your record?

1082
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,960
Dr. Bekker, you may have

1083
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,960
elbowed your way

1084
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,970
onto Ray's case,

1085
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,970
but he's still my patient.

1086
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,100
Transplant's not an option.

1087
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,340
Then you're just

1088
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,340
wasting time,

1089
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,840
because the balloon pump

1090
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,840
he's on won't hold.

1091
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,880
He'll max out on pressors

1092
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,880
but he'll still need

1093
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,880
to go on VA-ECMO.

1094
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,110
Then it gets invasive,

1095
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,650
a procedure

1096
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,650
for a temporary LVAD.

1097
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,010
When that's not enough,

1098
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,580
a bigger procedure

1099
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,580
for a permanent one.

1100
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,680
You're going to put Ray

1101
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,680
through months of

1102
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,920
physical and emotional strain,

1103
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,920
only to get back

1104
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,580
to exactly where

1105
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,580
we are right now.

1106
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,930
Ray's arteries were bad,

1107
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,930
not his heart.

1108
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,460
Now that the vessels

1109
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,460
are repaired,

1110
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,090
it will compensate

1111
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,090
for the clot and the bleed.

1112
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,690
It'll heal.

1113
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,160
No, it won't.

1114
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,070
And when I'm right,

1115
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,430
I'll make sure the blame

1116
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,430
is on you, not me.

1117
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,840
Wow.

1118
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,940
I guess there was something

1119
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,940
living inside Alex.

1120
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,620
I'm still not exactly sure

1121
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,620
what I'm looking at.

1122
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,120
Is it a tumor?

1123
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,410
Possibly.

1124
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,520
Or it could be

1125
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,520
a fetus in fetu,

1126
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,000
a twin that he absorbed

1127
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,000
in utero.

1128
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,090
Either way,

1129
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,760
it's not a result

1130
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,760
of schizophrenia or meth.

1131
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,160
How about that?

1132
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,890
That's gotta be so rare.

1133
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,600
To say the least.

1134
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,400
It's very cool.

1135
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,600
Hmm.

1136
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,220
But how did he know,

1137
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,220
not only that there was

1138
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,220
something inside him,

1139
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,440
but exactly where it was?

1140
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,320
Beats me.

1141
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,320
And after all the advances

1142
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,320
we've made,

1143
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,750
splicing the genome,

1144
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,750
reprogramming viruses,

1145
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,810
mapping the brain...

1146
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,120
In this case, you know,

1147
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,120
just completely trumped

1148
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,120
by human instinct.

1149
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,920
Everything I've learned

1150
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,920
about human nature,

1151
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,160
I still can't

1152
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,160
see things coming.

1153
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,160
He scared you?

1154
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,110
There's risk in our work.

1155
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,970
I guess I realized

1156
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,970
a long time ago,

1157
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,640
you... You choose to see

1158
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,640
the threat

1159
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,650
or the opportunity.

1160
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,330
Hey, Eric.

1161
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,210
Hey, uh, listen,

1162
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,210
the last thing that I need

1163
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,210
right now is a lecture.

1164
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,640
Hey, I'm here for me

1165
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,640
as much as I am for you.

1166
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,280
What happened back there,

1167
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,320
sometimes

1168
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,320
when people are grieving,

1169
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,320
they lash out.

1170
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,410
Yeah, no, that's...

1171
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,970
That's how my folks

1172
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,970
always are.

1173
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,350
Man, they think I'm, uh...

1174
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,350
I'm worthless.

1175
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,660
I don't know.

1176
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,660
Maybe I am,

1177
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,390
but they think

1178
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,390
I want to be like this,

1179
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,930
and I really don't.

1180
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,000
Uh, you know, Myra,

1181
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,000
she was the only one

1182
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,000
who ever, like...

1183
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,130
Like, really,

1184
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,130
like, saw me.

1185
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,770
You know?

1186
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,200
Yeah.

1187
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,710
And now it's...

1188
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,020
What do you want, Eric?

1189
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,750
I want to get clean.

1190
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
You know, I wanna, like,

1191
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
wake up

1192
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,650
and just feel clear.

1193
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,960
Okay.

1194
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,260
We'll set you up

1195
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,260
with a social worker,

1196
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,460
get you in a program.

1197
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,900
Wha... Seriously?

1198
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,430
Yeah.

1199
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,560
You'll get the support

1200
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,560
you need,

1201
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,230
but it's up to you

1202
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,230
to come through.

1203
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,500
Why are you

1204
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,500
doing this for me?

1205
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,480
I guess I'm seeing that

1206
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,480
there's a difference

1207
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,570
between a crutch

1208
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,570
and a helping hand.

1209
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,610
Thank you.

1210
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,980
Yeah.

1211
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,090
Let's get you something

1212
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,090
to eat first, huh?

1213
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,250
Help you come down.

1214
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,390
No, no,

1215
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,390
I had a burger earlier.

1216
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,830
Uh, it made me, like,

1217
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,830
feel really sick.

1218
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,460
It's why I...

1219
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,460
I had to get high.

1220
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,970
You know, not to...

1221
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,970
Not to feel it.

1222
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,140
Maybe food poisoning?

1223
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
Uh, no, I just...

1224
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,100
I just felt crappy,

1225
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,910
like I always do.

1226
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,020
Always,

1227
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,020
or just after eating?

1228
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,390
Hey.

1229
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,800
Oh, you again.

1230
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,590
Yeah, last guy

1231
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,590
only had a hangnail.

1232
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,000
Brought him in anyway.

1233
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,330
Okay.

1234
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,930
Crew's meeting

1235
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,930
at Molly's tonight.

1236
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,270
Come and hang?

1237
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,440
This sudden flirting...

1238
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,600
What is it?

1239
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,640
Have you seen you?

1240
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,700
You're still a catch.

1241
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,610
I always have been.

1242
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,040
You should've thought

1243
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,040
about that before you cheated.

1244
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,390
I'm not

1245
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,390
the same guy anymore.

1246
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,150
Hmm.

1247
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,720
Barry up to something?

1248
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,060
I'm not sure.

1249
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,330
Yeah, right.

1250
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,330
This round two?

1251
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,060
Too much baggage.

1252
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,760
Mmm-hmm.

1253
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,760
Make him work for it.

1254
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,830
Mmm.

1255
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,670
Can I help you

1256
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,670
with something?

1257
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,510
No, I'm just giving

1258
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,510
today's charts a once-over.

1259
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,370
Ugh, well,

1260
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,370
you better settle in.

1261
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,450
Some of them

1262
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,450
are a few chapters long.

1263
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,440
Stohl's five-minute

1264
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,440
knee aspiration

1265
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,040
reads like War and Peace.

1266
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,780
Hey, Nat,

1267
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,780
I was speaking with Eric.

1268
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,220
The drugs,

1269
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,220
he's self-medicating.

1270
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,550
Since he was a kid,

1271
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,620
he's gotten sick

1272
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,620
after eating protein.

1273
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,130
Myra was a vegan,

1274
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,130
avoided protein.

1275
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,790
You're thinking that's

1276
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,790
what made her sick, too?

1277
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,730
Last month, when Myra

1278
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,730
was feeling confused,

1279
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,560
she was fasting

1280
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,560
while studying.

1281
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,230
Ketosis.

1282
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,660
Her body was starving,

1283
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,070
so it started digesting

1284
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,070
muscle as fuel,

1285
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,000
which released protein

1286
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,000
into her blood.

1287
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,940
Okay, well, that explains

1288
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,940
what made her sick last month,

1289
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,070
but what about today?

1290
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,070
The fellowship.

1291
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,150
She probably

1292
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,150
wasn't eating again.

1293
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,270
I think this is OTC,

1294
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,270
a metabolic disorder fits.

1295
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,870
You were right.

1296
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,870
The visits were connected.

1297
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,280
Yeah.

1298
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,280
Wait.

1299
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,980
Did they transplant

1300
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,980
the liver yet?

1301
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,350
It's still up in the OR.

1302
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,350
They can't use it.

1303
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
If Myra had OTC,

1304
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
she couldn't

1305
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
break down nitrogen.

1306
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,060
So it built up in her body

1307
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,060
as ammonia

1308
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,390
and finally

1309
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,390
put her in a coma.

1310
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,060
And if the liver

1311
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,060
gets transplanted...

1312
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,430
Same thing will happen

1313
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,430
to the recipient.

1314
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,130
Is the transplant finished?

1315
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,240
No, the last surgery

1316
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,240
ran late.

1317
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,840
They moved the transplant

1318
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,840
to OR 3.

1319
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,000
Come on.

1320
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,900
Okay...

1321
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,710
Stop!

1322
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,710
What the hell?

1323
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,770
Liver might not be good.

1324
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,840
The biopsy was clean.

1325
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,010
It's a genetic defect.

1326
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,010
It wouldn't show up

1327
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,010
on the biopsy.

1328
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,560
I got my patient

1329
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,560
wide open, Choi.

1330
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,020
You transplant that liver,

1331
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,020
he could be dead

1332
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,020
within hours.

1333
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,820
We need time to test

1334
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,820
the donor's blood,

1335
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,560
see if she had OTC.

1336
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I'll pack and hold,

1337
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,960
but the donor's liver's

1338
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,960
only got four hours

1339
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,130
till it's shot,

1340
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,130
so move it.

1341
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,610
A metabolic disorder

1342
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,610
caused her death?

1343
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,340
The precise term is

1344
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,340
"ornithine transcarbamylase

1345
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,340
deficiency,"

1346
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,410
or OTC.

1347
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,420
You see, Myra's liver

1348
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,420
was missing a vital enzyme

1349
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,760
that helps

1350
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,760
break down protein.

1351
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,860
Something as simple

1352
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,860
as eating a burger

1353
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,620
could cause toxic levels

1354
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,620
of ammonia

1355
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,690
to build up in her blood

1356
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,690
and attack her nervous system.

1357
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,870
But Myra was a vegan.

1358
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,340
Which is how she was able

1359
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,340
to avoid symptoms

1360
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,340
for so long,

1361
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,870
but when she pushed herself,

1362
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,870
and didn't eat...

1363
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,510
Finals, the fellowship...

1364
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,700
Her body started

1365
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,700
breaking down muscle,

1366
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,140
which released protein

1367
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,140
into her blood.

1368
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,580
So, you mean,

1369
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,170
she'd be alive right now

1370
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,170
if she'd just...

1371
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,370
eaten?

1372
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,720
If this disease

1373
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,720
is genetic,

1374
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,960
that means one of us

1375
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,960
gave it to her.

1376
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,400
Yes, um, it is passed

1377
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,400
through the X chromosome,

1378
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,130
from mother to child, but...

1379
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,700
OTC sufferers exhibit

1380
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,700
totally normal liver function.

1381
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,210
That's why

1382
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,210
all of Myra's tests

1383
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,210
came back clean.

1384
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,110
We were only able

1385
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,110
to diagnose her

1386
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,110
once Eric explained

1387
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,310
his lethargy and sickness

1388
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,310
after eating.

1389
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,680
We believe he has

1390
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,680
the defect as well,

1391
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,580
and he's been self-medicating

1392
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,580
with drugs.

1393
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,810
Wha...

1394
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,520
Oh...

1395
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,660
Eric...

1396
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,860
Is this true?

1397
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,130
I'm so sorry.

1398
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,190
Oh, son...

1399
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,690
Forgive us?

1400
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,170
Will you forgive us?

1401
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,430
We're so sorry.

1402
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,900
Oh, Eric.

1403
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,120
So, how's our patient?

1404
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,120
Heading for ECMO?

1405
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,790
Actually, no.

1406
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,950
Uh, BP's risen

1407
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,950
and is holding,

1408
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,220
vitals have stabilized

1409
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,220
as well,

1410
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,160
so I'm going

1411
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,160
to remove the balloon pump

1412
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,360
and give his heart back

1413
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,360
its full load.

1414
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,730
What do you want,

1415
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,730
an "I was wrong"?

1416
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,900
I'm not holding my breath.

1417
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,780
Ah, I see our patient

1418
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,780
is making a turn

1419
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,780
for the better.

1420
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,780
For a moment,

1421
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,780
there was concern

1422
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,780
the damage was irreparable.

1423
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,080
A transplant option

1424
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,080
presented itself,

1425
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,240
but upon discussing

1426
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,240
the visual assessment

1427
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,980
of the heart during surgery,

1428
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,320
the decision was made

1429
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,320
to give it more time

1430
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,980
to come back on its own.

1431
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,550
It was a risk,

1432
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,550
but it appears

1433
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,550
we made the right choice.

1434
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,390
Indeed.

1435
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,060
Nice work, Doctors.

1436
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,670
Thank you.

1437
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,740
You and Dr. Bekker,

1438
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,470
your successes

1439
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,470
suggest a good pairing,

1440
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,470
but your...

1441
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,950
exchanges often convey

1442
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,950
the opposite.

1443
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,140
What's peculiar is Dr. Bekker

1444
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,140
seems to enjoy this...

1445
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,880
discordance.

1446
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,180
Do you?

1447
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,990
Maybe I do.

1448
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,060
You okay?

1449
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,310
We turned this hospital

1450
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,310
upside-down chasing zebras,

1451
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,320
but a simple ammonia test

1452
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,320
would've given us everything

1453
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,320
we needed to know.

1454
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,870
There's no way

1455
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,870
you could've known.

1456
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,180
Silver lining,

1457
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,180
the liver transplant

1458
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,180
was stopped

1459
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,690
before it was too late,

1460
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,880
and thanks to you,

1461
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,050
Eric's getting the help

1462
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,050
he needs.

1463
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,000
I may coddle my family,

1464
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,090
but seems

1465
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,090
I'm not the only one

1466
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,090
with a soft spot.

1467
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,640
Yes, yes, yes.

1468
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,080
Wonderful, Dr. Halstead.

1469
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,280
Above and beyond.

1470
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,280
Excellent medicine,

1471
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,010
and no red ink

1472
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,010
for the ED.

1473
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,880
It's been a good day.

1474
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,720
We're gonna

1475
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,720
turn this place around.

1476
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,890
He more happy

1477
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,890
about the work,

1478
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,890
or the bill?

1479
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,060
So I guess the rumors

1480
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,060
are true.

1481
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,770
This morning's board meeting

1482
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,770
was basically an edict

1483
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
to shake the old money tree?

1484
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,000
Ah, nothing that hasn't

1485
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,000
come down the pipe before.

1486
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,230
I'm handling it.

1487
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,970
And these itemized charts

1488
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,970
that Stohl's championing?

1489
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,270
I mean,

1490
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,270
detail equals charges, right?

1491
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,950
Basically a menu

1492
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,950
for Billing

1493
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,950
to pad the invoices?

1494
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,180
Well, I've looked

1495
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,180
at every chart coming out

1496
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,180
of the ED today.

1497
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,120
Each one has been accurate

1498
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,120
to the services provided.

1499
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,920
Well, I should hope

1500
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,920
he's not committing fraud.

1501
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,930
I mean, the fact that

1502
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,930
you even had to check...

1503
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,590
Look, Sharon.

1504
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,160
You set the tone,

1505
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,160
so if you're okay with it,

1506
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,220
well, then, it must...

1507
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,670
The numbers are clear.

1508
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,560
If I don't improve

1509
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,560
the bottom line,

1510
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,070
the board

1511
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,070
will start slashing.

1512
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,100
Do you want to see

1513
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,100
the ED closed,

1514
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,100
or contracted out?

1515
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,480
Because that's what'll happen.

1516
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,480
No, of course not,

1517
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,740
but I also don't wanna see

1518
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,740
the bottom line

1519
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,740
dictating patient care.

1520
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,110
Well, let me

1521
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,110
tell you something.

1522
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,060
Psych is the biggest

1523
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,060
money-loser in the ED.

1524
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,550
You, Daniel,

1525
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,550
are a major part

1526
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,550
of our problem,

1527
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,920
so don't get on the soapbox

1528
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,920
with me.

1529
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,630
You seen Natalie?

1530
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,070
She's in the doctor's lounge.

1531
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,030
Oh, she told me that you had

1532
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,030
a hot date planned tonight.

1533
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,640
Mmm-hmm.

1534
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,640
And I'm even

1535
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,640
gonna shave.

1536
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,480
No. The things

1537
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,480
we do for love.

1538
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,170
Hey.

1539
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,170
Day like today... Mmm.

1540
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,110
Tell me about it.

1541
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,280
You make

1542
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,280
a really nice pillow.

1543
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,820
Your hot date?

1544
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,890
Nice.

1545
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,310
Hi.

1546
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Dirty Martini.

1547
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,850
Extra olives.

1548
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,660
You remember

1549
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,660
the important things.

1550
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,030
Wasn't sure you'd show.

1551
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,760
Well, don't get

1552
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,760
ahead of yourself.

1553
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,200
You say that you've changed.

1554
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,700
We'll see.

1555
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,700
Thank you.

1556
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,740
April,

1557
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,730
I'll be there

1558
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,730
in 10 minutes.

1559
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,830
Okay.
