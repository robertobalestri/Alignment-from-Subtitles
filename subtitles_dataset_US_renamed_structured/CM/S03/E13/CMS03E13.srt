1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,230
Another 3-0 Prolene.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,230
Here.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,230
Homestretch, Peter.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,380
Just finishing up

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,380
the aortic connection.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,000
Then we'll start you back up.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,740
Talk to the patient

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,740
while they're out,

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,380
that's a new one.

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,640
It's a nice touch.

11
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,640
Actually, not new.

12
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,650
Just the first time

13
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,650
you've noticed.

14
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,380
Thought I'd made more of

15
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,380
an impression on you.

16
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,650
The way you can turn

17
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,650
a compliment into a dig,

18
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,520
it's quite the skill,

19
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,520
Dr. Bekker.

20
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,420
Don't be so sensitive,

21
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,420
Dr. Rhodes.

22
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,560
Okay, donor heart

23
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,560
is fully attached.

24
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,030
All right.

25
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,030
Let's get the pacer leads on.

26
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,230
100 beats per minute, Marty.

27
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,230
We're set.

28
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,930
Okay then, turn it on.

29
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,950
Excellent contractility in

30
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,950
the left and right ventricles.

31
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,780
No distension.

32
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,780
Healthy color.

33
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,320
Take off bypass?

34
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,820
Looks like this one's

35
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,820
going to take, Peter.

36
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,180
There's no better sight,

37
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,180
is there, Dr. Bekker?

38
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,950
Can't argue with that.

39
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,060
No, no, no!

40
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,060
Losing color. It's cyanotic.

41
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,830
Global contractility's

42
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,830
way down.

43
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,660
Left and right ventricles

44
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,660
severely distended.

45
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,030
Hyperacute rejection.

46
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,330
Donor heart's failing.

47
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,330
We need to get it out now.

48
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,270
Damn it.

49
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,270
Okay, back on bypass.

50
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,450
Okay, Peter obviously goes

51
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,450
back on the transplant list,

52
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,290
but for right now,

53
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,290
I only see two options:

54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,090
ECMO or an artificial heart.

55
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,090
ECMO's quick and easy.

56
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,390
Peter's on bypass, so the

57
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,390
cannulas are already in place.

58
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,760
Downside, he'd be confined to

59
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,760
the ICU and likely intubated.

60
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm leaning artificial.

61
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,000
That is a huge surgery.

62
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,090
Peter's already been on

63
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,090
the table for over four hours.

64
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,940
The risk of complications,

65
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,940
especially stroke?

66
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,980
But if all goes well,

67
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,980
he could get out of bed,

68
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,570
walk around,

69
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,570
maybe even go home.

70
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,410
Peter waited a year

71
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,410
for his first donor heart,

72
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,850
two and a half

73
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,850
for the one that just failed.

74
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,380
There's no telling

75
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,380
how long the next will take.

76
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,540
Then I guess you really

77
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,540
only have one option.

78
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,250
It's Peter's wife, Jane.

79
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,990
Not the post-op conversation

80
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,990
I was planning for.

81
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,390
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Halstead

82
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,390
called from the E.D.

83
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,990
while you were in surgery,

84
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,660
asked that you find him

85
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,660
the moment you're free.

86
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,200
Thank you.

87
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,200
Mmm.

88
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,070
It's Dan Kennet,

89
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,070
my giant-cell

90
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,070
myocarditis patient.

91
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,570
He's back.

92
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,570
Go. I've got this.

93
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,340
All right.

94
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,880
April, this thing tonight,

95
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,880
how big we talking?

96
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,440
It's my little cousin's

97
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,440
15th birthday, okay?

98
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,950
It's gonna be

99
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,950
some of her friends,

100
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,010
a few family members, low-key.

101
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,750
Yeah, right.

102
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,750
You always say that.

103
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,950
Then I get there

104
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,950
and it's Carnaval.

105
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,890
In Brazilian culture,

106
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,650
fifteen's a huge birthday

107
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,650
for a girl.

108
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,960
Baile de Debutante.

109
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,460
Uh, did you Google that?

110
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,460
Yeah.

111
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,760
Okay, that's really cute.

112
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,370
Oh, are you gonna

113
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,370
bring your sister?

114
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,230
I wasn't planning on it.

115
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,830
Come on, you guys

116
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,830
have been talking.

117
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,340
Things are going well, right?

118
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,640
Yeah, but Emily's always

119
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,640
been kind of a wild card.

120
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,200
I don't wanna spend

121
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,200
the whole night worrying

122
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,710
she'll do something

123
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,710
to offend your family.

124
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,270
Plus, she probably

125
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,270
has a poker game.

126
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,710
Lame.

127
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,380
All right,

128
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,380
I'm not gonna push.

129
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,280
I'd really like

130
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,280
to meet her, though.

131
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,450
You will.

132
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,020
One day.

133
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,760
He fainted?

134
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,850
Yeah, getting out

135
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,850
of the shower.

136
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,260
When I pressed for details,

137
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,990
he confessed to being

138
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,990
light-headed all week.

139
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,090
Labs?

140
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,820
Yeah, troponin's

141
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,820
way too high.

142
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,630
Left ventricular

143
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,630
ejection fraction is 10%.

144
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,670
I've been treating Dan

145
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,670
for six months.

146
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,070
Steroids, calcium

147
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,070
channel blockers,

148
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,670
ace inhibitors, beta blockers,

149
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,740
no matter what I try,

150
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,740
he just keeps getting worse.

151
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,250
Where is he

152
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,250
on the transplant list?

153
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,840
Way too low.

154
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,810
Don't let him give up.

155
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,180
Aww.

156
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,150
Hey, Dan. Hey, Sheila.

157
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,750
Hey. We're back too soon.

158
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,360
Listen, Dan,

159
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,360
your heart is failing,

160
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,230
so I'm going to

161
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,230
adjust the meds

162
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,230
that you're already on

163
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,240
and add IV dobutamine.

164
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,700
IV?

165
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,970
Guess I'm not

166
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,970
going home today, am I?

167
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,640
Yeah, we've gotta

168
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,640
get the inflammation

169
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,380
of your heart muscle

170
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,380
under control.

171
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,150
How long in the ICU?

172
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,250
I'm not sure, I'm sorry.

173
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,580
Hey, little B.

174
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,520
Hi.

175
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,290
The hospital has

176
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,290
a daycare center.

177
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,230
I can, uh, call...

178
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,230
No, no.

179
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,330
Having them close keeps me...

180
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,330
Keeps my spirits up.

181
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,630
Good. That's what we want.

182
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,170
I'll see you guys soon,

183
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,170
all right?

184
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,500
All right.

185
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,010
Hey, take it from

186
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,010
the old guy,

187
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,820
ease up or you get

188
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,820
a bunch of these.

189
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,420
What are you grinding on?

190
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,520
My dad asked me

191
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,520
to cosign on a loan.

192
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,750
Huh.

193
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,690
Northwestern offered him

194
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,690
a tenure-track position.

195
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,920
He's gonna buy

196
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,920
a place in Chicago.

197
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,190
Isn't that great news?

198
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,190
Yeah.

199
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,770
I can get through the most

200
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,770
arcane medical jargon,

201
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,360
but legalese? Impossible.

202
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,630
I just wanna know

203
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,630
what I'm signing.

204
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,010
Is that too much to ask?

205
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,010
Not at all.

206
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,310
Cosigning a loan

207
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,310
is a big deal.

208
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,370
Mmm.

209
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,370
If the borrower defaults,

210
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,180
you're on the hook

211
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,180
for the money, right?

212
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,310
Mmm-hmm.

213
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,750
Another little piece of

214
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,750
advice from the old guy.

215
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,450
Finances and family,

216
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,290
they don't always mix.

217
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,790
Oh, no, Dr. Charles,

218
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,790
my dad is good for the money.

219
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,230
He just needs me to cosign

220
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,990
because identity theft messed

221
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,990
up his credit a few years ago.

222
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,620
Huh.

223
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,030
So when did your back

224
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,030
start bothering you?

225
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,830
Oh, it's been killing me

226
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,830
since last night.

227
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,400
Listen, I probably overdid it

228
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,400
in my spin class.

229
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,380
I've been working

230
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,380
on my stamina.

231
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,840
We're off to Italy tonight,

232
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,840
bike trip through Tuscany.

233
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,540
Oh, yeah?

234
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,540
Our 30th anniversary.

235
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,280
Congratulations.

236
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,280
Thanks.

237
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,880
All right, so let me know

238
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,880
if you feel anything tender.

239
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,980
Okay.

240
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,980
Okay?

241
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,580
The spinning, is that a new

242
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,580
activity to prep for the trip?

243
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,490
Um, yeah. And also,

244
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,490
I've been trying to lose

245
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,550
the twenty-ish pounds

246
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,550
I gained over the winter.

247
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,220
Obviously, it's not working.

248
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,770
But muscle weighs more

249
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,770
than fat, isn't that right?

250
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,890
Don't answer that.

251
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,010
Are you on any medications,

252
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,010
Mrs. Davis?

253
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,040
Yeah, I'm on hormone

254
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,040
replacement therapy.

255
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,700
I'm at high risk

256
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,700
for osteoporosis,

257
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,970
so I started the hormones

258
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,970
after menopause.

259
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,170
Okay.

260
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,110
No midline abnormalities.

261
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,110
Okay.

262
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,550
Is, uh... Do you have

263
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,550
any burning with urination?

264
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,210
Um, no, although lately,

265
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,550
it does seem like I have

266
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,550
to go every ten minutes.

267
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,060
Our granddaughter just

268
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,060
got out of diapers.

269
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,590
I guess I'm on

270
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,590
my way into them.

271
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,530
Well, looks like it's

272
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,530
just a muscle strain.

273
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,620
Really?

274
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,630
Yeah, a ten of Flexeril

275
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,630
and 800 of Ibuprofen.

276
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,500
And, uh, I'll check

277
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,500
back in an hour,

278
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,970
see how you're feeling.

279
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,630
Thanks.

280
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,630
Yeah.

281
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,470
Muscle strain.

282
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,470
Mmm.

283
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,970
Maggie...

284
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,970
Uh-huh?

285
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,380
I need a doctor

286
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,380
in the waiting room.

287
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,280
Got it.

288
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,280
Dr. Choi, we're up.

289
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,010
LaShawn, hold onto this.

290
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,520
Be quiet, please!

291
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,420
Clear out, clear out.

292
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,420
Here, here, here.

293
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,580
Sir, take this chair

294
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,580
and move it,

295
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,580
please, thank you.

296
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,020
She kept falling over

297
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,020
onto the person next to her.

298
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,180
I can't wake her up.

299
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,620
Ma'am. Ma'am,

300
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,620
can you hear me?

301
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,630
She's snoring, so she's

302
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,630
protecting her airway.

303
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,030
Able to breathe, good pulse.

304
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,860
Who is she?

305
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,860
Patient here to be seen?

306
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,160
No idea, she never

307
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,160
checked in with me.

308
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,700
Anyone know who she is?

309
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,400
Mags, see if there's an ID.

310
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,330
Yeah. I got it.

311
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,240
Illinois driver's license.

312
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,240
Her name is Rachel Wexler.

313
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,800
30 years old,

314
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,800
lives in Evanston.

315
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,140
That's not close.

316
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,140
No.

317
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,010
Don't know why she's here,

318
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,010
but she's a patient now.

319
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,450
All right,

320
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,450
get ready to clear out.

321
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,380
Move, people, move, move,

322
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,380
move, move, move, move!

323
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,080
Go, go, go, go,

324
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,080
go, go, go, go!

325
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,240
Doris, Treatment Four.

326
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,310
What do we got?

327
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,550
Fell asleep,

328
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,550
now won't wake up.

329
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,250
OD?

330
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,250
That's my guess.

331
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,690
A drop and dash,

332
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,690
or maybe a last fling

333
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,060
before coming in

334
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,060
to get treatment.

335
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,720
Doris, push 2 of Narcan.

336
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,720
Yep.

337
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,990
Mags, any more info

338
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,990
from her purse?

339
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,260
Wallet, keys, makeup, gum,

340
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,330
birth control pills, and

341
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,330
cigarettes, nothing helpful.

342
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,800
BP, 104 over 68,

343
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,800
heartrate, 72,

344
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,700
pulse ox, 99%,

345
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,700
EKG, normal sinus rhythm.

346
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,940
Not exactly OD vitals,

347
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,940
Dr. Choi.

348
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,140
No response to Narcan.

349
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,140
I told you.

350
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,740
Narcan only counteracts

351
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,740
to opiates. Must be a benzo.

352
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,310
Push.4 of Flumazenil,

353
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,310
and order a CBC, CMP,

354
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,180
ammonia levels,

355
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,180
arterial blood gas, BAC,

356
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,810
and blood and urine

357
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,810
tox screens.

358
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,290
Maggie, she's wearing

359
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,290
a wedding ring.

360
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,050
Can you find a contact

361
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,050
for a spouse?

362
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,960
Would if I could,

363
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,960
but no cell phone,

364
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,320
but a charger, so I'm guessing

365
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,320
she had one at some point.

366
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,620
If she stumbled in here high,

367
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,620
who knows where she lost it.

368
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,390
Flumazenil's not

369
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,390
working either.

370
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,700
Okay, OD's out.

371
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,040
Doris, add an HCG,

372
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,170
a CT chest, spine,

373
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,600
um, abdomen and pelvis

374
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,600
to the test.

375
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,700
Got it.

376
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,040
Dr. Stohl,

377
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,040
you're thinking injury?

378
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,910
All I'm seeing is a scar

379
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,910
on her right cheek,

380
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,210
but it's old, clearly healed.

381
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,480
Just because

382
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,480
there's no bruising

383
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,750
doesn't mean

384
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,750
there's no trauma.

385
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,790
You should know

386
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,790
that, Dr. Choi.

387
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,860
So, I took a second look

388
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,860
at your echo,

389
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,990
and I wanna start you

390
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,990
on dexamethasone.

391
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,690
It's another

392
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,690
anti-inflammatory.

393
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,890
Whatever you think

394
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,890
is best, do it.

395
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,600
How'd it go?

396
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,600
Surgery went well.

397
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,400
Peter's artificial

398
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,400
heart is in.

399
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,270
Let's hope it lasts until a

400
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,270
donor heart becomes available.

401
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,650
Peter's Status One

402
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,650
on the transplant list.

403
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,840
He's got a chance.

404
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,280
My patient, Dan,

405
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,280
he's Status Two.

406
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,220
I am waiting for a call that's

407
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,220
probably never gonna come.

408
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,350
GCM's brutal but not usually

409
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,350
discovered until autopsy.

410
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,530
You're way ahead of it.

411
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,530
I was.

412
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,630
Now I'm just playing catch-up.

413
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,430
23-year-old male.

414
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,800
Went down on his motorcycle

415
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,800
just outside Bloomington.

416
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,930
Wasn't wearing a helmet.

417
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,930
Massive brain hemorrhaging?

418
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,540
Rural hospital's

419
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,540
been working on him,

420
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,380
but he's worse

421
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,380
than they can handle.

422
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,610
GCS, 3,

423
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,610
down six hours already.

424
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,840
Crap scans.

425
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,840
Doubt we can do much better.

426
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,250
You know what they call

427
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,250
a motorcyclist

428
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,950
riding without a helmet,

429
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,950
don't you?

430
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,220
One, two, three.

431
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,850
An organ donor.

432
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,400
Well, she's not catatonic.

433
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,270
Whatever knocked her out,

434
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,270
it's not psychiatric.

435
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,210
What'd her tox screens show?

436
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,210
Yeah, she's clean.

437
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,910
Blood alcohol, arterial gases,

438
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,910
and all other labs too.

439
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,240
Diabetic Ketoacidosis?

440
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,240
Blood sugar's normal.

441
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,220
Liver failure?

442
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,220
Ammonia level's normal.

443
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,410
Tumor?

444
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,980
Chest X-ray and all

445
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,980
the CTs were clean.

446
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,890
The scar on her cheek?

447
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,890
Plate from an old fracture.

448
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,650
No apparent connection

449
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,650
to her unconsciousness.

450
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,680
Just got off the phone

451
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,680
with PD.

452
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,130
Ruzek ran Rachel's name

453
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,130
through the system.

454
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,860
She got busted a few times,

455
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,860
DUI and possession.

456
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,960
And yet a clean tox and BAC.

457
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,830
Hmm, the plot thickens.

458
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,970
Good luck.

459
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,770
Hey.

460
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,280
Hi, Natalie.

461
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,280
Just getting here?

462
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,870
Yeah, remember,

463
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,870
it was my turn

464
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,280
to be volunteer mom

465
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,280
at Owen's daycare class.

466
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,650
Oh, right, yeah.

467
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,810
Three hours and 20 toddlers,

468
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,620
do you have any idea

469
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,620
how many boogers that is?

470
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,890
Ha, I'll bet.

471
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,820
Okay, not my best material,

472
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,750
but not even a courtesy laugh?

473
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,290
Are you okay?

474
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,290
Yeah, I'm just tired.

475
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,620
Are you sure?

476
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,620
No, yeah, I'm good.

477
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,930
Dr. Manning, you're up.

478
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,930
You're going to Treatment Two.

479
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,270
Okay. Hey,

480
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,270
I'll catch you later?

481
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,970
Okay.

482
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,480
Sam Covington,

483
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,480
27-year-old male.

484
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,210
Hypotensive and tachypneic.

485
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,940
Long-term care patient

486
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,940
following a TBI.

487
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,780
How long ago did he sustain

488
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,780
the brain injury?

489
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,180
Um, five years.

490
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,180
It was a surfing accident.

491
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,190
He was only 22.

492
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,380
Just graduated from UCSD,

493
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,380
magna cum laude.

494
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,050
Sorry, you don't

495
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,050
need to know all that.

496
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,530
Mom, I take it?

497
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,020
All right, let's transfer him

498
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,020
on my count.

499
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,100
Ready, one, two, three.

500
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,640
Temp, 101.6.

501
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,640
Okay.

502
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,580
Congested on both sides.

503
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,120
Mom, hey, I just got

504
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,120
your message.

505
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,380
Sorry, I was in class.

506
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,380
What happened? Is Sam okay?

507
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,430
Uh, your brother

508
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,430
was breathing fast,

509
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,190
and, um, he...

510
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,420
He looked like he was in pain.

511
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,860
Uh, let's get

512
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,860
a CBC, CMP, ABG,

513
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,420
a UA, and blood cultures,

514
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,400
and begin sepsis protocol.

515
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,770
Excuse me, sorry.

516
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,000
Start him on antibiotics.

517
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,000
That's a lot of tests.

518
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,140
I understand, but since Sam

519
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,140
can't tell us where it hurts,

520
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,140
it's better to err

521
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,140
on the side of caution.

522
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,540
Okay?

523
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,530
Take as much time

524
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,530
with your son as you need.

525
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,800
When you're ready,

526
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,800
someone will come

527
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,310
speak with you

528
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,310
about organ donation.

529
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,510
What happened?

530
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,110
Motorcycle accident.

531
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,110
Never had a chance.

532
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,580
Soon as the immunotyping

533
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,580
results are in, find me.

534
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,890
Yeah, okay.

535
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,740
So, how we feeling?

536
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,300
Ugh, my back is better,

537
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,140
but now I'm feeling

538
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,140
really queasy.

539
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,540
All of a sudden,

540
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,540
it just hit her.

541
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,540
A reaction to the Flexeril?

542
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,540
Yeah, maybe.

543
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,910
Um, can I take a look?

544
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,340
Okay, uh-uh...

545
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,010
Oh, gosh.

546
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,210
Mmm.

547
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,580
April, can I...

548
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,580
Sorry.

549
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,460
Mmm, can I get, um,

550
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,460
four milligrams of Zofran?

551
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,260
Uh, and if you'll

552
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,260
excuse me, I'll...

553
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,530
I'll be right back.

554
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,530
Sorry.

555
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,370
No, yes, it's, um...

556
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,370
It's no, it's no problem.

557
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,700
Sorry.

558
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,310
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

559
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,310
Oh, he's fine.

560
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,310
First-year resident,

561
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,310
projectile vomit is

562
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,310
a rite of passage.

563
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,540
I'll get you a gown.

564
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,540
Thank you.

565
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,350
Oh, my God.

566
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,350
Are you all right?

567
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,420
Daniel, there you are.

568
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,360
The next round of prospective

569
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,360
transplant candidates.

570
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,690
No rest for the wicked.

571
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,490
Dr. Reese's father, Robert

572
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,490
Haywood, is in this stack.

573
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,330
Class Three heart failure.

574
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,630
I hope he makes a strong

575
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,630
candidate.

576
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,470
You'll keep me in the loop?

577
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,230
Uh, Daniel?

578
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,840
Yes. Yes, of course.

579
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,170
Could you excuse me?

580
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,440
Dan?

581
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,180
Dan?

582
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,180
Daddy?

583
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,740
Get the crash cart!

584
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,740
Paddles now.

585
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,110
Come here.

586
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,490
Come...

587
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,630
No pulse or breathing.

588
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,630
He's in V-fib.

589
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,720
Get on his chest.

590
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,720
Charge to 200.

591
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,870
Charged.

592
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,100
All right,

593
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,100
hold compressions. Clear!

594
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,100
Charge again. Amp of epi.

595
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,440
Epi's in. Charged.

596
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,500
All right, clear!

597
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,610
He's hurting Daddy!

598
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,610
No, honey.

599
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,910
Charge again. Amp of epi.

600
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,280
He's just trying to help.

601
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,280
Come on, Dan.

602
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,650
Beat, damn it. Come on.

603
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,690
Meds are in.

604
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,690
Charged.

605
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,150
Hold compressions. Clear.

606
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,990
He's back.

607
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,060
Thank you.

608
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,010
So, I'm not getting on

609
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,010
the transplant list?

610
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,170
I didn't say that.

611
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,220
I'm just making you aware

612
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,220
that personality disorders

613
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,520
can be a contraindication

614
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,520
to transplant.

615
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,380
You believe I have Antisocial

616
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,380
Personality Disorder,

617
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,860
but another psychiatrist

618
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,860
might not.

619
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,620
It's... It's a pretty gray

620
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,620
area, wouldn't you say?

621
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,160
Well, actually it isn't.

622
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,760
Uh, take a look at this.

623
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,920
This is a PET scan

624
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,920
of your brain.

625
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,940
Taken...

626
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,510
When Dr. Rhodes was conducting

627
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,510
his thoracic study?

628
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,530
That's right.

629
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,710
And this supports

630
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,710
your diagnosis?

631
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,810
Mmm.

632
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,810
Well...

633
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,410
Since you're bound

634
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,410
by doctor-patient

635
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,410
confidentiality,

636
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,820
I just say we keep

637
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,820
this to ourselves.

638
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,330
I'm afraid

639
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,330
that's not an option.

640
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,330
Um, I am obliged

641
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,460
to report my findings

642
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,460
to the evaluation committee.

643
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,130
I didn't realize you had

644
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,130
such influence on the process,

645
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,630
Dr. Charles.

646
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,810
My heart meds.

647
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,810
Do you have any water?

648
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,310
Of course.

649
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,080
Um, by the way,

650
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,220
contraindication

651
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,220
isn't absolute.

652
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,770
I mean, taking positive steps

653
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,770
to manage your disorder

654
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,980
can go a long way

655
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,980
to mitigating concerns.

656
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,890
Well, I hope you have

657
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,890
some suggestions.

658
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,390
Well, what the committee's

659
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,390
looking for

660
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,720
is self-sufficiency...

661
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,720
Mmm-hmm?

662
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,490
Fiscal responsibility...

663
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,490
Fiscal responsibility?

664
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,570
You wouldn't by any chance

665
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,570
be referring to the loan

666
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,360
I asked Sarah to cosign?

667
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,730
Anything you can do

668
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,730
to establish independence...

669
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,330
Perhaps rescind the request.

670
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,570
Would certainly count

671
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,570
in your favor.

672
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,040
I'm sorry, Bob, you know,

673
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,940
they come up against this

674
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,940
all the time.

675
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,150
There are simply

676
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,150
too many people

677
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,950
waiting for too few organs.

678
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,260
I really appreciate you

679
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,260
giving me this advice.

680
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,830
Hi.

681
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,360
Dr. Manning, this is

682
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,360
my sister, Lizzie.

683
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,090
She just drove down

684
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,090
from Racine.

685
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,500
Nice to meet you.

686
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,630
Uh, how long was I sleeping?

687
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,340
Lizzie, when...

688
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,340
When did you get here?

689
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,600
Just now, Mom.

690
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,540
"Eddie would go"?

691
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,540
Who's Eddie?

692
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,110
Eddie Aikau,

693
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,410
legendary big wave surfer

694
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,410
and lifeguard at Waimea Bay.

695
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,380
He'd charge waves

696
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,380
no one else would dare.

697
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,980
Sam's hero.

698
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,320
So we got the results back

699
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,320
from Sam's labs and X-rays.

700
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,410
Um, I'm afraid

701
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,410
he has pneumonia.

702
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,150
The antibiotics

703
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,150
should knock it out.

704
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,690
Right now, we'd like to

705
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,690
swap out Sam's trach tube

706
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,060
so we can put him on the vent,

707
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,120
you know, give his

708
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,120
respiratory system a rest.

709
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,360
Okay?

710
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,870
No, no, it's okay.

711
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,960
Honey, honey, it's okay.

712
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,960
Just... She'll be gentle.

713
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,710
Okay.

714
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,920
Monique, pass me

715
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,920
the new trach tube.

716
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,850
Hey, that's, um,

717
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,850
Rachel's husband, Jacob.

718
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,420
Where'd you find him?

719
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,420
He found us.

720
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,280
He kept on calling

721
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,280
her voice mail

722
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,250
and finally used

723
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,250
a "find my phone" app,

724
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,720
which led him

725
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,720
to the waiting room.

726
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,380
Her phone was buried

727
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,380
in the chair cushion.

728
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,350
Thanks, Mags.

729
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,350
Yeah.

730
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,500
Mr. Wexler...

731
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,500
Hey.

732
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,290
I'm Dr. Choi. I've been

733
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,290
treating your wife.

734
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,630
What's wrong with her?

735
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,230
Well, we don't know yet.

736
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,830
All her tests

737
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,830
have been negative,

738
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,740
including the tox screen.

739
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,770
But given your wife's

740
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,770
drug history...

741
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,400
You think she overdosed?

742
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,450
She might have taken something

743
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,450
that's beating the test,

744
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,280
possibly a synthetic.

745
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,250
Rachel was in a car accident

746
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,250
a few years ago.

747
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,110
Airbag broke her jaw

748
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,620
and a bone in her cheek.

749
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,420
The injuries healed,

750
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,420
but the pain pills...

751
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,860
After her last arrest,

752
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,690
she promised

753
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,690
that she'd stay clean.

754
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,290
Here we go again.

755
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,880
Meds alone aren't taking

756
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,820
enough pressure

757
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,820
off of Dan's heart,

758
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,950
so I am going to

759
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,950
put him on ECMO.

760
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,800
Full support, so that

761
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,800
his heart doesn't have

762
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,800
to shoulder any load.

763
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,500
When you first

764
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,500
diagnosed the GCM,

765
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,970
you said ECMO was

766
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,970
a final option.

767
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,600
Mmm-hmm.

768
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,070
I told myself...

769
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,540
To make a plan,

770
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,750
to prepare for this moment,

771
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,510
but I couldn't do it.

772
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,450
It felt like giving up.

773
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,520
I promise you...

774
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,160
That's not what's

775
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,160
happening here.

776
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,290
Okay?

777
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,840
How's your TBI patient?

778
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,350
Saw pneumonia on his chart.

779
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,750
Pretty sure he got it

780
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,750
from his trach tube.

781
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,220
It was filthy.

782
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,760
His mom's his caregiver.

783
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,260
Looks like she hasn't been

784
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,260
cleaning or suctioning it.

785
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,630
What, neglect?

786
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,630
No, I don't think so.

787
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,830
All other areas, he was

788
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,830
meticulously well-cared for.

789
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,800
His nails are trimmed,

790
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,800
his teeth are brushed,

791
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,800
skin is moisturized.

792
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,340
So Mom's burnt out.

793
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,960
The first thing to slip

794
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,960
was the tube?

795
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,740
Ever since Sam's injury,

796
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,440
she has devoted

797
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,440
her entire life

798
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,440
to caring for him.

799
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,310
I'm not sure how to tell her

800
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,310
that she may no longer

801
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,310
be up to the task.

802
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,110
You want some backup?

803
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,520
No, I don't want her

804
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,520
to feel ganged up on.

805
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,880
I'll figure it out.

806
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,330
So, the Zofran

807
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,330
hasn't helped at all?

808
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,860
No! And the cramps

809
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,860
are unbearable.

810
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,450
So is her gas.

811
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,450
Hey!

812
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,900
No fever, vitals are normal.

813
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,330
All right, let's hang another

814
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,330
liter of, uh, normal saline,

815
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
and order a CBC, CMP,

816
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
amylase, and lipase levels.

817
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,460
Okay?

818
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,270
Uh, this might be

819
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,270
a stomach bug,

820
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,470
possibly kidney stones,

821
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,470
okay?

822
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm just gonna...

823
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm gonna put...

824
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,110
I'm gonna press

825
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,110
on your stomach.

826
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,480
Ah! Wait, I need a bathroom!

827
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,480
Okay.

828
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,280
Oh, okay.

829
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,280
I need a bathroom right now!

830
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,750
All right, come on, honey.

831
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,750
Okay, hold on a second.

832
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,340
We'll get you there.

833
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,790
Oh!

834
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,380
What?

835
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,380
Whoa.

836
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,360
Sorry.

837
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,360
That's okay.

838
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,060
Honey, let's get you

839
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,060
back into bed.

840
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,530
Oh, my God, no...

841
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,530
I still need to go!

842
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,160
Okay, I'm gonna help you.

843
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,160
Really bad!

844
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,030
Come on. Come on, let's go.

845
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,030
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

846
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,500
That's not urine.

847
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,230
Oh, okay. Let's, let's

848
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,230
get you right back into bed.

849
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,600
Come on.

850
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,600
Wait, what...

851
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,600
What's going on?

852
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,730
I don't know

853
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,730
what's happening.

854
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,000
Come on.

855
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,000
What's going on?

856
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,640
Oh! Oh! Ow!

857
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,540
Come on.

858
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,540
Jeez.

859
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,040
What are you doing?

860
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,350
What's going on?

861
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,350
Oh.

862
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,920
Yikes!

863
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,920
What is going on?

864
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,050
Really? Are you...

865
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,050
Whoa!

866
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,050
Oh.

867
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,090
Okay, Mrs. Davis...

868
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,090
Yeah?

869
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,250
You're gonna wanna push,

870
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,250
but don't.

871
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,130
There's no way. No, no, no.

872
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,660
This... This is not possible.

873
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,560
Uh, what is going on?

874
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,860
Your wife is pregnant

875
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,860
and in labor.

876
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,960
No, no, that...

877
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,960
That can't be true.

878
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,510
I'm 55. I've been

879
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,510
through menopause.

880
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,370
I know this might be a shock,

881
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,370
but this is happening.

882
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,170
I am positive. Page OB.

883
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,170
Okay.

884
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,140
I'll be right back, okay?

885
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,140
Uh...

886
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,840
Oh, my God!

887
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,840
Oh, my...

888
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,380
What the hell, Connor?

889
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,150
Not here.

890
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
That motorcyclist

891
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
is an HLA match

892
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,030
to my patient, Peter,

893
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,690
but suddenly,

894
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,690
your GCM patient is above him

895
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,350
on the transplant list?

896
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,560
How did he come in

897
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,560
this morning at Status Two

898
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,630
and suddenly jump to

899
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,630
the highest priority?

900
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,130
I had to put him on ECMO.

901
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,130
Before other meds?

902
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,370
Milrinone?

903
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,370
Monoclonal antibody therapy?

904
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,810
They're just stop-gaps.

905
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh, you sneaky

906
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,480
son of a bitch.

907
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,440
ECMO trumps

908
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,440
an artificial heart,

909
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,080
puts your patient

910
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,080
to the top of the list.

911
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,120
You manipulated the system.

912
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,920
I made an aggressive

913
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,920
treatment decision.

914
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,050
You're taking a heart

915
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,050
that doesn't belong to you!

916
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,060
I am fighting for one

917
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,060
that's available!

918
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,030
This isn't right.

919
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,090
And it isn't over.

920
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,200
The hospital

921
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,200
can connect you

922
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,200
with respite services,

923
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,240
as well as caregiver

924
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,240
support groups.

925
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,570
You do not have

926
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,570
to do this alone.

927
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,500
And we can

928
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,500
help out more, Mom.

929
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,540
Catherine...

930
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,240
No one is blaming you.

931
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,250
You have done

932
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,250
a tremendous job

933
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,250
caring for Sam.

934
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,630
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

935
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,490
No, of course not.

936
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,530
I thought that...

937
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,430
He would go peacefully.

938
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,970
No, I wasn't prepared

939
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,970
to see him in pain.

940
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,270
Mom, what are

941
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,270
you talking about?

942
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,680
Sam doesn't want

943
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,680
this oblivion.

944
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,980
I see it in his eyes

945
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,980
every time he looks at me.

946
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,260
The doctors say there is

947
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,260
no meaning behind it.

948
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,560
That he's not

949
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,560
really looking at me.

950
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,720
I know my son...

951
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,330
And he wants this over.

952
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,760
He was begging me to help him.

953
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,760
Mom, stop talking.

954
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,070
I should never

955
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,070
have called 9-1-1.

956
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,440
I should have just

957
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,440
let him go, like I planned,

958
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,070
like he wanted.

959
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,940
I got scared. I panicked.

960
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,570
Oh, my God, Mom, did you...

961
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,640
Mom, please,

962
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,640
don't say anything else.

963
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,880
Sam, I'm sorry

964
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,880
I let you down.

965
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,290
I am so sorry, honey.

966
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,590
We need to call

967
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,590
a lawyer, now.

968
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,830
First, you're

969
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,830
treating my father,

970
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,840
and now you're

971
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,840
blackmailing him?

972
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,010
What?

973
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,010
You heard me.

974
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,310
Look, I don't know

975
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,310
what he told you...

976
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,180
He said you're jealous

977
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,180
of our relationship,

978
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,180
that you have some twisted

979
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,180
paternal feelings for me,

980
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,480
that you threatened him,

981
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,380
and said if he didn't

982
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,380
stay away from me,

983
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,180
you'd sabotage his chances

984
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,180
of getting on the list.

985
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,520
I threatened him?

986
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,180
Sabotage?

987
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,180
Yes.

988
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,630
I'm a shrink in a sweater

989
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,630
vest, not a secret agent.

990
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,860
Is it true?

991
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,860
I can't disclose

992
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,860
details of our conversation,

993
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,900
but I assure you,

994
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,900
all I did was

995
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,900
lay out the facts

996
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,330
as they pertain

997
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,330
to his condition.

998
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,730
What are you

999
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,730
treating him for?

1000
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,960
I can't tell you that, Sarah.

1001
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,440
He's my patient.

1002
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,440
But he is my father.

1003
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,440
Who suddenly reappears

1004
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,440
after two decades

1005
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,480
of avoiding

1006
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,480
parental responsibility

1007
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,440
and alienating

1008
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,440
everyone in his life,

1009
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,070
who now presents himself

1010
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,070
as a victim

1011
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,280
in order to create

1012
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,280
an alliance with you.

1013
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,380
Think about

1014
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,380
what you know, Sarah.

1015
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,650
If he was your patient,

1016
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,920
what would be on

1017
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,920
your differential?

1018
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,070
What was that about?

1019
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,730
As you will read

1020
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,730
in my evaluation,

1021
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,330
her father, Dr. Haywood,

1022
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,990
has a particularly

1023
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,990
malignant form

1024
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,060
of Antisocial

1025
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,060
Personality Disorder.

1026
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,540
Are you serious?

1027
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,540
Is she in danger?

1028
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,670
Well, I haven't picked up

1029
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,670
any violent tendencies yet,

1030
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,110
but he's an extremely

1031
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,110
effective manipulator.

1032
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,450
Dr. Reese doesn't know?

1033
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,610
Well, I think she might be

1034
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,610
starting to figure it out

1035
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,350
on a clinical level,

1036
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,350
but emotionally,

1037
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,250
she's not there yet.

1038
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,120
Oh! This can't be real!

1039
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,120
This can't be real!

1040
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,130
Where the hell is the OB?

1041
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,130
They said five minutes.

1042
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,220
We can't wait.

1043
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,220
The baby's crowning.

1044
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,290
What?

1045
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,290
Tessa...

1046
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,630
Yeah?

1047
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,630
On three,

1048
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,760
really big push, okay?

1049
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,760
Okay.

1050
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,330
All right, one...

1051
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,330
Uh-huh?

1052
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,770
Two, three.

1053
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,300
Yeah, good, good.

1054
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,170
When did we go to

1055
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,170
Mark and Patti's cabin?

1056
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,840
What?

1057
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,840
Was that Fourth of July?

1058
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,210
What are you talking about?

1059
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,010
I'm just trying to figure out

1060
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,010
when this happened.

1061
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,680
Oh, God, Greg,

1062
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,680
how does that matter now?

1063
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,050
Mr. Davis, can you

1064
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,050
please help the nurse

1065
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,680
hold your wife's leg back?

1066
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,450
All right, okay, yeah, yeah.

1067
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,450
Thank you. Okay.

1068
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,690
Tessa, Tessa, look at me.

1069
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,690
Look at me, Tessa.

1070
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,230
Okay, Tessa,

1071
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,230
one more push, all right?

1072
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,560
Okay. Yeah!

1073
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,560
You can do it,

1074
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,560
you can do it.

1075
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,090
Ready?

1076
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,090
Yeah!

1077
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,730
You're doing great.

1078
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,730
You're almost there.

1079
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,460
All right, all right.

1080
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,460
Yes.

1081
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,730
Oh!

1082
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,730
Whoa.

1083
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,800
Okay, okay...

1084
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,470
This is crazy.

1085
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,100
It looks okay.

1086
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,100
Oh, my...

1087
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,080
It's a girl. Congratulations.

1088
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,080
Oh!

1089
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,380
Oh...

1090
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,380
Congratulations

1091
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,380
to you both.

1092
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh, my goodness.

1093
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,020
Oh, my gosh.

1094
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,590
Natalie, you can't

1095
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,590
sit on this.

1096
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,030
If I report it,

1097
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,760
Catherine will likely be

1098
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,760
removed as Sam's guardian.

1099
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,830
I wanna pull in

1100
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,830
social services.

1101
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,060
This goes beyond

1102
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,060
family counseling.

1103
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,630
It's a criminal matter.

1104
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,980
She intentionally

1105
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,980
stopped trach care to

1106
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,980
cause her son's death.

1107
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,740
To end his suffering.

1108
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,750
You know, she looked into

1109
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,750
moving to a state

1110
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,720
where assisted suicide

1111
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,720
is legal?

1112
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,620
But because Sam

1113
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,620
isn't terminally ill

1114
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,450
and can't express his wishes,

1115
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,450
he didn't qualify.

1116
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,050
Exactly, which means

1117
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,050
you can't be certain

1118
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,390
this is what he wants.

1119
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,890
No one knows what Sam wants

1120
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,890
more than his mother.

1121
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,690
Then she needs to go to court

1122
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,690
and make her case,

1123
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,660
petition a judge to get

1124
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,660
his feeding tube removed.

1125
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,200
Look, Natalie,

1126
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm not arguing she's wrong,

1127
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,330
but what she did is illegal.

1128
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,440
You have to call the police.

1129
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,630
No!

1130
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,200
Then I will.

1131
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,340
Decerebrate posturing.

1132
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,340
Rigid limbs, pointed toes.

1133
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,350
She's slipping deeper

1134
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,350
into unconsciousness.

1135
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,720
Dr. Stohl, Dr. Choi,

1136
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,720
we got something.

1137
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,400
Right after

1138
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,400
we discovered Rachel,

1139
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,760
I texted a pic of her license

1140
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,760
throughout the hospital.

1141
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,930
I just got a call

1142
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,930
from my friend from HR.

1143
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,000
She said she interviewed

1144
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,000
Rachel this morning

1145
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,470
for an admin job.

1146
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,510
She said she was alert

1147
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,510
and engaging.

1148
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,770
"Alert and engaging?"

1149
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,380
That doesn't sound like

1150
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,380
someone about to OD.

1151
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,640
All right, but if it's

1152
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,640
not drugs, what the hell

1153
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,640
knocked her out?

1154
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,850
You missed something.

1155
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,850
Recheck every test result,

1156
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,180
look for anything

1157
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,180
that might be

1158
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,180
mimicking something else.

1159
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,980
Her MRI.

1160
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,760
These two spots

1161
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,760
of diffusion restriction,

1162
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,560
radiology says they're from

1163
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,560
movement and mental artifact.

1164
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,100
The plate in her cheek.

1165
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,100
But what if that's wrong?

1166
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,860
This could be damage

1167
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,860
from a stroke,

1168
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,730
a clot that's knocked out the

1169
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,730
Reticular Activating System.

1170
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,410
I don't...

1171
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,410
Look, RAS controls

1172
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,970
wake and sleep patterns.

1173
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,200
Easy, Quincy,

1174
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,200
that would take a huge clot.

1175
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,340
The damage would be

1176
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,340
far more extensive than this.

1177
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,610
Normally, yes, because

1178
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,610
most people have two vessels

1179
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,880
that provide blood flow

1180
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,880
to the area, but some

1181
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,880
only have one.

1182
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,540
The Artery of Percheron.

1183
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,080
If Rachel has this variant,

1184
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,680
a small clot

1185
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,680
in just the right area

1186
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,090
would take out the RAS.

1187
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,250
She's been out for about

1188
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,250
four-and-a-half hours.

1189
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,490
We missed the window

1190
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,490
to use TPA to bust the clot.

1191
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,430
Still may be able

1192
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,430
to reverse the damage

1193
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,430
with local thrombolysis.

1194
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,930
Okay, so get on it.

1195
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,400
This is not a debate,

1196
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,400
Dr. Rhodes.

1197
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,200
My patient's HLA is

1198
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,200
an ideal match to the donor.

1199
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,570
But his antibody levels

1200
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,570
are not.

1201
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,800
They're too high and suggest

1202
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,800
he'll reject the heart.

1203
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,740
So it slides to

1204
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,740
the next person

1205
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,740
on the transplant list,

1206
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,150
Dr. Bekker's patient, Peter.

1207
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,780
I'm sorry.

1208
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,760
Without that heart,

1209
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,760
Dan doesn't stand a chance.

1210
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,460
Neither does Peter.

1211
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,460
No, actually, he does,

1212
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,520
because the artificial heart

1213
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,520
that you put in

1214
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,660
can last months,

1215
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,660
possibly even years.

1216
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,710
Dan doesn't have

1217
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,710
that kind of time.

1218
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,400
Peter, he's had

1219
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,400
two hearts already,

1220
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,500
and with each transplant,

1221
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,130
his chances of survival

1222
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,130
decrease.

1223
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,410
It is not fair

1224
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,410
that he gets a third heart

1225
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,740
before Dan

1226
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,740
even gets his first.

1227
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,650
There's no limit

1228
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,650
to the number of organs

1229
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,180
a person can receive,

1230
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,590
and it's impossible

1231
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,590
to compare patients in need.

1232
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,450
That's why there's a list,

1233
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,960
to crunch numbers

1234
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,960
and break ties.

1235
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,890
You're right.

1236
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,820
It's all about the numbers.

1237
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,700
Okay.

1238
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,100
No, no, right,

1239
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,100
uh, I understand.

1240
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,280
Okay, bye.

1241
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,550
I canceled our trip.

1242
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,410
They asked if I wanted

1243
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,410
to rebook for a later date.

1244
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,540
I said, "Sure,

1245
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,540
in about 18 years."

1246
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,310
Uh, what's that saying?

1247
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,310
"When we plan, God laughs"?

1248
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,950
Speaking of planning,

1249
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,950
we need diapers

1250
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,790
and a crib and a car seat

1251
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,390
and bottles and, uh, onesies

1252
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,390
and... Did I say diapers?

1253
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,700
You did.

1254
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,700
I ate sushi.

1255
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,170
I had the occasional

1256
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,170
glass of wine.

1257
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,960
I am happy to report

1258
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,030
that you have a completely

1259
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,030
healthy baby girl.

1260
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,770
Really?

1261
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,040
Aw.

1262
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,540
Amazing.

1263
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,540
Hey, you. Yes!

1264
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,550
Hello! God!

1265
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,550
Oh.

1266
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,440
Oh, holy cow,

1267
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,440
you weren't kidding.

1268
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,440
No.

1269
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,380
This is our son, Martin,

1270
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:14,950
and our daughter-in-law,

1271
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:14,950
Amy, and Haley, come here

1272
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:14,950
and meet your, um... Aunt.

1273
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,860
How 'bout that, huh?

1274
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,420
We'll give you all some time.

1275
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,190
Thanks.

1276
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,190
Thanks very much.

1277
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,200
Right this way, guys.

1278
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,430
It's weird that Will

1279
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,430
was so adamant

1280
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,940
about calling the cops.

1281
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,440
What do you mean?

1282
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,770
Well, last week's patient,

1283
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,770
Vic Thomas,

1284
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,640
he had advanced-stage cancer,

1285
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,640
and he was refusing treatment.

1286
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,110
Will sent me out of the room

1287
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,110
to get a cautery,

1288
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,310
and when I came back,

1289
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,310
Vic was dead.

1290
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,550
I can't be certain,

1291
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,550
but I think Will let him die.

1292
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,830
What did you do?

1293
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,630
Oh, my God.

1294
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,630
He's not hooked up.

1295
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,170
I need some help here!

1296
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,730
Ma'am, I need you to step out.

1297
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,710
Right now, ma'am!

1298
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,170
I love you, Sam.

1299
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,170
Ma'am, please.

1300
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,740
No pulse. Bag him.

1301
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,440
I need you to step back

1302
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,440
from here, please.

1303
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,740
Step back, please.

1304
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,020
Quick look?

1305
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,490
Asystole.

1306
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,490
Milligram of epi.

1307
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,430
Still no pulse.

1308
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,430
Another milligram of epi.

1309
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,970
Please, don't hurt him.

1310
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,440
Just let him go.

1311
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,830
Time of death, 18:16.

1312
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,120
It did not have to

1313
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,120
get this messy.

1314
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,410
I had no choice, Natalie.

1315
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,420
When someone commits a crime,

1316
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,420
you have to report it.

1317
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,780
Except for when it's you?

1318
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,080
What are you talking about?

1319
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,890
Vic Thomas.

1320
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,890
You let him die.

1321
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,630
That's why you've been walking

1322
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,630
around like a ghost, right?

1323
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,260
I don't know

1324
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,260
what April told you,

1325
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,260
but Vic Thomas explicitly

1326
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,260
and repeatedly

1327
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,830
expressed his wishes to me,

1328
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,030
and there is a monumental

1329
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,030
difference between allowing

1330
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,030
someone to die naturally

1331
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,700
and intentionally

1332
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,700
causing their death.

1333
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,870
Well, if you did nothing

1334
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,870
wrong, then why

1335
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,870
keep it a secret?

1336
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,310
No, no, no, don't you dare

1337
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,310
compare what I did

1338
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,510
to what happened here today.

1339
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,110
Natalie, they murdered him.

1340
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,150
You backed them into a corner

1341
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,150
when you called the police.

1342
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,310
You forced that family

1343
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,310
into a decision!

1344
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,390
These are the results

1345
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,390
of Dan Kennet's latest

1346
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,730
panel reactive antibody test.

1347
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,320
His antibody levels

1348
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,320
were above 80, but now...

1349
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,340
They're within

1350
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,340
transplant criteria.

1351
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,500
Antibody levels don't

1352
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,500
just go down on

1353
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,500
their own that quickly.

1354
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,840
Uh, you can see for yourself.

1355
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,840
I had the lab run it twice.

1356
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,740
I'm sorry, Dr. Bekker.

1357
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,910
It's not my decision.

1358
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,320
Dan Kennet is at

1359
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,320
the top of the list.

1360
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,910
Assemble the transplant team,

1361
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,320
and notify Mr. Kennet

1362
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,320
and his family.

1363
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,660
Emergency plasmapheresis

1364
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,660
and IVIG.

1365
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,860
Didn't you?

1366
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,230
You made Dan look like

1367
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,230
a better candidate

1368
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,230
than he really is.

1369
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,800
Soon as he's off

1370
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,800
the plasmapheresis and IVIG,

1371
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,770
his antibody levels

1372
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,770
will shoot back up.

1373
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,970
Maybe, but the

1374
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,970
immunosuppressants

1375
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
that he's gonna be on

1376
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
post-transplant

1377
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,740
should ensure that his body

1378
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,740
doesn't reject the organ.

1379
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,140
You got it all covered, huh?

1380
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,910
Hey, look, I did what

1381
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,910
I had to for my patient.

1382
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,510
At the expense of mine!

1383
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,510
So do me a favor, okay,

1384
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,180
and save your self-righteous

1385
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,180
hero speech for someone else.

1386
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,260
Will she wake up?

1387
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,260
I'm hopeful.

1388
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,700
Interventional radiology

1389
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,760
was able to locate

1390
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,760
the clot and clear it.

1391
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,470
But she's so young.

1392
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,470
What caused the stroke?

1393
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,670
A DVT, deep vein blood clot.

1394
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,700
Cigarettes

1395
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,700
and birth control pills

1396
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,270
were found in Rachel's purse.

1397
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,210
Smoking on the pill

1398
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,210
can sometimes cause one.

1399
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,910
But how'd it get

1400
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,910
into her brain?

1401
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:42,290
A PFO, a hole in the heart.

1402
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,020
They're not uncommon.

1403
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,680
Most people don't even

1404
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,680
know they have them.

1405
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,160
Jacob?

1406
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,190
Oh, thank God, Rachel.

1407
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,430
Where am I?

1408
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,430
The hospital.

1409
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,800
Rachel, I'm Dr. Choi.

1410
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Do you know what day it is?

1411
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,110
Tuesday.

1412
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,910
What's the last thing

1413
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,910
you remember?

1414
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,980
I sat down...

1415
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,950
To wait for my cab.

1416
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,380
I had a job interview.

1417
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,120
The nurse told me.

1418
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,510
That's where you've been going

1419
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,510
in the afternoons, isn't it?

1420
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,820
Looking for a job?

1421
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,720
Why didn't you tell me?

1422
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,290
I've messed up

1423
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,290
so many times before.

1424
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,770
To surprise you, show you

1425
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,770
that I really changed.

1426
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,100
So, it's really

1427
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,100
gonna happen today?

1428
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,300
Yes.

1429
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,710
You are getting a new heart.

1430
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,840
I... My antibody levels,

1431
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,680
like, I thought

1432
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,680
they were too high.

1433
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,310
They were,

1434
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,310
but now they're not.

1435
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,250
The emergency plasmapheresis

1436
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,250
and IVIG you're on now

1437
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,020
lowered your levels to

1438
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,020
within transplant criteria.

1439
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,120
Techs are gonna be by

1440
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,120
to prep you for surgery soon.

1441
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,130
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

1442
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,200
Of course.

1443
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,790
Thank you.

1444
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,320
It's all just

1445
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,320
legal mumbo jumbo.

1446
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,970
It's pretty boilerplate.

1447
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,370
Uh...

1448
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,400
Here.

1449
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,550
Um, Dad, I'm sorry,

1450
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,550
but I can't sign this.

1451
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,500
Yeah! Muah.

1452
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,590
Yeah!

1453
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,710
Yeah!

1454
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,460
Just some

1455
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,460
friends and family?

1456
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,320
You look so good in a suit.

1457
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,190
I cannot wait

1458
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,190
to tear it off later.

1459
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,960
April, this is

1460
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,960
my sister, Emily.

1461
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,320
Emily, my girlfriend, April.

1462
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,290
It's all good.

1463
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,770
I am so happy

1464
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,770
to finally meet you.

1465
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,670
A little.

1466
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,670
I spent a year in Rio.

1467
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,340
Wow...

1468
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,940
Well, hello there.

1469
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,750
I am Noah. And you are?

1470
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,950
Emily.

1471
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,450
Emily.

1472
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,450
Ethan's sister.

1473
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,980
Right.

1474
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,720
Oh, really?

1475
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,530
Really? Well, you know,

1476
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,530
how about that?

1477
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,890
Yeah? You wanna join me

1478
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,890
on the dance floor?

1479
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,830
Sure. Think you can keep up?

1480
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,200
Oh, yeah?

1481
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,830
Oh, it's on. Vamos la.

1482
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,900
Aww!

1483
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,070
Aww, she seems fun.

1484
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,700
I'm so glad you brought her.

1485
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,810
With Emily, I always expect

1486
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,810
to be disappointed.

1487
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,540
Thought I'd give her a chance

1488
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,540
to prove me wrong.

1489
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,310
But you...

1490
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,380
Breathtaking.

1491
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,250
Come on, join me

1492
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,250
on the dance floor.

1493
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,750
No.

1494
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,750
Yes!

1495
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,420
No!

1496
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,420
Hey!

1497
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,120
No...

1498
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,890
And then faster.
