1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,100
All right, here we go.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,100
Next bucket wins.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,690
Check.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,710
All right, hold on.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,710
I gotta tie my shoe.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,270
So, how are you

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,270
and Natalie doing?

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,870
I see what you're doing.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,870
It's not gonna work.

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,970
Seriously.

11
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,210
I just wanted to see

12
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,210
if you two are getting along.

13
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,180
Seriously, things have

14
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,180
never been better.

15
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,310
I'm a lucky guy.

16
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,310
Now quit stalling.

17
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,880
Well, I'm glad

18
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,880
you didn't screw things up.

19
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,590
'cause you can be

20
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,590
a real knucklehead.

21
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,390
What's that supposed to mean?

22
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,320
Yes!

23
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,790
Ethan, this way.

24
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,630
What the hell happened?

25
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,190
Uh, this guy,

26
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,190
I think he OD'd.

27
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,430
You should've called 911.

28
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,430
Look around.

29
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,030
Last thing I wanna do is

30
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,030
get anyone in trouble.

31
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,410
Em, it's 7:00 a.m.

32
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,410
What are you even doing here?

33
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,340
I was out dancing

34
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,340
with my friends.

35
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,580
Got invited over here after.

36
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,580
Don't you have work today?

37
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,450
Ethan, don't worry,

38
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,450
I'll be there.

39
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,250
Over here.

40
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,380
His name's Jeremy.

41
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,520
Jeremy? Hey, Jeremy...

42
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,580
What did you take, huh?

43
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,120
Does anyone know what he took?

44
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,200
Heroin. He's choking.

45
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,490
Oh, God.

46
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,830
I can't clear it.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,970
Em, see if you can find a pen.

48
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,970
What? Why?

49
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,700
He's not breathing.

50
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,700
He needs a surgical airway.

51
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,050
Hey!

52
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,050
Here, got one.

53
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,350
Unscrew the top.

54
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,920
I'm in.

55
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,560
He's breathing.

56
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,710
Unfortunately, I have

57
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,710
to bring up

58
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,370
last week's

59
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,370
mass casualty incident,

60
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,310
because in the chaos,

61
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,850
it seems 40 pills of Percocet

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,510
disappeared from

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,510
the medication dispensary.

64
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,760
That's a street value

65
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,760
of $2,500.

66
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,220
Someone took advantage

67
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,220
of that situation.

68
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,390
So, we will be implementing

69
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,390
new protocols

70
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,830
to prevent that from happening

71
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,830
in the future.

72
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,340
Keep your eye out for a memo

73
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,340
in the next few days.

74
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,760
Any questions?

75
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,500
Good. Back to work.

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,600
Go to Four.

77
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,440
Tracy Herman,

78
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,440
25-year-old female.

79
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,440
21 weeks pregnant.

80
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,440
GCS, 14, dyspneic.

81
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,810
This is her mother, Pam.

82
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,910
Is my baby okay?

83
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,910
We're gonna take a look.

84
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,380
All right, Tracy,

85
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,380
I'm Dr. Manning.

86
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,110
Can you tell me what happened?

87
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,110
I don't know.

88
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,680
We were having breakfast

89
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,680
and she just collapsed.

90
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,190
All right, let's transfer her

91
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,190
and put her on the monitors.

92
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,090
On my count,

93
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,090
ready, one, two, three.

94
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,890
Any pain or discomfort?

95
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,060
No.

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
Breath sounds are clear

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
and present bilaterally,

98
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,630
but I am hearing

99
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,630
a systolic murmur.

100
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,900
What does that mean?

101
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,640
It's probably

102
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,640
the pregnancy putting

103
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,640
a strain on your heart.

104
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,610
Have you had any bleeding?

105
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,610
Uh, just some spotting,

106
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,150
but my OB said it's normal.

107
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,150
It can be.

108
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,940
Uh, Doris, let's get

109
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,940
a fetal ultrasound,

110
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,650
uh, chest X-ray,

111
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,650
and call up to Cardiology

112
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,650
for an ECHO, okay?

113
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,760
All right, Tracy,

114
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,760
just try to relax.

115
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,450
All right, we're gonna do

116
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,450
everything we can

117
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,450
to figure this out, all right?

118
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,560
Thank you.

119
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah.

120
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,030
Oh, goodie.

121
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,060
Lime flavor today.

122
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,700
I, uh, just checked

123
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,700
with the charge nurse.

124
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,430
Your last set of labs

125
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,430
look good.

126
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,070
If everything holds

127
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,070
for the next 24 hours,

128
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,540
they'll put you back

129
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,540
on solid foods.

130
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,150
Wonderful news.

131
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,250
I also told her

132
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,250
about your nausea.

133
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,080
She'll be over in

134
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,080
a few minutes

135
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,080
with some ondansetron.

136
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,510
Sarah?

137
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,850
I know I haven't

138
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,850
said it enough, but...

139
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,490
Thank you.

140
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,790
I can't tell you

141
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,790
how grateful I am

142
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,800
for all you've done for me

143
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,800
since the transplant.

144
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,430
No, just, uh, one more thing.

145
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,970
It looks like I'll still

146
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,970
be in rehab for a while.

147
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,870
Uh, I haven't checked my mail

148
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,500
since all this happened.

149
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm sure the bills

150
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,020
are piling up.

151
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,540
You want me to run

152
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,540
to your apartment?

153
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,790
Unfortunately, I have no one

154
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,790
else to ask.

155
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,190
All right, but it'll

156
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,190
have to wait a few hours.

157
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,520
Dr. Charles and I have rounds

158
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,520
at Cohn County.

159
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,230
The jail?

160
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,230
Ooh, sounds fascinating.

161
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,360
All right.

162
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,540
Now, this certainly

163
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,540
can wait till after.

164
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,900
It's this key right here.

165
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,510
I made a short list

166
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,510
of things I need.

167
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,750
If you don't mind.

168
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,820
"No clues to

169
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,820
mystery surrounding

170
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,320
"missing college co-eds

171
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,120
"Search for Indiana girl

172
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,120
goes on."

173
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,130
This poor young lady,

174
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,130
Olivia Coveny,

175
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,130
seems to have disappeared

176
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,130
from the Madison campus,

177
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,130
what, about ten years ago?

178
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,200
"Wisconsin girl missing."

179
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,760
What am I looking at?

180
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,470
Seems like somebody

181
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,470
is trying to make a case

182
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,700
that Robert Haywood

183
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,700
is a very bad guy.

184
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,840
Sarah Reese's father?

185
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,840
Yeah.

186
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,810
Well, I mean, apparently,

187
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,810
he was a visiting lecturer

188
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,580
at all of these colleges

189
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,750
at the same time that

190
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,750
these women disappeared.

191
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,760
And you don't know

192
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,760
who sent you this?

193
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,760
Nope. Somebody slipped it

194
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,760
under my door.

195
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,920
Apparently, somebody knows

196
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,920
that I'm working

197
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,920
with Robert Haywood.

198
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,960
I think if you think

199
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,960
there's something there,

200
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,430
you should turn it over

201
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,430
to the police.

202
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,590
Turn what over to the police?

203
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,130
It's all

204
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,130
completely circumstantial.

205
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,830
There's nothing in here

206
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,830
that connects him

207
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,830
to any one of these women.

208
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
And if you read the articles,

209
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
every single one

210
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
of these cases

211
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,110
has been thoroughly

212
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,110
investigated by the police.

213
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,340
You haven't shared this

214
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,340
with Dr. Reese yet, have you?

215
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,110
Absolutely not.

216
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,910
We set up Baghdad

217
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,910
as soon as you called.

218
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,580
How's he doing?

219
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,580
Got an ET tube in

220
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,020
on the right, but held off

221
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,020
on the naloxone.

222
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,280
They don't want him waking up

223
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,280
with a tube in his neck.

224
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,520
But he needs a better airway.

225
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,720
Get me a number eight

226
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,720
trach tube.

227
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,560
You ready to get him

228
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,560
on the monitors?

229
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,030
All right, we're gonna

230
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,030
transfer him on my count.

231
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,770
Everybody ready?

232
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,770
One, two, three.

233
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,270
I'm in.

234
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,270
Bag him.

235
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,310
BP's dropping.

236
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,310
88 over 50.

237
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,080
All right,

238
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,080
he's still intoxicated.

239
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,080
We need to reverse him.

240
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,980
Push 2 milligrams

241
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,980
of naloxone IV.

242
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,260
How's Jeremy?

243
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,760
It's gonna take time

244
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,760
for the drugs to clear

245
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,760
from his system,

246
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,820
but he should be okay.

247
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,130
I'm gonna go home and change.

248
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,310
I'll be back for work

249
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,310
in a couple of hours.

250
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,340
Heroin?

251
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,440
What was she thinking,

252
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,440
going to that party?

253
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,450
I'm not sure

254
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,450
she was thinking.

255
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,450
Hey. How was the game?

256
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm filing a protest

257
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,960
with the league commissioner.

258
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,430
So you lost?

259
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,500
Dr. Manning?

260
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,500
Yes?

261
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,030
Imaging results from

262
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,030
your pregnant patient

263
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,030
in Treatment Four.

264
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,960
You better page CT surgery.

265
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,960
Yeah.

266
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,540
Maggie?

267
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,540
Yeah?

268
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,800
Okay.

269
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,000
Now, the access to the atria

270
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,000
of both hearts.

271
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,640
We're ready to clamp.

272
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,140
Left is clamped.

273
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,280
And the right...

274
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,120
Dr. Bekker will now perform

275
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,120
the separation.

276
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,180
Scalpel.

277
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,550
Josh, have peeds

278
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,550
surgery ready.

279
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,560
What's happening?

280
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,560
Heart rate's diving.

281
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,530
The twins are bradying down.

282
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,530
Dr. Bekker?

283
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,260
I don't know, my incision

284
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,260
was superficial.

285
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,820
Step aside.

286
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,820
Heart rate's down to 44.

287
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,320
There's no bleeding.

288
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,230
We haven't cut near

289
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,230
any major vessels.

290
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,700
We need to push atropine.

291
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,100
No, it's too late.

292
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,840
Congratulations, Dr. Latham.

293
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,280
According to

294
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,280
the computer simulation,

295
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,980
your team just killed

296
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,980
both twins.

297
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,250
Yes, we did.

298
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,250
I don't know what happened.

299
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,790
That's why we conduct

300
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,790
these exercises, Dr. Bekker,

301
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,550
so that we can predict

302
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,550
all outcomes

303
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,790
and make the necessary

304
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,790
adjustments on game day.

305
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,160
Dr. Frisch, my team

306
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,160
will evaluate our approach

307
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,160
and determine what went wrong.

308
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,130
We'll gather again

309
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,130
this afternoon

310
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,130
and resume the procedure.

311
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,360
I'd like all

312
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,360
possible scenarios

313
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,360
on my desk before lunch.

314
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,470
Yes, Dr. Latham.

315
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,640
Keep your chin up.

316
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,640
You'll figure it out.

317
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,040
You know, you don't

318
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,040
have to do that.

319
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,470
What?

320
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,140
Act like you don't enjoy

321
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,140
seeing me on the hot seat.

322
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,610
Go ahead and buy it.

323
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,380
If I were in your position,

324
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,380
I would.

325
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,220
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker,

326
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,220
they need you in the ED.

327
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,620
Okay.

328
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,390
You're saying I have

329
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,390
damage to my heart?

330
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,120
Uh, to be specific,

331
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,120
it's your mitrovalve.

332
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,360
Uh, when it's not

333
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,360
functioning properly,

334
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,260
the body doesn't get

335
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,260
enough oxygen.

336
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,460
Which is why you've

337
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,460
been feeling so weak

338
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,460
and short of breath.

339
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,940
But she's never had any

340
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,940
problems with

341
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,940
her heart before.

342
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,870
In all likelihood,

343
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,870
Tracy was born with a defect,

344
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,710
and it just didn't show

345
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,710
any symptoms until now.

346
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,750
Um, the baby has apparently

347
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,750
added strain to your heart,

348
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,510
which has caused it

349
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,510
to present itself.

350
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,820
We'll need surgery

351
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,820
to replace

352
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,820
the defective valve.

353
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,380
Oh...

354
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,150
Okay.

355
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,360
There are...

356
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,360
Potential complications.

357
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,960
Complications?

358
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,160
Due to your pregnancy,

359
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,500
the medication needed

360
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,500
to conduct the surgery

361
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,010
could cause a life threatening

362
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,010
vaginal bleed,

363
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,700
and given that your fetus

364
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,700
hasn't reached viability...

365
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,510
What are you saying?

366
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,520
We think it's best for

367
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,520
your health if you terminate

368
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,520
before undergoing surgery.

369
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,950
What? No.

370
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,520
You don't understand.

371
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,260
Her husband, Roy...

372
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,920
We lost him in a car accident

373
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,920
three months ago.

374
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,460
We had just got the news

375
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,460
that I was pregnant.

376
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,660
He was so excited.

377
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,330
He wanted this so bad.

378
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,340
Tracy, trust me,

379
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,780
I understand

380
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,780
what you're going through,

381
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,110
but without this surgery,

382
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,980
neither you nor your baby

383
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,980
will survive.

384
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,690
Honey, please...

385
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,690
Listen to the doctors.

386
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,120
No. No!

387
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,620
This baby is all I have left.

388
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,390
I won't let you

389
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,390
take it from me.

390
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,950
The patient understands

391
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,950
that, without surgery,

392
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,950
condition could be fatal?

393
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,280
Yeah, we explained the risks.

394
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,180
Well, so, your concerns

395
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,180
are certainly justified.

396
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,950
We need blood thinners to keep

397
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,950
the bypass pump for clotting.

398
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,290
Hm. Have you

399
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,290
considered a minimally

400
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,290
invasive valvuloplasty?

401
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,820
Yes, but due to

402
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,820
the level of stenosis

403
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,990
and the presence

404
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,990
of regurgitation,

405
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,690
we don't feel that

406
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,690
she's a candidate.

407
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,920
We have to open her chest.

408
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
What if there is

409
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
another option?

410
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,460
What?

411
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,730
If we lower the dose

412
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,730
of the blood thinners

413
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,500
and use a heparin-coated

414
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,500
bypass tube,

415
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,940
there is a chance

416
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,940
that we could

417
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,940
save both mom and baby.

418
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,440
According to Dr. Manning,

419
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,840
Tracy's Level Two ultrasound

420
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,840
showed placenta previa,

421
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,970
which puts her at

422
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,970
an even greater risk

423
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,970
of developing a serious bleed.

424
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,980
Ava, you heard what she said.

425
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,880
This baby is all she has left

426
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,880
of her dead husband.

427
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,350
Don't we have an obligation

428
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,350
to honor the patient's wishes?

429
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,390
So, we should let

430
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,390
the patient's

431
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,390
emotional involvement

432
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,950
impact our medical decisions?

433
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,860
I think we owe it to her

434
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,860
to give it a shot, yes.

435
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,160
With close monitoring,

436
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,160
it is possible

437
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,700
to stay ahead of any bleeding.

438
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,860
Dr. Rhodes, if you believe

439
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,860
that this is the best

440
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,860
course of action,

441
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,730
please proceed.

442
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,730
Thank you.

443
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,410
Well... Good luck.

444
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,790
Are you taking her

445
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,790
up to surgery?

446
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,520
Yeah. I'm worried about her.

447
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,060
Connor's taking a big risk.

448
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,650
Hey, you two, Treatment Six.

449
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,890
Okay.

450
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,300
Hi.

451
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,900
You must be Cody.

452
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,300
What's his temp?

453
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,300
102.

454
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,740
He's been like this

455
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,740
for over a week.

456
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,880
Uh, I've had him on Tamiflu,

457
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,880
bed rest, fluids.

458
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,610
We've tried everything.

459
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,610
He... He just keeps

460
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,610
getting worse.

461
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,020
It's been an extremely

462
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,020
harsh flu season.

463
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,310
Is anyone else

464
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,310
in your household sick?

465
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,790
No, it's just the two of us.

466
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,260
I've been spared so far,

467
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,850
I assume 'cause

468
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,850
I was vaccinated.

469
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,020
And what about Cody?

470
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,930
Uh, unfortunately not.

471
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,890
No, I know

472
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,890
what you're thinking.

473
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,890
It's not like that.

474
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,360
Uh, Cody has a...

475
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,360
A long list of allergies.

476
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,600
Last year, he had a severe

477
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,600
reaction to the vaccine.

478
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,160
I didn't wanna put him

479
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,160
through that again, you know?

480
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,840
I understand, all right.

481
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,840
It makes sense why you didn't

482
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,840
wanna get him vaccinated.

483
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,070
Let's get a CBC, CMP,

484
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,070
and a chest X-ray, okay?

485
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,010
I promise we're gonna do

486
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,010
everything we can to take care

487
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,010
of your son, okay?

488
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,180
We'll be back soon.

489
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,190
All right...

490
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,190
Couple of more seconds

491
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,190
and I'll have the valve free.

492
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,320
No evidence of bleeding.

493
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,450
Good.

494
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,860
There. Got it.

495
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,200
All right,

496
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,200
let's get a sizing tool.

497
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,470
I'm gonna measure the opening,

498
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,470
determine what size valve

499
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,470
we need.

500
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,900
Let's start with a 21.

501
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,250
Yep. Let's open

502
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,250
a 21-millimeter

503
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,250
porcine valve.

504
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,220
Manufacturer had

505
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,220
some production delays

506
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,980
with that size valve.

507
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,980
It's on backorder.

508
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,420
But I have a mechanical.

509
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,290
Can we get one

510
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,290
from another supplier?

511
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,690
Sure, but it'll take

512
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,690
an hour or more

513
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,700
for a rep to get here.

514
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,700
Marty?

515
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,860
With any other patient, maybe,

516
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,330
but every minute

517
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,330
this woman's on pump

518
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,370
reduces her chances of

519
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,370
maintaining this pregnancy.

520
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,030
Okay, then let's open

521
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,030
the mechanical valve.

522
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,440
Mechanical valve means she'll

523
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,440
need heparin post-operatively.

524
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,880
She'll be more likely

525
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,880
to bleed.

526
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,910
We need to wait for a porcine.

527
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,910
You heard what Marty said.

528
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,610
This baby

529
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,610
doesn't have an hour.

530
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,610
We don't have a choice.

531
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,900
Thank you again for stopping.

532
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,900
It saves me so much time.

533
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Right on the way back from

534
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Cohn County. Pretty easy.

535
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,760
I'll only be

536
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,760
a couple of minutes.

537
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,430
You know, it's a pretty hefty

538
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,430
list your dad left for you.

539
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Are you sure you don't want

540
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
some help?

541
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
Do you mind? In case

542
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
I can't fit it all in one box?

543
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,710
Not at all.

544
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,990
I'll go pack some clothes.

545
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,160
He said he wanted

546
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,160
a book or two?

547
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,990
Yeah, I think his office

548
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,990
is down the hall.

549
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,030
Dr. Charles, you ready?

550
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,030
Yeah.

551
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,730
Do you have a book?

552
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,040
Right over here.

553
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,820
You made it.

554
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,820
On time.

555
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,590
Don't act

556
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,590
so surprised.

557
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,320
How's he doing?

558
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,960
Stable for the moment.

559
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,330
Uh... Listen,

560
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,140
about this morning...

561
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,770
Thanks for being there.

562
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,240
Yeah.

563
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,240
Guess I better get to work.

564
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,270
I'll check in later.

565
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,520
You hear about

566
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,520
the missing Percocet?

567
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,020
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

568
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,020
It was a chaotic day.

569
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,120
You know, I hate to even

570
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,120
mention this, but,

571
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,860
you don't think

572
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,860
Emily could've had

573
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,020
something to do with it,

574
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,020
do you?

575
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,160
What?

576
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,160
She was working that day,

577
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,160
she had access,

578
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,640
and now her friend

579
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,640
OD's at a party?

580
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,340
And how'd she afford

581
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,340
those new Louboutins?

582
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,670
Lou... Loubout... what?

583
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,670
The shoes she had on.

584
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,110
Do you know how expensive

585
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,110
they are?

586
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,740
April, you're the one

587
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,740
that keeps telling me

588
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,740
to give her a chance.

589
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,550
Did Emily show poor judgment

590
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,550
this morning? Absolutely.

591
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,480
But this kid OD'd on heroin,

592
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,480
not Percocet.

593
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,760
Is there something else

594
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,760
about Emily I'm missing?

595
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,450
No, uh... I'm sorry.

596
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,020
Forget I mentioned it.

597
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,660
Okay.

598
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,090
So, get this,

599
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,340
it turns out that

600
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,340
Robert Haywood did know

601
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,670
one of those co-eds

602
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,670
that disappeared:

603
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,330
Olivia Coveny.

604
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,330
Oh, yeah?

605
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,500
The one from Madison,

606
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,500
yeah, was his student.

607
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,240
And I saw a picture of 'em

608
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,240
together this morning

609
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,240
at his apartment.

610
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,510
Wait a minute,

611
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,750
you... You went

612
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,750
to his apartment?

613
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,210
Sarah and I were doing rounds

614
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,210
at the jail this morning,

615
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,190
and she needed to pick up

616
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,190
some of this stuff,

617
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,050
and so we just stopped

618
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,050
on the way back.

619
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,520
But what happened to,

620
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,390
"We're gonna forget

621
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,390
all about it"?

622
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,450
She asked for my help.

623
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,450
What am I supposed to do,

624
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,450
sit in the car?

625
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,500
And I couldn't help, seeing

626
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,500
the picture was right there.

627
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,070
And, by the way,

628
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,070
part of me says,

629
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,360
"So they knew each other.

630
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,360
So what?

631
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,130
"Student, you know, teacher."

632
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,860
But the thing is

633
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,860
that in the picture,

634
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,860
he had his arm around her.

635
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,800
Well, have you

636
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,800
considered calling

637
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,870
the Madison Police Department?

638
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,870
No, I did.

639
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,740
The detective I talked to,

640
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,910
I don't know, he just

641
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,910
didn't seem that interested.

642
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,110
You know, ten years ago,

643
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,110
it's a cold case.

644
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,020
If I only had, like, two more

645
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,020
minutes in that apartment.

646
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,080
Daniel...

647
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,080
What?

648
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,090
Be careful.

649
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,600
Sats are dropping.

650
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,600
What's happening?

651
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,860
Respiratory failure.

652
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,860
Bag him.

653
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,670
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

654
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,670
We need to intubate now.

655
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,800
Sats are down to 87.

656
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,710
Nat...

657
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,710
I'm almost there.

658
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,620
Oh, God...

659
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,620
82.

660
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,130
I'm in.

661
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,160
Now, let's get

662
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,160
10 parts per million

663
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,160
of inhaled nitric oxide.

664
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,990
Let's get a chest X-ray

665
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,990
for tube placement.

666
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,070
Dad?

667
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,940
Oh, Sarah.

668
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,580
She's even lovelier

669
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,580
than you said.

670
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,820
Thank you.

671
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,760
I should probably get going,

672
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,760
but, um...

673
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,570
Thank you, Robert.

674
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,600
This has meant so much to me.

675
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,270
As to me.

676
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,480
What was that all about?

677
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,920
That... Was the widow

678
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,010
of my heart donor.

679
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,820
She had asked to meet me.

680
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,730
I admit I was reticent

681
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,730
about the whole thing,

682
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,660
but, surprisingly,

683
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,590
it felt good.

684
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,570
Sats are still in the tank.

685
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,570
Nitric oxide didn't work.

686
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,480
Neither did

687
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,480
low volume ventilation.

688
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,770
Where's the mom?

689
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,250
She went to grab

690
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,250
a cup of coffee.

691
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,080
We should get him

692
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,080
up to the PICU.

693
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,710
I called already.

694
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,710
They don't have

695
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,710
an isolation room available.

696
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,250
This flu epidemic

697
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,250
is wreaking havoc.

698
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,580
It's time to consider ECMO.

699
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,950
Yeah.

700
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,420
Hey, uh,

701
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,420
what do you think of this?

702
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,390
A rash?

703
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,390
Mm-hmm.

704
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,230
It's not abnormal.

705
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,870
I'll call the ICU, see if

706
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,870
they have an extra iso room.

707
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,280
Dr. Choi, we need you.

708
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,010
He's having a seizure.

709
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,010
Push 2 of Ativan.

710
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,680
All right, take it easy,

711
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,680
take it easy.

712
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,850
His eyes are icteric.

713
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,850
There's something wrong

714
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,850
with his liver.

715
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,510
From the heroin?

716
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,320
Not likely.

717
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,320
Did we get his labs back?

718
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,010
I think they came in

719
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,010
a few minutes ago.

720
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,590
Okay.

721
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,560
Positive for acetaminophen.

722
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,560
That's in Percocet.

723
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,270
Uh, let's also start a NAC,

724
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,270
140 milligrams per kilogram.

725
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,460
Okay.

726
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,420
April, what you said

727
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,420
about the missing drugs...

728
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,050
Oh, forget it,

729
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,050
I shouldn't have gone there.

730
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Actually, you should've.

731
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,720
I thought this kid

732
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,720
OD'd on heroin,

733
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,160
but his labs

734
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,160
came back positive

735
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,890
for both opioids

736
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,890
and acetaminophen.

737
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,960
I can't tell it's exactly

738
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,960
what he took, but,

739
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,030
the most likely source is

740
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,030
Percocet, our missing drug.

741
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,930
You thought from the beginning

742
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,930
this could be a possibility.

743
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,160
Why?

744
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,160
I don't know.

745
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,300
Maybe what you've told me

746
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,300
about her history.

747
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,140
April, what aren't

748
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,140
you telling me?

749
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,970
Remember that first day

750
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,970
Emily came to stay with you?

751
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,040
Yeah.

752
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,110
She cleaned up

753
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,110
and cooked dinner.

754
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,750
She also had

755
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,750
some people over.

756
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,310
I found an ash tray

757
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,310
full of cigarette butts

758
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,310
in the bathroom.

759
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,360
You didn't think

760
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,360
I should know?

761
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,290
I just... I wanted you two

762
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,290
to get off on the right foot.

763
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,490
She begged me

764
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,490
not to say anything.

765
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,100
I'm sorry.

766
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,100
I should've told you.

767
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,230
Yeah.

768
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,270
I'm gonna go talk to her.

769
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,270
Maybe she'll come clean to me.

770
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,400
No.

771
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,340
She's my sister.

772
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,340
I'll do it.

773
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,680
Dr. Charles,

774
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,680
what a pleasant surprise.

775
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,020
Dr. Haywood, just wanted to...

776
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,590
To stop by,

777
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,590
see how you're doing.

778
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,490
Well, I won't be running

779
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,490
a marathon any time soon,

780
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,220
but I'm getting along

781
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,220
much better.

782
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,890
You know, Sarah told me you

783
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,890
spent some time up in Madison.

784
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,590
I had no idea.

785
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,590
Yeah.

786
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,790
I spent a few semesters.

787
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,360
You know, they keep on

788
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,360
bugging me to come up there

789
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,340
and do a forensic

790
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,340
psychiatry seminar.

791
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
I don't know, worth my time?

792
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
Worth the trip?

793
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,740
I found Madison to be

794
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,310
a bit, uh, claustrophobic.

795
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,540
Good to know.

796
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,510
Could you do me a favor?

797
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,510
Of course.

798
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,380
Would you mind...

799
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,380
Getting me a book

800
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,380
from that box?

801
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,380
Yeah.

802
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,000
Ha, Grisham.

803
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,940
Well, Sarah doesn't

804
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,940
know me very well.

805
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,670
All right, Dr. Haywood,

806
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,480
time for your exercises.

807
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,970
Sorry to cut this short,

808
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,970
Dr. Charles.

809
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,580
I hope you'll stop by

810
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,580
again soon.

811
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,090
You can count on it.

812
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,090
The surgery was a success.

813
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,730
We managed to replace

814
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,730
your valve

815
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,730
and stave off any bleeding.

816
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,430
And the baby?

817
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,660
The baby pulled through

818
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,660
just fine.

819
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,340
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

820
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,800
Thank you.

821
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,230
I'll be back to check in

822
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,230
on you soon,

823
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,900
see how you're doing, okay?

824
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,940
Dr. Rhodes, good work.

825
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,410
Things broke our way

826
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,410
this time.

827
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,750
Nonetheless, well done.

828
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,820
Hey, I was wondering,

829
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,820
uh, has there been

830
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,820
any progress

831
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,320
on the

832
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,320
conjoined twins simulation?

833
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,920
Uh, Dr. Bekker and I suspect

834
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,920
it was the placement

835
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,920
of the clamps

836
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,620
that caused the problem,

837
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,620
but we've already confirmed

838
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,130
that the coronary vessels and

839
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,130
vagus nerve were not affected.

840
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,920
What about

841
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,920
the sinoatrial node?

842
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,890
We hadn't considered that,

843
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,890
given its location.

844
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,560
Well, the anatomy of these

845
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,560
hearts is highly irregular,

846
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,800
so it's possible that

847
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,800
we clamped the SA node

848
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,850
and it cut off the hearts'

849
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,850
electrical activity.

850
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,510
So are you suggesting moving

851
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,510
the L.A. clamp laterally?

852
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Worth a shot.

853
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Ah...

854
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,550
Dr. Rhodes,

855
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,550
why don't we test your theory

856
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,550
before the next simulation?

857
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,020
Meet me in the lab in an hour.

858
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,550
Okay.

859
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,190
I take it that means good

860
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,190
news for Tracy and her baby?

861
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,700
You know

862
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,700
what they say, right?

863
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,700
Fortune favors the bold.

864
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,330
Catheter's in good position.

865
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,900
Let's double-check

866
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,900
circuit tubing,

867
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,270
and set goal flow at 35 to 40

868
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,270
ccs per kilogram per minute.

869
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,640
I was lucky there was

870
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,640
an ECMO available.

871
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,010
I was afraid

872
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,010
they'd all be taken.

873
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,340
Um, you...

874
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,920
I don't think

875
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,920
we should put him on ECMO.

876
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,550
Why not?

877
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,250
The rash on Cody's IV site,

878
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,830
given his history of

879
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,830
intense allergic reactions?

880
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,260
I think he may

881
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,260
have undiagnosed

882
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,260
systemic mastocytosis.

883
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,430
You're jumping to that

884
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,430
from a rash?

885
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,470
Kids with mastocytosis

886
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,470
generally produce

887
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,470
an overabundance of histamine.

888
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,540
If Cody has it,

889
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,540
passing his blood

890
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,010
through the machine could send

891
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,010
him into anaphylactic shock.

892
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,570
Given the state

893
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,570
his lungs are in,

894
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,570
he would not survive that.

895
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,870
Mastocytosis is

896
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,870
extremely rare, Natalie,

897
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,480
and we don't have time for

898
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,480
a biopsy to confirm it.

899
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,740
Dr. Halstead, we're ready.

900
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,750
All right.

901
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,250
What about PLV?

902
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,250
Partial liquid ventilation?

903
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,990
I thought that was reserved

904
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,990
for preemies.

905
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,920
There have been

906
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,920
some clinical trials

907
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,920
with encouraging results.

908
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,600
PLV's a good idea, in theory.

909
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,490
I... I'm not sure we should be

910
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,490
risking a kid's life

911
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,000
by using a treatment

912
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,000
that's unproven.

913
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,860
Will, I know we've had

914
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,860
our disagreements,

915
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,800
but I really think

916
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,800
this could work.

917
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,740
Your patient, your call.

918
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,180
Stop. We're not

919
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,180
putting him on ECMO.

920
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,030
Wait a minute, you're

921
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,030
saying you wanna drown my son?

922
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,520
I assure you, Karen,

923
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,520
Cody will not drown.

924
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,660
But you're gonna

925
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,660
fill his lungs with fluid.

926
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,160
It's called Perflubron.

927
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,700
It has unique properties,

928
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,740
including the ability to hold

929
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,740
large amounts of oxygen.

930
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,630
Yeah, at this point,

931
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,630
Cody's lungs are too damaged

932
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,400
to absorb oxygen

933
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,400
through the air,

934
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,570
so our hope is

935
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,570
that this treatment

936
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,440
helps oxygen penetrate

937
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,440
Cody's lungs

938
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,310
and restore his breathing.

939
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,850
Have you done this before?

940
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,850
Um...

941
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,950
This procedure is performed

942
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,950
quite often with neonates.

943
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,460
We feel strongly

944
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,460
it's the best chance we have

945
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,460
at saving your son's life.

946
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,560
Okay. Go ahead.

947
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,870
Maggie, I'm gonna

948
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,870
be out-of-pocket

949
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,870
for a little bit.

950
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,770
For how long?

951
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,770
Uh, three or four hours.

952
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,240
If anybody needs me,

953
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,240
just redirect

954
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,240
them to Dr. Kwon.

955
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,430
You got it.

956
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,430
Daniel...

957
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,010
Where are you going?

958
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,950
Robert Haywood still has

959
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,950
a storage locker

960
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,950
in Madison, Wisconsin

961
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,420
that he rented before

962
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,420
Olivia Coveny disappeared.

963
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,850
Okay?

964
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,590
Okay, so I'm going up there

965
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,590
to check it out.

966
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,750
Come on, Daniel,

967
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,300
let the proper authorities

968
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,300
handle it.

969
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,890
The proper authorities,

970
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,890
they're just not

971
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,890
that interested right now.

972
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,900
I have a limited window.

973
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,900
Stop.

974
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,060
Look, I know you're trying

975
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,060
to protect Dr. Reese,

976
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,160
but no matter what you find,

977
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,210
you are really putting your

978
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,210
relationship with her at risk.

979
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,140
Sharon, if there's

980
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,140
even a remote chance

981
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,480
that any of

982
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,480
this stuff is true,

983
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,640
and, trust me,

984
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,640
I don't want it to be,

985
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,210
it's a risk

986
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,210
I'm willing to take.

987
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,090
Hear you might have

988
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,090
found a solution.

989
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,460
Fingers crossed.

990
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,560
Looks like it's all coming up

991
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,560
roses for you today.

992
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,730
You two, join me.

993
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,730
Yes, sir.

994
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,070
I mean, I'm still hoping it's

995
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,070
me who gets to do the surgery.

996
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,500
No surprise there.

997
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,110
If we move the two clamps

998
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,110
to the center of the bridge,

999
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,110
between the two atria,

1000
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,610
that could solve our problem.

1001
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,350
I'll let Dr. Frisch know

1002
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,350
that we're ready

1003
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,350
to run another simulation.

1004
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,410
Okay.

1005
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,390
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker,

1006
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,390
they need you back in the ICU.

1007
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,090
What's going on?

1008
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,560
Her BP just

1009
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,560
started plummeting.

1010
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,900
Bag her.

1011
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,900
What's going on

1012
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,900
with my daughter?

1013
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,330
Uh, ma'am...

1014
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,330
She's hemorrhaging.

1015
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,700
Uh... All right.

1016
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,670
All right, hang 2 units

1017
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,670
of o-neg on a pressure bag.

1018
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,840
Give me the ultrasound.

1019
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,840
We need to check her fetus

1020
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,000
and take a look

1021
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,000
at her placenta.

1022
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,810
Placenta's marginally

1023
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,810
separating, causing her

1024
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,810
to bleed.

1025
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,860
Fetal heart tones are strong.

1026
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,860
We'll reverse

1027
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,860
the blood thinners.

1028
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,620
Hopefully, the placenta

1029
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,620
will tamponade itself.

1030
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,420
If we reverse the thinners,

1031
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,420
her new valve could clot off.

1032
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,780
We'll lose mom and baby.

1033
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,780
We have to get her to the O.R.

1034
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,350
Look, we can still save

1035
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,350
this pregnancy.

1036
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,590
It's too late for that.

1037
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,220
If we have any hope of

1038
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,220
getting control of this bleed,

1039
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,820
she needs

1040
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,820
an emergency hysterectomy.

1041
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,790
Stop the heparin drip.

1042
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,790
Bolus a gram of TXA.

1043
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,530
We're not gonna lose

1044
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,530
either of them.

1045
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,310
He still hasn't woken up.

1046
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,310
No.

1047
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,680
How well do you know Jeremy?

1048
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,590
Not that well.

1049
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,590
I mean, just from around.

1050
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,920
I had no idea

1051
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,920
he was using heroin.

1052
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,820
I don't think that's

1053
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,820
what Jeremy OD'd on.

1054
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,150
No?

1055
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,150
No.

1056
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,930
Pretty sure it was Percocet,

1057
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,600
which, coincidentally,

1058
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,600
is the same drug

1059
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,660
that went missing from

1060
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,660
the dispensary last week.

1061
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,760
So?

1062
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,530
What, are you suggesting

1063
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,530
that I took them?

1064
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,900
Did you?

1065
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,900
You know how easy it is

1066
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,840
to score pharmaceuticals

1067
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,840
on the street?

1068
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,400
Jeremy could've gotten them

1069
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,400
from anyone.

1070
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,640
But he was at the party

1071
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,640
with you.

1072
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,150
Ethan, I swear,

1073
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,150
I didn't take those drugs.

1074
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,080
So where'd you get the money

1075
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,080
for the Louboutins?

1076
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,850
Louboutins?

1077
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,560
What do you even know

1078
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,560
about Louboutins?

1079
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,820
She put you up to this,

1080
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,820
didn't she?

1081
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,460
Your uptight narc

1082
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,460
of a girlfriend.

1083
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,630
You know, all the two of you

1084
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,630
have done since I moved in

1085
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,640
is hover around,

1086
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,640
waiting for me

1087
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,640
to make a mistake.

1088
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,690
That's not true.

1089
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,170
Yeah, all my life

1090
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,170
it's been like this.

1091
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,270
You know, I've had it.

1092
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,270
Emily...

1093
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,330
No, I'm not working

1094
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,330
some place that

1095
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,330
thinks I'm a criminal.

1096
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,940
Emily...

1097
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,940
Happy?

1098
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,810
You got him all

1099
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,810
to yourself now.

1100
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,560
How's she doing?

1101
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,490
She's passing an old clot,

1102
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,490
but there's no more

1103
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,490
active bleeding.

1104
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,060
Placenta looks like

1105
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,060
it tamponaded itself.

1106
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,930
Fetal heart tones are steady.

1107
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,040
We've got a problem.

1108
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
Pressure's down.

1109
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
Heart rate's spiking.

1110
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,740
She's clotting off that valve.

1111
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,250
We need to get her to the O.R.

1112
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,250
and replace the valve.

1113
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,410
Let's go, come on!

1114
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,410
What's happening?

1115
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,880
Stop!

1116
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,760
No pulse.

1117
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,760
She must be in v-fib.

1118
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,450
Let's get a crash cart!

1119
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,450
Come on.

1120
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,820
Come on, Tracy.

1121
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,820
Come on.

1122
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,600
Stay with us.

1123
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,600
Charge to 200.

1124
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,260
Clear!

1125
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,260
No pulse.

1126
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,530
Milligram of epi.

1127
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,610
Please save her! Please!

1128
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,170
Hold compressions.

1129
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,170
Come on.

1130
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,710
Clear!

1131
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,110
Still no pulse.

1132
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,110
Charge again.

1133
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,020
Charge!

1134
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,810
Clear!

1135
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,620
Another milligram of epi.

1136
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,560
Connor...

1137
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,160
She's gone.

1138
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,110
Oh, God, no!

1139
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,400
No, no, no!

1140
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,550
No...

1141
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,620
Time of death, 17:23.

1142
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,180
If you want, I can help

1143
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,180
the mother with the paperwork.

1144
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,690
No. This is my responsibility.

1145
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,070
Ms. Barker, I am so sorry

1146
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,070
for your loss.

1147
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,540
You talked my daughter

1148
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,540
into this,

1149
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,570
and now she's gone forever.

1150
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,070
You did this.

1151
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,170
This is all your fault!

1152
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,770
It's all your fault!

1153
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,150
Dr. Manning...

1154
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,550
Cody's temp's

1155
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,550
back up to 103.7.

1156
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,560
What are his sats?

1157
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,560
83%.

1158
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,790
83? He's getting worse.

1159
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,430
Okay.

1160
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,570
Hey, how's he doing?

1161
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,570
PLV's not working.

1162
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,530
I made a huge mistake, Will.

1163
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,530
Natalie...

1164
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,770
No, I should've just

1165
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,770
put him on ECMO,

1166
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,770
but I got carried away,

1167
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,780
and I might've just put

1168
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,780
his life in jeopardy.

1169
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,440
Why didn't I just

1170
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,440
listen to you?

1171
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,670
Good thing you didn't.

1172
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,340
You were right.

1173
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,340
What?

1174
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,750
Cody tested positive

1175
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,750
for mastocytosis.

1176
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,180
If you had put Cody on ECMO,

1177
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,220
he could've gone into

1178
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,220
anaphylactic shock.

1179
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,520
You may have

1180
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,520
just saved his life.

1181
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,200
No, I haven't...

1182
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,200
Not yet.

1183
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,070
Guess things got out of hand

1184
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,070
last night.

1185
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,700
Yeah, you're lucky

1186
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,700
Emily called us.

1187
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,570
According to your blood work,

1188
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,570
you had a high concentration

1189
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,940
of opioids in your system,

1190
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,540
along with toxic levels

1191
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,540
of acetaminophen.

1192
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,750
Most likely due

1193
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,750
to the Percocet.

1194
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,080
Yeah.

1195
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,080
So where'd you get

1196
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,080
those pills?

1197
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,480
Do you have a prescription?

1198
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,480
No...

1199
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,680
I mean... My dad does.

1200
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,990
He had back surgery

1201
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,990
a few weeks ago.

1202
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,390
I swept some from

1203
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,390
his medicine cabinet.

1204
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,890
I feel like an idiot.

1205
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,290
Get some rest.

1206
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,290
We'll check on you soon.

1207
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,200
You think he's telling

1208
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,200
the truth?

1209
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,430
No reason to doubt him.

1210
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,150
When it comes to my sister,

1211
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,150
I'm so used

1212
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,150
to assuming the worst.

1213
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,410
I never should've accused her

1214
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,410
of stealing those drugs.

1215
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,450
Have Noah work up

1216
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,450
Jeremy's discharge.

1217
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,820
I need to find Emily,

1218
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,820
make things right.

1219
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,270
Dr. Manning?

1220
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,060
Yes?

1221
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,310
Cody's sats are

1222
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,310
back above 90.

1223
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,320
Looks like he's out

1224
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,320
of the woods.

1225
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,420
Thank you for saving my boy.

1226
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,190
Of course.

1227
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,090
I just found out myself.

1228
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,490
Neurology's in there now,

1229
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,490
doing a quick exam.

1230
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,900
You know what,

1231
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,900
we did good today.

1232
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,800
Yeah, we did, didn't we?

1233
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,400
I mean, together.

1234
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,790
Dr. Rhodes, good.

1235
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,590
We're just about

1236
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,590
to get started.

1237
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,890
You coming?

1238
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,390
Dr. Latham,

1239
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,390
with your permission,

1240
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,300
I would like to remove myself

1241
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,300
from the team.

1242
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,700
Why?

1243
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,370
I think it would be best

1244
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,370
for the patients

1245
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,370
and for everyone involved.

1246
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,180
A surgery with

1247
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,180
this level of difficulty

1248
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,180
and in that environment...

1249
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,050
I don't know that

1250
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,050
I can trust my judgment.

1251
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,950
Are you sure about this?

1252
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,020
Yes.

1253
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,750
Mm.

1254
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,620
Very well.

1255
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,480
So, your dad had

1256
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,480
back surgery?

1257
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,450
Yeah.

1258
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,980
Awfully convenient.

1259
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,650
Well, I told you,

1260
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,830
that's where I got them.

1261
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,990
Mm-hmm.

1262
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,060
According to your tox screen,

1263
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,060
the Percocet you took

1264
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,060
were hospital grade.

1265
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,700
That means they

1266
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,700
didn't come from

1267
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,700
your dad's medicine cabinet.

1268
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,840
Possessing a Schedule Two

1269
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,840
narcotic with

1270
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,840
that level of potency

1271
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,380
is a felony offense.

1272
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,940
Now, I'm not gonna report you,

1273
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,350
but I need you to tell me.

1274
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,080
Emily.

1275
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,820
She sold them to me.

1276
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,990
Emily?

1277
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,630
Em?

1278
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,260
What's up?

1279
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,640
You want a rematch?

1280
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,340
I was just wondering,

1281
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,380
are you still holding onto

1282
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,380
Mom's wedding ring?

1283
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,950
Yeah, of course.

1284
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,950
Why wouldn't I?

1285
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,480
Oh...

1286
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,920
Just try not to be

1287
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,920
a knucklehead.

1288
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,630
Okay, uh, well, come on in,

1289
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,460
and I'll go get it.
