1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,270
The conjoined twins

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,270
Dot and Lily Cronin

3
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,270
spent an uneventful night

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,630
in our pediatric

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,630
intensive care unit.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,830
They'll be evaluated

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,830
this morning,

8
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,240
and if they remain stable,

9
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,240
the surgical team,

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,710
under the supervision of

11
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,710
Dr. Frisch and Dr. Latham,

12
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,980
will attempt to separate them.

13
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,420
Lungs sound clear.

14
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,450
The latest chest X-rays

15
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,450
are good.

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,850
No infiltrates.

17
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,560
Vitals and saturation

18
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,560
are stable.

19
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,920
The girls are healthy.

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,930
In my opinion, they're

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,930
strong enough for surgery.

22
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,730
Dr. Rhodes?

23
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,730
I agree with Dr. Bekker.

24
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,030
Actually, Dr. Rhodes will

25
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,030
not be in the operating room.

26
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,970
Dr. Latham and I

27
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,970
will be performing

28
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,870
the cardiothoracic portion

29
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,870
of the separation.

30
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,970
What?

31
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,870
You've been so involved

32
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,870
since the beginning.

33
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,770
What if we spoke

34
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,770
to Dr. Frisch?

35
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,680
Believe me, Dot and Lily have

36
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,680
the finest surgeons

37
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,680
in the hospital.

38
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,880
We'll be back soon

39
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,880
to take the babies to the O.R.

40
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,780
Excuse me.

41
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,180
Connor.

42
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,900
Why aren't you on the team?

43
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,660
He pulled himself out.

44
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,060
Why?

45
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,830
Because we lost a patient?

46
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,840
I lost her and her baby,

47
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,970
because of my poor judgment.

48
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,980
I made the wrong call

49
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,980
on her treatment.

50
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,870
But the Cronins

51
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,870
are counting on you.

52
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,240
They're counting on the team.

53
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,340
She's right.

54
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,750
Look, I can understand if

55
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,750
you're having second thoughts.

56
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,480
Yeah.

57
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,340
I'm worried about my sister.

58
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,140
Why? She told you

59
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,140
she was going to Las Vegas.

60
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,010
Yeah, but she's not returning

61
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,010
my calls or texts.

62
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,180
She's ashamed

63
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,180
she stole those drugs

64
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,180
and lied about it.

65
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,710
I still think we could've

66
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,710
handled it better.

67
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,280
Handled it better?

68
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,280
Emily committed a crime.

69
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,550
She's lucky

70
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,550
she wasn't arrested.

71
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,790
As soon as she

72
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,790
wants something,

73
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,790
I'm sure you'll hear from her.

74
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,880
Morning.

75
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,880
Good morning.

76
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,720
What?

77
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,720
Dr. Halstead, incoming.

78
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,490
Hey, after work...

79
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,490
Mm-hmm?

80
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,690
You wanna meet me

81
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,690
on the balcony?

82
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,820
Okay.

83
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,820
All right.

84
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,660
Monique, with us. Cesar?

85
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,030
Bert Goodwin,

86
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,030
60-year-old male.

87
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,090
Goodwin?

88
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,430
Trauma One.

89
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
Neighbors found him

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
unconscious in the garage.

91
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,770
Motor running.

92
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,770
Intubated in the field.

93
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

94
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,410
Tachycardic at 120.

95
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,410
BP, 145 over 95.

96
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,340
EKG shows

97
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,340
slight ST depressions.

98
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,750
Sats at 92%.

99
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,750
Okay, on my count,

100
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,750
one, two, three.

101
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,150
Monique, 12-lead EKG.

102
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,250
We need

103
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,250
a carboxyhemoglobin level.

104
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,220
CBC, BMP, coags, lactate,

105
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,220
troponins, and a chest X-ray.

106
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,060
Got it.

107
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,060
Maggie, call the ICU.

108
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,430
Have them set up

109
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,430
a hyperbaric chamber.

110
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,490
Copy.

111
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,830
And page Ms. Goodwin.

112
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,830
Let her know.

113
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,570
Is this her husband?

114
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,570
Ex-husband.

115
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,900
How's the position

116
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,900
of the twins?

117
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,440
Good for peds surgery.

118
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,350
CT?

119
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,350
Bit of a shadow in my field.

120
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,780
Can we adjust the light?

121
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,810
Good.

122
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,350
Has everyone

123
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,350
got room to work?

124
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,620
No, bypass is in my way.

125
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,320
What if you move the machine

126
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,320
to the foot of the bed?

127
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,750
You could run the tubing

128
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,750
along the sides.

129
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,690
That way, you won't cross

130
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,690
with anesthesia.

131
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,230
Ah. Good idea.

132
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,900
Tell me again

133
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,900
why you're not in there.

134
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,410
So, are we good to go?

135
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,070
All right, it's show time.

136
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,850
The pressure in the chamber

137
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,850
unbinds carbon monoxide

138
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,850
from hemoglobin.

139
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,580
It allows oxygen to bind.

140
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,060
Now, we've already seen

141
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,060
a significant improvement.

142
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,390
Bert's carbon monoxide levels

143
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,990
are down from 55% to 15.

144
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
Now, at 10%, we can

145
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
take him out of the chamber

146
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,170
and lighten the sedation.

147
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,240
He could've pulled into

148
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,240
the garage and fallen asleep.

149
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,220
Maybe he had a mild stroke.

150
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,220
We'll test for that.

151
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,550
His girlfriend died,

152
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,550
Dr. Halstead.

153
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,080
He tried to kill himself.

154
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,860
Dr. Choi, that homeless girl

155
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,860
that you treated

156
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,860
a couple months ago,

157
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,630
she's back with her friend.

158
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,190
They're asking for you.

159
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,800
Hey, Nat...

160
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah?

161
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,000
You free?

162
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,770
Kiki, Deb,

163
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,770
you remember Dr. Manning.

164
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,470
What's going on?

165
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,470
Oh, she's really sick.

166
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,270
BP's 102 over 68.

167
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Heart rate, 112.

168
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Temp, 100.

169
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,350
My stomach hurts. Headaches.

170
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,970
You are running a fever,

171
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,970
so let's take a look

172
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,680
and see what's going on,

173
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,680
all right?

174
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,090
Hey, Deb, you're looking

175
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,090
a little under

176
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,090
the weather too.

177
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,390
I'm just tired.

178
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,790
Still living on the streets?

179
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,360
It's okay.

180
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,360
Not so cold.

181
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,330
Her liver is

182
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,330
slightly enlarged.

183
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm gonna be sick.

184
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,300
Okay.

185
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,630
We can help you

186
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,630
with the nausea.

187
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,900
4 milligrams of Zofran.

188
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,340
We'll run some tests.

189
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,140
Let's get a CBC, BMP, LFT,

190
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,140
hepatitis panel.

191
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,570
Whoa, whoa.

192
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,910
Ah. Let's get Deb

193
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,910
into a room,

194
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,910
take a look at her.

195
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay. Come on, I got ya.

196
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,310
Better run the same labs

197
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,310
for Deb too.

198
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,710
Yeah.

199
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,410
Mr. Goodwin,

200
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,410
do you remember me?

201
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,790
I'm Dr. Halstead.

202
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,390
Mr. Goodwin...

203
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,390
I remember.

204
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,450
Good.

205
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,930
Can you follow my finger?

206
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
Okay. How 'bout this?

207
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,100
Can you touch your right

208
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,100
forefinger to your nose?

209
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
Mr. Goodwin,

210
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
can you try to touch

211
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,370
your right forefinger

212
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,370
to your nose or...

213
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,140
Why didn't you just

214
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,140
let me die?

215
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,830
We're gonna get you

216
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,830
through this.

217
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,470
I'll be back

218
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,470
to check on you soon.

219
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,340
I think he'll be okay.

220
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,610
Damn, Bert.

221
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,880
How could you do this?

222
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,620
Can't you think of

223
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,620
anyone else but yourself?

224
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,180
Sharon, come on.

225
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,460
It... It's selfish

226
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,460
and pathetic.

227
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,650
Not helping right now.

228
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,530
Attempted suicide is an

229
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,530
automatic five-day psych hold.

230
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,590
Fine.

231
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,370
Sharon, do you have a minute?

232
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,100
The board wants

233
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,100
to meet with you.

234
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,840
What is it?

235
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,840
More complaining about

236
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,840
the money we're spending?

237
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,270
I have to go.

238
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,270
Sharon...

239
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,540
Look, I have a situation

240
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,540
to deal with.

241
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,670
Tell them

242
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,670
I'll get back to them.

243
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,220
This facility, Holly Oaks,

244
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,320
has a good

245
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,320
staff-to-resident ratio.

246
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,090
They also have a nice package

247
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,090
of supplemental services.

248
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,090
Art, music, pet therapy.

249
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,860
It's still a nursing home.

250
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,850
It's a cardiac rehab facility.

251
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,960
Why can't I go back

252
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,960
to my apartment?

253
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,590
No. You just got

254
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,590
a new heart.

255
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,840
You have to be monitored

256
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,840
very closely,

257
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,430
particularly for

258
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,430
the first three months.

259
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,470
I don't deserve you.

260
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,050
Can we just focus on

261
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,050
finding you a place to live?

262
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,410
You're about to be discharged.

263
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,620
But it's true, Sarah...

264
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,020
I don't deserve you.

265
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,920
Dr. Haywood, time to get you

266
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,920
in the cardiac chair.

267
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,360
Can't it wait?

268
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,360
No.

269
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,690
No, you have

270
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,690
to change position

271
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,690
to prevent pneumonia.

272
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,250
Find a place you like.

273
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,640
We have

274
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,640
a public health issue.

275
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,100
Liver panels came back.

276
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,230
Both Kiki and Deb

277
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,230
tested positive for Hep A.

278
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,470
Oh, no.

279
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,140
We need to admit them

280
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,140
to the PICU.

281
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,370
Yeah, but then what?

282
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,110
It'll only be

283
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,110
for a couple days.

284
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,610
Then they'll wanna go

285
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,610
back out on the streets,

286
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,170
and they'll be...

287
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,170
They'll be contagious.

288
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,380
Highly contagious.

289
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,380
We have to report this.

290
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,910
I understand they live

291
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,910
in some kind of encampment?

292
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,550
Yeah, with a bunch of

293
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,550
other kids in close quarters.

294
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,360
It's got to be cleared out.

295
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,360
DCFS will have to find homes

296
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,360
for these kids.

297
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,790
Meanwhile, let's get

298
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,790
a team over there

299
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,700
to see who else is infected,

300
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,700
and immunize everybody

301
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,700
who's been exposed.

302
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,100
Natalie and I should go.

303
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,870
We've treated them.

304
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,870
They know us, April too.

305
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,340
Okay, I'll stay and

306
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,340
look after Kiki and Deb.

307
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,400
All right.

308
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,610
Please, can we have

309
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,610
just one more minute?

310
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,310
Yeah. Guys, hold on.

311
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,390
We love you so much.

312
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,810
Are we doing the right thing

313
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,810
taking this risk?

314
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,860
Yes.

315
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,840
Look after them, Dr. Rhodes.

316
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,710
Don't let my babies die.

317
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,290
Thomas.

318
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,290
Hey, Dr. Choi.

319
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,630
You know April. Not sure

320
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,630
if you met Dr. Manning,

321
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,170
but she was here with me

322
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,170
a couple months ago.

323
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,230
Thomas, we need

324
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,230
to examine everybody,

325
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,470
but first we need to see

326
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,470
anyone who's not feeling well.

327
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,770
The most sick first.

328
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,900
Laura.

329
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,900
Laura?

330
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,240
Is she the one

331
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,240
who had the baby?

332
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,110
Yeah.

333
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,110
Where is she?

334
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,340
Laura?

335
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,790
Dr. Manning?

336
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,590
Have you seen my baby?

337
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,280
No, but I know she was

338
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,280
adopted by a good family.

339
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,550
Temp's 101.

340
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,420
When was the last time you

341
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,420
had anything to eat or drink?

342
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,460
Significantly jaundiced

343
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,460
and dehydrated.

344
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,520
Liver's enlarged.

345
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
We need to get her

346
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
to the hospital.

347
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,260
No.

348
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,260
Laura, you have to.

349
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,240
You have hepatitis.

350
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,240
You could die.

351
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,360
Call an ambulance.

352
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,340
Thomas, who else is sick?

353
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,070
Over here.

354
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,070
Excuse me.

355
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,090
Hey, I'm Dr. Choi.

356
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,950
Hey.

357
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,590
Emily...

358
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,590
Ethan?

359
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,130
Emily, what are

360
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,130
you doing here?

361
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,330
Nowhere to go.

362
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,030
It's all right, okay?

363
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,400
I messed up.

364
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Have you been able

365
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
to eat or drink anything?

366
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,730
No, it makes me throw up.

367
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,640
Don't worry,

368
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,640
you're gonna be okay.

369
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,640
I'm gonna take care of you.

370
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,100
Ambulances are on their way.

371
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,110
Oh, my God.

372
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,720
Take it easy, Em, I got you.

373
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,890
What's up, Jay?

374
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,320
Gunshot victim... Just waiting

375
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,320
to get a statement.

376
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,420
What'd Natalie say?

377
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,670
I'll tell you tonight.

378
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,830
You didn't ask her yet?

379
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,830
You've had Mom's ring a week.

380
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,270
It's gotta be perfect.

381
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,070
Do you have any idea what

382
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,070
real French champagne costs?

383
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,230
More than you can afford.

384
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,530
Don't I know it.

385
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,800
Hello?

386
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,540
Yes, he's right here.

387
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,940
Dr. Charles, it's for you.

388
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,870
Dr. Charles?

389
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,010
Yes, this is

390
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,010
Mr. and Mrs. Coveny.

391
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,250
Uh, Detective Miller

392
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,250
in Madison,

393
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,650
he said

394
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,650
that you called him,

395
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,490
that you're interested in

396
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,490
the case of our daughter,

397
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,490
Olivia.

398
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,890
She disappeared ten years ago.

399
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,790
Mr. Coveny, um...

400
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,230
Why did you call?

401
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,230
Well, I'm a, um...

402
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,660
I'm a forensic psychiatrist

403
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,660
here in Chicago,

404
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,760
and I'm interested in

405
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,760
your daughter's case

406
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,000
purely in a clinical

407
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,000
point of view.

408
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,040
Come visit us.

409
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,040
We'll tell you about Olivia.

410
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,670
She was

411
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,670
really remarkable.

412
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,870
Dr. Charles,

413
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,870
if you find out something,

414
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,870
call us, please.

415
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,280
Uh, of course.

416
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,650
Let me give you my number.

417
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,460
Clamps are on.

418
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,090
A lot of bigwigs here.

419
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,760
Hopkins, Mayo, Duke.

420
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,330
Dot's inferior vena cava

421
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,330
is more anterior lateral

422
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,330
than anticipated.

423
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,370
We'll have to reconstruct

424
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,370
the atrium to get it closed.

425
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,430
What does that mean?

426
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,970
They need to continue

427
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,970
the surgery on bypass.

428
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,070
I'm afraid we're gonna have

429
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,070
to put the twins on bypass.

430
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
You were right.

431
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,120
Thanks, Kelly.

432
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,020
Hey, Bert.

433
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,830
You mind if I sit?

434
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,100
Just for the record, I'm not

435
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,100
here on official business.

436
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,200
I just...

437
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,110
Came to say hi to an old pal.

438
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,020
Leave me alone, Daniel.

439
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,220
The other day, I heard

440
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,220
these two residents

441
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,860
talking about this ten-day

442
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,860
master cleanse.

443
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,960
You ever heard of that?

444
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,860
Reminded me of the time

445
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,860
that you and I went on

446
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,860
that grapefruit diet.

447
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,310
You know, something about

448
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,310
the enzymes in the grape...

449
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,500
Please.

450
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,710
You're wasting your time.

451
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,810
Just go away.

452
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,390
Your fever's gone down.

453
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,390
Heart rate and blood pressure

454
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,390
have improved.

455
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,480
All good signs.

456
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,690
Uh, what about Kiki?

457
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,620
She's doing better too.

458
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,130
Maggie, if Deb and Kiki

459
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,130
are both stable,

460
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,290
we can send them up

461
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,290
to the PICU.

462
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,030
We got more coming in.

463
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,230
Dr. Manning?

464
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,370
You're going to Treatment Two.

465
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,880
16-year-old female,

466
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,880
suspect Hep A.

467
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,780
Febrile and hypotensive.

468
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,010
My stomach hurts.

469
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,550
We're gonna help you

470
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,550
with that, all right?

471
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,210
Emily?

472
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,740
Possibly Hep A also.

473
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,080
You're going to

474
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,080
Treatment Four.

475
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,450
Febrile and tachycardic.

476
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,450
Call Radiology.

477
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,350
We need an ultrasound of her

478
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,350
liver, right upper quadrant.

479
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,450
Got it.

480
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,050
Transfer her on my count.

481
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,650
Ready?

482
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,650
Yep.

483
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,320
One, two, three.

484
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,770
Let's get a CBC, BMP, LFTs,

485
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,530
hepatitis panel,

486
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,530
and a chest X-ray.

487
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,930
Got it.

488
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,470
She hates me.

489
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,340
She doesn't hate you.

490
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,310
I don't blame her.

491
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,410
Just get some rest.

492
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,020
I'm not going anywhere.

493
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,590
Laura is emaciated, lethargic,

494
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,860
and profoundly jaundiced.

495
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,870
Incubation time

496
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,870
should be similar,

497
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,630
but she's presenting

498
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,630
so much worse than the others.

499
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,510
I know you delivered

500
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,510
this girl's baby.

501
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,700
I'm sorry, Natalie.

502
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,610
Both hearts on bypass.

503
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,980
We're ready to go.

504
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,980
One more echo

505
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,980
to confirm positioning.

506
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,890
I'm seeing a pretty large

507
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,890
muscular ventricular

508
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,890
septal defect in Dot's heart.

509
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,130
Why didn't we see this

510
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,130
on previous imaging?

511
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,330
Doesn't matter.

512
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,330
We'll have to correct it

513
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,330
before we can proceed.

514
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,030
Is this a big problem?

515
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,030
Patching a hole of unknown

516
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,030
size near the heart's apex,

517
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,030
a difficult spot to reach,

518
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,370
yeah, it's a very big problem.

519
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,610
To get access, we need

520
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,610
to make a ventriculotomy.

521
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,010
No, in this case,

522
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,010
with the abnormal anatomy

523
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,780
of the heart, by cutting

524
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,780
into the ventricle,

525
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,250
we can disrupt the heart's

526
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,250
conducting system.

527
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,950
The heart might

528
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,950
never beat again.

529
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,520
We lose one girl,

530
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,520
we lose them both.

531
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,190
Excuse me.

532
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,630
I think we should patch

533
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,630
the hole using

534
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,630
the sandwich method.

535
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,030
Two pieces of Gore-Tex

536
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,030
on either side.

537
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,930
More incisions in

538
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,930
her tiny, fragile heart.

539
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,560
No, too risky.

540
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,800
Use a transcatheter

541
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,800
VSD closure device.

542
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,430
That's a cath lab procedure.

543
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,500
We never do it

544
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,500
on an open heart case.

545
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,910
It's the only way

546
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,910
to reach the VSD

547
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,910
and not damage Dot's heart.

548
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,300
No incision.

549
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,970
We snake the patch in

550
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,970
through the atrium.

551
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,240
Dr. Latham...

552
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,240
No, he's right.

553
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,010
It's our only option.

554
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,910
I will take

555
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,910
full responsibility

556
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,910
for the outcome.

557
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,080
Indeed, you will.

558
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,780
Dr. Rhodes will perform

559
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,780
the procedure.

560
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,420
Go scrub in.

561
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,620
Yes, sir.

562
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,970
Connor...

563
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,970
I have to do this.

564
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,530
You realize if those babies

565
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,530
don't pull through,

566
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,530
your career is over?

567
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,140
Yeah. I do.

568
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,620
Sharon? Can I just

569
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,620
talk to you

570
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,620
for a second?

571
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,680
Yeah.

572
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,310
So...

573
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,220
Bert isn't talking

574
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,220
to Dr. Chapman,

575
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,890
he isn't talking to Dr. Reese,

576
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,460
not even talking to me.

577
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,290
You two were married

578
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,290
for 30 years.

579
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,000
30 years.

580
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,460
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just...

581
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,460
please, I'm asking you,

582
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,800
could you...

583
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,800
Could you talk to him?

584
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,310
Just try and open him up.

585
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,900
So, you think that

586
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,570
because of all

587
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,570
those good years,

588
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,340
I owe him something now?

589
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,410
I'm just saying that,

590
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,410
coming from you,

591
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,180
it might make a difference,

592
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,180
that's all.

593
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,280
Well, let me ask you

594
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,280
this, Daniel,

595
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,080
what did Bert owe me

596
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,080
when he walked out?

597
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,360
You suspected

598
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,360
a comorbid illness.

599
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,530
You were right.

600
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,630
Laura?

601
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,010
Your HIV antibody tests

602
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,010
came back as negative.

603
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,110
However, you did test positive

604
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,950
for both hepatitis A

605
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,950
and hepatitis C.

606
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,610
I am very sorry.

607
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,250
Hep A is recent,

608
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,020
but the Hep C, we think

609
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,020
you've had for a long time.

610
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,360
It's damaged your kidneys

611
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,360
and your liver.

612
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,860
My baby,

613
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,370
did I give it to her?

614
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,420
We don't know.

615
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,460
We'll have to contact

616
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,460
her parents

617
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,460
and have them bring her in,

618
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,170
so that we can

619
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,170
test her as well.

620
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,240
My little girl.

621
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,740
Now, luckily,

622
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,740
if she is infected,

623
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,510
at this early stage,

624
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,510
we can treat her.

625
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,980
When she comes,

626
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,980
can I see her?

627
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,120
We'll see if that's possible.

628
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,980
Have you decided

629
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,980
on a rehab facility?

630
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,610
Oh, you pick one.

631
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,410
I'm not gonna be

632
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,410
living there, you are.

633
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,220
Sarah, I'm sure you'll find

634
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,220
the best one,

635
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,280
or at least the lesser

636
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,280
of all the evils.

637
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,190
You know,

638
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,260
I suddenly love choral music.

639
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,290
Just like my heart donor.

640
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,500
It's good to see you.

641
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,180
The nurses aren't

642
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,180
very good company.

643
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,510
I hardly ever see them.

644
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,640
What do you mean? They're

645
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,640
supposed to be walking you.

646
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,310
Haven't you

647
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,310
been outside today?

648
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,310
Nope.

649
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,710
Nurses put me in this chair

650
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,710
and left me.

651
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,320
I imagine she's very busy.

652
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,250
Hey, uh,

653
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,250
this transplant patient's

654
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,690
supposed to walk

655
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,690
every three hours.

656
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,550
We are short-staffed today.

657
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,600
I'll get to it when I can.

658
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,400
Never mind, I'll do it.

659
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,770
Come on, Dad,

660
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,770
we're gonna go for a walk.

661
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,430
Oh, I'd like that.

662
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,750
So far, we have

663
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,750
five Hep A patients.

664
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,690
One adult

665
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,690
and four adolescents.

666
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,390
One of the patients

667
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,390
also has hepatitis C.

668
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,620
She gave birth to a baby

669
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,620
a few months back,

670
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,620
put her up for adoption.

671
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,490
The adoptive parents are here

672
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,490
to get the baby tested.

673
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,860
Please keep me informed

674
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,860
if those numbers change.

675
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,070
Oh, and another thing,

676
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,070
Peter Kalmick called.

677
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,130
They're asking

678
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,130
for you upstairs

679
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,130
in the board room.

680
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,370
Yeah, I know.

681
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,370
I... I'll get to them.

682
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,130
Oh, and have you been up

683
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,130
to see Bert?

684
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,670
No.

685
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,690
I can't see her

686
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,690
field of positioning

687
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,690
as much as I had hoped.

688
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,160
Can you get

689
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,160
the device in place?

690
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,460
Give me a second.

691
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,560
Okay.

692
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,370
Snaking the catheter

693
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,370
into position.

694
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,370
Pulling the first half of the

695
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,370
patch into the left ventricle.

696
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,240
But if you can't see

697
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,240
or feel the alignment,

698
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,280
you can't be sure of deploying

699
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,280
the second half correctly.

700
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,780
So we'll have to open

701
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,780
the heart even more

702
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,320
to make the repair,

703
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,320
which is exactly

704
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,980
what we're trying to avoid.

705
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,980
Maybe not.

706
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,750
Let's try

707
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,750
a flexible pharyngoscope.

708
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,260
Maybe we can see

709
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,260
where the patch is lying

710
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,620
before we deploy.

711
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,620
Beth?

712
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,480
Here.

713
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,200
Dr. Rhodes...

714
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,830
Well?

715
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,740
Uh...

716
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,340
Yeah, I see it.

717
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,250
All right, aligning the patch.

718
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,110
And deploying.

719
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,190
The VSD's repaired.

720
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,020
Now we can proceed.

721
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,990
I got some fluids in you.

722
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,430
Should be feeling better.

723
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,530
Heart rate and blood pressure

724
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,530
look good.

725
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,340
Em, I, uh... I...

726
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm just...

727
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,010
I'm so sorry

728
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,450
for what I did.

729
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,840
I lied to you.

730
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,980
I'm so sorry.

731
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,730
Don't worry about that.

732
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,320
Hey, I'll be

733
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,320
right back, okay?

734
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,770
We can send Emily upstairs.

735
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,770
Good.

736
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,940
And when she gets well,

737
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,940
you should talk

738
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,940
to Dr. Charles.

739
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,200
We'll see.

740
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,610
He knows places, group homes

741
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,610
that could take her in.

742
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,980
So, you want me

743
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,980
to send her away?

744
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,540
She needs professional help.

745
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,810
Let her be

746
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,810
somebody else's problem?

747
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,280
Ethan...

748
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,910
That's how I've always

749
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,910
dealt with Emily.

750
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,450
I can't do that anymore.

751
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,250
Oh, Dr. Charles.

752
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,360
Hello.

753
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,360
Bob.

754
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,360
And Dr. Reese.

755
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,990
Sarah was taking me

756
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,990
for a walk.

757
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,500
As soon as I get him back,

758
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,500
I'll finish rounds.

759
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,850
Dr. Charles, why don't you

760
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,850
see me the rest of the way?

761
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,510
Let Sarah get back

762
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,510
to her real job.

763
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,350
Uh... Sure.

764
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,020
Thank you, Dr. Reese.

765
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,060
You know, Sarah told me

766
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,060
that a woman

767
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,060
in her support group

768
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,530
says her husband came away

769
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,530
from his heart transplant

770
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,430
a changed man.

771
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,430
Really?

772
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,200
Yeah, I did

773
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,200
a little googling.

774
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,070
It turns out that there's

775
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,070
a lot of anecdotal evidence

776
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,900
that transplant patients

777
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,900
experience profound

778
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,900
personality changes.

779
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,210
Yes, uh, "anecdotal"

780
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,210
being the key word there.

781
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,950
Oh, no, actually

782
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,950
there's a name for it.

783
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,320
It's called

784
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,320
cell memory phenomenon,

785
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,520
the theory that

786
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,520
memory is stored

787
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,700
in the neurons of

788
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,700
donated organs.

789
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,130
I mean, it would

790
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,130
certainly explain

791
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,330
why recipients develop

792
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,330
the tastes

793
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,170
and preferences and habits,

794
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,900
even dreams of

795
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,900
their heart's donors.

796
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,810
What are you doing, Bob?

797
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,950
Your antisocial

798
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,950
personality disorder

799
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,910
isn't gonna be affected

800
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,910
by a transplant.

801
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,720
The issue is your brain,

802
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,720
not your heart.

803
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,210
Glenda, could you escort

804
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,210
Dr. Haywood back to his room?

805
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,250
He has had a nice, long walk.

806
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,790
Sure.

807
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,790
Yeah.

808
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,920
Well, Sarah seems open

809
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,920
to the possibility,

810
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,660
or do you think she's just

811
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,660
another young, gullible woman,

812
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,000
Daniel?

813
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,090
Uh, yes, hi, Mr. Coveny?

814
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,720
It's, uh, it's Dr. Charles

815
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,720
from Chicago Med.

816
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,660
I so appreciate your

817
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,660
invitation to come up

818
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,660
and visit.

819
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,970
It's very helpful

820
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,970
for my research to get

821
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,670
a complete picture

822
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,670
of everyone involved.

823
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,770
Seems like the world's

824
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,770
forgotten about Olivia.

825
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,940
We're just so grateful

826
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,940
to talk to someone who hasn't.

827
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,520
Left her room

828
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,520
just the way it was

829
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,520
the day Olivia disappeared.

830
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,620
That was taken

831
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,620
the summer between

832
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,560
her freshman and

833
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,560
sophomore year in college.

834
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,220
She was a science major

835
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,220
at Madison, right?

836
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,090
And she minored in astronomy?

837
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,320
Did she get to know

838
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,320
any of her professors?

839
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,400
No, she never mentioned

840
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,400
any of her professors.

841
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,100
The police

842
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,100
interviewed everyone.

843
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,640
No one knew anything.

844
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,210
Olivia loved monkeys.

845
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,420
Where's the third one?

846
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,050
Oh, yeah, when we picked

847
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,050
her things up from the dorm,

848
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,180
it wasn't there, we don't know

849
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,180
what happened to it.

850
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,790
Laura?

851
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,370
I have some good news.

852
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,370
Your baby's okay.

853
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,570
Look.

854
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,740
My baby.

855
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,980
What's her name?

856
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,640
Anna.

857
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,610
Anna.

858
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,720
I promise we'll take

859
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,720
good care of her.

860
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,760
This way.

861
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,080
Thank you.

862
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,080
Of course.

863
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,910
So, the baby tested negative.

864
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,710
Yeah, and Laura

865
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,710
got to see her.

866
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,850
That's great.

867
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,850
Yeah.

868
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,610
Good omen.

869
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,610
What?

870
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,290
No pulse.

871
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,290
I'll bag her.

872
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,890
Milligram of epi.

873
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,660
Come on.

874
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,840
The girl with Hep C.

875
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,240
Hold compression.

876
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,800
Another milligram of epi.

877
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,940
Come on.

878
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,310
Come on.

879
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,210
Hold compression.

880
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,790
Asystole.

881
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,790
No.

882
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,010
No.

883
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,420
Laura, come on.

884
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,990
She's gone.

885
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,600
Time of death, 15:25.

886
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,410
Have you been able

887
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,410
to reach her family?

888
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,510
Not yet.

889
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,640
You know, the last time

890
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,640
you brought Lyla here...

891
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,250
Just before

892
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,050
she passed away,

893
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,620
as sick as she was,

894
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,620
she had the presence of mind

895
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,490
to ask me

896
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,030
to look after you

897
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,030
when she was gone.

898
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,300
Sharon, I...

899
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,430
I'm sorry for the

900
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,280
pain I caused you.

901
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,350
You know, I don't need

902
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,350
or want an apology

903
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,350
from you, Bert,

904
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,650
but I'm not gonna sit here

905
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,650
and lie to you either.

906
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,090
It was hard,

907
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,260
the way you left me,

908
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,000
our life.

909
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,830
But what's done is done,

910
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,830
and I'm a big girl.

911
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,390
I'm working it out.

912
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,900
But we can be proud of this.

913
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,270
We have raised

914
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,910
three wonderful children.

915
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,990
Don't do this to them, Bert.

916
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,620
Don't you dare do

917
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,620
this to them.

918
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,330
And you let these people

919
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,870
help you.

920
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,820
I just told you.

921
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,160
I can't let you in

922
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,160
without his permission.

923
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,990
It's just that Dr. Haywood

924
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,990
is entering this rehab

925
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,990
facility on very short notice,

926
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,870
and it's just important

927
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,870
that I get him

928
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,870
a few personal items.

929
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,530
Uh, you know,

930
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,530
toothbrush, toothpaste...

931
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,830
Have him call me.

932
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,710
Liver separation is complete.

933
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,710
Both hearts as well.

934
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,370
Already off bypass.

935
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,370
Decannulated as well.

936
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,310
Pacing wires are in.

937
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,750
Patch is holding.

938
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,580
Both hearts look good.

939
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,930
So, what's included in your

940
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,930
massive transfusion protocol?

941
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,840
Well...

942
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,840
And how responsive

943
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,840
is the blood bank?

944
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,970
They'll come in with a cooler

945
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,970
stocked with 4 units of reds

946
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,970
and 2 plasma.

947
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,010
Well, can I see the data

948
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,010
and your process

949
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,010
improvement indicators?

950
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,670
Well...

951
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,670
Excuse me.

952
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,070
Can I help you?

953
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,120
Ms. Goodwin, this is our

954
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,120
new division chief of trauma,

955
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,120
James Lanik.

956
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,340
Jimmy.

957
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,310
New chief of trauma?

958
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,250
Ms. Goodwin is

959
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,250
our Executive Director

960
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
of Patient and

961
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Medical Services.

962
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,090
Looks like you weren't

963
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,090
expecting me.

964
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,030
News to me.

965
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,290
I just got the memo.

966
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,390
Well, it's nice to meet you,

967
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,390
Dr. Lanik.

968
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,000
Hospital intrigue.

969
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,070
Yeah, you'll see.

970
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,140
Sharon, congratulations on

971
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,140
the twins.

972
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,680
Come join us for champagne.

973
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,510
How is it we have

974
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,510
a new chief of trauma

975
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,510
and I wasn't consulted?

976
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,310
I've been trying to get you

977
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,310
to meet with us all day.

978
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,180
But we should've

979
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,180
given you a heads-up,

980
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,380
and I'm sorry.

981
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,820
The position

982
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,820
needed to be filled,

983
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,450
and I know

984
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,450
Dr. Lanik personally.

985
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,450
He is first-rate.

986
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,560
Sharon, this is Gwen Garrett,

987
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,560
our new C.O.O.

988
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,070
New? We never had

989
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,070
an old C.O.O.

990
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,930
Well, it's a recently

991
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,930
created position.

992
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,870
Help run the hospital

993
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,870
a little more efficiently.

994
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,310
Efficiently or economically?

995
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,870
Uh, both.

996
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,740
Ms. Garret's done

997
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,740
a wonderful job

998
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,150
minimizing red ink at

999
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,150
several large pharmaceuticals.

1000
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,140
I look forward to working

1001
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,140
with you, Ms. Goodwin.

1002
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,150
As do I, Ms. Garrett.

1003
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,460
It's amazing.

1004
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,510
Excuse me, Dr. Rhodes,

1005
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,510
Ralph Ballard.

1006
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,510
Have you got a minute?

1007
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,850
I gotta run to my locker.

1008
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,850
I'll meet you on the balcony?

1009
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,020
Sure.

1010
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,960
Will, care to come

1011
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,960
celebrate with me?

1012
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,020
Uh, no thanks.

1013
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,740
Natalie...

1014
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,740
It was her?

1015
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,310
Yes, but...

1016
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,210
Please.

1017
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,330
Told Emily when she gets out,

1018
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,330
she can stay with us.

1019
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,390
Ethan, you can't trust her.

1020
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,870
Look, you know

1021
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,870
how hard

1022
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,870
she's been trying,

1023
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,460
how great she was

1024
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,460
with patients.

1025
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,480
Yeah, until she quit

1026
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,480
without notice.

1027
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,140
Look, I know she said some

1028
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,140
awful things to you and...

1029
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,250
No, it's not about that.

1030
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,250
Then what is it?

1031
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,810
You're the one who always told

1032
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,810
me how important family is.

1033
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,280
Yes, and I treated Emily

1034
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,280
like family.

1035
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,250
I stood up for her,

1036
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,250
I told you to give her

1037
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,250
another chance,

1038
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,480
and how did she thank you?

1039
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,480
Thank me?

1040
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,530
She stole drugs.

1041
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,530
She lied to us.

1042
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,530
Ethan, she's damaged.

1043
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,090
You can't fix her.

1044
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,470
I gotta try.

1045
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,570
She's just gonna bring

1046
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,570
her mess into our lives.

1047
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,640
April...

1048
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,840
I'm sorry, but she's

1049
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,840
coming home with us.

1050
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,570
No, Ethan,

1051
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,850
she's going home with you.

1052
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,390
Natalie!

1053
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,090
Hey...

1054
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,460
I wanted this

1055
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,460
to be so special.

1056
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,630
Uh, a view of

1057
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,630
the city, champagne.

1058
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,600
Not like this,

1059
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,600
not in a parking lot,

1060
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,070
but, I'm not

1061
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,070
gonna let you go...

1062
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,410
Not without asking.

1063
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,410
Will...

1064
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,600
Just wait.

1065
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,950
Will you marry me?

1066
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,450
Will you marry me?

1067
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,810
So, tell me, did you

1068
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,810
orchestrate this whole thing?

1069
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,080
Reluctant hero comes in

1070
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,080
and saves the day?

1071
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,920
You give me

1072
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,920
too much credit.

1073
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,980
Do I?

1074
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,360
Your ambition

1075
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,360
strikes me as boundless.

1076
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,530
Wait a second,

1077
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,530
do you really think that?

1078
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,100
I don't know what to think.

1079
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,630
Yes, you helped keep

1080
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,630
those babies alive,

1081
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,340
but I'm sure you also

1082
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,340
secured yourself

1083
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,340
an attending position.

1084
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,630
Uh, God, Ava, I...

1085
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,580
What?

1086
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,190
You bastard.

1087
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,220
You got an offer tonight,

1088
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,220
didn't you?

1089
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,760
That guy in the PICU?

1090
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,060
Mayo Clinic.

1091
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,000
You got an offer

1092
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,000
at the Mayo Clinic?

1093
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,330
I can't believe it.

1094
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,410
And of course

1095
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,410
you're going to take it.

1096
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,910
Would you?

1097
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,850
Yes. Absolutely.

1098
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,790
Great.

1099
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,090
Oh, Dr. Charles.

1100
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,660
Come to say good-bye.

1101
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,660
I did.

1102
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,260
You all set to, uh,

1103
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,260
head off to rehab?

1104
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,930
Well, actually, Sarah has

1105
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,930
asked me to live with her

1106
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,730
while I complete my recovery.

1107
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,740
Really?

1108
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,740
Mm-hmm.

1109
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,070
Sarah's taking you

1110
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,070
home with her?

1111
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,210
Mm-hmm.

1112
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,210
Huh.

1113
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,740
Well, I guess she certainly

1114
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,740
turned out to be

1115
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,310
the devoted daughter

1116
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,310
you were looking for.

1117
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,310
I'm a very lucky man.

1118
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,960
So, guess what, I, uh...

1119
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,120
I decided I'm gonna

1120
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,120
head up to Madison

1121
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,220
and give that forensic

1122
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,220
psychiatry seminar.

1123
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,290
Oh, you decided to do it?

1124
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,290
Yeah.

1125
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,530
It turns out that

1126
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,530
they got a bit of

1127
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,000
a dark history up there

1128
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,000
at the university, you know,

1129
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,200
some homegrown crime

1130
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,200
of their own.

1131
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,140
Oh?

1132
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,140
Yeah, around ten years ago,

1133
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,940
I think around the time

1134
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,940
that you were teaching there,

1135
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,410
the, um... The Olivia...

1136
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,410
Coveny case?

1137
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,780
You remember?

1138
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,910
No, doesn't ring a bell.

1139
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,180
Her parents are convinced

1140
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,180
she was murdered.

1141
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,160
Murdered?

1142
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,530
Well, just because

1143
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,530
a girl is missing

1144
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,530
doesn't mean she was murdered.

1145
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,300
Oh, uh, so you do remember?

1146
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,130
Hm? What? Sorry?

1147
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,830
Well, I... I didn't say

1148
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,830
that she was missing.

1149
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,640
Oh, well,

1150
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,640
guess I just assumed.

1151
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,070
Yeah, I was kinda surprised

1152
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,070
when you said

1153
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,070
you didn't remember,

1154
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,510
because she was a...

1155
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,670
She was an astronomy student,

1156
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,670
actually, one of yours.

1157
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,180
Ah, so, this is

1158
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,180
where this is going,

1159
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,180
this little dance of yours.

1160
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,250
You're suggesting

1161
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,250
I'm a murderer. Really?

1162
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,190
You know what's

1163
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,190
the most fascinating thing

1164
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,530
about serial killers?

1165
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,530
Even the most brilliant ones,

1166
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,530
they all have this weakness,

1167
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,360
where they can't seem

1168
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,360
to resist taking

1169
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,530
a personal item

1170
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,530
from their victims,

1171
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,600
you know, like, uh...

1172
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,600
Like a trophy.

1173
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,600
Trophy?

1174
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,970
Yeah, in this case,

1175
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,970
I think it's a

1176
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,730
little stuffed monkey.

1177
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,730
Oh, please.

1178
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,110
Why don't you just admit

1179
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,110
you lost?

1180
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,440
I'm going home

1181
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,440
with my daughter,

1182
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,240
and you can't do

1183
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,240
anything about it.

1184
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,990
Give it up.

1185
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,910
You appreciate the irony,

1186
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,910
don't you?

1187
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,920
That you've got

1188
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,920
this new heart,

1189
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,920
this new life,

1190
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,930
and you spend

1191
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,930
the rest of it in jail?

1192
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,450
Bob?

1193
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,420
Bob?

1194
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,210
Dad?
