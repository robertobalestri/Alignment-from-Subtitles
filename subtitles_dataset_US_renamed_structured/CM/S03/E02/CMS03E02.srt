1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,690
Damn it!

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,210
What's going on?

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,310
I put too much damn salt

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,310
on the rub.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,340
I got to get it out.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,880
Honey, it's 4:30

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,880
in the morning.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,940
Yeah, and if the meat

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,940
loses its juices,

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,050
it's gonna be all dry

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,050
and burnt.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,980
Sweetie, I... I...

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,830
I feel like this might be one

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,830
of those anxiety attacks

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,760
that Dr. Reese

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,760
said you might have.

17
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,060
It's not because

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,060
of my condition.

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,530
It's because I put

20
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,530
too much damn salt...

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,540
Whoa! Okay, okay, okay.

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,910
Let me help you.

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,150
Why don't you start

24
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,150
measuring out another rub?

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,150
Excuse me.

26
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,150
Yeah... Ah, whoa.

27
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,430
Excuse me.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,730
Excuse me.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,570
Dr. Rhodes, you're late.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,570
I know. I am sorry.

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,130
I understand you're under

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,130
additional stress

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,230
at home lately, but please try

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,230
not to make this a habit.

35
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,610
I assure you

36
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,610
I will not.

37
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,510
Dr. Rhodes,

38
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,510
your CT patient's here.

39
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,880
You're going to 1.

40
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,570
Jerry Willis, 54, called 911

41
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,450
with shortness of breath

42
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,450
and tachycardia.

43
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,950
BP 110 over 60, rate 120,

44
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,580
satting at 89%

45
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,580
on five liters 0-2.

46
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,490
Mr. Willis, what are you

47
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,490
doing back here so soon?

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,820
I've been having trouble

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,820
breathing.

50
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,920
It started a few days

51
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,920
after I left.

52
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,720
What trouble are

53
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,720
we talking about?

54
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,270
Coughing. He's wheezing.

55
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,270
It's been getting worse.

56
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,440
All right, let's move him

57
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,440
on my count.

58
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,530
All right.

59
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,660
And one, two, three.

60
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,110
I replaced his aortic valve

61
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,110
two weeks ago.

62
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,550
Any intraoperative

63
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,550
difficulties?

64
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,240
None.

65
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,240
Cardiac comorbidities?

66
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,610
Nothing notable, no.

67
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,490
Austin Flint murmur.

68
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,490
The valve is leaking.

69
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,850
That's impossible.

70
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,650
Maybe you're hearing, uh,

71
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,650
tricuspid stenosis

72
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,990
or a subclinical MI.

73
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,190
Is it possible you

74
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,190
misoriented the valve?

75
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,300
Obstructed

76
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,300
one of the leaflets?

77
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,030
No. I remember it

78
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,030
very clearly.

79
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,440
Surgery went off

80
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,440
without a hitch.

81
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,550
We should order an echo?

82
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,550
What?

83
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,640
What's wrong?

84
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,640
Aortic insufficiency.

85
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,510
The valve is

86
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,510
definitely leaking.

87
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,910
But you just replaced it.

88
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,910
How could it leak?

89
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,880
I don't know.

90
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,880
It doesn't make any sense.

91
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,050
I...

92
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,220
Maybe Dr. Rhodes

93
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,220
made a mistake.

94
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,670
Morning.

95
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,670
Good morning.

96
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,830
Hi.

97
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,840
Whoa. Is that

98
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,840
what you're planning

99
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,840
on wearing tonight?

100
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,040
It's a brand-new Chiara Boni.

101
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,050
I mean... Nah, I mean

102
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,050
it's probably fine.

103
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,880
I mean, if you think

104
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,880
it's fancy enough

105
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,150
for the corner table

106
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,150
at Alinea.

107
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,680
Are you kidding?

108
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,690
That's like the toughest

109
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,690
reservation in town.

110
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,450
GQ says 97%

111
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,450
of relationships

112
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,990
are decided on the first date.

113
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,590
Oh, now you're getting

114
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,590
your dating advice from GQ?

115
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,960
Natalie, these are

116
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,960
hard numbers.

117
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,160
Mmm.

118
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,160
I'm just citing the research.

119
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,440
I honestly don't know

120
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,440
what happened.

121
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,240
Go back over your notes.

122
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,240
Try to learn from your error.

123
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,170
I will, and I'll get him

124
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,170
preop'd for a re-do.

125
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,940
That will not be necessary.

126
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,880
Between the adhesions and

127
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,880
further procedural stress,

128
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,710
reopening his heart

129
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,710
is simply too risky.

130
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,480
We'll manage him

131
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,480
with medications instead.

132
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,710
But if we don't fix

133
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,710
the valve,

134
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,450
his quality of life

135
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,450
is gonna suffer.

136
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,890
I understand,

137
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,890
but at this point,

138
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,480
it's our best option.

139
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,490
Any plans tonight?

140
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,490
Still got that chili.

141
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,030
You want to join?

142
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,030
No way.

143
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,530
Is the sushi place

144
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,530
on the corner still open?

145
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,590
Why can't you just be nice?

146
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,100
Oh, I can be nice.

147
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,350
Hold that thought.

148
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,490
Daniel. You're looking

149
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,490
more rested.

150
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,580
Doing my best.

151
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,580
What's the word?

152
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,490
The board is deciding

153
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,490
whether to put metal detectors

154
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
at all the hospital entrances.

155
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,670
So I have to go prepare

156
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,670
my recommendation.

157
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,230
Which way you leaning?

158
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,060
Toward yes.

159
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,530
Really?

160
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,470
Doesn't that kind of fly

161
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,470
in the face

162
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,140
of being a trusted

163
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,140
community institution?

164
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,170
You know, putting up barriers

165
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,170
between us and the people

166
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,910
that we're trying to help?

167
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,920
One of those people shot you

168
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,920
in the gut, Daniel.

169
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,880
Yeah, outside the hospital.

170
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,780
What kind of detector's

171
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,780
gonna stop that?

172
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,890
Dr. Reese.

173
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,890
Dr. Charles.

174
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,720
So, Nurse Sexton,

175
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,570
who do we got next?

176
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,570
Henry Lee.

177
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,270
He's a sweetheart,

178
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,270
comes in every month

179
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,670
for his heart failure meds.

180
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,470
Mr. Lee, I'm Dr. Choi.

181
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,470
How are you doing today?

182
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,910
A lot better now

183
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,910
that my girl's here.

184
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,110
She does have

185
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,110
that effect on people.

186
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,980
Any new complaints?

187
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,440
Nope. Just got

188
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,440
to get my meds.

189
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,850
Take a deep breath.

190
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,690
One more.

191
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,590
How much Lasix

192
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,590
does he usually get?

193
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,630
40 IV.

194
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,630
That sounds good.

195
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,790
But I'm also hearing some

196
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,790
dullness near your lung base.

197
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,200
I'd like to send you

198
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,200
for an X-ray.

199
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,900
Thanks, Doc, but

200
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,900
if it's all the same,

201
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,960
I'd rather just get

202
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,960
my meds and go.

203
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,160
Mr. Lee, I hear

204
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,160
what you're saying,

205
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,330
but I prefer

206
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,330
to be thorough.

207
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,540
Nah, let's just stick

208
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,540
to the usual.

209
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,910
Hey, can you do the IV

210
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,910
in my left hand today?

211
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,080
I got a good puffy one.

212
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,120
She never misses.

213
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,120
You got it.

214
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,220
I really would like

215
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,220
that X-ray.

216
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,630
I bet he'd listen to you.

217
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,570
Why? You think there's

218
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,570
something else going on?

219
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,740
I don't know. Probably not,

220
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,170
but it's impossible to say.

221
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,870
Okay, I'll try.

222
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,270
Thank you.

223
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,880
So I've got a 43-year-old

224
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,880
woman who passed out

225
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,350
at a Starbucks

226
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,350
from hypoglycemia.

227
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,110
Mmm-hmm.

228
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,110
Now, that's normal, right?

229
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,980
But then her blood came back

230
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,980
showing insulin

231
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,540
with a high C-peptide count.

232
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,950
So she gave herself

233
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,950
too much insulin.

234
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,650
Right, but here's the thing.

235
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,220
She is not diabetic.

236
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,090
Wait... So wait a minute.

237
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,290
She somehow got her hands

238
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,290
on insulin,

239
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,830
then injected it

240
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,830
into herself?

241
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,090
Why would she do that?

242
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,030
I don't know.

243
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,030
That's why I called you.

244
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,560
Okay, I'll try to find out.

245
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,560
All right, cool, thank you.

246
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,030
Oh, actually, um...

247
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
Okay, so you know how

248
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
I've been hounding you

249
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,200
about getting a drink

250
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,200
one night after work?

251
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm familiar with it, yes.

252
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,800
Okay, well, I promise

253
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,410
it's all going to stop.

254
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,580
Right after you get a drink

255
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,580
with me tonight.

256
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,770
Oh, come on, Noah,

257
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,770
couldn't we just stick

258
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,370
to being colleagues?

259
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,880
Sure.

260
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,790
A drink as colleagues.

261
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,190
Okay.

262
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,720
Ms. Lake, I'm Dr. Reese

263
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,720
from Psychiatry.

264
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,790
Of course you are.

265
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,530
It's nice to meet you.

266
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,530
Nice to meet you.

267
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,730
Uh, I understand that you may

268
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,730
have injected yourself

269
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,930
with insulin today.

270
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,500
I did.

271
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,270
Can you tell me why?

272
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,100
Today's the court hearing.

273
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,040
For my divorce.

274
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,510
Oh.

275
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,010
It just snuck up on me.

276
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,690
I mean, I've been dreading it

277
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,690
for months, but

278
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,450
when I woke up today and

279
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,450
realized that this is it...

280
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,820
Did you try

281
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,820
to harm yourself?

282
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,420
Oh, no, no, no.

283
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,090
I don't want to die.

284
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,690
I just couldn't face the day.

285
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,890
So let me understand.

286
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,940
You made yourself

287
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,940
pass out on purpose?

288
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,370
I panicked.

289
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,430
I did something stupid.

290
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,100
And now I'm wasting your time.

291
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,340
I'm sorry.

292
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,540
Speaking of which, could you

293
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,540
write a note for the judge?

294
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,880
Just something saying

295
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,880
I had a medical emergency.

296
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,210
Ah, I am sorry,

297
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,210
but I can't do that.

298
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,220
It doesn't have

299
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,220
to be anything big.

300
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,810
Handwritten

301
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,810
on a letterhead is fine.

302
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,020
The thing is, you didn't

303
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,020
have an emergency.

304
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,520
You caused it.

305
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,530
So it would be disingenuous

306
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,530
for me to say otherwise.

307
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,630
I'd like to speak

308
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,630
with your supervisor.

309
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,060
Excuse me?

310
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,260
I'm seeing a doctor,

311
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,260
now I need a doctor's note.

312
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,470
And if you can't do that,

313
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,470
then get me your supervisor.

314
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,880
Um... Okay.

315
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,420
You look like you need this

316
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,420
more than I do.

317
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,750
I'm fine.

318
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,490
Sure.

319
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,220
Hair's a mess,

320
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,220
bags under your eyes.

321
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,520
You look great.

322
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,570
Don't be so hard on yourself.

323
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,860
You work our schedule

324
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,860
then go home

325
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,630
to a girlfriend who's

326
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,630
basically your patient too.

327
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,240
Something like this

328
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,240
was bound to happen.

329
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,670
Really? Is that so?

330
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,580
At least it hasn't affected

331
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,580
your sunny disposition.

332
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,120
Keep up the good work.

333
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,190
Dr. Halstead,

334
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,560
You're going to 3.

335
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,560
Doris.

336
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,720
Talk to me, Chout.

337
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,890
Julie Dutra, 34, pregnant,

338
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,060
para one gravita zero,

339
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,060
fainted in a yoga class,

340
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,530
in A-fib at 150,

341
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,530
BP 90 over 60.

342
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,070
Hi, Julie, I'm Dr. Manning.

343
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,070
This is Dr. Halstead.

344
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,870
I told them

345
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,870
I don't want to be here.

346
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,070
Hopefully this

347
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,070
won't take long.

348
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,010
On my count.

349
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,010
One, two, three.

350
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,440
Julie. Are you okay?

351
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,070
I'm fine, just call Mira.

352
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,070
Our midwife.

353
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,090
I think Julie would be more

354
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,090
comfortable at home with her.

355
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,050
Uh, sir, your wife's

356
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,050
in a dangerous arrhythmia.

357
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,380
We can't let her go until

358
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,380
we get it under control.

359
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,250
Do you have any history

360
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,250
of heart disease?

361
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,820
No, I don't eat red meat,

362
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,820
and I keep

363
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,120
a high antioxidant profile

364
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,120
to minimize inflammation.

365
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,490
Okay, good.

366
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,360
Um... Let's get an EKG,

367
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,360
cardiac labs, CBC, CMP,

368
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,000
coags and a U/A, and let's

369
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,000
start 5 of verapamil IV, okay?

370
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,430
No, no medications.

371
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,100
This one's safe

372
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,100
for pregnancy.

373
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,070
If we don't control

374
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,070
your arrhythmia, it could

375
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,200
put the baby in danger.

376
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,200
Is that true?

377
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,900
Scott.

378
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,900
What?

379
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,100
We don't want anything

380
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,100
bad to happen.

381
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,950
Okay, fine,

382
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,950
but then we're leaving.

383
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,250
Thank you. All right.

384
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
Let me ask you

385
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
a few more questions.

386
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,120
Wait, what are you doing?

387
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,120
Just a quick

388
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,120
fetal ultrasound.

389
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,250
No, get that thing off me.

390
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
Acoustic radiation

391
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
impairs neurodevelopment.

392
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,390
That's not actually true.

393
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,160
Note that the fetus measures

394
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,990
normal size and weight

395
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,990
for five months.

396
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Wait, what did you say?

397
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,670
That this looks like

398
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,670
a normal five-month pregnancy.

399
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,630
Measure it again.

400
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm sure of the numbers.

401
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,040
Well, you're wrong.

402
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,040
Measure it again.

403
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,210
See?

404
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,310
Totally normal

405
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,310
for five months.

406
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,710
Except I'm not

407
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,710
five months pregnant.

408
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,250
I'm eight.

409
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,930
Julie's labs.

410
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,430
Anemia, vitamin deficiencies,

411
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,030
all the signs

412
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,030
of early kidney failure.

413
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,830
And no family history

414
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,830
of troubled pregnancies

415
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,270
or genetic conditions.

416
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,400
Maybe a malabsorption

417
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,400
syndrome?

418
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Ms. Dutra.

419
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,210
Have you ever had any

420
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,210
gastrointestinal issues?

421
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,950
Crohn's, ulcerative colitis?

422
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,610
I used to have leaky gut.

423
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,020
At first, we thought

424
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,020
it was just lactose,

425
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,450
but of course it was

426
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,450
more complicated than that.

427
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,620
I see, and were you seeing

428
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,620
someone for this?

429
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,620
My nutritionist.

430
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,500
She got me off lecithin

431
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,500
and phytic acid.

432
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,730
It helped some,

433
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,890
but then once I got pregnant

434
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,890
I had to give up all GMOs

435
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,900
and anything that wasn't

436
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,900
locally sourced, too.

437
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,270
So what do you eat?

438
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,540
Certain strains

439
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,540
of Swiss chard, broccoli.

440
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,640
Sometimes I'll have

441
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,640
a cup of adzuki beans.

442
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,510
But she supplements a lot.

443
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,570
Selenium, coenzyme Q.

444
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,910
You eat three meals a day?

445
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,910
More? Less?

446
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,920
I do portion control

447
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,920
to manage the baby's glucose.

448
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,680
Seven hundred to 800 calories

449
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,680
a day. Why?

450
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,190
We suspect the difficulties

451
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,190
with this pregnancy

452
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,230
are being caused by your diet.

453
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,560
That can't be.

454
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,560
I only eat organic.

455
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,400
But you're not getting

456
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,400
enough protein or iron.

457
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,290
And we're seeing the effects

458
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,290
it's having on your baby.

459
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,070
We need to start aggressive

460
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,070
IV nutrition to help it grow

461
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,570
as much as possible

462
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,570
before you deliver.

463
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,200
If we admit you

464
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,200
to Obstetrics now, we...

465
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
No.

466
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,780
I understand that

467
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,780
you don't want to be here,

468
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,150
but at this point it is...

469
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,150
No.

470
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,080
You're not giving me IV food.

471
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,350
Your baby is severely

472
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,350
malnourished.

473
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,510
No, my baby is getting

474
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,520
healthy farm-to-table

475
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,520
nutrients.

476
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,390
You're not gonna pump him

477
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,390
full of toxins and chemicals.

478
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,790
Ms. Dutra...

479
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,790
I said no.

480
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,800
Your arrhythmia

481
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,800
hasn't resolved yet.

482
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,170
We'll be back in a minute

483
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,170
to check on you.

484
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,470
She's starving

485
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,470
that baby to death.

486
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,950
We need to talk to Goodwin.

487
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,850
Mr. Lee, we got

488
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,850
your X-ray results back.

489
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,720
Great. So I can get

490
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,720
out of here?

491
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,190
Actually, they show

492
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,190
bilateral pleural effusions,

493
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,120
fluid surrounding your lungs.

494
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,560
Is that bad?

495
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,560
It's hard to say.

496
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,220
It could just be

497
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,220
from your heart failure.

498
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,130
Either way, it's not making

499
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,130
your breathing any easier.

500
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,330
I'd like to have Radiology

501
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,330
remove it

502
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,960
with a needle aspiration.

503
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,970
You want to stick

504
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,970
a needle in my lung?

505
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,200
Yes.

506
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,200
But I'm breathing fine now.

507
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,370
I'd rather just go.

508
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,370
I understand, but doing this

509
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,340
will let you go longer

510
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,340
between treatments.

511
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,240
I think it's a good idea.

512
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,640
Don't you agree?

513
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,440
I don't know. Um...

514
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,340
The effusions are

515
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,340
pretty small.

516
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,580
True, but it also wouldn't

517
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,580
hurt to send the fluid

518
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,990
out for analysis,

519
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,990
just to be sure, right?

520
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,620
I suppose.

521
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,600
So, Henry, what do you say?

522
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,070
You really think

523
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,070
this is a good idea?

524
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,830
Okay.

525
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,240
We'll get you over there

526
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,240
right away.

527
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,170
Are you sure you want

528
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,170
to be this aggressive?

529
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,210
I want to cover

530
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,210
all the bases, yeah.

531
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,780
Henry's not

532
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,780
a very healthy man.

533
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,710
He doesn't do so well

534
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,710
with procedures.

535
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,210
I hear you, but medically,

536
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,210
it's the best course

537
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,210
of action.

538
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,520
I don't think it is.

539
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,420
I'm sorry you feel that way.

540
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,220
What you should be sorry

541
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,220
about is thinking

542
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,490
that I would agree

543
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,490
with you in there

544
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,430
just because we're

545
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,430
sleeping together.

546
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,120
That has nothing

547
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,120
to do with it.

548
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,100
I thought you'd agree because

549
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,100
that's my medical opinion.

550
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,400
Well, you were wrong.

551
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,100
The next time

552
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,100
you want to put me

553
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,870
on the spot in front

554
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,870
of my patient, think again.

555
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,910
Hey.

556
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,170
April.

557
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,810
You want to feed a patient

558
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,810
against her will.

559
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,790
A pregnant mother

560
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,790
who's killing her baby.

561
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,620
We believe she has

562
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,620
something called orthorexia,

563
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,620
an obsession with healthy

564
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,620
living that has limited

565
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,320
her diet so severely

566
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,320
that it's become dangerous.

567
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,790
And has led to

568
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,790
a pathologic distrust

569
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,260
of the entire medical system.

570
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,260
She won't let us do anything.

571
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,360
Well, is she delusional?

572
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,030
Can she make decisions

573
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,030
on her own?

574
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,430
No, she's very clear

575
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,330
about what she wants

576
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,330
and what she does not want.

577
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,170
Well, then we can't prove

578
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,170
incompetence,

579
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,210
and we can't force her

580
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,210
to do anything

581
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,900
to her body she doesn't want.

582
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,340
The law sides with her.

583
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,810
But there are

584
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,810
two patients here.

585
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,210
Yeah, one of whom

586
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,210
has no control

587
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
over what's being done

588
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
to it.

589
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,910
This is child abuse.

590
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,780
Well, I can convene

591
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,780
an emergency ethics committee.

592
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,320
It's possible

593
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,320
they may find grounds

594
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,190
to override her decision.

595
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,730
And in the meantime?

596
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,590
See if you can find a way

597
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,590
to help her trust us.

598
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,990
Dr. Latham.

599
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,990
We should do the surgery.

600
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,260
Dr. Rhodes...

601
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,260
No, I...

602
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,700
I looked over all my notes.

603
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,900
Okay? Mr. Willis' anatomy

604
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,900
is good.

605
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,370
We owe him a chance

606
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,370
to get this right.

607
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,930
We owe him

608
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,930
our best clinical judgment.

609
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,840
Yes, I was inside

610
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,840
of his heart.

611
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,470
He's got more than enough

612
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,470
healthy muscle

613
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,470
and vasculature.

614
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm telling you

615
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,520
he can handle it.

616
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,120
Have you had more

617
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,120
than four hours' sleep

618
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,590
this last several weeks?

619
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,650
I am a cardiothoracic fellow.

620
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,880
Sleep deprivation

621
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,880
is part of the job.

622
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,220
I understand that.

623
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,790
But you have a lot

624
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,790
on your plate.

625
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,400
Dr. Bekker and I will take

626
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,400
the case from here.

627
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,760
No, Dr. Latham,

628
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,760
that's not necessary...

629
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,400
Dr. Rhodes,

630
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,400
you have a phone call.

631
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,900
Tell them

632
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,900
I'll call them back.

633
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm sorry.

634
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,440
It's your landlord.

635
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,100
He says it's an emergency.

636
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,460
Excuse me.

637
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,460
Hey. Thank you.

638
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,580
Excuse me.

639
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,490
Robin. Robin.

640
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,150
Hey, are you okay?

641
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,150
I forgot the brisket

642
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,150
in the oven when I went

643
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,430
to the store, and then

644
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,430
all the alarms went off.

645
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,560
I'm just such an idiot.

646
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,560
Come here.

647
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,500
Come here.

648
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,500
Hey, Otis, when are we

649
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,760
gonna get that

650
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,760
thing shut down?

651
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,930
Yeah. Thank you.

652
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,770
Don't worry.

653
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,770
It could happen to anybody.

654
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,050
Shouldn't be more

655
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,050
than a half hour.

656
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,090
I'm sorry you had

657
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,090
to deal with that.

658
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,230
No need to be sorry.

659
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,230
You know what I mean.

660
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,820
The more time

661
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,820
you spend with her,

662
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,830
the less we have to see people

663
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,830
who actually need our help.

664
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,120
I don't know.

665
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,630
I'm not quite sure we're...

666
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,370
We're done with Ms. Lake yet.

667
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,570
Why? She just wants

668
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,570
to use us to game the system.

669
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,570
Well, so do a lot

670
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,570
of patients.

671
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,910
We're not gonna let her.

672
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,550
But the question is,

673
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,550
why is she doing it?

674
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,840
Wait, you still think

675
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,840
this is a psych case?

676
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,480
Why wouldn't I?

677
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,640
I mean, she exhibited some

678
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,640
pretty extreme behavior

679
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,650
this morning, didn't she?

680
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,650
To get out of a court date.

681
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,210
Well, perhaps,

682
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,210
but until we figure out

683
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,760
what's behind the behavior,

684
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,290
we haven't really

685
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,290
done our job,

686
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,290
have we?

687
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,090
I guess.

688
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,090
Good.

689
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,020
Keep me in the loop.

690
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,010
Your heart isn't responding

691
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,010
to the meds.

692
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,850
If things keep going

693
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,850
in this direction,

694
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,040
we may need to consider

695
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,040
an emergency C-section

696
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,850
to take the extra load

697
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,850
off your heart.

698
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,350
Drug me up then cut me open?

699
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,350
No way.

700
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,860
That's not what

701
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,860
we want either,

702
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,860
but we do need to protect

703
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,860
you and your baby.

704
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,760
That's why in the meantime,

705
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,760
if you allow us to give you

706
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,960
some IV nutrition...

707
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,960
No way.

708
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,770
Those bags off-gas BPAs.

709
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,990
Look, you don't get it.

710
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,430
This baby is being formed

711
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,430
from every single molecule

712
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,800
that enters my body.

713
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,630
It is my job to keep it

714
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,630
absolutely pure.

715
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,270
That is how I'm protecting it.

716
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,580
They understand that.

717
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,580
No, they don't.

718
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,050
Uh, excuse us.

719
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,790
Please tell me you have

720
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,790
some good news.

721
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,260
I'm afraid not.

722
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,450
The committee ruled

723
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,450
that we can't intervene

724
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,430
against her wishes, not even

725
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,430
for the sake of the baby.

726
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,030
So that's it?

727
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,860
We just have to watch

728
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,860
as she lets the baby die?

729
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,560
If that's

730
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,560
what she chooses to do.

731
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,960
But that's not

732
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,960
what she wants.

733
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,660
She wants to help her baby.

734
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,230
She's just confused

735
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,230
about how to do it.

736
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,610
I'm sorry.

737
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,610
Our hands are tied.

738
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,350
What happened?

739
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,410
Sats are at 78

740
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,410
and dropping.

741
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,390
He's in pulmonary edema.

742
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,950
Get him on BiPAP

743
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,950
and 40 of Lasix.

744
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,690
He's my patient.

745
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,960
Sublingual nitro,

746
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,960
IV nitroprusside

747
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,590
and ready an intra-aortic

748
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,590
balloon pump.

749
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,800
What's happening?

750
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,800
The leak in your valve

751
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,770
is causing fluid to back up

752
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,770
into your lungs.

753
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,970
BiPAP's at 100%.

754
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,970
Balloon pump is here.

755
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,630
What's that?

756
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,580
It's a pump that we can

757
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,580
implant directly

758
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,050
into his aorta to take

759
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,050
the strain off of his heart.

760
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,670
Meds are in.

761
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,670
Still satting at 78.

762
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,650
So, then he's hooked up

763
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,650
to a machine forever?

764
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,780
Possibly if his heart doesn't

765
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,780
respond to the medications.

766
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,980
Oh, my God.

767
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,980
Betadine.

768
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,580
Hold on.

769
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,580
Dr. Rhodes...

770
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,720
Give the meds

771
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,720
a minute to work.

772
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,820
We may not have a minute.

773
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,230
Look.

774
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,260
Your sats are coming up.

775
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,730
We'll hold off for now.

776
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,530
Give him 1.25 of enalapril IV

777
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,530
and another 40 of Lasix.

778
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,070
Mr. Dutra. Hi.

779
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,740
I need you to talk

780
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,740
to your wife.

781
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,250
She won't listen to me.

782
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,080
But you do understand

783
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,080
this has gotten out of hand.

784
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,280
Of course I do.

785
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,840
I mean, all she thinks

786
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,840
about is how

787
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,580
uric acid and compromised soil

788
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,280
are infecting

789
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,280
everything we eat.

790
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,890
What do I say to that?

791
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,390
Well, how did you handle it

792
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,390
in the past?

793
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,860
It wasn't this bad before.

794
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,020
I mean, she's always struggled

795
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,900
with anxiety

796
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,900
and control issues.

797
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,300
But when she got pregnant,

798
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,990
it's like she turned the dial

799
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,990
straight to 11.

800
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,960
Nothing's pure enough anymore.

801
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,870
Everything looks

802
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,870
like baby poison.

803
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,740
But there has to be

804
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,740
something you can say

805
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,370
to get her to let us help.

806
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,210
I am so scared my wife

807
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,210
and my baby are gonna die.

808
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,200
Can't you do something?

809
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,290
So you think I avoid conflict

810
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,290
to protect myself?

811
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,660
I think it is a possibility.

812
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,020
And you think

813
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,020
that's a pattern.

814
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,430
Yes. A destructive one,

815
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,430
from the sounds of it.

816
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,330
I can't believe

817
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,330
I didn't see it.

818
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,040
I will get your discharge

819
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,040
paperwork started.

820
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,420
Looks like you had

821
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,420
a little breakthrough.

822
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,750
I... I think she sees

823
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,750
that she has some issues

824
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,090
and that it will be worthwhile

825
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,930
for her to seek

826
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,930
some long-term therapy.

827
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,760
Sounds like a good start.

828
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,670
I, um...

829
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,670
I was wrong about her,

830
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,670
Dr. Charles.

831
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,540
Thank you for making me

832
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,540
stick with her.

833
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,040
Dr. Choi.

834
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,310
Pulse ox is down to 82.

835
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,750
No breath sounds

836
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,750
on the left.

837
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,880
He's got pneumothorax.

838
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,860
Get a chest tube, 26 French.

839
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,260
I can't breathe.

840
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,290
I'm afraid

841
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,290
your lung's collapsed.

842
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,590
Radiology must've nicked it

843
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,590
during the tap.

844
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,720
You're kidding me.

845
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,160
I'm so sorry, Henry.

846
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
I need to insert a tube

847
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
between your ribs

848
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,860
to reinflate your lung.

849
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,730
Do you understand, Mr. Lee?

850
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,430
Lidocaine.

851
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,070
Henry, I'm just

852
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,070
gonna lift your arm.

853
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,270
You're gonna feel a sting.

854
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,380
Just breathe.

855
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,850
It's okay. We're gonna

856
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,850
get you through this.

857
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,480
All I wanted was

858
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,480
my damn medicine.

859
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,280
I know.

860
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,280
Then why'd you let him

861
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,280
do this to me?

862
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,850
I was fine.

863
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,100
Oh, God.

864
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,900
It feels like

865
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,900
you're stabbing me

866
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,900
with a knife.

867
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,600
Breathe.

868
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,370
Put him on suction,

869
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,370
get a portable chest X-ray,

870
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,240
gram of cefazolin,

871
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,240
a milligram of morphine

872
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,140
and dress it with xeroform.

873
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,240
At this point I'm gonna have

874
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,240
to admit you, Mr. Lee.

875
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,780
Probably for several days.

876
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,780
I'm very sorry.

877
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,450
I'll check back on him soon.

878
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,990
I'm sorry.

879
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,420
What the hell are you

880
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,420
trying to do me?

881
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,720
Please, Ms. Dutra,

882
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,720
let me explain...

883
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,200
I told you no food!

884
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,200
Just one second.

885
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,930
What's going on?

886
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,930
I need you to calm down,

887
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,930
okay? Please.

888
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
She put this in my IV

889
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,730
behind my back.

890
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,730
Ms. Dutra, wait.

891
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,070
Glucose, amino acids.

892
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,160
You did this?

893
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,970
Ms. Dutra.

894
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,970
Julie.

895
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,980
Ms. Dutra, just relax.

896
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,980
Julie!

897
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,840
Ms. Dutra, we need

898
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,840
to get you back into bed.

899
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,110
Get her away from me.

900
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,180
Get her away from me!

901
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,080
I need some help here.

902
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,980
All right, easy.

903
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,580
Relax, I have her.

904
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,260
Let's get her back up.

905
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,060
Dr. Reese.

906
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,100
Your patient in 1's waiting

907
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,100
for his prescription.

908
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,500
Okay.

909
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,470
Hey, have you seen my pad?

910
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,760
Uh-uh.

911
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,000
Huh.

912
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,970
Have you seen

913
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,970
my prescription pad?

914
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,070
No.

915
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,070
No?

916
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,010
I couldn't have lost it.

917
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,170
I always put it back

918
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,170
in my pocket, always...

919
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,090
Hey, do you still need

920
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,090
that note for the judge?

921
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,420
Oh, no, it's fine, my lawyer

922
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,420
actually took care of it.

923
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,420
Oh, good. Could you please

924
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,420
open your purse?

925
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,420
I'm sorry?

926
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,420
I can't find

927
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,190
my prescription pad.

928
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,190
I want to check your purse.

929
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,750
I don't know why you think

930
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,750
it'd be in there.

931
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,990
Because you decided

932
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,990
to forge the judge a note

933
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,060
and you took it from my pocket

934
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,060
when you hugged me.

935
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,530
I have no idea

936
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,530
what you're

937
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,530
talking about.

938
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,440
Hey! Give me that!

939
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,270
So what's this?

940
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,570
You have no right.

941
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,570
You're gonna pay for this!

942
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,310
Ma'am!

943
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,310
I am gonna make you pay!

944
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,080
Hey! Hey.

945
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,080
Ma'am, step away now!

946
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,140
She assaulted me.

947
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,140
She... She put

948
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,140
that in my purse.

949
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,810
Okay, everybody calm down.

950
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,140
Dr. Reese.

951
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,670
What happened in there?

952
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,300
She stole my pad.

953
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,100
That's a felony.

954
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,880
She has been lying to us

955
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,880
from the start.

956
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,440
Of course she has.

957
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,210
Lying, manipulating.

958
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
Behaving recklessly with no

959
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
regard for herself or others.

960
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,380
Exactly.

961
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,380
No.

962
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,430
Not exactly.

963
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,360
Look, off the top of my head,

964
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,430
probably a sociopath,

965
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,190
but that makes your job

966
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,190
exploring that

967
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,330
and trying to help her.

968
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,070
Not punishing her.

969
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,110
But all she did from

970
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,110
the moment she got here

971
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,660
was try to manipulate us

972
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,660
and waste our time.

973
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,440
Because she's mentally ill.

974
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
No. No, it's because people

975
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
like you let her.

976
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,950
People like me?

977
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,950
Yes.

978
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,280
Yes, you enable

979
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,280
and you make excuses

980
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,320
and you give out

981
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,320
psychiatric diagnoses

982
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,290
so that no one has to be held

983
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,290
accountable for their actions

984
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,590
just like you did

985
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,590
with the guy that shot you.

986
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,100
You feeling any better?

987
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,170
A little bit.

988
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,600
Good.

989
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,570
If there's anything

990
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,570
that you need,

991
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,710
Dr. Latham

992
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,710
and Dr. Bekker

993
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,040
are gonna be

994
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,040
taking care of you

995
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,580
from here on out, okay?

996
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,980
Dr. Rhodes.

997
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,050
Am I gonna be

998
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,050
like this forever?

999
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,490
Things will get better once

1000
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,490
they optimize your meds.

1001
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,590
But I'll always be

1002
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,590
coming back here

1003
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,590
for something, right?

1004
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,600
There's no way to go back

1005
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,600
to how I was?

1006
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,780
It is possible to redo

1007
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,780
your valve surgery.

1008
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,910
It comes

1009
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,910
with significant risks.

1010
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,610
You could end up with an even

1011
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,610
worse leak than before.

1012
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,080
You could even die.

1013
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,350
But it could work.

1014
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,950
I could go back to normal?

1015
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,130
Dr. Latham is the best

1016
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,130
this hospital's got.

1017
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,240
I promise he's gonna take

1018
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,240
great care of you.

1019
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,790
This is why I didn't want

1020
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,790
to do the lung test.

1021
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,230
Still the right call.

1022
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,230
No, you don't know that.

1023
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,420
You don't know him...

1024
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,420
But I know

1025
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,830
what heart failure looks like,

1026
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,830
and this just seems

1027
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,830
like something else.

1028
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,960
I've been treating

1029
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,960
Henry for years.

1030
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,960
This is what he looks like.

1031
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,870
I'm not asking

1032
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,870
for a second opinion.

1033
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,960
You don't want my opinion.

1034
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,370
Just because I don't have

1035
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,370
an MD after my name

1036
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,310
doesn't mean I don't know

1037
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,310
what's best for my patient.

1038
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,400
April, as the doctor,

1039
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,400
I'm responsible.

1040
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,410
I have to do

1041
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,410
what I think is right.

1042
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,180
Both of you, in there. Now.

1043
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,780
This has to stop.

1044
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,750
Do you need another nurse

1045
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,750
on your case, Dr. Choi?

1046
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,190
No.

1047
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,190
Uh, excuse me.

1048
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,960
Why didn't you ask me

1049
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,960
if I need a new doctor?

1050
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,230
April.

1051
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,230
He's just as much my patient

1052
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,230
as he is Dr. Choi's.

1053
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,330
I don't know what's going on

1054
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,330
between the two of you,

1055
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,430
but if you don't stop

1056
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,430
disturbing my ED,

1057
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,340
I'm gonna separate you

1058
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,340
for good.

1059
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,040
Do you understand?

1060
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,370
Clear.

1061
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,640
Good.

1062
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,650
Carry on.

1063
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,230
You're very lucky

1064
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,230
her husband convinced her

1065
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,200
not to pursue action

1066
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,200
against you or the hospital.

1067
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,270
Ms. Goodwin, I'm sorry.

1068
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,910
I expect better from you,

1069
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,910
Dr. Manning.

1070
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,710
Nat, wait.

1071
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,250
Hi.

1072
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,260
I'm sorry.

1073
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm really not interested.

1074
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,330
I understand.

1075
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,330
You didn't trust us before.

1076
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,960
You certainly have no reason

1077
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,960
to trust us now.

1078
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,970
Then we finally agree

1079
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,970
on something.

1080
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,700
Julie.

1081
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,600
Fearing for your baby's safety

1082
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,910
is the most natural thing

1083
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,910
in the world.

1084
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,550
When I was pregnant,

1085
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,650
I lost my husband.

1086
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,260
I was afraid

1087
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,260
of a lot of things.

1088
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,690
And then one day,

1089
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,690
after I had my son,

1090
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,960
I was up in a high-rise

1091
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,960
building on the balcony

1092
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,200
and suddenly had this

1093
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,200
vivid image of myself

1094
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,900
falling over the railing.

1095
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,470
And my first thought was,

1096
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,470
what would happen to my son

1097
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,240
if I wasn't here for him?

1098
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,480
And the craziest part is,

1099
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,480
my favorite thing in the world

1100
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,210
had always been Ferris wheels

1101
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,210
and roller coasters

1102
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,950
and being up in the air.

1103
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,250
But from that day on,

1104
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,220
I had this totally irrational

1105
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,220
fear of heights.

1106
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,620
It is really scary

1107
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,620
being solely responsible

1108
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,130
for that tiny, defenseless

1109
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,130
person inside of you.

1110
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,770
But you are letting

1111
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,770
your fear win.

1112
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,500
And it's gonna end badly.

1113
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,410
Anyway...

1114
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,910
I am sorry.

1115
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,100
I just got the analysis

1116
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,100
of Henry's lung tap.

1117
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,380
Non-small-cell lung cancer?

1118
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,710
You were right to do the tap.

1119
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,090
That's not important.

1120
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,420
What matters now is that

1121
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,420
he needs to be told,

1122
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,230
and I think it would be best

1123
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,230
if he hears it from you.

1124
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,800
You've treated him longer

1125
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,800
than anyone here.

1126
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,770
You know him better

1127
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,770
than anyone here.

1128
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,430
Why is Mr. Willis

1129
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,430
insisting on surgery

1130
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,060
despite my explicit

1131
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,060
recommendation

1132
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,570
to the contrary?

1133
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,570
Dr. Latham, I...

1134
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,970
Did you go behind my back?

1135
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,740
No, he asked

1136
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,740
if he had options.

1137
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,250
So I told him.

1138
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,250
I in no way suggested...

1139
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,380
You've shown extremely poor

1140
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,380
decision-making today.

1141
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,410
From this point on,

1142
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,410
you are not

1143
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,410
to set foot in the OR

1144
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,190
until I deem you

1145
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,190
ready to return.

1146
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,160
Do you understand?

1147
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,160
You're benching me?

1148
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,250
For the foreseeable

1149
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,250
future. Yes.

1150
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,200
Dr. Halstead.

1151
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,640
Her heart rate's too high

1152
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,640
and her pressure's dropping.

1153
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,800
Baby's heart rate's

1154
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,800
down to 90.

1155
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,000
My chest hurts.

1156
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,450
Your arrhythmia is

1157
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,450
escalating out of control.

1158
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,310
Push ten milligrams

1159
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,310
of diltiazem stat

1160
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,750
and up her 0-2 to 6 liters.

1161
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,840
We need to do a C-section.

1162
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,840
We have to get the baby out.

1163
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,220
No.

1164
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,590
Julie, I know you

1165
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,590
don't trust me,

1166
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,390
but your baby is

1167
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,390
in real danger.

1168
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,120
84.

1169
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,120
Julie, let them do it.

1170
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,490
I can't.

1171
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,320
Julie, if you don't

1172
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,320
let us do this,

1173
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,260
your baby is going to die.

1174
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,360
Okay, do it.

1175
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,360
Thank you.

1176
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,440
Call OB and tell them

1177
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,440
we're coming up

1178
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,770
for a crash C-section, now!

1179
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,500
You heard her.

1180
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,500
Let's move.

1181
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm not seeing

1182
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,480
any cause for the leak.

1183
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,480
Pickups.

1184
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,820
Pickups.

1185
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,850
Are any of the leaflets

1186
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,850
impinged in the ventricle?

1187
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,620
No,

1188
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,620
they're opening freely, and

1189
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,620
the orientation is correct.

1190
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,860
So what do we do?

1191
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,860
Re-suture the valve.

1192
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,830
Won't give us

1193
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,830
much room to work,

1194
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,770
but I don't see where

1195
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,770
we have a choice.

1196
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,040
It's the valve.

1197
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,970
It's the valve.

1198
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,210
Dr. Rhodes, no one asked

1199
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,210
for your opinion.

1200
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,280
It's a brand-new valve.

1201
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,280
That's ridiculous.

1202
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,250
The leaflets

1203
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,250
must be asymmetrical.

1204
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,450
That would cause

1205
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,450
a large enough

1206
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,450
opening for the blood

1207
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,610
to keep leaking back through.

1208
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,290
It does seem that they're

1209
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,290
not closing properly.

1210
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,160
Really? They gave us

1211
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,160
a bad valve?

1212
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,730
It appears so.

1213
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,730
Dr. Rhodes,

1214
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,730
go change your clothes.

1215
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,400
I'd like you to scrub in for

1216
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,400
the remainder of the surgery.

1217
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,250
How are you feeling?

1218
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,250
I'm okay.

1219
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,680
What are they putting in him?

1220
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,860
Proteins,

1221
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,860
carbohydrates, fats.

1222
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,090
He needs them to grow.

1223
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,040
You paged about a consult?

1224
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,100
Yeah. Yeah.

1225
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,980
Um...

1226
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,510
Fifty-something guy,

1227
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,510
post-op after

1228
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,510
getting shot by a patient.

1229
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,320
Is this a joke?

1230
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,960
No. I'm serious.

1231
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,390
Give me your clinical

1232
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,390
evaluation of my recovery.

1233
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,730
No residual anger or fear.

1234
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,500
Mmm-hmm.

1235
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,700
Normal intellectual

1236
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,700
and emotional functioning.

1237
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,670
You seem like

1238
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,670
you have moved on.

1239
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,470
Yeah.

1240
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,440
And you should too.

1241
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,140
Excuse me?

1242
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,840
I'm just wondering if today

1243
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,840
was less about your patient

1244
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,820
and more about lingering fears

1245
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,820
for our safety.

1246
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,520
It is certainly true

1247
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,220
that a very few patients

1248
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,220
can be dangerous.

1249
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,360
But the overwhelming

1250
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,360
majority are

1251
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,390
harmless and in fact

1252
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,390
very grateful for our help.

1253
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,100
Only they can't get that help

1254
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,100
if you come to work scared.

1255
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,430
I'm not scared.

1256
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,300
This is not an accusation,

1257
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,300
Doctor.

1258
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,340
I just want you to know

1259
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,340
that every psychiatrist

1260
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,740
goes through this

1261
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,740
at some point or another.

1262
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,610
And then it passes.

1263
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,810
And it'll pass for you, too.

1264
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,600
Seems the hospital

1265
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,600
changed valve manufacturers

1266
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,870
several weeks ago.

1267
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,670
This particular company

1268
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,670
didn't bother

1269
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,570
to conduct any

1270
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,570
human testing.

1271
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,800
And they can do that?

1272
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,680
All they have to do is prove

1273
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,450
that it performs the same

1274
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,450
function as a previous device.

1275
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,050
Unbelievable.

1276
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,850
Well...

1277
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,220
Good night, Dr. Latham.

1278
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,060
When surgeons burn out,

1279
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,060
it always starts with stress.

1280
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,330
Then a call goes

1281
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,330
the wrong way,

1282
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,330
an unlucky result.

1283
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,740
And they get

1284
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,740
in their own heads,

1285
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,240
and that's when

1286
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,240
the hesitation starts,

1287
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,310
the unsteady hands.

1288
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,670
And once you're there,

1289
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,280
it's a very hard road back.

1290
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,950
Are you okay, Dr. Rhodes?

1291
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,390
Yes. I am.

1292
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,230
Then you continue to have

1293
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,230
my full confidence.

1294
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,420
Good night.

1295
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,260
Good night.

1296
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,910
I'm sorry.

1297
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,080
Me too.

1298
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,460
This isn't gonna be easy,

1299
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,460
is it?

1300
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,620
No, it's not.

1301
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,690
Though you know

1302
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,690
what would help?

1303
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,830
Big pot of chili.

1304
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,830
Sushi?

1305
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,230
I'll see you later.

1306
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,230
Yeah.

1307
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,940
Hey.

1308
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,210
How'd that metal detector

1309
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,210
thing turn out?

1310
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,910
I changed my mind.

1311
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,440
Really?

1312
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,440
Yeah.

1313
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,820
I saw a woman today

1314
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,820
who almost killed her baby

1315
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,680
because she didn't trust us.

1316
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,250
And I thought,

1317
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,620
"How can we encourage people

1318
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,620
to trust us more

1319
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,660
"if we don't show them

1320
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,660
trust first?"

1321
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,690
Couldn't agree more.

1322
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,240
Well, uh, good night.

1323
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,240
All right, see you tomorrow.

1324
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,190
Dr. Reese, Dr. Sexton.

1325
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,190
Check it out.

1326
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,980
Someone slashed her tires.

1327
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,950
You still think patients

1328
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,950
are harmless?

1329
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,360
She did this.

1330
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,790
Yes, I'm still here.

1331
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,070
I'm sorry you don't

1332
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,070
even get a real meal

1333
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,010
after the day you have had.

1334
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,680
Oh, a little vegetarian

1335
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,680
living never hurt anybody.

1336
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,420
Well, I'm sorry that

1337
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,420
you have to put up with

1338
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,750
all of this.

1339
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,490
I promise it will

1340
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,490
be better soon.

1341
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,450
I know.

1342
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,320
It's almost 9:00.

1343
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,320
Aren't we gonna miss

1344
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,320
our reservation?

1345
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,580
Maybe.

1346
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,210
So then what

1347
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,210
are we doing here?

1348
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,360
What?

1349
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,860
No. No, no, no. No way.

1350
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,860
Mmm-mmm.

1351
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,090
Hey, you're not gonna

1352
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,090
let fear win, are you?

1353
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,830
Uh, yes.

1354
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,830
Yes, I am.

1355
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,060
Aw, come on.

1356
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,630
Just one ride.

1357
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,400
Oh, Will, no.

1358
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,410
Natalie, I'm gonna be

1359
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,410
next to you the whole time.

1360
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,340
Trust me.
