1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,460
The form asks

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,460
for an employer.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,460
I'm retired,

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,100
so... Should I just

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,100
leave it blank?

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,070
Sure, they'll figure it out.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,140
Hey, Emily.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,140
Hey!

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,840
How's the first day going?

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,280
I've helped four people

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,280
with the vending machine,

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,180
three with directions

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,180
to the cafeteria.

14
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,690
Closing in on 2,000 steps

15
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,690
carrying paperwork.

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,690
Oh, and I'm wearing

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,690
a triple-XL vest,

18
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,390
because the one in my size

19
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,390
has barf on it.

20
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,890
I wish I could say

21
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,890
the waiting room

22
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,360
gets more glamorous,

23
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,360
but it doesn't.

24
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,060
Yeah.

25
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,900
She's gonna quit.

26
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,900
You don't know that.

27
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,370
Volunteering could be

28
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,370
huge for Emily.

29
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,410
Responsibility, purpose.

30
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm just worried

31
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,140
she won't see it through.

32
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,110
Give her a chance.

33
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,220
Remember those tickets

34
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,220
we bought for The Revivalists?

35
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,810
Oh, yeah.

36
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,810
Yeah, it's next weekend.

37
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,150
Well, you go. Take Jay.

38
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,430
I'm not going on a date

39
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,430
with my brother.

40
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,330
Don't you want them?

41
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,730
I promised Owen

42
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,730
I'd take him to Navy Pier.

43
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,430
You use 'em.

44
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,240
Faster scan rates,

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,070
a greater resolution,

46
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,170
a host of diagnostic

47
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,170
improvements

48
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,740
in cardiac calcium scoring,

49
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,680
TAVR planning.

50
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,680
I get it, okay?

51
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,410
The... The ED would put

52
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,410
a new CT scanner to good use,

53
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,680
but the machine alone's

54
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,680
upwards of $2 million.

55
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,780
Okay, then there's

56
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,780
maintenance.

57
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,780
You got tech support...

58
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,090
And higher patient throughput,

59
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,860
which is increased

60
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,860
revenue, Peter. Come on.

61
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,060
I'd go to the board myself,

62
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,070
but considering my stock

63
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,070
these days,

64
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,800
it'll sound better

65
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,800
coming from you.

66
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,740
Well, so much for

67
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,740
a free cup of coffee, huh?

68
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,370
I need help over here!

69
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,780
What the hell?

70
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,290
We just piled

71
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,290
them in and drove.

72
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,390
I need a doctor!

73
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,760
What is going on?

74
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,800
Some lunatic opened fire

75
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,800
with an automatic rifle

76
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,130
at Millenium Park.

77
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,130
How many victims?

78
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,370
A lot.

79
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,950
Clear every treatment room

80
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,950
and trauma bay.

81
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,810
Patients go to

82
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,810
the waiting room.

83
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,310
We need more space

84
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,310
on the floor.

85
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,820
Chairs, COWS, carts,

86
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,780
pile everything

87
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,780
in the consultation room.

88
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,340
Lock down the

89
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,340
walk-in entrance.

90
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,320
From now on,

91
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,320
all patients funnel through

92
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,320
the ambulance bay.

93
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,480
Maggie, trigger an

94
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,480
All Hazards Disaster Plan.

95
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,290
Every doctor, nurse, and tech

96
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,290
on call gets in here now.

97
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,690
Already on it.

98
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,690
How many victims

99
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,690
can we handle?

100
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,820
Sixteen yellow tags,

101
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,820
four, maybe five red tags.

102
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,200
We're gonna have

103
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,200
more than that.

104
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,760
You're going to Trauma 1.

105
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,100
Deb?

106
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,660
She's pouring blood

107
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,660
everywhere.

108
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,000
Prep a chest tray

109
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,000
for an ED thoracotomy.

110
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,440
No, no, no,

111
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,440
Mass Casualty protocol.

112
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,340
No chance of recovery,

113
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,340
no resuscitation.

114
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,180
Save the living, Dr. Sexton.

115
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,880
Doris, move her out.

116
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,210
Dr. Choi, April, Baghdad.

117
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,210
On it.

118
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,520
Go, go, go.

119
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,850
All right, weak pulse,

120
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,850
not breathing.

121
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,860
One, two, three, four holes,

122
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,860
face, neck, chest.

123
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,330
Belly's hard as a rock.

124
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,330
He's bleeding

125
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,330
into his abdomen.

126
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,020
Okay, we'll deal with that

127
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,020
after we get him an airway.

128
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,860
Intubation kit?

129
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,860
Yes, Doctor.

130
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,430
Half his face is gone.

131
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,430
No chance I get a tube in.

132
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,430
He needs a crich.

133
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,840
Here we go!

134
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,840
They're coming in!

135
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,880
Noah, you're going

136
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,880
to Treatment 1.

137
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,070
Dr. Reese,

138
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,070
you're going to Treatment Two.

139
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,380
There you go, sir.

140
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,970
Dr. Charles?

141
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,970
Yeah, Maggie?

142
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,080
You're going

143
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,080
to Treatment 3.

144
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,820
Okay, file in down the line.

145
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,360
You're going to 4,

146
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,360
you're going to 5...

147
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,450
There you go...

148
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,450
And you're going to 6.

149
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,060
There you go.

150
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,570
Be careful. Rotate.

151
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,570
Rotate here.

152
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,140
FAST scan.

153
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,080
I can't get the tube in.

154
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,640
Too much blood

155
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,640
in the airway. Suction.

156
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,010
Blood in the pelvis.

157
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,850
Two more units of O-neg

158
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,850
on the rapid transfuser.

159
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,590
Block party today

160
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,590
at Millennium Park.

161
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,420
Saturday plus tourists.

162
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,420
Gotta be a few thousand people

163
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,420
down there.

164
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,050
Owen's nanny sometimes

165
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,050
brings him down there

166
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,050
to ride his scooter.

167
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,690
I don't know

168
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,690
if they went today.

169
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
I'm sure

170
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
they're fine, Natalie.

171
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,700
Yeah, that's what I keep

172
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,700
telling myself.

173
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,100
Okay, I'm in. Bag him.

174
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,940
Maggie?

175
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,940
Yeah?

176
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,640
I don't know if Owen and his

177
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,640
nanny went to the park today.

178
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,880
Can you...

179
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,880
I have her number.

180
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,380
I'll call her. Okay.

181
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,380
Thank you.

182
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,060
Oh, my God.

183
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,560
Where do we begin?

184
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,060
Maggie?

185
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,060
Yeah?

186
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,330
We need to prioritize

187
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,330
surgical candidates.

188
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,870
Where are they?

189
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,870
Everywhere.

190
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,830
Connor, I need you.

191
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,130
All right, start in

192
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,130
the treatment rooms.

193
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,670
I'll meet you

194
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,670
on the other side.

195
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,910
Sinus tach.

196
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,910
Pressure dropping.

197
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,310
Trach tube.

198
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,540
All set up.

199
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,950
He's crashing.

200
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,950
Asystole. I'm on his chest.

201
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,720
No compressions.

202
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,720
We can't save him.

203
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,590
Dr. Choi, I'm losing

204
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,590
her pulse.

205
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,590
She's apneic.

206
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,300
Okay, time of death, 14:38.

207
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,160
Him out, her in.

208
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,130
April, Stohl needs you

209
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,130
in Triage.

210
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,830
Come on, come on, let's go.

211
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,830
Go.

212
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,630
Doris, can you move him?

213
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,630
Morgue's full.

214
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,200
Okay, then just find

215
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,200
a place up here.

216
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,710
Bag her.

217
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,950
Two IVs? What's that mean?

218
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,950
Is it bad?

219
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,010
No, no, no,

220
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,010
it's just a move now

221
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,710
to save time later

222
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,710
if there is an emergency.

223
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,510
Emergency?

224
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,510
But I have a yellow tag.

225
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,560
That means stable, right?

226
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,320
Red's the bad one and black...

227
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,920
No, no, no, it's just

228
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,920
a preemptive measure.

229
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,920
That's all.

230
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,550
The shots,

231
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,550
they just kept coming.

232
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,190
I... I ran,

233
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,190
but I got knocked down

234
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,190
and I couldn't get up.

235
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,530
I can't imagine.

236
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,270
I... I'm so sorry.

237
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,070
All around me,

238
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,070
people were just being...

239
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,940
Torn apart.

240
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,470
This blood is not mine!

241
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,570
Shh. Okay.

242
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,570
Shh. Look at me.

243
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,570
Look at me.

244
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,080
Slow, deep breaths, okay?

245
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,090
Like this. Loo... Look...

246
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,150
Dr. Charles,

247
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,150
she's reliving the moment.

248
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,960
No! No! Who are you?

249
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,890
Hey, here, take my hand.

250
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,890
Okay, it's okay.

251
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,560
Look at me, look at me,

252
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,560
look at me, look at me.

253
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,540
Look at my hands.

254
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,540
You see me holding your hands?

255
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,970
You feel me

256
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,970
holding your hands?

257
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,400
You're safe.

258
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,400
You're in a hospital.

259
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,400
You're here with me.

260
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,910
We're gonna take care of ya,

261
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,910
all right?

262
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,970
I'm Dr. Charles.

263
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,970
Can you tell me your name?

264
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,080
Uh, Jill.

265
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay, Jill.

266
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,750
We got this, okay?

267
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,380
Okay.

268
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,680
It'll be all right.

269
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,250
...appears to be

270
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,250
a mass shooting in Chicago...

271
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,660
Water?

272
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,460
Uh, would you like a water?

273
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,100
Oh, my God.

274
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,000
Uh, help? Help!

275
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,970
Uh, he... He just

276
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,970
looked at me

277
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,970
and slumped.

278
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,410
Okay, he's breathing.

279
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Weak carotid pulse.

280
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Nothing radial.

281
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,040
I need a gurney!

282
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,520
Help me elevate his legs.

283
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,690
Emily?

284
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,690
Uh...

285
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,750
What happened?

286
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,160
BP dropped too low.

287
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,160
He passed out.

288
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,690
Sometimes a fracture can

289
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,690
trigger a sudden dip.

290
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,560
There could be a broken bone

291
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,560
beneath the swelling.

292
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,630
What's going on?

293
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,630
You passed out.

294
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,830
Sorry.

295
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,460
I'm gonna get you

296
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,460
on some IV fluids

297
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,470
and send you in for an X-ray

298
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,470
of your right arm.

299
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,810
Feels busted.

300
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,300
Good thing I'm a lefty.

301
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,300
Sorry.

302
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,970
I shouldn't joke right now.

303
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,610
It's just... This is a lot.

304
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,150
It's okay.

305
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,080
I get it. Don't feel bad.

306
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,990
This is madness.

307
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,790
Dr. Stohl,

308
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,790
we've got incoming.

309
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,660
Yes. How many?

310
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,660
Twenty-five,

311
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,660
at least 10 critical.

312
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,320
That's too many.

313
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,320
We're already swamped.

314
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,160
They need to be rerouted

315
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,160
to East Mercy

316
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,160
or Lakeshore Memorial.

317
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,670
They can't.

318
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,670
They're choked up too.

319
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,170
They're trying to send

320
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,170
patients to us.

321
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,830
So let's get Maggie

322
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,830
to double up patients

323
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,170
into treatment rooms

324
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,170
and trauma bays.

325
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,770
Remove the dividing walls

326
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,770
to make the space.

327
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,480
April, with me, we need

328
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,480
to help unload these ambos.

329
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,030
Two per room?

330
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,030
That's not gonna do it.

331
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,270
No, not even close.

332
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,710
Hey, Maggie,

333
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,710
where do you want us?

334
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,380
Treatment room,

335
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,380
wherever you can fit.

336
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,220
Copy.

337
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,220
Maggie?

338
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,450
Follow Noah and make space.

339
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,450
Mmm-hmm.

340
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,050
No, no, no, no, no,

341
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,050
I gotta stagger the intake.

342
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,360
Find a trauma bay.

343
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,360
They're all jammed.

344
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,300
Well, elevator hallway?

345
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,730
Did you get to Liz?

346
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,730
No, voicemail.

347
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,170
Please keep trying.

348
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,170
Yeah.

349
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,410
Two hemostats

350
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,410
and 10 ml of lidocaine.

351
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,470
We're out of lidocaine.

352
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,470
Waiting on resupply.

353
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,740
50 mics of fentanyl instead?

354
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,740
25.

355
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,610
He's gonna need a neuroexam.

356
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,610
Can't dope him up.

357
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
All right, squeeze my hand.

358
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
Come on, it's only

359
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
gonna take a second.

360
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,920
Okay, keep squeezing.

361
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,420
We're almost there.

362
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,060
Done.

363
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,060
What do you got?

364
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,180
Lacerated right carotid.

365
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,420
Bleeding's under control

366
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,420
for now.

367
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,550
What's his pressure?

368
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,100
Low but holding. 89 over 50.

369
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,100
All right, up his volume.

370
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,070
I'll get him in the OR

371
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,070
as soon as I can.

372
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,360
He can't wait.

373
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,360
Connor, I clamped off

374
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,360
blood flow to his brain.

375
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,460
He sits too long...

376
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,460
He hasn't stroked.

377
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,300
That means he's got adequate

378
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,300
flow on the other side.

379
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,300
He can wait.

380
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,100
Dr. Rhodes, I need you in

381
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,100
3, 4, 6 and 7.

382
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,440
Who's first?

383
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,070
Ava and I are running

384
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,070
all over the place.

385
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,580
We get to one patient, three

386
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,580
more pile up somewhere else.

387
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,910
This isn't working.

388
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,810
Oh, heads up,

389
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,810
next wave five minutes out.

390
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,620
Ms. Goodwin,

391
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,620
we're stabilizing patients,

392
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,550
but if we can't get them

393
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,550
to surgery,

394
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,550
we'll start losing them.

395
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,210
Unless something changes,

396
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,210
the ED's gonna collapse.

397
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,380
Well, if you have an idea,

398
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,380
now is the time.

399
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,890
Casualty collection areas.

400
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
Designated zones for

401
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
specific treatments,

402
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,320
especially surgical eval.

403
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,660
Doctors stay put,

404
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,660
patients shuttle

405
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,660
between zones.

406
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,200
An assembly line?

407
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,660
All right,

408
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,660
you set it up in Triage,

409
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,500
I'll spread the word.

410
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,500
Yes, ma'am.

411
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,700
I saw the shooter.

412
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,310
I should've run at him,

413
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,180
tackled him,

414
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,180
done something,

415
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,980
but instead,

416
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,980
I just stood there,

417
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,320
like a coward,

418
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,320
while he mowed people down.

419
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,190
Have you heard of

420
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,190
fight-or-flight?

421
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,320
Before that is the freeze.

422
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,330
It's an instinct that kicks in

423
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,760
when there's no time to think.

424
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,860
Not running at that shooter

425
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,860
might've saved

426
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,860
your life, okay?

427
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,870
Can you tell me your name?

428
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,770
Sir, do you know

429
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,770
where you are?

430
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,010
Wow, you were, uh...

431
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
You were right there, huh?

432
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,090
Dr. Charles, uh, Dr. Reese...

433
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,720
Paramedics are bringing in

434
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,720
personal belongings

435
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,720
from the scene.

436
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,390
Uh, what should I do

437
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,390
with them?

438
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,560
Oh, this is awful.

439
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,030
Uh... Uh, people are gonna

440
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,030
wanna go through those,

441
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,040
so, um, we should put it

442
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,040
on display.

443
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,570
There's at least

444
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,570
three dozen boxes already,

445
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,400
and they said

446
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,400
there's more coming.

447
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,540
Um... Use the cafeteria.

448
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,540
Dr. Reese, can you oversee?

449
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,980
People are gonna be,

450
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,980
you know, overwhelmed and...

451
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,210
Yeah, got it.

452
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,890
Uh... Uh, I'm Dr. Charles.

453
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,950
What... What's your name?

454
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,950
Can you tell me your name?

455
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,890
Roger.

456
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,790
Where am I?

457
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,790
You're in a hospital.

458
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,460
You were... You were

459
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,460
involved in a shooting.

460
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,230
I was?

461
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,230
Yeah.

462
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,230
You know, you have

463
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,230
a wound on your head,

464
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,400
and I'd very much like to get

465
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,400
one of the ER doctors

466
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,670
just to take a look at it.

467
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,470
Would that be all right?

468
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,410
Yeah. Okay.

469
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,210
Okay, good.

470
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,080
All right, CTs and X-rays

471
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,080
are in the elevator hallway.

472
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,180
If the line gets long, just

473
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,180
snake it around the corner.

474
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,880
Monique, 1 and 2

475
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,880
are now laceration repair

476
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,920
and hemorrhage control.

477
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,920
You lead.

478
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,590
Dr. Sexton, Trauma 2 is now

479
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,590
strictly for chest tubes.

480
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,960
Once they're in,

481
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,960
move them to Baghdad

482
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,960
for surgical eval.

483
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,190
Okay.

484
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,190
Ms. Goodwin...

485
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,190
Yes?

486
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,300
We're abandoning protocol?

487
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,300
Uh, have to.

488
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,200
Our disaster plan

489
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,200
wasn't designed

490
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,110
for an incident this massive.

491
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,540
But a change on the fly?

492
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,540
That makes me nervous.

493
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,700
Noted.

494
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,140
Uh, Dr. Halstead, you now live

495
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,140
in Treatments 6 and 7.

496
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,710
Nothing but intubations.

497
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,090
Any person with

498
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,090
respiratory compromise

499
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,450
will be coming

500
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,450
straight to you.

501
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
Okay, but, uh,

502
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
meds are a problem.

503
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,960
It's taking forever for nurses

504
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,960
to run back and forth

505
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,960
pulling etomidate and sux.

506
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,120
All right, I'll override

507
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,120
the fingerprint scan

508
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
on the medication dispenser.

509
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,230
Leave the door open,

510
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,230
so nurses can stuff

511
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,230
their pockets.

512
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,960
We'll have no idea

513
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,960
who's getting what.

514
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,440
You mean who's being charged

515
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,440
for what, right?

516
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,670
Let's figure out

517
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,670
billing later.

518
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,470
I need help!

519
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,880
Trample victim. No pulse.

520
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,480
No breath sounds either.

521
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,480
On his chest.

522
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,450
April, quick look

523
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,450
and an intubation kit.

524
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,750
Then start a line to

525
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,750
push meds.

526
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,820
No, triple zero.

527
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,820
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

528
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,160
He's dead.

529
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,160
Where's his family?

530
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,160
I don't know.

531
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,000
Good Samaritan found him

532
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,000
on the ground not moving,

533
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,590
drove him in in his own car.

534
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,330
Dr. Bekker,

535
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,330
Dr. Rhodes is calling you.

536
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,680
If Owen and his nanny

537
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,680
did go to the park today,

538
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,410
what if they got

539
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,410
separated too?

540
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,310
Until you know for sure,

541
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,440
don't let your mind

542
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,440
lead you to a bad place.

543
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,750
Stay focused on right now.

544
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,860
Natalie, need extra hands.

545
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,850
April?

546
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,850
I'll move him.

547
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,390
I need a hand in here!

548
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,990
No! No, no, don't touch me!

549
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,630
I'm sorry, honey,

550
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,630
but I have to.

551
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,570
I'm a doctor, okay?

552
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,570
I promise you I'll be quick.

553
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,130
It hurts. Where's my mom?

554
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,370
We're gonna do our best

555
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,370
to try to find her,

556
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,880
but right now,

557
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,880
I have to help you.

558
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,280
Can I do that?

559
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,450
Thank you.

560
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,980
Bullet wounds

561
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,980
to the left hand,

562
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,310
the left thigh...

563
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,310
Where is she?

564
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,180
Good pulse

565
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,180
in the wrist and feet.

566
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,650
No life-threatening issues.

567
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,050
Four of morphine for the pain,

568
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,820
then bandage her wounds,

569
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,820
send her upstairs.

570
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,260
They can dress her up there.

571
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,690
I'm gonna send you

572
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,690
to another doctor, okay?

573
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
Be brave, sweetheart.

574
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
Okay.

575
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,660
Hole in the left

576
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,660
anterior chest wall.

577
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,330
Breath sounds present

578
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,330
and bilaterally.

579
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,860
Get him in line

580
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,860
for a chest X-ray.

581
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,060
Yep.

582
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,000
Things moving

583
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,000
smoother in here?

584
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,510
Yeah, bringing patients here

585
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,510
instead of us trying to

586
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,510
find them, it's a great call.

587
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Uh, heavy confusion,

588
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,700
memory loss,

589
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,490
no recollection of

590
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,490
what... What happened today.

591
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,760
He could barely

592
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,760
tell me his name.

593
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,640
But, I mean, I guess

594
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,640
it could be neural.

595
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,830
I'm just thinking shock.

596
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,430
Yeah, him and everyone else,

597
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,430
including me.

598
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,500
We'll stitch that up

599
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,500
when we get a chance.

600
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,610
Oh, my God. What...

601
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,050
Roger...

602
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,610
So, listen, I... I know

603
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,610
it's difficult to make sense

604
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,990
of what's going on

605
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,990
around you right now

606
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,420
and... And what

607
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,420
happened today,

608
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,820
but I can help you put

609
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,820
that puzzle together, okay?

610
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,520
Just keep some pressure

611
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,520
on this right now.

612
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,520
Dr. Charles?

613
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,600
Unconscious when he came in.

614
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,600
GSW nicked the external

615
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,600
jugular vein.

616
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,530
As long as he keeps

617
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,530
pressure on it,

618
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,530
his vitals are stable,

619
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,900
but he refuses to do it.

620
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,910
You keep pressure on that.

621
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,910
I'll be right back, okay?

622
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,940
I got it. How we doing?

623
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,250
You don't have to help me.

624
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,020
Yeah, well, I...

625
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,020
I mean, I kind of do,

626
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,080
'cause if... If somebody

627
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,080
doesn't hold this,

628
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,080
you're gonna die.

629
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,520
I'm okay with that.

630
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah, well, I'm not,

631
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,790
so I guess

632
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,790
you're stuck with me

633
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,790
for the moment anyway.

634
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm Dr. Charles.

635
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,920
What's your name?

636
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,430
Uh... Uh, Trevor.

637
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,960
Good pulse and BP,

638
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,960
but diminished breath sounds

639
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,960
on the left.

640
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,770
Chest X-ray.

641
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,170
Hey, man, how are you doing?

642
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,770
I'm fine.

643
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,770
Yeah?

644
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,050
All right, log roll.

645
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,250
Okay, okay. One...

646
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,350
Two holes, left delt,

647
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,350
right upper back.

648
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,450
Chest tube, then CT chest

649
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,450
and thoracic spine.

650
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,990
Keep him on his side.

651
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,620
You're gonna be fine, man.

652
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,620
You're gonna be fine.

653
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,750
Go.

654
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,200
More ambos inbound.

655
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,200
We'll be ready.

656
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,600
Hearing PD hasn't

657
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,600
found the shooter.

658
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,970
If he's still out there...

659
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,300
Yeah... This could get worse.

660
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,600
Dr. Choi,

661
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,600
we need you in Baghdad.

662
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,540
April, take over Triage.

663
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,540
What?

664
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,140
You've seen enough

665
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,140
bullet holes to gauge risk.

666
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,270
Ethan...

667
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,270
Dr. Choi!

668
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,980
April, hey, hey, hey,

669
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,980
eye the wound,

670
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,750
assess trajectory,

671
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,750
predict potential injuries,

672
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,480
then send them

673
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,480
where they need to be.

674
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
You got this.

675
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,490
One, two, three.

676
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,420
Heart rate's jumping,

677
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,420
BP's crashing.

678
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,800
There's only a trickle

679
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,800
of blood coming from

680
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,800
the chest tube.

681
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,430
Guy has two holes.

682
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,470
He was stable.

683
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,470
Hemorrhagic shock?

684
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,060
The GSW must've

685
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,060
traversed the liver.

686
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,160
FAST scan.

687
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,770
Two units O-neg

688
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,770
and two of plasma

689
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,770
on the rapid transfuser.

690
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,510
Chest tube must've clotted.

691
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,270
It took a bit,

692
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,270
but now he's coagulopathic.

693
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,180
Yeah, FAST scan's positive.

694
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,610
He's bleeding into

695
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,610
his chest and belly.

696
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,410
We need to replace the tube.

697
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,410
Scissors?

698
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,610
Connor, what's up?

699
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,620
This guy needs surgery,

700
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,620
but the OR is packed.

701
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,780
I need to convert Baghdad

702
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,780
and do it here.

703
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,160
Okay, I got

704
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,160
more victims en route.

705
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,520
You can have half the space.

706
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,190
No, I'm not opening him up

707
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,190
with people running in

708
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,190
and out.

709
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,330
Then take the doctor's lounge.

710
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,960
Four walls and a door,

711
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,960
as quiet as you're gonna get.

712
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,200
Doctor's lounge?

713
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,600
No gas lines, suction lines,

714
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,600
airflow capabilities,

715
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,800
it's short electrical outlets,

716
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,800
lighting?

717
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,640
Come on.

718
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,670
I'll take it.

719
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,770
Excuse us.

720
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,870
I'm sorry it took so long.

721
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,640
The police had

722
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,640
the streets blocked off.

723
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,620
Never mind, unimportant.

724
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,620
Where is Dr. Rhodes?

725
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,040
Operating in

726
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,040
the doctor's lounge.

727
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,510
Yeah, I know.

728
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,900
Dr. Latham,

729
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,900
good, you're here.

730
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,260
We're gonna do a laparotomy.

731
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,990
This is not a surgical suite,

732
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,990
Dr. Rhodes.

733
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,760
Oh, I know,

734
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,760
but I'm afraid

735
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,760
it's all we got.

736
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
We'll also need

737
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
an electrocautery machine

738
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,870
and an ultrasonic

739
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,870
cavitation device.

740
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,200
There's no

741
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,200
frills today, sorry.

742
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,740
No, no, no!

743
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,740
There can't be any shadows.

744
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,440
Dr. Latham, I know this is

745
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,440
a lot of change all at once,

746
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,880
but this patient is

747
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,880
running out of time.

748
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,610
I can't do the surgery alone.

749
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,610
I really need your help, okay?

750
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,480
Yes. Yes, of course.

751
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,440
I'll scrub in. Where?

752
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,190
Yeah.

753
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,290
All right, Connor,

754
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,290
anything else you need?

755
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,260
Uh-huh, Noah.

756
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,260
Hmm?

757
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,120
For what?

758
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,100
Anesthesia

759
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,100
and airway control.

760
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,930
Uh...

761
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,930
Dr. Rhodes, I... I have,

762
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,600
like, three hours of

763
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,600
surgical experience.

764
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,110
And now you get more.

765
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,040
Bring in the patient.

766
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,140
So, I gotta be honest,

767
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,140
I really feel like

768
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,350
I've been doing a little bit

769
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,350
too much of the talking here.

770
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,820
No way I can

771
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,820
get you to tell me

772
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,260
a little bit about

773
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,260
what happened today?

774
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,120
I thought I had a jacket.

775
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,490
Did I drop it?

776
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,000
You know what? You could've.

777
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,160
Our memory tends to

778
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,160
come back in fragments,

779
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,800
and so time and space

780
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,800
tend to be a little mixed up.

781
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,830
Um...

782
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,740
Hey, Trevor, you think

783
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,740
I can get you to take over

784
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,330
putting pressure

785
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,330
on the wound for me?

786
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,480
My wife, uh...

787
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,850
I lost my wife this morning.

788
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,850
That's awful.

789
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,820
That's really awful.

790
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,820
I'm sorry to hear that.

791
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,990
She was a good person.

792
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,260
I really don't deserve

793
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,260
your help.

794
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,920
You should just, like...

795
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,370
Just let me go.

796
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,700
You know that feeling of...

797
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,700
Of it being unfair,

798
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,200
you know, that your wife

799
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,200
was taken and you weren't?

800
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,540
Maybe even feeling

801
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,540
a little bit guilty

802
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,240
that... That you survived?

803
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,410
Well...

804
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,120
That's... It's just normal

805
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,850
for this horrible thing

806
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,850
you've been through,

807
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,850
and if it's any consolation

808
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,850
at all,

809
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,650
there's probably a lot of

810
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,650
people in this hospital

811
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,390
who are feeling...

812
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,390
The same way right now.

813
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,360
Well, then you should

814
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,360
go be with them,

815
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,730
because you can't help me.

816
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
You know what, though, I can.

817
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
No, you can't!

818
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,230
I just need you

819
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,230
to meet me halfway

820
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,130
by putting pressure

821
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,130
on your wound.

822
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,000
I just need to go over

823
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,000
and talk to this gentleman

824
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,940
for just a minute,

825
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,940
and I'll be right back.

826
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,210
I, uh...

827
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,750
I collect things...

828
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,750
Uh-huh?

829
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,920
And my wife, she said

830
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,920
that I was a hoarder,

831
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,980
and that...

832
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,550
She was gonna

833
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,550
throw it all out.

834
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,860
God, I would get

835
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,860
so mad, but I...

836
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,400
I was wearing a jacket.

837
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,900
I had it at lunch.

838
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,160
God...

839
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,670
I got this.

840
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,000
You sure?

841
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes.

842
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,340
Thank you.

843
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,720
So the officer saw the guy

844
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,720
ditch the assault rifle,

845
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,590
then he got a shot off,

846
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,590
and then he lost him

847
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,590
in the crowd.

848
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,930
And you think now he's here?

849
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,900
Yeah, maybe.

850
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,900
He was wearing a hoodie.

851
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,490
We recovered it at the scene.

852
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,360
Tested positive for

853
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,360
gunshot residue,

854
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,360
and there was blood on it.

855
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,930
So the officer

856
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,930
might've shot him?

857
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,940
Well, that's the theory.

858
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,940
We're thinking either

859
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,940
the paramedics brought him in,

860
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,570
or he's hiding among

861
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,570
the injured, so we're checking

862
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,570
all the hospitals

863
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,610
against the officer's

864
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,610
partial description.

865
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,570
White male, brown hair,

866
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,710
medium height, build,

867
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,710
dark pants.

868
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,080
Do you mind if my guys

869
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,080
just go through the ED?

870
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,450
Please.

871
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,450
All right.

872
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,750
But, uh, we're barely

873
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,750
keeping it together here.

874
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,480
What's happening out there?

875
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,390
People are scared.

876
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,670
The cell network

877
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,670
is probably down from

878
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,670
the boost in traffic, right?

879
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,990
Probably why Maggie

880
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,990
can't get through?

881
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,800
Yeah, I think you're right.

882
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,570
All right, I'm in. Bag him.

883
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,570
Then CT zone

884
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,570
for head and chest.

885
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,910
And then up to the ICU

886
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,910
for neuro. Let's go.

887
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,650
Hey, Jay, uh, my son, Owen,

888
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,620
he and the nanny may have been

889
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,620
at Millennium Park today,

890
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,950
but I can't reach them.

891
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,950
Can you...

892
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,620
Every cop in the city's

893
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,620
looking for the shooter.

894
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,320
I'm so sorry, Nat.

895
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,320
Okay.

896
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,160
Natalie, if you need to

897
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,160
go home...

898
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,900
How can I leave?

899
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,940
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

900
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,940
How do you know which parts

901
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,940
of the bowel are viable?

902
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,570
Peristalsis? Color?

903
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Right now, I don't care

904
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,840
about viability. I only care

905
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,840
about the bleeding.

906
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,850
Ooh, this is wild.

907
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,020
Being a trauma surgeon

908
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,020
is intense.

909
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,380
No time to think.

910
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,380
Just react...

911
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,380
Stop talking.

912
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,820
I haven't been inside

913
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,820
an abdomen since my residency.

914
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,760
It's okay, Dr. Latham.

915
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,760
Surgery is surgery.

916
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,190
GIA stapler

917
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,190
for the anastomosis.

918
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,520
Skip it, it takes too long.

919
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,160
But I've already resected

920
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,160
a portion of the bowel.

921
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,290
It needs to be reconstructed.

922
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,200
Just leave it

923
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,200
in discontinuity.

924
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,670
That doesn't make any sense.

925
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,830
We'll have to open him back up

926
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,830
again to make the repair.

927
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,170
No, 'cause we're not

928
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,170
gonna close him.

929
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,670
But he'll be susceptible

930
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,670
to infection.

931
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,900
Dr. Latham,

932
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,900
this is damage control.

933
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,910
Stop the bleeding,

934
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,910
stop the spillage,

935
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,240
move on to the next patient.

936
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,050
Are you good?

937
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,050
Yes.

938
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,580
Let's continue.

939
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,580
Okay.

940
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,240
This is my brother's.

941
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,240
It belongs to my son.

942
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,540
I bought it for him.

943
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,410
Lady, if you don't let go

944
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,410
and back off...

945
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,110
Hey, maybe I can help,

946
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,110
maybe I can help.

947
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,420
Look inside.

948
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,420
You'll find sheet music.

949
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,250
He plays the bass.

950
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,980
May I?

951
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,770
Told you.

952
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,010
I know my son was

953
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,010
at the park today.

954
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,140
If he was okay,

955
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,140
he would've called.

956
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,610
He always calls me.

957
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,950
His name is Jared. He's 16.

958
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,560
Oh, I've seen him. He's here.

959
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,560
Is he all right?

960
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,260
Uh, when I saw him,

961
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,300
he was conscious, talking.

962
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,420
He had a broken arm.

963
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,420
Oh, my God.

964
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,630
I'll find him.

965
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,630
Thank you. Thank you.

966
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,570
Emily?

967
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
What do you need?

968
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,510
Emily? Hey, what do you need?

969
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,810
Uh... Uh, there's...

970
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,810
There's a lot of people

971
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,980
bleeding in the waiting room.

972
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,580
The nurse needs help.

973
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,520
But I don't have anyone else.

974
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,130
Wait a second, I got an idea.

975
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,320
Come with me.

976
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,900
Come, come,

977
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,900
come, come!

978
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,490
Caprice?

979
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,490
Yes?

980
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,270
I know you're busy,

981
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,270
but I need some help.

982
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,480
Sir, ma'am,

983
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,480
can I borrow you for a second?

984
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,950
So, we have a lot of injured,

985
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,950
but not enough nurses,

986
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,380
so we need volunteers.

987
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,710
Caprice here is gonna

988
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,710
teach you

989
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,710
how to apply pressure,

990
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,020
hemostatic bandages,

991
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,020
and tourniquets.

992
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,560
Are we all still in?

993
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,160
Em?

994
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,160
Yeah, okay.

995
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,160
Great. Okay.

996
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,890
Got two. Two.

997
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,330
Go be sharks.

998
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,330
Find some blood.

999
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,800
Come with me.

1000
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,800
Okay.

1001
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,760
Sir, would you like to help?

1002
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,410
No.

1003
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,410
I will.

1004
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,870
Oh, thank you.

1005
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,740
There you go.

1006
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,690
He's right there. White man,

1007
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,690
medium build, dark pants.

1008
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,920
Fits the profile.

1009
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,920
He was acting kind of sketchy.

1010
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,460
He stared right through me.

1011
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,860
I see him.

1012
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,570
What's going on, Ms. Goodwin?

1013
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,770
They think they may have

1014
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,770
the shooter.

1015
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,440
Chicago Police, sir,

1016
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,440
I need to talk to you.

1017
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,780
I didn't do anything.

1018
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,220
Put the bag down

1019
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,220
and show me your hands.

1020
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,480
I didn't do anything.

1021
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,480
Drop the bag

1022
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,480
and show me your hands!

1023
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,320
Get up! Get up!

1024
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,760
Do not move.

1025
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,570
He's a thief.

1026
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,570
He looted the bodies.

1027
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,570
Opportunist scum.

1028
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,880
Detective, I understand

1029
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,880
you have a job to do,

1030
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,610
but this description

1031
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,610
of the shooter,

1032
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,750
white male, dark pants,

1033
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,750
it's vague.

1034
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,760
Ms. Goodwin, if I think

1035
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,760
I found the son of a bitch

1036
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,310
that did this,

1037
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,310
I'm going after him.

1038
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,330
ICU for rewarming

1039
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,330
and resuscitation.

1040
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,490
Okay, bring in the next one.

1041
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,720
Dr. Latham, I'm sorry

1042
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,720
if I overstepped earlier.

1043
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,930
I certainly wasn't

1044
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,930
trying to criticize.

1045
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,330
No need for an apology,

1046
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,330
Dr. Rhodes.

1047
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,500
I realize that my rigidness

1048
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,500
can be frustrating.

1049
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,560
While your tone was unnerving,

1050
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,560
your words were enlightening.

1051
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,800
They were?

1052
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,840
Stop the bleeding,

1053
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,840
stop the spillage,

1054
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,840
move on to the next patient.

1055
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,140
Precisely the structure

1056
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,140
I needed.

1057
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,140
Well, then

1058
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,140
I'm glad I could help.

1059
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,880
Okay, let's do this.

1060
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,080
He was hit by a car

1061
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,080
trying to escape the scene.

1062
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,250
Broken ribs, diminished breath

1063
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,250
sounds in the left chest.

1064
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,160
He needs a tube.

1065
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,960
Emily, what are you doing?

1066
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,090
Uh, looking for

1067
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,090
more bandages, gauze.

1068
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,730
I'm helping the nurses

1069
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,730
in the waiting room.

1070
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,240
While he was waiting

1071
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,240
for his X-ray?

1072
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,140
Epidural hematoma.

1073
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,870
By the time

1074
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,870
they got him to me,

1075
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,870
he was gone.

1076
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,880
There was nothing

1077
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,880
I could do.

1078
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,770
His mother is here.

1079
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,250
Thinks he's all right.

1080
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,720
Poor woman.

1081
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,290
Am I doing this right?

1082
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,930
I think so.

1083
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,860
You're good at this.

1084
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,100
Blood doesn't bother me.

1085
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,980
I can see it.

1086
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,780
There was a band.

1087
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,820
Every song was an '80s cover.

1088
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,320
This woman started

1089
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,320
dancing with me.

1090
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,410
Uh-huh.

1091
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,920
And were you guys

1092
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,920
dancing together

1093
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,020
when the gunfire broke out?

1094
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,760
Uh, Doctor, I...

1095
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,060
Yes.

1096
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,930
Did you happen

1097
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,930
to look and see

1098
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,340
what direction the gunfire

1099
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,340
was coming from?

1100
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,100
Uh, yes.

1101
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,540
Doctor, there are so many

1102
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,540
people here who are in

1103
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,540
worse shape than me.

1104
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,770
I really... I should just go.

1105
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,410
Well, you... You can't

1106
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,410
go yet, Trevor, because

1107
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,410
you still need treatment.

1108
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,710
You're bleeding

1109
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,710
from your neck.

1110
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,380
But I just... I need to be

1111
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,380
just anywhere else.

1112
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,780
I'm... I'm fine.

1113
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,950
Okay, okay. Um...

1114
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,420
I'll be right back.

1115
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,190
Look, what I'm hearing is that

1116
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,190
actually you're not fine.

1117
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,360
You're trying to convince

1118
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,360
yourself you're fine.

1119
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,730
I am.

1120
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,730
Look, I get it,

1121
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,730
but I can also see

1122
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,730
how much pain you're in,

1123
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,360
and you have

1124
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,360
every right to be.

1125
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,370
Uh, listen, I don't expect

1126
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,370
you to believe me right now,

1127
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,740
but I promise you will

1128
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,740
get better, but you...

1129
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,740
You need to hang in with me

1130
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,870
a little bit longer,

1131
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,870
okay? Okay?

1132
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,280
What you looking at, Roger?

1133
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,040
Him.

1134
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,850
That guy?

1135
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,550
You recognize him?

1136
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,360
Yes.

1137
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,920
I'm in. Bag her,

1138
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,920
then chest tube zone.

1139
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,260
She's getting

1140
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,260
our last ventilator.

1141
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,000
What? We're out?

1142
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,000
Yes.

1143
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,270
We can switch to bags

1144
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,270
full-time.

1145
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,740
Who's gonna work 'em?

1146
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,740
We don't have enough nurses.

1147
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,440
We'll get extra tubing

1148
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,440
and split it,

1149
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,840
put two patients

1150
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,840
on a single ventilator.

1151
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,140
No, the vent

1152
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,140
isn't strong enough.

1153
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,140
I'm in. Bag him.

1154
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,240
Yeah, if we match patients

1155
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,240
who are roughly the same size,

1156
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,510
double the tidal volume,

1157
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,510
should be enough to hold.

1158
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,850
Okay. Okay.

1159
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,890
Oh, my God, Owen? Owen?

1160
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,680
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1161
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,290
I just need to... I need

1162
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,290
some... I need some air.

1163
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,290
Just five minutes, okay?

1164
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,200
Of course.

1165
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,200
I'll take care of the vents.

1166
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,800
So this guy, Roger,

1167
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,800
I've been working with,

1168
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,470
his memory is still very hazy.

1169
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,530
The one thing he is

1170
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,530
absolutely certain about

1171
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,170
is that he saw this fellow

1172
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,170
over here in the kiddie chair

1173
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,650
with the blue shirt

1174
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,650
right there,

1175
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,210
and that he had, quote,

1176
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,210
"A look of rage in his eyes."

1177
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,150
We've already had

1178
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,150
one false ID, Daniel,

1179
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,480
and witness statements...

1180
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,550
Notoriously unreliable,

1181
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,550
I know.

1182
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,520
I'm just saying,

1183
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,520
this guy, Roger, very well

1184
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,520
could've seen everything.

1185
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,360
I mean, that's why

1186
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,360
I'm spending

1187
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,360
so much time with him.

1188
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,460
You think it's possible

1189
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,460
that he can ID the shooter?

1190
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,560
Yeah, it's possible.

1191
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,560
I mean, he knows he saw David.

1192
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,390
And I gotta tell ya, I've been

1193
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,390
watching them for a bit,

1194
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,370
and he is a little

1195
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,370
overly enthusiastic,

1196
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,840
in terms of helping

1197
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,840
all the other victims.

1198
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,380
You know, create a disaster,

1199
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,210
so that he can then rise up

1200
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,210
and become the hero,

1201
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,510
you know, I don't know.

1202
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,680
We got a name.

1203
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,680
Trent Harris, 43.

1204
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,240
Well, Dr. Charles

1205
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,240
was wondering

1206
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,880
if it could be this guy

1207
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,880
behind you in the blue shirt.

1208
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,820
But he's been telling us

1209
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,820
his name is David.

1210
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,520
Well, he would definitely

1211
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,520
give a fake name.

1212
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,720
Yes, but he looks like

1213
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,720
he's in his 20s,

1214
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,720
not his 40s.

1215
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,490
Yeah, how'd you make your ID?

1216
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,630
Registered AR-15

1217
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,630
we recovered at the scene.

1218
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,900
You sit tight, tuck in,

1219
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,900
just watch him.

1220
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,070
PD is pulling DMV photos.

1221
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,540
If we do get a positive ID,

1222
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,600
be ready to clear as many

1223
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,600
people out of here as you can.

1224
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,770
I'll find Maggie

1225
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,770
and spread the word.

1226
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,900
Okay.

1227
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,340
Thank you, Jay.

1228
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,340
Yeah.

1229
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,540
So SWAT raided

1230
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,540
Harris' house,

1231
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,210
crap floor to ceiling,

1232
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,210
major hoarder.

1233
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,250
They found another body.

1234
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,250
Guy shot his wife.

1235
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,230
Where is he?

1236
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,030
Where'd this guy go?

1237
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,030
I don't know.

1238
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,220
Little help? I need help!

1239
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,500
Trevor, hey. Trevor!

1240
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,940
Ethan, April, I need you.

1241
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,940
Thready pulse,

1242
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,940
hole in the neck.

1243
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,410
Slashed his wrist.

1244
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,410
Multiple stab wounds

1245
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,410
to the abdomen.

1246
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,790
Guy's lost a lot of blood.

1247
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,290
Let's give him

1248
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,290
two units of O-neg

1249
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,300
and start bagging.

1250
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,300
I need to intubate.

1251
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,230
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

1252
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,170
Detective Halstead said

1253
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,170
he'll have a photo

1254
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,470
of our suspect, Trent Harris,

1255
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,060
an... Any second now.

1256
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,110
He's not the guy.

1257
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,980
Sats, 82. Heart rate, 130.

1258
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,880
Interior abdomen

1259
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,880
stab wounds.

1260
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,110
Belly's distended. FAST scan.

1261
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,740
Wrists are

1262
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,740
slashed to the bone.

1263
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,080
I'm in.

1264
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,460
FAST scan's positive.

1265
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,790
Where are we?

1266
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,790
Belly's full of blood.

1267
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,330
He needs surgery now.

1268
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,230
We'll take him to

1269
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,230
the doctor's lounge.

1270
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,230
Let's go.

1271
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,590
Connor, that's our guy.

1272
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,740
Don't let him off the hook

1273
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,740
by dying.

1274
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,670
When did you realize

1275
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,670
he was the shooter?

1276
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,680
When I heard

1277
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,680
about his wife

1278
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,180
and the hoarding.

1279
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,800
You knew?

1280
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,510
We're struggling to keep

1281
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,510
innocent victims alive,

1282
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,210
and you pull us away

1283
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,210
to save this monster?

1284
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,750
Damn it, Dr. Charles,

1285
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,750
my son is missing!

1286
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,030
I'm so sorry.

1287
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,740
Jared's gone?

1288
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,970
That's it?

1289
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,340
I'm so sorry.

1290
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,910
No.

1291
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,470
He'll live.

1292
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,010
Tired?

1293
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,620
I am exhausted.

1294
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,890
Yeah, me too.

1295
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,390
They still need help upstairs

1296
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,390
in the ORs.

1297
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,360
Let's go.

1298
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,500
Natalie?

1299
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,340
It looks like Liz's phone,

1300
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,340
Owen's nanny.

1301
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,730
Owen?

1302
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,500
Mommy!

1303
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,770
There she is.

1304
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,050
How?

1305
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,610
Once they found the shooter,

1306
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,610
I had Jay make some calls.

1307
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,150
Owen and Liz,

1308
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,150
they were at the park.

1309
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,020
They ran as soon as

1310
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,020
they heard the gunfire

1311
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,420
and left everything behind

1312
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,420
and got to the 51st District.

1313
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,410
Great work today, Dr. Choi.

1314
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,130
Thanks.

1315
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,070
So much blood.

1316
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,720
I can still smell

1317
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,720
the iron in the air.

1318
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,290
You okay?

1319
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,990
Still shaking.

1320
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,030
Crazy thing is,

1321
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,030
it's the most gratifying day

1322
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,440
I've ever had as a doctor...

1323
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,070
But I don't know what to feel.

1324
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,060
Emily stepped up.

1325
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,290
Yeah.

1326
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,800
Yeah, she did.

1327
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,110
Since the first victim

1328
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,110
rolled in, it's only been

1329
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,110
two hours.

1330
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,670
Feels like two weeks.

1331
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,950
This is the world

1332
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,950
we live in, huh?

1333
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,950
Yeah... Unfortunately.

1334
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,220
Hey, phenomenal job,

1335
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,220
Sharon, okay?

1336
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,060
Approval for a new CT scanner,

1337
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,060
done deal.

1338
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,430
You know something, Peter,

1339
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,830
just a CT scanner

1340
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,830
is not gonna cut it.

1341
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,260
The numbers we saw today,

1342
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,260
we need multiple scanners,

1343
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,740
triple the number

1344
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,740
of trauma bays.

1345
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,470
Waiting room

1346
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,470
and hallway walls wired

1347
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,600
for monitors and oxygen,

1348
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,270
and that's just the beginning.

1349
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,510
So basically, you're talking

1350
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,510
about a... A whole new ED?

1351
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,250
Yeah, I guess I am.

1352
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,050
Okay.

1353
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,690
Daniel?

1354
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,030
Of course you had to save him.

1355
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,570
I know that,

1356
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,570
and she does too.
