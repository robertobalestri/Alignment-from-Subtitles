1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,837
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,998
Look, Luka...

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,040
I'm glad we're friends,
but I've got a dad.

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,205
- Fingernails, tattoo, the hair?
- It's the whole package.

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,942
I'll talk to my band mates,
see if I can't pull it back a little.

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,610
- You off?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,789
If you wait for a second,
I'll walk out with you.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,059
- Okay.
- Ah! Damn it!

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,286
Son of a bitch!

10
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,897
- He should be in a nursing home.
- I'd never do that to him.

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,090
You wanna stay here for
tonight? Plenty of room.

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,566
Actually, you can stay
as long as you like.

13
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,608
Hey. SAM: Hey.
How was your night?

14
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,775
- The usual.
- Anything good?

15
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,980
Guy got his arm caught in
a sausage-making machine.

16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,954
Nice.

17
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,655
I'm not on till 9.

18
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,557
I can drop Alex off at school,
but can you pick him up at 3?

19
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,130
Sure, after I get some sleep.

20
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,491
Morning.

21
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,899
Mom, I need 10 bucks for the
class field trip to Millennium Park.

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,134
Okay.

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,542
They've got a giant silver
sculpture shaped like a bean.

24
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,713
If I don't get the money in...

25
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,875
I have to stay behind to do
homework with the fifth graders.

26
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,680
Okay, okay.

27
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,687
What? You've never
seen a kid pee before?

28
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,428
This is gonna bounce.

29
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,762
- Whoa, that's a lot of zeroes.
- Tuition was expensive.

30
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,930
No wonder you're
sleeping on Abby's sofa.

31
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,100
You know you can defer paying
your loans until after residency?

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,176
Not this one. This
is for my father.

33
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,783
- What? Your dad's leaning on you?
- It's for my brother's university tuition.

34
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,350
My parents put me through
school, now it's my turn...

35
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,749
They can't wait until
you're making real money?

36
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,583
Is there something
you need, Ray?

37
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,250
How would you like to
work Christmas for me?

38
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,093
I'm already working New Year's.

39
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,892
Look, you do Christmas and
I'll take your New Year's Eve.

40
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,261
You'd work New Year's Eve?

41
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,098
It's important to have us all together
on Christmas. I'll take Ramadan for you.

42
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,603
I'm not Muslim, I'm Sikh.

43
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,436
Great. I'll cover whenever
you wanna take a Sikh day.

44
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,807
- This is unbelievable.
- What? Weaver's got a boyfriend?

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,813
Only 39 percent of the staff
has had a flu shot this year.

46
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,451
I don't want massive
absenteeism in January.

47
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,314
- I had mine. NEELA:
I'll get one today.

48
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,887
- How about you, Ray?
- Tomorrow.

49
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,889
My band's to play at Delilah's
tonight. Can't have a sore arm.

50
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,287
Sore arm?

51
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,054
How about 100 percent
compliance by next week?

52
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,460
You've had lame excuses
for the past two months.

53
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,226
- What are you talking about?
- First, you had a cold.

54
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,270
- Oh, yeah, then you were sleep-deprived.
- Police officer shot. ETA, two minutes.

55
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,464
- Where's the wound?
- I couldn't understand.

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,667
- All right, clear Trauma 1.
- Neela, Ray, Chuny, you're with me.

57
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,109
Mary, get some extra security
down here to handle the press.

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,182
- Do me a favor, give me a flu shot.
- What?

59
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,147
Yeah. Get me when
I'm not expecting it.

60
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,311
Just stick me quick, I
got a thing about needles.

61
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,653
Paramedics
probably have two IVs.

62
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,158
You can go
femoral if we need it.

63
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,296
Eddie Escobar,
caught one in the neck.

64
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,329
- Lost lots of blood.
- This the throw-and-go?

65
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,839
- We were 10 blocks away.
- You're at County General.

66
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,308
- Should've called paramedics.
- We'd still be waiting.

67
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,844
- C-collar.
- Board's ready.

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,014
One, two, three.

69
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,177
We're gonna give
oxygen through your nose.

70
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,793
- Thank you. NEELA:
Pulse is thready.

71
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,721
- Take my keys, Gary.
- It's okay, Eddie.

72
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,291
- Try not to move.
- Someone needs to feed my dogs.

73
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,123
- Have intubation tray ready.
- There's a filing cabinet...

74
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,026
in the bedroom
with all my papers.

75
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,463
Forget about that. It's
gonna be okay. Tell him.

76
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,798
Trauma panel, type and cross, six units,
call X-ray, get a portable neck-and-chest.

77
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,462
I threw up all over Amy's
collage. It was so embarrassing.

78
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,964
Oh, that's okay. We see, like,
a hundred puking kids a day.

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,624
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

80
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,270
- Mom's here. This is
Dr. Lockhart. ABBY: Hi.

81
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:08,033
- School nurse called my office.
- They sent her in for vomiting and fever.

82
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,370
- She okay?
- Well, it seems like it's just a flu.

83
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,445
Are you okay, honey?

84
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,212
- I should take her to our doctor.
- She's here now...

85
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,544
- I see how busy you are.
- It's not that. It's...

86
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,117
Do you want to go see Dr. Ben?

87
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,946
Uh... I...

88
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,751
It's probably just
the stomach flu.

89
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,793
Let us run tests. We'll give
her fluid. She'll be good as new.

90
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,123
- How long is that gonna take?
- About an hour.

91
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,926
- Can we move her to a real room?
- I'll work on it.

92
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,898
Sam, this girl needs
a line and Tigan.

93
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,731
You have to ask Malik.

94
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,600
Excuse me! Excuse me.

95
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,799
Sub-Q air. Otherwise okay.
- Excuse me.

96
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,999
Two units O-neg.

97
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,805
Looks like the bullet missed
your spinal cord and trachea.

98
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,413
That's good. SAM: Excuse me.

99
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,421
- That's good news.
- Sats aren't so hot.

100
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,678
- He needs plastic.
- Yeah. I'm all over it.

101
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,947
We're gonna stick a tube down
your throat to give you more oxygen.

102
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,488
Whatever you say, doc.

103
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,256
- You'll go to sleep first.
- Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux?

104
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,920
- Everyone else okay?
- We're all good, Eddie.

105
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,433
- You get the perp?
- Couple of double taps to the chest.

106
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,433
- He went down.
- Go for it, Ray.

107
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,004
What happened? McWAYNE:
Convenience store holdup.

108
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,104
Chased the guy into an apartment
building, called for backup.

109
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,136
Scumbag starts
shooting out the window.

110
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,844
All right. There's too much blood.
- Pulse ox only 72.

111
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,347
Okay. Pull out and bag him
up. You want me to do it?

112
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,008
No, no, no. I got it.
Give me a straight blade.

113
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,648
- You cut yourself?
- No, that's... It's nothing.

114
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,315
- We should take care of it.
- No, really, it's okay.

115
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,222
One more shot, Ray.

116
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,529
- Ray?
- Just give me some cricoid pressure.

117
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,667
I could get this.

118
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,664
- I still can't see the cords.
- Okay, that's it.

119
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,704
- You want me to try?
- How about you try?

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,531
- Crike tray.
- Yeah?

121
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,732
Yeah. Betadine, 11 blade.

122
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,344
No. Third drawer of the
crash cart. Get the trach light.

123
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,880
- The what?
- Are you going fiberoptic?

124
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,415
Not exactly. SAM: Got it.

125
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,053
- Where's the scope?
- It's a blind procedure.

126
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,416
Who's in charge of this ER?
- That would be me.

127
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,218
You can stay here, sir,
but you have to be quiet.

128
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,883
Okay.

129
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,691
Bend the tip to 90 degrees.

130
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,389
Turn the lights off.

131
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,673
Passing the midline,
lift the jaw forward.

132
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,336
Sats are dropping.
Shouldn't we prep the neck?

133
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,751
Through the cords, you'll
see a pre-tracheal glow.

134
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,609
- He needs a crike.
- That's the glow.

135
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,751
Won't see it if you're
in the esophagus.

136
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,183
Okay, that's it. Bag
him. Turn the lights on.

137
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,849
- Very slick.
- How about a subclavian?

138
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,391
Okay, good breath sounds.

139
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,259
Number six gloves, Dr. Barnett?

140
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,029
Seven-and-a-half.

141
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,728
Sterile drape and a
finer needle, please.

142
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,873
I have Mallory. McWAYNE:
This is Eddie's fiancée.

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,942
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, Eddie.

144
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,306
I'm Dr. Lewis. He's doing okay.

145
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,947
- He was shot?
- Once, in the neck.

146
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:06,280
He's sedated with medication, but
you can sit with him, hold his hand.

147
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,546
I was playing around with my
nephew. We were wrestling.

148
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,249
Looks like he kicked
your butt. Is the rib sore?

149
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,758
- Right there, yeah.
- Okay, Mr. Sakabu.

150
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,760
I think it's nothing
but a bruise.

151
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,092
What about my shoulder?

152
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,269
- Any pain when I press?
- It's more on the inside.

153
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,768
It's probably just a strain.

154
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,737
I'll have the nurse bring
your discharge instructions.

155
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,067
Hey, hey. I didn't
know you were in today.

156
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,110
The stupid alarm didn't go off.

157
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,615
- Rough night, huh?
- Yeah.

158
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,307
You okay?

159
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,117
Okay. I got a quick one
for you, ready for discharge.

160
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,950
Give me a couple
of minutes, okay?

161
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,425
Good news. Labs are fine,
white count's not elevated.

162
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,999
- So we can go?
- Mom. Mom.

163
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,294
Are you all right, honey?

164
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,371
- What's wrong?
- It hurts now.

165
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,440
- Where does it hurt?
- Right here.

166
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,510
Here? JOYCE: Ow!

167
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,942
Does it hurt more when
I take my hand away?

168
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,513
Ow!

169
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,683
I'm gonna get you some
medicine for that pain, okay?

170
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,649
I need to run some more tests.

171
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,551
Start with four of MS. Thanks.

172
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,282
I thought she'd
be better by now.

173
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,553
What starts out looking like flu
ends up to be something else.

174
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,287
- Like what?
- Appendicitis.

175
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,692
You said it wasn't serious.

176
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,890
It may not be. I'd like
a surgeon to take...

177
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,300
She needs an operation?

178
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,063
It's a possibility.

179
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,727
Oh, God.

180
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,500
No. No, she's not
having surgery. Not here.

181
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,701
- It's a very simple operation.
- I need to talk to my husband.

182
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,039
There's time. I need to
do another blood test...

183
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,206
You can't do surgery
without my permission, right?

184
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,545
Right. One step at a time, okay?

185
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,846
You call your husband.
I'll get things started.

186
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,885
- Hey, Ray. Is Carter in there?
- Just Lewis.

187
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,258
- How's the cop?
- Stable. What's in your hand?

188
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,059
- A chart.
- Okay. The other hand?

189
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,065
A pen. I didn't say I'd do it.

190
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,535
- Hey, anybody seen Dr. Chen?
- Sorry.

191
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,368
Do you have any plans
for New Year's Eve?

192
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,909
- You're not really my type.
- Funny. My band's got a party gig.

193
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,343
- Can you take the p.m. for me?
- On New Year's Eve?

194
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:18,884
Well, look at it this way, you won't
have to go to a square dance by yourself.

195
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,918
Or with a date, or whatever.

196
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,420
You give my med-student
lecture for me in January.

197
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,270
- Deal. CRAWFORD:
Suspect's been wounded...

198
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,724
and apprehended. Do we have ETA?

199
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,090
No, I'm sorry. They
haven't called that in yet.

200
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,289
- We'll be with the family.
- Okay.

201
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,594
Ten-year-old girl. Fever, vomiting,
right lower quadrant tenderness.

202
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,600
- Rule out appy. ABBY:
Yeah. CT or ultrasound?

203
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,534
It depends.

204
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,603
What the hell was that?

205
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,233
What?

206
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,541
Jing-Mei?

207
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,713
Oh, sorry.

208
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,284
Coffee was brewing.

209
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,423
You okay to work?

210
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,320
Yeah, sure. What do you got?

211
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,427
Thirty-five-year-old,
strain and sprain...

212
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,722
- chest and shoulder contusion.
- Okay.

213
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,462
- You don't wanna see the patient?
- No. I trust you.

214
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,731
How's your dad doing?

215
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,340
Okay.

216
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,638
I mean, I've got a nurse
for him 16 hours a day.

217
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,008
And then from 11
to 7, it's just me.

218
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,774
- So you're not getting much sleep.
- Hey, Dr. Chen.

219
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,409
Carter's got a baby in status. Needs
you for that suspect in that shooting.

220
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,488
- How soon?
- Right now.

221
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,925
Gunshots to the
chest and abdomen.

222
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,500
- Vitals?
- No pulse in the field.

223
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,262
- Son of a bitch.
- How long down?

224
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,996
Cops had to secure the building.

225
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,437
- How long did that take?
- Made us wait 45 minutes.

226
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,133
It takes 20 minutes
to bleed out.

227
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,643
If there'd been a shooter,
she'd be full of holes.

228
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,852
Two of O-neg on the infuser.
- On my count...

229
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,506
- Hold on. He's cuffed.
- Who's got the key?

230
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,983
- Not me. You got the keys?
- I'll check with Hogan.

231
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,019
- Quickly.
- Start on the paramedic gurney.

232
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,022
Betadine, 32 French.
Thoracotomy's all yours, Neela.

233
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,853
- You gonna assist?
- You'll be fine.

234
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,359
Sterile gloves and 10 blade.
- First unit's up.

235
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,555
I need to lift up his
arms. Where's the key?

236
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,733
- We're working on it.
- Get the bolt cutters.

237
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,198
Take it easy. TOMMY: I got it.

238
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,338
- Can the officers wait outside?
- Suspect's in custody, uncuffed.

239
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,338
- We're waiting here.
- Don't think he's gonna jump off the bed.

240
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,635
Hook up the Thora-Seal.
Give her room to work.

241
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,039
Think he's got a chance?

242
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,339
Why do you think they're
letting me crack his chest?

243
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,245
- That thing's got to wait outside.
- That thing is a service animal.

244
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,855
A service animal with fleas.

245
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,515
Actually, fleas have a
natural aversion to minis.

246
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,526
- Abby, Dilantin level's back...
- Carter, this is Mrs. Gellin...

247
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,255
- and her guide horse, Ruby.
- Who should be outside.

248
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,899
We let Seeing Eye dogs in here.

249
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,967
Our floors are gonna
be covered with crap.

250
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,036
- She's housebroken.
- What if she spooks?

251
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,402
Oh, we've been on the
L, airplanes, elevators...

252
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,907
- She can stay.
- Thank you.

253
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,279
See you later, Ruby.

254
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,885
Dr. Carter, Officer
Escobar's son's here.

255
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,283
Okay. We're... We're
still working on his dad.

256
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,218
The kid's anxious to see him.

257
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,588
- Let me... Let me go check for you.
- Thanks.

258
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,708
- Too close to the skull.
- Can you stop the bleeding?

259
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,972
Direct pressure. SAM: Got it.

260
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,592
Call Angio. Maybe we can
balloon the proximal carotid.

261
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,500
They just picked
up his son at school.

262
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,732
- Arlo's here?
- How old is your son?

263
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,605
Fifteen. I'm not his mother.
Arlo's from Eddie's first marriage.

264
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,671
- Fine. Throw down a fresh drape.
- I'll be next door.

265
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:40,149
- CVC's in. Need a repeat chest.
- Hey, Arlo. It's not as bad as it looks.

266
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,749
- It's okay. You can come on up here.
- What is she doing here? I want her out.

267
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,085
Excuse me, ma'am...

268
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,939
- Who let her in?
- This the ex-wife?

269
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,619
- You shouldn't be here.
- Mom. Mom.

270
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,594
- Get out!
- Can you just shut up?

271
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,426
Okay, everybody shut up.

272
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,467
Officer, you and Mallory
need to step outside.

273
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,138
- I don't wanna leave him.
- Everyone gets to see him...

274
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,297
- just one at a time.
- Come on.

275
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,942
We're gonna start x-rays on your
father. You can say hello quickly.

276
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:11,176
- Dad, it's Arlo. I'm here.
- He can't talk with the tube in his mouth.

277
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,176
You're gonna be all right.

278
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,179
Take them to the family room.

279
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,517
Me?

280
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,990
- You're tough, Dad.
- All right, honey, that's enough.

281
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,191
Dr. Barnett will
answer any questions.

282
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,662
Okay. Right this way, guys.

283
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,327
- Sam, check a second HemoCue.
- I think it's next door.

284
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,802
Thanks.

285
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,742
- You got a rhythm?
- Unit five and six are up.

286
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,468
Hold compressions.

287
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,244
- Asystole.
- How's his volume?

288
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,540
- Heart's filling well.
- Too many holes.

289
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,978
We could try high-dose epi.

290
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,585
Penetrating trauma
with no pulse in the field.

291
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,846
Okay.

292
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,991
11:07.

293
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,994
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

294
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,723
You just saved the taxpayers a million
bucks in trial fees and prison costs.

295
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,664
- What happened to your wrist?
- Oh, I don't know.

296
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,737
Neela, you wanna help
Officer McWayne out here?

297
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,740
- I was gonna find family for this patient.
- Get him started in the suture room.

298
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,273
Sorry about the
misunderstanding.

299
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,542
Some people are freaked
out by little animals.

300
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,050
I'm gonna clean your cut out.

301
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,087
I have a cousin who gets
nervous around Chihuahuas.

302
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,216
- Is she wearing sneakers?
- It keeps her from slipping on the floor.

303
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,919
My husband wants
her transferred to Mercy.

304
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,066
- Surgery's on their way to check her out.
- We wanna move her.

305
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,398
You're gonna have to find a
surgeon at Mercy to accept her...

306
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,561
before I can okay a transfer.

307
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,597
Whoa, whoa. Hey, back off, Ruby.

308
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,712
- Doctor, can you come to the phone?
- Yes. One minute. I'll be right back.

309
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,906
Re-prep the wound
and tie up the horse.

310
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,415
It's my husband. He's
driving back from Detroit.

311
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,747
- Hi. This is Dr. Lockhart.
<i>- Are you the doctor?</i>

312
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,651
- Yes, I am.
<i>- You better be damn sure...</i>

313
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,917
<i>- you know what you're doing.</i>
- Mr. Trager...

314
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:03,426
<i>- If you do anything...</i>
- Mr. Trager, I understand.

315
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,326
We will.

316
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,729
Yes, your wife is working on that
right now. We would never do that, sir.

317
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,598
Got paged about
a patient transfer?

318
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,773
Wendall Meade, Social Services.

319
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,135
Thank God you're here.

320
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,176
Why don't you get here soon, and
we won't make any decisions with...

321
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,444
Nice talking to you too.

322
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,177
Little pin prick
and some burning.

323
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,845
- Ooh.
- Sorry.

324
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,652
Must be a pain having to waste all
that time trying to save a scumbag's life.

325
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,923
- He jacked a mini-mart, doc.
- Looks like a 14-year-old.

326
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,798
Feels like a foreign body.

327
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,609
Something hard. Is it
possible you were shot?

328
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,110
I don't think so. I remember I
scraped my wrist when I fell.

329
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,849
- How about there?
- Mm-mm. That's a loop of bowel.

330
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,012
I left messages for
three surgeons at Mercy.

331
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,988
- They'll call back. JOYCE:
How long can we wait?

332
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,320
Eight to 10 hours.

333
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,896
- I can't find the appendix.
- What does that mean?

334
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,624
Usually if it's enlarged,
it's easy to find.

335
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,360
- She may not have appendicitis?
- It's not a perfect test.

336
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,564
She could still have the disease
even if the ultrasound is normal.

337
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,868
Can't you people give
me a straight answer?

338
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,002
I would say, based on her fever
and tenderness, that it is appendicitis.

339
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,512
She said it was stomach
flu, then changed her mind.

340
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,583
Now you can't find her appendix?

341
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,516
Transfer center from Mercy
wants to talk to the Attending.

342
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,354
- Finally.
- Hang a gram of cefotetan.

343
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,494
Do you think I
need an operation?

344
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,169
- Do I need it soon?
- Yep.

345
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,033
Can I have it here?

346
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,400
Well, you could...

347
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,033
but your parents want you to
have it at a different hospital.

348
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,544
- Won't that take a while?
- Not too long. It'll be okay.

349
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,549
Why can't I decide?

350
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,885
Because when you're a kid, your
parents get to decide what's best.

351
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:15,060
The only way to stop the bleeding is
by blowing up a balloon in his artery.

352
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,389
This x-ray is gonna
guide us to the right spot.

353
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,725
- How does he get blood to
his brain? NEELA: Dr. Lewis.

354
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,765
Hold on. RAY: That's
a good question.

355
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,269
Two carotid arteries
supply the brain.

356
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,738
Right and left, okay?

357
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,605
If one gets blocked, Mother
Nature has a backup plan.

358
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,077
It is called the
Circle of Willis.

359
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,738
It's a detour.

360
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,751
But it allows the blood from the
right to get over to the left-hand side.

361
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,250
- I understand.
- So he can recover.

362
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,120
Well, priority number
one is to stop the bleeding.

363
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,287
- If you're not wearing lead, leave.
- I'll come get you when we're done.

364
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,096
- Thanks, Dr. Barnett.
- Ray's fine.

365
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,433
Okay, Ray.

366
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,265
- Sam, Dr. Kovac called.
- Did you take a message?

367
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,636
Sounds like your kid got
suspended from school again.

368
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,905
- I may need to leave.
- In a minute.

369
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,670
- Dr. Lewis.
- Have them step outside.

370
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,680
I removed a foreign body
from Officer McWayne's arm.

371
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,613
- What's that?
- Feels like a plastic BB.

372
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,309
Could be what shot your patient.

373
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,081
- That couldn't sever a carotid artery.
- You sure?

374
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,520
Officer Escobar was
shot with this metal slug...

375
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,853
- from a sub-Q, right upper a trapezius.
- Looks like a 9 mm.

376
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,497
- Is that what the suspect used?
- I don't think so.

377
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,965
Nine-millimeter semi-automatic,
standard issue. That's what we carry.

378
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,604
I can pick him up. It's not
a problem. Stay at work.

379
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,971
<i>- Well, what is it about?</i>
- No. The school didn't tell me anything.

380
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,771
They didn't tell you?
What did he do?

381
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,936
<i>They just said to
come in for a meeting.</i>

382
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,810
- Well, is he okay?
<i>- Yeah, yeah. He's fine.</i>

383
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,975
All right. Call me as
soon as you get back.

384
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,484
<i>- I will.</i>
- Okay, thanks.

385
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,281
Tetanus shot for
Officer McWayne.

386
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,822
Being interviewed
about friendly-fire.

387
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,015
Is it for sure now?

388
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,956
They found a pellet
gun at the scene.

389
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,995
So he didn't shoot the cop then.
- Guess not.

390
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,330
Arlo, you should be
in the family room.

391
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,070
Is that the guy who shot my dad?

392
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,004
He was the suspect
they were pursuing.

393
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,873
- Can I go in there?
- Probably not a good idea.

394
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,311
- I wanna see him.
- Arlo.

395
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,352
- He's a kid.
- You don't have to do this...

396
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,046
- Was he on drugs?
- I can't say.

397
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,988
- Did he have a police record?
- I don't know.

398
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,153
Why would he do that?
Why would he shoot my dad?

399
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,024
Arlo, we're not exactly
sure who shot your dad.

400
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,831
He may have been accidentally
shot by a police officer.

401
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:43,237
- What? But I thought...
- This guy was only carrying a BB gun.

402
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,107
They won't know for sure until
the ballistics tests are completed.

403
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,542
Oh, man.

404
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,017
One of his own guys.

405
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,021
Arlo, can we talk to you?

406
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,885
- Which one of you did it?
- We don't know anything yet.

407
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,552
Why don't we go and sit down?

408
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,391
- We're sorry. ARLO:
It's not your fault.

409
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,055
Comes with the job.

410
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,069
There, balloon is up and
the vessel is occluded.

411
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,107
- Can we have his family in?
- Not yet.

412
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,939
- Entrance wound is dry as a bone.
- Nice.

413
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,375
He's not waking up.

414
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:25,746
He's still comatose
with a flaccid paralysis...

415
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,113
and an up-going toe.

416
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,914
So much for collateral flow.

417
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,650
- But you can repair the carotid?
- Oh, it'd likely do more harm than good.

418
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,487
It's not a procedure
that I'm comfortable with.

419
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,887
- But if the wife consents...
- His fiancée.

420
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,089
- Not her call then.
- We have an ex-wife.

421
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,395
- Is there a blood relative?
- Yeah, a son, but he's 15.

422
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,437
- Could he be a mature minor?
- A what?

423
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,598
It's when a kid's mature enough
to make medical decisions.

424
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,472
- Could be.
- Okay, I'll talk to him.

425
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,978
Get Wendall in on this.
And find me if you need me.

426
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,275
- Okay.
- Dr. Dubenko, I need you right now.

427
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,942
Keep his crit
above 30. PO-2, 90.

428
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,317
Ten-year-old,
appy, systolic's 60.

429
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,489
- Is she septic?
- Antibiotics are on board.

430
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,925
- We're running in a liter.
- Who saw her from Surgery?

431
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,653
- The family wants her transferred.
- That isn't happening.

432
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,298
Dr. Hong at Mercy accepted her.

433
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,298
- Pressure's up to 70 with 500.
- They're sending an ambulance.

434
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,862
I'm sorry, ma'am. Your
daughter is very sick.

435
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,131
She needs surgery now.
Do we have consent?

436
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:23,606
- No. She said we could wait.
- In most cases, we could.

437
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,610
This is unusual. The infection
spread to her blood quickly.

438
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,805
Mrs. Trager, we need
consent for surgery.

439
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,861
- My husband will be here.
- We don't have time.

440
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,147
- I need to wait.
- It's life-threatening.

441
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,686
- Okay. We'll double-doctor it.
- What? What?

442
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,293
Two physicians' signatures
can override your consent.

443
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,861
Sign it. Sign it. Let's go.

444
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,295
- This is not what we agreed on.
- I'm sorry.

445
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,833
- You done this before?
- No one gets in trouble...

446
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:54,167
- acting for the patient.
- Tell that to Dr. Corday.

447
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,336
- Treating your dad...
- Sorry, I was tied up.

448
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,035
Everyone, this is Wendall Meade.

449
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,148
- Hi, Arlo.
- Can he stay?

450
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,216
If it's okay with Arlo.

451
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,251
Yeah?

452
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,752
Okay, so the two
treatment options:

453
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,357
We can use a catheter to
plug up the artery with coils.

454
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,255
Like with a balloon?

455
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:19,159
Yeah. That would give him a 15
percent chance of getting better...

456
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,496
85 percent chance of
still staying in a coma.

457
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:28,004
Or we could do surgery to
reconnect the artery. If we do that...

458
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,699
that would give him a 30
percent chance of improving.

459
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,675
- That's a little better.
- Yeah, well, it's risky.

460
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:38,113
Usually with surgery, half the
time the patient deteriorates or dies.

461
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,877
The surgery sounds too risky.

462
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,882
Do you understand
the choices, Arlo?

463
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,416
They both kind of suck.

464
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,593
- Can you explain them back to me?
- What?

465
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,194
- I need to make sure he understands.
- I'll make sure he does.

466
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,925
Arlo?

467
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,634
Well, if we play it safe...

468
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,240
there's a small
chance he gets better.

469
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,609
If we do the surgery...

470
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:10,239
there's a bigger chance he'll improve,
but an even bigger risk he'll get sicker.

471
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,941
That's right.

472
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,987
It's your call.

473
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,884
What are you talking about?

474
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,582
We've decided Arlo's mature.
He can make the decision.

475
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,091
By himself? He can't handle this.
- Yes, I can.

476
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,127
- No, you can't. You're 15.
- He's my dad.

477
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,131
In cases like this, the decision has to
be made by a blood relative. It's the law.

478
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,428
How can this be right?

479
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,773
Between you and me,
it's not the end of the world.

480
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,106
The board has a
zero-tolerance approach...

481
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,749
to what they
consider pornographic.

482
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,550
What?

483
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,648
He brought this to school.

484
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,286
He was showing it to the other
kids. That may not be appropriate.

485
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,630
They have lots of cool
electronic gadgets in here.

486
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,126
I don't think they were
looking at the gadgets.

487
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,293
- Is that your name on the mailing label?
- Yeah.

488
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,803
And you're Alex's stepfather?

489
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,471
Not exactly.

490
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,537
I see.

491
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,304
But you take an active
role in the child-rearing?

492
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,540
Yeah, I pick him up from
school. You know, we do sports.

493
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,644
- I took him fishing.
- That's great.

494
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,308
You know, Alex and his mom...

495
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,320
we've been all living together,
and it's really going well.

496
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,651
And how long has that
been the arrangement?

497
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,390
About a week.

498
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,664
Ray, do you have a minute?

499
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,896
Hey. Hot chocolate?
It's my treat.

500
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,405
I'm really sorry about my mom.

501
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,678
She's just looking out for you, okay?
- By freaking out?

502
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,610
My dad's lucky she won't
even talk to him anymore.

503
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,116
Are you okay with
what we talked about?

504
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,913
About your dad?

505
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,218
Last year for the
ninth-grade prom...

506
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,386
- there was this girl Sarah.
- Yeah.

507
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,122
I was too afraid to ask her.

508
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,563
But my dad told me that you got
to take chances or you miss out.

509
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,360
She was going with this
guy from the baseball team.

510
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,898
And two weeks later, she asked
me to go to a concert on the pier.

511
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,075
Sounds like your
dad's a pretty cool guy.

512
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,706
He'd want the surgery.

513
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,049
- Then that's what we'll do.
- But my mom's gonna freak out.

514
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,846
It's your decision.

515
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,552
And I'll back you up.

516
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,721
You will?

517
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:33,953
Sure thing.

518
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,391
Abdominal pain and
near-syncope from hypotension.

519
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,724
He was here this
morning. Dr. Pratt's patient.

520
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,230
Marina, find Pratt, and
grab the ultrasound.

521
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,595
I thought it was a bruise.

522
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,070
- When did you get dizzy?
- A few hours ago.

523
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,900
- Why didn't you come back?
- Doctor said it wasn't serious.

524
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,636
Pressure's only 80 palp.

525
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,937
Trendelenburg, liter of saline,
CBC, type and cross for force.

526
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,013
- Sir, where does it hurt?
- Sonosite.

527
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,082
- What's up?
- You sent home an unstable patient.

528
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,450
Damn, he lacerated
a spleen. Call Surgery.

529
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,146
Dr. Pratt...

530
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,282
- I signed off on this.
- He was rolling with his nephew.

531
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,928
- You didn't mention belly pain.
- He didn't have any.

532
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,427
Did you even check a crit?

533
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,799
- It would have been normal.
- His shoulder was hurting?

534
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,662
- There was no point...
- Blood irritates the diaphragm...

535
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,204
and gives you pain. You missed
it. You forgot about Kerr's sign.

536
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,535
No, we missed it because you
were too tired to see the patient.

537
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:32,179
- So, what did the principal say?
<i>- You're busy, we'll talk at home.</i>

538
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,614
Why can't you tell me now?

539
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,947
<i>I don't want to talk
about it over the phone.</i>

540
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,352
- All right. Okay, when I get home.
<i>- Okay.</i>

541
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,789
Arlo's consenting for
surgery. It's taken care of.

542
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,985
- You called it in?
- Vascular's ready for him.

543
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,290
- Okay.
- I'll start the pre-op list.

544
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,160
I have to go pump
before I explode.

545
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,858
Carolyn made it to the O.R.

546
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,628
- Who?
- Appendix girl.

547
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,294
Great.

548
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,067
You were busy today. Declared
a 15-year-old a mature minor...

549
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,974
- overrode parental consent on an appy.
- And took a kid from an abusive parent.

550
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,308
It's the triple crown
of social work.

551
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,485
- When are you off?
- Another hour.

552
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,985
Wanna get some dinner?

553
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,185
Thanks, I have plans already.

554
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,188
- Not with anyone, if you're wondering.
- Not a problem.

555
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,026
You can come along, but I have
to warn you, it's pretty physical.

556
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,829
Oh, yeah? RAY: Dr. Carter...

557
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,665
Neuro's admitting my CVA in 4.

558
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,705
Thanks. Abby,
that's two to sign out.

559
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,046
- It's 7:05.
- I've been here five minutes too long.

560
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,514
Stroke patient, tele-admit and the
cop Dubenko's sending to surgery.

561
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:42,052
- You've still got three on the board.
- I know. They're all discharged.

562
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,886
- Hey, Ray, you forgot something.
- Abby, what?

563
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,256
- Oh!
- Your flu shot.

564
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,364
You're welcome.

565
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,198
Pressure's good, 122/76.

566
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,927
You feeling better, Mr. Sakabu?

567
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,935
Yes. Thank you very much.

568
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,739
Okay if the nephew comes back?

569
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,873
Yeah, sure. We might be
able to get more history.

570
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,907
- Are you on any medication?
- No.

571
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,104
Any allergies?

572
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,380
Uh-uh. How could this happen?

573
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,618
Well, it's a very
unusual presentation.

574
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,721
You need enough force to break
a rib that cuts into the spleen.

575
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,584
My nephew's a pretty tough kid.

576
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,454
He'd have to be to
cause something like this.

577
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,652
My uncle gonna be okay?

578
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,398
Hey, have you seen Susan?

579
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,436
- She signed out.
- Oh, great.

580
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,336
- No, just page her again for me, please.
- What do you need?

581
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,407
Can't believe Ray
dumped this on me.

582
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:41,411
I'm supposed to take care of
this cop's kid. What's going on?

583
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,108
- He signed out to you? Why'd he do that?
- I was in his exit path to the door.

584
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,082
Dr. Lockhart, this
is Keith Trager.

585
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,154
- Daughter has appendicitis.
- Right. Hi. We spoke on the phone...

586
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,154
- Where is she?
- Her condition worsened.

587
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,623
- We had to take her.
- You were to transfer her.

588
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,763
- I know. There wasn't time for that, sir.
- Take me to her now.

589
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,023
- One second.
- There's a problem with Arlo?

590
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,929
Ray said it was all
settled, but he's very upset.

591
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,299
- I know the case. Want me to take it?
- Can you? Thank you.

592
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,939
- Excuse me.
- I'm coming.

593
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,267
Arlo?

594
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,472
- Where's Ray?
- He had to leave.

595
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,771
- When's he coming back?
- He left for the night.

596
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,471
- He left?
- I'm sure I can help.

597
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,311
He promised that he would
help me talk to my mom.

598
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,282
I can do that.

599
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,723
Bowel grasper and stapler.

600
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,363
Pressure is 122/76.

601
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,795
Prep the extraction bag.

602
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,463
Peanut swab with
Betadine for the stump.

603
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:43,870
Oh, my God. NURSE: Got it.

604
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,911
They're doing it through the scope, which
means a smaller scar, shorter recovery.

605
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,308
So she's okay?

606
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,074
It's not a complicated
procedure.

607
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,241
Everything's fine, Keith.

608
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,582
Who is that operating?

609
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,188
That's the chief of surgery.

610
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,224
- He's the best. DUBENKO:
Up on the cautery.

611
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,258
Dr. Dubenko, the
parents are here.

612
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,096
Oh, she's doing great.
We caught it before it burst.

613
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,691
- What's that?
- Pulse ox probe slipped off.

614
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,165
Everything's fine.

615
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,735
You know, I brought my dad
here for back surgery. He never left.

616
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,876
Well, that's not gonna happen.

617
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,842
He died on the table. Some
junior doc botched the job.

618
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,509
I'm sorry to hear that.

619
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,514
I hate this hospital.

620
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,588
- Where's the other doc?
- He isn't available...

621
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,287
He took off.

622
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,928
So, Arlo, have you decided
on which treatment...

623
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,193
you would like us to pursue?

624
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,872
I want him to
have the operation.

625
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,219
It's too risky, honey.

626
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,165
It's what he'd want.

627
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:04,056
- Isn't it better to
have him around sick...

628
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,418
- than to lose him?
- Does he have to be here?

629
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,060
He's your father's best
friend. McWAYNE: I feel bad.

630
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,163
I don't know why we're still
talking. Ray said it's my decision.

631
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,890
- What, you don't want my opinion?
- No.

632
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,335
Tell her.

633
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,803
Legally, Arlo has the right...

634
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,811
- He's too young to handle it.
- I'm not!

635
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,307
- Don't talk to your mother like that!
- Maybe if I reviewed the risks...

636
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:28,003
No. I understood
it the first time.

637
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,481
Dad would wanna go for it.

638
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,330
I know that's how
he always talked.

639
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,851
He liked to take chances.

640
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,080
That's what
probably got him shot.

641
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,985
We're not gonna
make any progress...

642
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,750
I want him to
have the operation.

643
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,196
If you approve this surgery...

644
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,263
how are you going
to feel if he dies?

645
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,433
- He's not gonna die.
- He could die.

646
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,964
Are you ready to live with that?

647
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,168
I'm trying to protect you.

648
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,832
I know you think
you're all grown up.

649
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,879
Are you ready to accept
responsibility for your father's death?

650
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,110
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hey, Marie.

651
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,314
It's Dr. Chen. How's he doing?
- <i>Well.</i>

652
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,625
Okay. Well, go ahead and
push another two of Ativan.

653
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,891
Yeah. Listen, any chance
you can work late tonight?

654
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,534
<i>- Probably.</i>
- Yeah, we're getting slammed.

655
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,398
And I don't think I'm gonna
be able to get home till 2 a.m.

656
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,129
<i>Well, all right.</i>

657
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,069
That would be great. Thank you.

658
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,140
Yeah, thank you so much.
- <i>No problem.</i>

659
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,800
Okay, bye.

660
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

661
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,147
- Sorry about Uncle Sumo's spleen.
- Yeah, well, we caught it in time.

662
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,152
Who knew his nephew
was the size of a Hummer?

663
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,982
Didn't mean to
snap at you earlier.

664
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,224
No. No. I was the Attending.
I should have seen him.

665
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,158
So who's the potassium for?

666
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,989
My dad.

667
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,869
- You gotta go easy on that stuff.
- Of course. Forty a day for his diarrhea.

668
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,673
This should last me a few weeks.

669
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,783
- Hey.
- Hey.

670
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,549
- It's a big wall.
- Yep, I'm in training.

671
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,022
For what? Taking down PCPers?

672
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,854
Triathlon.

673
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,526
Wendy. MEADE: Hey, Brett.

674
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,096
This is John. CARTER: Hi.

675
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,092
- First time?
- No.

676
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,895
I did this once
when I was a kid.

677
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,569
All right, thanks. Take good
care of him. See you at the top.

678
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,207
Let's go to the beginner wall.

679
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,037
Is this how this thing
is supposed to go?

680
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:43,108
Sure, if you want to hang
upside-down by your balls.

681
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,153
What's going on?

682
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,487
The family have decided
not to have the surgery.

683
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,823
The family? We've been
together for three years.

684
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:02,399
- Don't I get a say in any of this?
- Hello, this is Dr. Rasgotra in the ER.

685
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,663
We are canceling the carotid
surgery on patient Escobar.

686
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,601
Yes, I can hold.

687
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,152
Hey, John. CARTER: Hi.

688
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,659
So you two are dating?

689
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,195
No, we're just friends.

690
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,717
Well, that's how it starts.

691
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,957
We went out for a year or two.

692
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,033
Oh, yeah? Great.

693
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,502
Thought we might
even get married.

694
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:44,107
One day she tells me she
wants to start seeing other people.

695
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,468
Why do they say that?

696
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,706
You know, if you want to
break up, you should just do it.

697
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,480
Is the rope supposed
to be this loose?

698
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,518
- Better?
- Yeah, thanks.

699
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,957
Hey. SAM: Hey.

700
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:04,289
- Did you get back to sleep?
- No, not really.

701
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,794
Sorry.

702
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,963
Okay, where's Alex?

703
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,064
Up in his room.

704
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,200
Want a beer?

705
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,969
Do I need one?

706
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,638
He brought this to school.

707
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,208
That's it?

708
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,385
That's such crap.

709
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,749
Where'd he get it?

710
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,655
You subscribe?

711
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,819
- I like the articles.
- Oh, please.

712
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,333
So listen, anyway...

713
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,729
a friend of his had the
magazine in the bathroom...

714
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,002
in the stall...

715
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,738
at school...

716
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,411
You know, the kid was...

717
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,849
Are you kidding me?

718
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,247
Oh, my God.

719
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,923
Do you think that Alex is?

720
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:18,064
I thought it would be at least a
year or two until I had to deal with this.

721
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,874
Well, I guess I
need to talk to him.

722
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,210
Yep.

723
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,720
So I'm here twice a week,
anytime you want to join me.

724
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,413
- That'd be great.
- Brett could give you another lesson.

725
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,922
He's quite a teacher.

726
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,992
- See you next time.
- Bye.

727
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,528
I got an outfit just like that at
home, but I didn't want to show off.

728
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,221
So are you hungry?

729
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,493
Um, no. No, not really.

730
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,569
You got to eat dinner.

731
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,569
I'm just gonna grab
something at home.

732
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,299
Come on, you've been
a good sport. My treat.

733
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,568
- Okay.
- Okay.

734
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,745
So, what are you
in the mood for?

735
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,909
I don't know.

736
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,677
Indian?

737
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,116
No? Chinese?

738
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,748
Uh...

739
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,359
- Sushi?
- Had it for lunch.

740
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,825
What about deep-dish
pizza? I could go for pizza.

741
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:21,592
- I know a good pizza place on Monroe.
- Yeah, too many carbs.

742
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:22,995
Right.

743
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,933
Hey, I have an idea.

744
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:33,608
Okay, close your eyes,
pick a page and point.

745
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,713
That's where we go.

746
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,811
- What if it's a doughnut shop?
- Are you in this or not?

747
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,453
- There?
- Not there.

748
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,388
- There?
- Right there.

749
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,030
- And the winner is...
- Uncle Vito's Mongolian Barbecue.

750
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,825
What's that?

751
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,792
It's Italian. It's Asian.

752
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,027
It's maybe Southern.

753
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,269
All right, close your
eyes and do it again.

754
00:39:00,293 --> 00:39:01,640
No, no. You made the rules.

755
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,032
Mongolian barbecue?

756
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,736
But it's in Downers Grove.
We don't want to go that far.

757
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,813
Are you in this or not?

758
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,740
All right.

759
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,478
I hope they have tofu.

760
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,867
Officer McWayne.

761
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,364
They're moving
him up to the ICU.

762
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,506
Okay.

763
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,140
Thank you.

764
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,872
Arlo!

765
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,444
- Arlo!
- It's okay.

766
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,744
- Where is he going?
- Probably just getting a snack.

767
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,445
- He seems really upset.
- It'll pass.

768
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,022
Well, maybe I
should go talk to him.

769
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:56,958
No, he's too emotional. You can't
talk to him when he gets this way.

770
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,563
I hope he doesn't feel
like he was forced into this.

771
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,394
You don't want to think
about it some more...

772
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,766
- discuss it after he calms down?
- It won't help.

773
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:10,136
He's not being realistic. That's
why we had to make the decision.

774
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:11,742
He's too confused.

775
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,880
I heard him express a
strong opinion more than once.

776
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,208
You and I both know it
was the wrong choice.

777
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,277
He was hoping for something
that's never going to happen.

778
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,548
He loves his father, but I'm
the one who has to set the limits.

779
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,422
Anyway, thanks for
everything you did.

780
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,794
I'm not sure I helped.

781
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,058
Well, when you let us
work it out together...

782
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,225
you did the right thing.

783
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,777
Yeah.

784
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,478
Hey. Can I come in?

785
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,179
Didn't know you liked <i>The Goon.</i>

786
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,948
They didn't have <i>Hellboy.</i>

787
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,091
So look...

788
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:04,593
about today at school...

789
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,724
Mr. Elmore is such a loser.

790
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,366
Yeah.

791
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,763
What happened with
that kid in the bathroom...

792
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:17,669
all right, I just wanted to make
sure you didn't have any questions.

793
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,535
About what?

794
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,980
You know, about
what he was doing.

795
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,306
Spanking the monkey?

796
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,317
Yeah.

797
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,621
What about it?

798
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,616
Well, it's... It's normal...

799
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,352
but, you know, it's not the kind
of thing you should do at school.

800
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,959
You think I'm stupid?

801
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,169
No. At your age, it can
be a confusing time.

802
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,468
If you ever want to, you can
always talk to me about these things.

803
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,769
Okay.

804
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,348
Okay.

805
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,578
Good night.

806
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,660
I heard there was
an after-hours club.

807
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,854
Cool.

808
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,056
Have you seen Kristy?

809
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,668
Yeah, she's pulling
around the side.

810
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,099
Hey, you're late.

811
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,864
- We went on at 9.
- How could you just leave like that?

812
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,942
I'll meet you in the car.

813
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:28,541
- I'm sorry, what?
- You abandoned that kid.

814
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,714
I signed out my patients
when my shift was ov...

815
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,682
- You should have signed out to me.
- You were busy.

816
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,014
You thought it was
easy. It got complicated.

817
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:40,386
How did it get complicated? The
kid wanted his dad to have surgery.

818
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,289
- How long you discuss it, two minutes?
- He understood.

819
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,862
His dad's not
having the surgery.

820
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,692
- Why not?
- Because you weren't there.

821
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,926
His mom gave him a hard
time about it, and he gave in.

822
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,598
- Did you at least talk to him?
- Yes.

823
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,739
Well, all he needed was a
little hand-holding, Neela.

824
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,709
- I mean, God, is that so hard for you?
- Don't turn it around, make it about me.

825
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,744
- You promised to help.
- No, I told him...

826
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,112
You know, it's not my job or
anyone else's to keep your promises.

827
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,776
- My shift was over.
- He was counting on you.

828
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,819
- I had a gig.
- Screw your gig!

829
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,048
Medicine isn't a day job!

830
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:16,388
This coming from a girl who was
selling hot dogs three months ago.

831
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,830
I was off at 7.
Abby was off at 7.

832
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,432
But we were still there
taking care of our patients.

833
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,503
We'd never leave the hospital if we had
to stick around to tuck in every patient!

834
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,573
I'm not talking about every
patient, I'm talking about one kid.

835
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,936
It was the most important
decision of his life.

836
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:35,113
He trusted you, and you left.
