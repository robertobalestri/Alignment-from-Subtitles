1
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,167
<i>Previously on</i> ER.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,970
I was wondering if you found a replacement
for the chief of emergency medicine.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,169
- Someone you want to recommend?
- Yeah, me.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,010
You're doctors. Stop thinking like
students and take on a real patient load.

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,448
- You like it over there? At Luka's?
- I guess so.

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,179
- You like him too, right?
- Yeah. Why?

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,790
You two decide yet?
About moving in?

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,189
Don't. It'll kill the romance. They're
on their best behavior at first...

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,954
then they're farting
in the kitchen.

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,927
Thanks for your help today.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,800
- Sure.
- If you wait for a second...

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,833
I'll walk out with you.

13
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,768
Dr. Lewis, phone call.

14
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,278
- Say I'll be back in a minute.
- Seems persistent. Someone called Chuck.

15
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,007
Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,118
Hi, Chuck. I can't
talk right now.

17
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,448
Cosmo ate the yams? Okay.

18
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:58,114
Sure, of course I'm thrilled. It's just
I'm late for a meeting with Weaver.

19
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:02,457
No, no, no. I'm glad you called. Just,
Chuck... Chuck... Chuck, I gotta go.

20
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,394
I'll call you back, okay? Bye.

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,462
- How's Chuck?
- He's fine. Thank you.

22
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:12,367
He's excited because Cosmo ate
yams for the first time. You know babies.

23
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:16,135
- They like the bananas or the apples.
- Henry loved yam right from the get-go.

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,609
So as to your one-month
performance review...

25
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,079
- Performance review? Now?
- You've been emergency chief 30 days.

26
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,742
And I think it's going well. Staff
feels positive, esprit de corps is high.

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,320
- That's good to hear.
- Not that there haven't been...

28
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,151
- a few little glitches. First.
- First...

29
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,159
The average wait time to see
a physician is almost 10 hours.

30
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,991
I think we'd all agree
that's a bit excessive.

31
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,896
Second, a record number of patients
leave without treatment, resulting in...

32
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,937
a record number of complaints coming
to the administration. That would be me.

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,734
- Yes. Kerry, I've...
- Third, the number of bounce backs...

34
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:52,278
in under 48 hours was up 11
percent, signifying an increased rate...

35
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,349
of misdiagnoses, improper treatment
or really just poor follow-up planning.

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,349
- Kerry, if this isn't working out...
- Don't be silly.

37
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,079
You're doing a great job. I
wanted to make you aware...

38
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,589
that there are still many, many,
many problems for you to work on.

39
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,854
And if there's one word I can't
emphasize enough, Susan...

40
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,464
it's leadership.
That's it. Carry on.

41
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,872
Still waiting on a
transport for Mr. Lemley.

42
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,771
Thanks, Jerry.

43
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,377
From when you were in Africa?

44
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,481
No, these are new. Kem
just e-mailed me these.

45
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,049
I was gonna print them up.

46
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,379
She looks happy.

47
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,982
- Uh, which is nice, considering...
- Oh, yeah, she does.

48
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,888
Oh, very nice. Anyone
I should get to know?

49
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,618
You're not her type.

50
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,492
Paramedics at the back door.
Lewis is upstairs with Weaver.

51
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,100
We'll take it. Won't we, doctor?

52
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,162
- Hey. That's Carter's whatever, right?
- Mm-hm.

53
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,638
Man, I could
look at her all day.

54
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,744
Sixty-year-old woman, facial
injuries, chest wall contusions...

55
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,031
- and deformities to both arms.
- What's your name?

56
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,873
- Might be Louise.
- No ID. She was in an alley.

57
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,747
- No purse, wallet.
- What happened?

58
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,219
She could have fallen from a window
or dumped from a car. I don't know.

59
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,483
BP, 124/74. Tachy at 118.

60
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,117
- She's gonna need an airway.
- Let's clear her neck first.

61
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,864
- C-spine looks good.
- Does that mean I can talk to her?

62
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,027
You can take the c-collar off.
Sit her up to 30 degrees. No.

63
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,197
Do you need a hand in here?
- Facial fractures...

64
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,106
pulmonary contusions,
fractured wrist, fractured hands.

65
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,337
Name is Louise.

66
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,107
Hi, Louise, I'm Sam. Let us
know if this makes you at all dizzy.

67
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,342
- I... I...
- Don't talk if it hurts.

68
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,951
Dr. Carter, your COPD guy's...

69
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,553
- seizing in Curtain 4.
- Okay, go.

70
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,851
- 8.0 ET tube is ready to go.
- Not so fast.

71
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,218
Sorry. I know it hurts.

72
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,140
Pulse ox, 82. I'll
move her to five liters.

73
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,962
No intubation. It's a LeFort Il.

74
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,726
She's gonna need surgery
or she can't have an oral tube.

75
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,371
- Okay. Can I crike her?
- You're gonna observe quietly.

76
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,804
Louise, you have a broken jaw
and broken bones in your face.

77
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,036
We'll put a breathing tube in your
neck and sedate you for the procedure.

78
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,773
Wait.

79
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,215
I was raped.

80
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,595
Excuse me.

81
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,902
I'll be back, okay?

82
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,539
- Are you the one...?
- Yeah. We got the rape kit.

83
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,376
We did it while she was out.
She doesn't need more trauma.

84
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,747
Well, her full name is Louise Garvin.
We canvassed the neighborhood.

85
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,411
Her apartment's above the
alleyway where she was found.

86
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,676
Anyone see anything?

87
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,923
No. There were signs
of a struggle inside.

88
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,220
Seems like she got
away and then took a fall...

89
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,761
- coming down the fire escape.
- Found any family?

90
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,559
Not yet. Detectives are
on the case. They'll be here.

91
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,725
They'll talk to her, to
you, and to the doc.

92
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,997
Fine. Hey, Jerry. When the
detectives get here for Louise, find me.

93
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,437
- Okay.
- We can't have patients sitting around...

94
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:18,340
for 10 hours waiting to be seen. You
need to adhere to a 15-minute rule.

95
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,743
Even if you're busy, the patient
needs to be seen within 15 minutes...

96
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,315
of hitting the gurney, okay?

97
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,644
- Yeah.
- Sure.

98
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,083
And we have a serious
issue with bounce backs.

99
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,622
Oh, man, I was supposed
to stitch that head lac in 2.

100
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,524
Okay, bounce backs. I need you
all to provide aftercare instructions...

101
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,430
written directly to the patient.
Make sure they understand.

102
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,125
- You'll take that belly pain in Curtain 3?
- Yes, I was.

103
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,662
Make sure they understand...

104
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,298
and that they know to go to
their clinic or primary for follow-up.

105
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,304
- Get the labs back on that renal colic?
- Still waiting.

106
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:54,107
What do those guys want? I
got them a crate of Cracker Jacks.

107
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,647
Um... What's the...?
About the follow-ups?

108
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,648
Okay, Mi-Cha Pak?

109
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,848
- Mi-Cha, am I saying that correctly?
- Yes.

110
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,688
I'm Dr. Lockhart. Tell me
about the pain you're having.

111
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,157
It hurts here. ABBY: Okay.

112
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,959
And is it constant, or
does it come and go?

113
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,332
It comes and goes. I think it's a
kidney stone. My father had one...

114
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,440
- Morris.
- Sorry. Okay? Sorry.

115
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,169
- What about a kidney stone?
- Her father had one.

116
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,972
- Okay. And are you...?
- Sorry. Sorry.

117
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,550
- What is your problem?
- No problem. We're all set. Sorry again.

118
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,842
Um...

119
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,682
Vomiting or fever.
Any vomiting or fever?

120
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,087
I think maybe I'm better.
I could probably go.

121
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,854
No, no. As long as you're
here, we'll take a look at you.

122
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,758
- We'll get you in a gown, okay?
- Okay.

123
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,058
And I'll be back to examine you.

124
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,530
So you two moving in?
Girl, that's getting serious.

125
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,365
With Luka, that's getting lucky.

126
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,097
It just seemed to
make more sense.

127
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,209
That's what my girlfriend said
when she moved in six years ago.

128
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,242
That's why you two
are coming in together.

129
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,007
We just moved our stuff over last night.
We haven't even unpacked our boxes.

130
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,346
Living together is for wimps.
Real commitment comes with a ring.

131
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,544
Yeah, my girlfriend's
on that one too.

132
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:12,421
Excuse me. I'm Detective Patrie.
I'm here about Louise Garvin.

133
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,723
Yeah, she's over here. She's in rough
shape. As soon as a bed opens up...

134
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,957
- we'll send her to ICU.
- Did she say anything other than that...

135
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,693
- she'd been raped?
- She could barely get that out.

136
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,397
She's got a crike tube now, can't
talk at all, and two broken arms.

137
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,444
Hi, Louise. This is Detective
Patrie. He's investigating your case.

138
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,912
Hi. May I call you Louise?

139
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,249
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

140
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,912
I know this is difficult. But I'm going
to need to ask you some questions...

141
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,785
if you're up to it.

142
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,924
Now, the man who raped you...

143
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,827
was he someone you knew,
a friend or an acquaintance?

144
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:58,029
Anyone you saw around
your building or neighborhood?

145
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,465
Was he alone?

146
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,411
It's just mucous plug. Louise,
I'm gonna have to suction you out...

147
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,110
- since you can't cough this stuff up.
- Can I still talk to her?

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,428
Yeah.

149
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,435
Louise, was he alone?

150
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,443
Did you get a good look at him?

151
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,435
Would you be able to identify
him if you saw him again?

152
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,508
You know what, I think
that's enough for now, okay?

153
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,949
- When will she be able to talk?
- We'll have to ask Dr. Kovac.

154
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,288
It's a gravid abdomen.

155
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,459
Oh! It hurts. It hurts now.

156
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,827
I need sterile gloves, Surgilube,
and help with the pelvic.

157
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,900
- When was your last period?
- I don't know.

158
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,630
You don't know? Did you
have a gush of water today?

159
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,505
Maybe when I was peeing.

160
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,678
- Aah!
- Oh, God. She's 10 centimeters dilated.

161
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,748
- Oh, God, is right. Effacement?
- Hundred percent. Station is two-plus.

162
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,508
- Call OB?
- Yeah.

163
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:21,348
Okay, Mi-Cha, don't push, all
right? Listen to me and focus.

164
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,013
I need you to pant when the
pain comes and don't push.

165
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,988
Chuny, can you help
me with this gurney?

166
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,129
- Is she having a baby?
- I'm not pregnant.

167
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,022
- Pulmonary contusions are getting worse.
- That's why she can't talk?

168
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,532
She was punched so hard
that her lungs are bruised.

169
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,639
Swelling, fluid,
bleeding in the air sac...

170
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,834
Sam. Her condition is critical.

171
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,876
We'll provide oxygen, wait for the lungs
to heal, hope it doesn't get any worse.

172
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,569
- It could get worse?
- Much worse.

173
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,215
- I need to talk to her.
- That's not gonna be possible.

174
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,011
The details she could give
us might help solve this case.

175
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,019
This rapist has been assaulting
women all over the North Side.

176
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,022
She's the first one who seems
like she got a good look at him.

177
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,387
Can't we do something?
I think she wants to help.

178
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,358
How? By blinking in Morse code?

179
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,692
We can't miraculously cure pulmonary
edema. She's being admitted to the ICU.

180
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,701
Then she'll go for reconstructive
surgery on her facial bones.

181
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,568
In a week or so, they may be able to
remove the tube and then she can talk.

182
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:21,214
Okay. Don't push. Don't push.
What's she doing down here?

183
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,579
She didn't know she was pregnant
until I examined her. Name's Mi-Cha.

184
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,118
- Hi, Mi-Cha. I'm Dr. Carter.
- I'm not pregnant.

185
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,223
- Don't push, okay?
- Come on. Come on.

186
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,757
Hey, breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
- Breathe?

187
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,952
- Yeah, breathe.
- Yeah, breathe.

188
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,427
- We won't make it. She's crowning.
- Wanna take it?

189
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:41,432
- No, not in the elevator lobby.
- Get me a BOA kit and a baby warmer.

190
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,571
- Okay, don't push.
- Hang in there. You're gonna be okay.

191
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:49,266
Baby's LOA, normal presentation.
Okay, Mi-Cha. Now I want you to push.

192
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,070
- So push. Push.
- Come on.

193
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,839
Push. A little bit more.

194
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,606
Head's out. Good, good.

195
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,350
- More suction.
- Okay. Now stop pushing.

196
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,113
Stop pushing. Don't
push. Don't push.

197
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,619
A little bit more.

198
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,953
And there we go.

199
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,354
Cord clamp.

200
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,089
Time of delivery, 11:14.

201
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,332
- I'll get the HemoCue.
- Ten fingers, 10 toes.

202
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,835
You have a beautiful
healthy baby boy.

203
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,236
You did great.

204
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,373
That's not my baby.

205
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,104
- What?
- I didn't have a baby.

206
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,288
Abby's not making much
progress with that Korean girl.

207
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,721
- Well, give her a little bit more time.
- She was hoping you could come.

208
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,090
If she can't break through her denial,
she should get Psych down here.

209
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,131
Is that the message you'd
like me to give Dr. Lockhart?

210
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,737
- Tell her I'll check in with her in a bit.
- Frank, call a taxi for Mrs. Donaldson.

211
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,463
Hear you're doing the
<i>"mi casa, su casa"</i>thing.

212
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,633
- What?
- Hell, it's none of my business.

213
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,379
- Detective's still here.
- You shouldn't have been so dismissive...

214
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,615
- of me in front of him.
- You didn't need to discuss details.

215
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,384
Louise deserves some privacy.

216
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,121
Yeah, and she deserves a chance to
help. We have an option we haven't...

217
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,890
- even talked about.
- And that is?

218
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,467
If we deflate the crike
balloon, Louise could whisper.

219
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,934
- You want to take her off the vent?
- Just for a few moments at a time.

220
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,166
She's requiring
100 percent oxygen.

221
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,335
I take her off the vent every
time I suction her, and she's fine.

222
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,815
- We both know it's possible.
- Technically, yes, but why risk it?

223
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,952
- Because she wants to help.
- She does or you do?

224
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,814
What is that supposed to mean?

225
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,183
You're sensitive about
these kinds of cases.

226
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,453
- What?
- You always stand up for women...

227
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,824
- who have been assaulted.
- And you don't?

228
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,693
Of course I do.

229
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,271
Maybe because of when
you were with Steve?

230
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,608
Steve never raped me.

231
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,509
- Physical abuse? Hitting you?
- Oh, this has nothing to do with that.

232
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,378
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

233
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,678
There's a violent
rapist out there.

234
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,386
How are you gonna feel in two
days, two weeks, a month from now...

235
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,321
when we get another
woman like Louise in here?

236
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,958
Hey, crit's only 19
on your GI bleeder.

237
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,469
Go.

238
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,829
Go.

239
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,653
Korean girl, mother's in the family room.
But Mi-Cha is still on another planet.

240
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,220
She's perfectly reasonable
until I mention the baby.

241
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,982
Then she looks
at me like I'm nuts.

242
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,821
Teenage denial can be fairly intransigent.
Can't necessarily attack it head-on.

243
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,156
- I know. That's why I was...
- I'll talk to her.

244
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,329
- Hi, Mi-Cha.
- Hi.

245
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,995
- How are you? How are you feeling?
- I feel fine. It's hard to sleep though.

246
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,231
That baby cries.

247
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,342
- She said my kidneys are fine.
- Yes, they are.

248
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,740
Then can I go home?

249
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,179
No. No, you can't. Not yet. We're
still waiting on a few more test results.

250
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,421
How long is that gonna take?
Because my parents get really mad...

251
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,886
when I'm not home
right after school.

252
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,186
Well, you're not
in school today.

253
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,191
I still need to be home by 4.

254
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,459
Hey, Mi-Cha. Have you
checked out this baby over here?

255
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,431
He's pretty cute.

256
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,933
Why do you people keep
asking me about that baby?

257
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:44,939
We're just wondering if you like babies,
or if you ever wanted to have a baby.

258
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:49,444
I don't know. Maybe when
I'm married. Who cares?

259
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,207
You want to try holding him?

260
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,220
Why would I do that?

261
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,715
I don't get why he's even in
here. I mean, shouldn't his mother...

262
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,055
- be dealing with him?
- Okay, you just take it easy. Calm down.

263
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,254
And we'll be back in a bit.

264
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,231
- Am I gonna get out by 4?
- Don't know. Hope so.

265
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,627
So is she pretending
this didn't happen...

266
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,239
or does she really believe
she didn't give birth?

267
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,899
Who knows? Her dissociative
denial is pretty strong.

268
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,601
I have her mother
hanging around.

269
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,612
And I can't break confidentiality
and tell her about the baby.

270
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,512
Let me guess, this is the
mother walking towards us?

271
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,015
Uh-huh. That's Mrs. Pak.

272
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,620
Call Social Services
and Psych again.

273
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,314
Get back in there, see if
you can keep working on her.

274
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,786
Mrs. Pak. Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.

275
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,258
Forty-three-year-old female, 15-foot
fall. Blunt head trauma. GCS, 13.

276
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,526
- Heart rate, 92. BP, 112/72.
- Why isn't she wearing a collar?

277
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,100
- What collar?
- Don't talk.

278
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,703
Did you just say 43?

279
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,031
What do we got? HARMS:
Twenty-eight-year-old male.

280
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,599
Penetrating injury to bilateral lower
extremities with arterial laceration.

281
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,041
- BP 72 palp.
- BP 72 palp.

282
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,944
I don't think she'd be talking on her
cell phone, and I don't think she's a male.

283
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,982
We're here now. I gotta go.

284
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,212
Thirty-nine-year-old female, crush
injury to the chest and abdomen.

285
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,948
- ST elevations on the strip.
- I know I just got here...

286
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,821
- but where are the bathrooms?
- What's going on?

287
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,622
Are you the incident commander?

288
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,395
- Me? SCURRY:
Chemical explosion...

289
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:16,332
at a maraschino cherry factory,
93 casualties. You're getting 35.

290
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,836
Okay, ladies and
gentlemen, this is a drill. Go.

291
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,805
- What the hell?
- Did you know anything about this?

292
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,339
Dr. Lewis!

293
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,641
Louise is still asleep.

294
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,479
Yeah, I got some
background information on her.

295
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,817
She lived alone since her
husband died five or six years ago.

296
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,721
Neighbor wasn't sure. No children.
Haven't located any family yet.

297
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,022
- I thought you might wanna know.
- Yeah.

298
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,590
Thanks. I should probably
get in there and check on her.

299
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,770
Yeah. Guy uses a
similar pattern each time.

300
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,371
How many other victims?

301
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,666
Four women in
the last five weeks.

302
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,502
He poses as a pizza guy...

303
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,908
pretends to be confused
about the apartment number.

304
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,940
Never open your door
to anyone you don't know.

305
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,210
The others, are they okay?

306
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,016
Rape isn't quite bad
enough for this guy.

307
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,351
He likes to beat
them too, like Louise.

308
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,620
One died, and the other
three are in pretty bad shape.

309
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,260
Hope she makes it. Each victim
has given us a clue, you know...

310
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,594
helped us get
a little bit closer.

311
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,967
If Louise dies, we'll just
have to wait for the next one.

312
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,772
- Got a head lac, GCS, 15.
- She's a green, put her in Sutures.

313
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,208
- Suture room's full.
- Okay, then Curtain 4.

314
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,144
- I wanna stay with Kaitlin.
- They said we could be together.

315
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,615
Sorry. You're a pelvic
fracture. Red tag, Trauma 1.

316
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,879
- I wanna stay with Julie.
- They promised us...

317
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,752
- Guys, you're not babies, all right?
- Yeah, but they were told they could...

318
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,959
Yeah, they said so.

319
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,995
Don't forget to call your
consults and support staff.

320
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,598
They're keeping track
of the response times.

321
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,726
Abby said Social Services is here. They
are in with the Korean virgin-birth girl.

322
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,304
- Okay. Thanks, Haleh.
- Frank, where's Jerry?

323
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,442
He left on account
of the infestation.

324
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,442
He was calling Transport for
a real patient in 2, going to CT.

325
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,910
- I'm on it.
- Wow, this is fun.

326
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,346
Damn JCAHO drill. Explosion
at a maraschino cherry factory.

327
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,782
- That's what I heard.
- Who makes this stuff up?

328
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,751
- I don't know.
- Does this even exist...

329
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,253
- in Chicago?
- I actually...

330
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,858
I got rid of two greens and
a dead merit-badge holder.

331
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,087
Is it okay if I help a real person
with double vision and vertigo?

332
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,925
Susan, do you want all the
red tags parked in Trauma 1?

333
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,930
- No.
- Hi, I'm Trina. I'm a squad leader.

334
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,467
- Need any help?
- You have a head lac. You can't talk.

335
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,606
- I wasn't asking you.
- Phone call for Dr. Lewis. It's the lab.

336
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,708
They wanna yell at you.

337
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,972
So Fremont has a pretty
good football team, don't they?

338
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,114
I don't go to that many games.

339
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,314
What kind of stuff do
you do with your friends?

340
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,619
Mostly we just eat
lunch together at school.

341
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,281
What about the weekends?

342
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,190
Do you go out as a group,
or do you go on dates?

343
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,327
Some of my friends have boyfriends
so they just go with each other.

344
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,561
Do you have a boyfriend?

345
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,493
No.

346
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,298
Can I still leave by 4?

347
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,870
Do your parents get very
upset if you're not home on time?

348
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,874
I have to be there
for my brother.

349
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,637
Why is that?

350
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,348
- I take care of him.
- How old is he?

351
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,177
Twenty-three.

352
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,348
So you spend a lot of
time with your brother.

353
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,387
- Yeah, of course.
- And when you take care of him...

354
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,825
- what kind of things do you do?
- I don't know why you keep asking...

355
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,327
all these questions.

356
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,997
I'm getting tired. Can I
just take a nap in here?

357
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,008
Sure. Get some rest.

358
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,515
Maybe we should
check out this brother.

359
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:56,520
- Mom's in the family room.
- I'll try talking to her obliquely.

360
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,181
If need be, we can designate
the baby as a safe haven.

361
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,021
Safe haven? This baby isn't abandoned.
- It kind of is.

362
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,425
Mother's right there.
Grandmother's down the hall.

363
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,260
- She's not acknowledging the baby.
- She's not competent...

364
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,232
- to give up the baby.
- Even if she does, we don't know...

365
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,962
- she'll want to keep him.
- Shouldn't we at least try?

366
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,938
- We don't know a thing about her family.
- Let's go find out.

367
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,044
- You can't break confidentiality.
- Maybe her family's support...

368
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,804
- is what she needs.
- Dr. Carter.

369
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,778
I talked to the mom. She seems
very reasonable and concerned.

370
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,248
- This baby has a family.
- Carter...

371
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,909
Mrs. Pak. MRS. PAK: Yes?

372
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,079
Mi-Cha, can I see her now?

373
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,385
Notice any changes in Mi-Cha's
condition in the last couple months?

374
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,087
No. She's good. Please
tell me what's wrong with her.

375
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,892
So you didn't know that
your daughter was pregnant?

376
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,236
That's right. This morning she gave
birth to a beautiful healthy baby boy.

377
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,435
- Her father won't have her in the house.
- Mrs. Pak.

378
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,308
- How long will she stay here?
- Maybe a couple days.

379
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,142
Mrs. Pak...

380
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,787
- She's awake.
- The Unasyn piggyback get here?

381
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,793
Yeah. I just hung it.

382
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,090
I'll get back to our
little Ranger Scouts.

383
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,114
Yeah, be my guest.

384
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,259
Hey, Louise. How you doing?

385
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,207
Louise, the man that raped
you, he raped four other women.

386
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:31,280
Now, there might be a way that we
could help you talk to the detective.

387
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,379
The tube that's in your neck...

388
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,291
has a little balloon on the end of it
that we inflate to protect your lungs...

389
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,725
to prevent oxygen
from leaking out.

390
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:48,630
If I deflate the balloon and
cover the end of the tube...

391
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:53,671
you would be able to whisper
just a few words at a time.

392
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,133
There are some very real risks.

393
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,871
I would be depriving your lungs of
supplemental oxygen for a minute.

394
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,346
But if there were a problem...

395
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:09,181
I'd re-inflate the balloon
and put you back on the vent.

396
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,492
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

397
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,531
I would need to clear it with
Dr. Kovac, and I also need your consent.

398
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,575
Hey, Jerry, where's that
surgical consult on Rapke in 2?

399
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,942
Man, I have called
them, like, five times.

400
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,277
They're so jerked around with
these scouts they won't come down.

401
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,046
Go and drag one down here
before the guy bleeds out.

402
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,690
- As soon as I take these to...
- No, Jerry, I said now.

403
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:48,294
Frank, call the lab. Have them come
pick that up. Don't accept any excuses.

404
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,056
- Which patient does Kovac have at CT?
- Check the board. Stay away from Carter.

405
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,699
He's got his panties in a twist.

406
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,300
Tell Kovac to come find me.

407
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,871
- Did they call about a bed for Louise?
- They said maybe an hour.

408
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,071
Oh, just wanted to let you know
that I'll be leaving for a while.

409
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,905
- Louise is awake.
- Yeah, I saw her.

410
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,378
- I told her I'd see her later.
- Well, she'll be in ICU by then.

411
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,541
I'll find it. Thanks
for your help.

412
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,284
Detective Patrie, wait.

413
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,455
There is something
else we could try.

414
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,651
You knew the drill was today.
- Dr. Lewis?

415
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,557
- Dr. Lewis, I'm Trina. Remember?
- Yes.

416
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,459
- I'd like to help.
- You're yellow tag.

417
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,566
- You should be in your area.
- I feel fine.

418
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,066
- I think I could be useful.
- Well, thanks again.

419
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,466
- Take Trina back to the yellow tags.
- No problem.

420
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,301
Are you sure? I'm good with
injuries. I'm a people person.

421
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,568
I knew it was today,
they called to schedule.

422
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:40,076
- You didn't tell staff.
- I've got a scrotal pain...

423
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,407
but haven't got room.
Can I move the scouts?

424
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,413
Yeah. But they need to be seen.
- Yeah.

425
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,747
- It was supposed to be a surprise.
- A hint wouldn't hurt.

426
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,651
Susan, you need to learn to
take control despite the rules.

427
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,419
I'm gonna need clarification on which
ones to follow and which ones to break.

428
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,028
What should I do with a
ranger with a shrapnel injury?

429
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,989
- The O.R. won't let me through.
- I'll call.

430
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,665
Girls, please, stop. You're
gonna get hurt for real.

431
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,465
- Morris, what the hell is going on?
- A vat of cherry dye blew up on them.

432
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:10,097
They needed decon. I couldn't find
the key to the decontamination closet...

433
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,609
so I sent them to the shower. It
was supposed to be a pretend shower.

434
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,681
- Yeah. Go round them up.
- Okay, get them some scrubs.

435
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,284
- Get them out of those wet clothes.
- Oh, my God.

436
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,819
- Susan, this is chaos.
- We could use help with the green tags.

437
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,887
Okay, girls. We're gonna...

438
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,792
Girls, can I have
your attention, please?

439
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,294
Yo! Scouts!

440
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,299
- Gosh.
- That's much better. Thank you.

441
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,972
Pulse ox, 94. That's good.

442
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:52,985
Okay, Louise.

443
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
I'm gonna deflate
the balloon now.

444
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,821
You okay, Louise?

445
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,161
Okay.

446
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,002
Sam was looking for you.
She went with that detective.

447
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,660
Okay, thanks. MARQUEZ: Luka.

448
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,170
Can I give Mr. Sanchez
another four of morphine?

449
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,173
- Sure. His chest pain is getting worse?
- Seven out of 10.

450
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,174
- Do a repeat EKG.
- I already did.

451
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,711
He says the pain
radiates to his back.

452
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,542
Could be a dissection.

453
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,174
- See if his chest x-ray is ready.
- Already got it. It's bedside.

454
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:31,346
Okay. I had better be sure
this guy doesn't need the O.R.

455
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,754
You said you got a good
look at this guy's face.

456
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,352
What color was his skin?

457
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,696
White.

458
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,198
Was he tall or short?

459
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,568
Wait. Do you want us to stop?

460
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:59,711
Louise, was he tall or short?

461
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,911
Kind of medium.

462
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,551
Maybe tall.

463
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,889
- Jerry's not back yet?
- When is Jerry ever back?

464
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,559
This where we keep the
workmen's comp claim forms?

465
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,069
No, they're in these bins
down here somewhere.

466
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,003
Talked to Mi-Cha's
brother. He's coming.

467
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,904
Yeah. How's all
that working out?

468
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,840
Okay. She's opening
up about her family.

469
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,243
- They sound kind of scary.
- Meaning what?

470
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,076
Conservative,
traditional, old world.

471
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,346
As in you'd be pretty screwed if
you were an unwed teenage mom.

472
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,457
Wendall had to leave, but she's
coming back. Wanna talk to her?

473
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,304
- Mi-Cha? Again? Why?
- I don't know.

474
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,520
- I just figured whatever helps.
- What are these doing in here?

475
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,755
- What?
- Pictures of Kem from the computer.

476
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,923
- Why are they in that drawer?
- I don't know.

477
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,763
Somebody printed them out.
You don't have any idea who?

478
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,963
- Well, Morris was looking at them. I...
- Morris? Where is he?

479
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,268
He was wheeling one of those
scouts up to CT, or something.

480
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,607
Hey, Morris! What are you doing
downloading pictures of my girlfriend?

481
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,182
What? CARTER: Morris!

482
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,494
You should really
come take a look at him.

483
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,697
Who?

484
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,835
This beautiful baby.

485
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,473
This beautiful boy.

486
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,240
What are you talking about?

487
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,138
You haven't even
held him yet, have you?

488
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,747
Why are you talking like this?

489
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,006
He is so beautiful.

490
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,480
Look at those eyes.

491
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,149
Look at that face.

492
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,491
And all he wants
to do is be held.

493
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,589
All he wants to do is be loved.

494
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,495
Do you know how lucky you are?

495
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,199
Do you know what
a miracle this is?

496
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,170
What are you doing?

497
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,681
I just don't understand. Can't
you see it? I mean, look at it.

498
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,910
- Take him.
- Why are you doing this?

499
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,676
- Hold him for a second.
- Dr. Carter.

500
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,188
I just thought that if
she held the baby...

501
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:19,850
They need you down the hall.

502
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,041
- I was just trying to...
- They need you down the hall.

503
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,485
I don't remember.

504
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,561
Sorry. PATRIE: That's okay.

505
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,253
You're doing great, Louise.

506
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,100
Did he have any tattoos
or scars that you saw?

507
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,767
All right, I'm gonna
blow the balloon back up.

508
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,807
It's okay, Louise. I got you.

509
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,570
- What...? Is she gonna be okay?
- Go get Dr. Kovac now.

510
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,239
Good news, Mr. Sanchez. You
won't be needing that surgery after all.

511
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,989
- How are her sats? SAM:
Seventy-nine. She vomited.

512
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,423
I can see that.

513
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,324
She's aspirated.

514
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:36,100
Add five of PEEP, hang 3.375
of Zosyn to cover aspiration.

515
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,602
- Chest x-ray now and repeat in an hour.
- Is she gonna be okay?

516
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,296
She's sucked
vomit into her lungs.

517
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,942
I don't think there will be
any more questions today.

518
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:55,581
- You left her airway vulnerable.
- I didn't expect the vomiting.

519
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,383
Her lungs were already bad
from the pulmonary contusions.

520
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,891
I wanted to help. I explained
the risks. It's what Louise wanted.

521
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,187
And what you wanted.

522
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,603
Are you sure no one else knows
about what you were doing in there?

523
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,931
Just the cop.

524
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,500
Luka, her sats keep dropping.

525
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,607
Down to 72 at a
hundred percent oxygen.

526
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:22,577
- Put her up to 10 of PEEP.
- Repeat chest.

527
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,114
Bilateral whiteout.

528
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,878
- Is that the contusions or the aspiration?
- Does it matter at this point?

529
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,354
- Mi-Cha's brother's here.
- Good.

530
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,962
He's 23 but developmentally
delayed. Wendall's in there with them.

531
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:42,294
- I'm heading in. Wanna come along?
- Nope. You and Wendall can handle it.

532
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,206
Hi.

533
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,808
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

534
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,207
So, Yong-Jo, you and Mi-Cha
spend a lot of time together?

535
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,811
First we get up.

536
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:00,384
And then we have breakfast.

537
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,949
And then Mi-Cha goes to
school, and I go to Sadler's.

538
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,185
- Sadler's?
- It's a supermarket.

539
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,994
I stock shelves.

540
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,055
I bag groceries.

541
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,496
- I can lift things. Oh.

542
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,193
So when Mi-Cha comes home
from school, what do you do?

543
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,572
She stays home with me.

544
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:30,341
- She doesn't go out. She never leaves.
- Yong-Jo.

545
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,677
- She stays home with me.
- What are you doing?

546
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,117
- I didn't tell anybody.
- Tell anybody about what?

547
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,249
What are you doing here?

548
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,363
I came to see you and the baby.

549
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,465
And the baby?

550
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,020
I didn't tell anybody.

551
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,786
You told me not to
and I didn't, I promise.

552
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,562
You believe me,
don't you, Mi-Cha?

553
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,999
I didn't do anything wrong.

554
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,737
- Please, Mi-Cha!
- Yong-Jo, let's go outside, okay?

555
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,139
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- I know, it's okay.

556
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,303
I didn't tell anybody.

557
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,579
Mi-Cha?

558
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,813
It's a real disaster in here.

559
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,721
Red tag, partially
amputated foot.

560
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,089
Another red, unconscious
and short of breath.

561
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,662
Trina. TRINA: Abdominal
lac and dizziness.

562
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,494
She's only a yellow, but
she's taken a turn for the worse.

563
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,501
- I can help.
- Trina, please. I think we'll be okay.

564
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,606
Hey, Malik. Can you dispo
all these fake patients?

565
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:06,335
Respiratory distress needs O2, pulse
ox, chest x-ray and a possible tube.

566
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,707
- Okay, it's in the works.
- Thanks.

567
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,509
Ow! Ow! Ow!

568
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,016
- What are you doing?
- Her foot's amputated.

569
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,738
If we don't put
pressure on it, she'll die.

570
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:17,762
Trina, please.

571
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,690
Want her to bleed to death?
You want that on your conscience?

572
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,387
Please, please, Trina.
Please, get back to your gurney.

573
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,361
- But I can help you.
- But you're not.

574
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,295
But I can. I've
earned a lot of badges.

575
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,401
Adventure club, adventure teen...
- Trina.

576
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,629
Globe trekking, horse
lover, horse rider...

577
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,861
Trina!

578
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,519
Hiker, safety tips, stress
tips, sailing, surfing, boating...

579
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:40,068
Stop it now! I don't care
about your damn badges.

580
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,912
Water world, weather watch.

581
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,147
You know what?
That's it, I'm done.

582
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,291
- You're all out of here.
- Excuse me?

583
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,451
Every observer, all
the little girls, out now.

584
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,893
- This drill is over.
- You can't do that.

585
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:02,501
I'm the chief of emergency
medicine here, and I damn well can.

586
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,930
We don't need this drill.

587
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,504
We had a helicopter crash in
our ambulance bay for God's sake!

588
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,471
So you can take your clipboards
and your Ranger Scouts...

589
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,976
and hit some other hospital
because my doctors and nurses...

590
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,673
need to get back to treating real
patients with real problems. You got it?

591
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,749
Back to work.

592
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,854
I was afraid I was
gonna miss you.

593
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,360
- We're on our way out.
- Just give me one second.

594
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,328
All right, look, you're
gonna go up to the third floor.

595
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,908
Just tell them you're
looking for the O.R.

596
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:39,961
What? You're not coming?

597
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:44,770
Look, hang out for about 30 minutes,
or so, and roll yourself back down.

598
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,673
How's your dad?

599
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,212
He came in for a G-tube,
ended up with pneumonia.

600
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:52,441
But after two weeks of
antibiotics, oxygen and a chest PT...

601
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,108
he's back to just being old.

602
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,819
I just fired the scouts.
No more fake patients.

603
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,791
What about the
ones we dealt with?

604
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:04,986
Broom all of them.

605
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,962
See real patients only within
15 minutes of their signing in.

606
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:11,297
Susan seems to take this
chief thing kind of seriously.

607
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,337
I don't know if it was the
brother wanting to see the baby...

608
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,738
or us thinking he's the father,
whatever, it got through to her.

609
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,969
So the father was actually some
guy that lives across the street?

610
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,842
Yes, her boyfriend.

611
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,848
And her cover was having
Yong-Jo say, "She never goes out.

612
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,953
She always stays home.
She never leaves me."

613
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:33,584
- Good work.
- Thank you.

614
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:39,660
- How are they?
- Adjusting, hanging in, who knows?

615
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,925
- Was that Carter who was just out here?
- Yeah.

616
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,194
I thought he might come in.

617
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,396
I think all of this might have
been a little bit rough on him.

618
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,402
Why? What do you mean?

619
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:53,341
I don't know if you've heard
what he went through last spring?

620
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,677
No, I hadn't.

621
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,214
- Gonna come to work tomorrow?
- That's the plan...

622
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,545
as long as everything's
okay on this end.

623
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,723
Shh, shh.

624
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,624
- What's the matter? He okay?
- He gets confused and agitated.

625
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,231
And being in that hospital
for that long didn't help.

626
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,800
Papa. Papa! Papa!
No, no, no, no!

627
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,799
- It's okay.
- Papa!

628
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,072
Damn it!

629
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,138
Son of a bitch!

630
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,576
- Son of a bitch.
- Bradying down at 42.

631
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,716
Amp of atropine and
open the crash cart.

632
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,646
- Go up on the PEEP?
- Pressure's too low.

633
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,649
- What about steroids?
- V-tach. No pulse.

634
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,198
Starting compressions. Charge to 200.
- Milligram of epi.

635
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,888
Charged. SAM: Clear!

636
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,320
- No change.
- Three hundred.

637
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,327
Check for pneumothorax.

638
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:50,059
Good sounds bilaterally. No tracheal shift.
- Charged.

639
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,635
Clear.

640
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,738
Put Ativan's in. He
might not need these.

641
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,438
Send a tech to get
a 28 French button.

642
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,010
We'll put in a Foley
to keep the tract open.

643
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,477
- Shouldn't I register him first?
- Don't bother.

644
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,947
I'm just gonna put the
G-tube in and get him home.

645
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,781
What are you looking at him for? He's
a third-year resident, I'm an Attending.

646
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,685
I said he doesn't
need to be registered.

647
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,953
I'll be back.

648
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,425
He should be in a nursing home.

649
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,201
- I'd never do that to him.
- At least you shouldn't have to do this.

650
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,304
- Call GI.
- Watch his hand.

651
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,702
- He may react when I put in the Foley.
- Jing-Mei.

652
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,043
Papa.

653
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,338
Papa!

654
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,047
- Still in fib.
- Charge to 360.

655
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,345
I heard she vomited.
You think she aspirated?

656
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,215
Clear.

657
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:48,015
- Fine V-fib. Possibly.
- Try 360 again.

658
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,223
You shouldn't arrest
from aspiration.

659
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,525
The balloon on her
crike must have burst.

660
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,492
It happens.

661
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,001
Clear.

662
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,971
- Asystole.
- How long have you been at it?

663
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,404
Thirty-nine minutes.

664
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,340
- What about a dopamine drip?
- No.

665
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,640
Hold compressions.

666
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,174
Get a strip. We're done.

667
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,483
I'll clean her up.

668
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,866
She's a coroner's case.

669
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,738
Yeah, I know.

670
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,912
When they do the autopsy,
they'll see the balloon didn't burst.

671
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,594
No.

672
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,159
They'll see that it did.

673
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,496
So is she gonna keep the baby?

674
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,258
Well, we finally
got her to hold him.

675
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,426
One miracle at a time.

676
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,029
Look, I just came
up to apologize.

677
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:23,046
A few months ago, the
woman that I'd been with...

678
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,443
- we lost a baby.
- I heard.

679
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,810
You getting some help with that?

680
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,982
I'm working on it.

681
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,124
Good night.

682
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,478
I thought they would
have taken her by now.

683
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,813
Morgue's backed up.

684
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,916
Coroner's backed up.
Same old, same old.

685
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,520
I thought you were with
that intussusception kid.

686
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,722
Pedes surgery took
him up to the O.R.

687
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,234
Sam, you don't need to do this.

688
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,206
I know.

689
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,608
- There are other nurses.
- I know.

690
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,014
Sam.

691
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,218
I shouldn't have done it.

692
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:46,689
The contusions were severe.
She could have died anyway.

693
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,426
I shouldn't have done it, Luka.

694
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,332
You did what you did
to help the patient, Sam.

695
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,374
Sam?

696
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:07,642
When I deflated that balloon,
Louise was still so traumatized.

697
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,821
He kept asking her
these questions...

698
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,985
and the only thing that
she could remember was:

699
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,629
"White guy, dark hair."

700
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,614
I did what I did for
"white guy, dark hair."

701
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,875
Come here.
