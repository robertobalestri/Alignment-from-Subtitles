00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,437
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,646
Okay.

3
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,010
- Dr. Lockhart. Mr. Scanlon.
- Kerry.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,148
I'm mixing up some Ancef.

5
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,946
I'm just gathering
up supplies...

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,040
Dubenko's working him pretty hard,
and my place is closer to the hospital.

7
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,352
So sleeping over is
basically a convenience.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,337
I'm not into research. I
don't care about publishing.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,058
You should. You'll be looking
for a job in a couple years.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,096
You'll look back and
wish you'd stepped up.

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,098
How do you stand it?

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,868
- What?
- The responsibility.

13
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,805
- Whoa! Slow down, buddy.
- Sorry, ma'am.

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,106
Wait for me!

15
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,250
Did he just call me "ma'am"?

16
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,511
- Yeah.
- Because technically, I'm a "miss."

17
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,621
Maybe you project maturity.

18
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,188
Meaning I look old?

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,449
No, you look beautiful.

20
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,355
You look beautiful
and not a day over 16.

21
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,089
Seriously, if you didn't know me,
would you think that I had a fifth grader?

22
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,960
No, no.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,925
I could see you with a toddler.

24
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,763
Oh, God.

25
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:13,499
Sleep deprivation,
diapers, teething.

26
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,802
Been there, done that.

27
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,538
Is that something you
think you might want again?

28
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,274
Kids?

29
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,016
You?

30
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,948
I don't know. I can't really
imagine myself with an infant again.

31
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,508
- Lucas, take it for five minutes.
- I hate you.

32
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,972
Then Christopher can have it
for five minutes. Callie! Callie!

33
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,336
- I got it!
- Will somebody...? Will you take that?

34
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,349
- Yes. Hello? CHRISTOPHER:
He won't let me have it!

35
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,733
- You get it for five...
- Hi.

36
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,900
- And then Christopher for five.
- Mom. Mom.

37
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,978
- What?
- Can I go to Stacy's house?

38
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,169
No. One of you...

39
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,667
- Take the dog out.
- She said no.

40
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,479
- She can be such a bitch.
- Here's your father. Come on. Come on.

41
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,644
- We gotta go.
- My dad's here. I gotta go. Bye.

42
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,256
Here we go. Here
we go. Take your coat.

43
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,085
Okay? You got? You got?

44
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,988
- Here, Mom.
- You got your trumpet?

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,720
All right. Don't try and
sweet-talk your dad, okay?

46
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,092
The answer is no.
Please close the door!

47
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,063
Thank you! Have fun!

48
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,230
Hello? WOMAN: <i>Hey, it's Pam.</i>

49
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,398
Hi, Pam.

50
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,740
Can I call you right
back? Five minutes?

51
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,881
- Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

52
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,133
<i>You know, I'm... I'm
really feeling okay now.</i>

53
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,738
<i>- I... I just got a little dizzy.</i>
- Pulse ox, 99 on 2 liters!

54
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,875
<i>- I just got a little dizzy is all.</i>
- Got another call.

55
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,601
Lower Wacker, MVC.

56
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,712
- Lucky us. ELLIE: <i>I
think I'm gonna be okay...</i>

57
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,939
<i>so if you could just
take me back home.</i>

58
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,606
<i>I really appreciate
your coming...</i>

59
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,912
<i>and everything you've...</i>

60
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,554
<i>Sir?</i>

61
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,745
<i>Sir?</i>

62
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,250
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.

63
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,586
<i>- Hello.</i>
- What happened?

64
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,455
<i>I... I don't know.
I got a little dizzy.</i>

65
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,063
<i>- I had too much coffee or...</i>
- Aphasia and hemiparesis.

66
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,926
<i>Or maybe some
kind of anxiety attack.</i>

67
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,624
<i>- I... I...</i>
- A little young for CVA.

68
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,894
Is she hypertensive?

69
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,062
<i>- My dad actually had high blood
pressure.</i> DUMAR: Last BP, 128 over 76.

70
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,398
<i>I don't.</i> ABBY: What's open?

71
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,771
- Trauma 1.
- Ma'am, can you tell us your name?

72
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,467
<i>Yes. Ellie.</i>

73
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,579
- Sorry?
<i>- My name is Ellie Shore.</i>

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,805
What did she say?

75
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,530
See you later, Ray!

76
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,791
- You heading in?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,162
All right, all right.
Okay. Wait up, guys.

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,462
I'll give you a ride.

79
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,629
I'm working tonight anyway.

80
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,035
We were trying
for opposite shifts.

81
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,036
I had to make a switch. We
have a gig on Saturday. I'm sorry.

82
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,547
Is it okay with you if
the guys stay here?

83
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,681
Cool.

84
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,687
Hi.

85
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,884
You... You play anything?

86
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,789
The viola.

87
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,699
<i>That's kind of
bright in my eyes.</i>

88
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,206
<i>- There's nothing wrong.</i>
- Pupils, equal and reactive.

89
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,005
<i>- Nobody is listening to me. Am I slurring?</i>
- Normal sinus on the monitor.

90
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,410
<i>- Is something wrong with my tongue?</i>
- Facial droop.

91
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,744
<i>It does feel kind of numb.</i>

92
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,819
<i>- Maybe I'm not talking loud
enough.</i> SAM: She's not hypoglycemic.

93
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,751
- Normal rhythm, no murmur.
<i>- Excuse me!</i>

94
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,414
<i>Where am I?</i>

95
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,896
Ma'am, you're at a county hospital.
We're gonna take care of you.

96
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,090
<i>- County? Great.</i>
- Can you squeeze my hand?

97
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,703
<i>Yeah. Look, I don't know what that
paramedic guy told you, but I'm fine.</i>

98
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,602
- Good grip.
<i>- So you can just stop doing all this...</i>

99
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,174
<i>and just let me up
and call me a cab...</i>

100
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,745
<i>- and I'll be on my way.</i> KOVAC:
Now squeeze with your right.

101
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,276
<i>What did you just do?</i>

102
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,613
- As hard as you can, squeeze.
<i>- I ca...</i>

103
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,617
Anything?

104
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,221
<i>I ca...</i>

105
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,120
<i>Was that my arm?</i>

106
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,955
<i>- I didn't feel it or anything.</i>
- Absent DTRs on the right.

107
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,461
<i>What's wrong with my arm?</i>

108
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,759
<i>- What's wrong with my
arm?</i> ABBY: Positive Babinski.

109
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,459
<i>Oh, God! Where's
my leg? My foot!</i>

110
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,605
<i>Why can't I feel my...?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

111
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,536
<i>- Miss! What are you...? Wait!</i>
- Call Neuro and let's get a CT.

112
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,300
<i>What are you...?
Those are my pants.</i>

113
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,967
<i>Miss, please?</i>

114
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,704
<i>Not my underwear!
I'm not... Try to...</i>

115
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,475
<i>- I'm not staying!</i>
- Just try to relax, okay?

116
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,623
Ma'am, I'm gonna put a
catheter into your bladder.

117
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,588
There might be some
discomfort as it passes, okay?

118
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,499
You do this every day off?

119
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,828
Usually it's a 10K.

120
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,993
Oh, so you're cutting
me some slack, right?

121
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,162
Just keeping it fun.
You need to stop?

122
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,136
No, I got another mile in me.

123
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,243
How about a water break?

124
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,475
- Want some?
- No, I'm good.

125
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,651
You know it's been three months?

126
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,881
Oh, yeah? Since what?

127
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,019
What do you want to
do for dinner tonight?

128
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,595
I don't know. I don't feel
much like going out. You?

129
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,197
Not really.

130
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,625
Race to the fountain?

131
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,531
Winner cooks, loser cleans?

132
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,762
You're on.

133
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,996
Ready, set...

134
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,401
- Hey.
- What?

135
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,110
- Happy three-month anniversary.
- Hey!

136
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,473
Dr. Pratt, my MVC
couple is ready to go home.

137
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,948
Husband's got a broken
foot. Wife's eye is patched.

138
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,178
Their car's totaled.
Get them a taxi voucher.

139
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,017
- Where do I turn in my PPD results?
- Employee Health.

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,786
Dr. Pratt, do you have any dating tips
for someone on a med student's budget?

141
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,053
Yeah, don't bother.

142
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,527
No, it's incredibly
flattering. That'd be great.

143
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,632
I'll let you know
who'll be attending.

144
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,665
Okay. Thank you very much.

145
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,030
Good news?

146
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,866
We're being honored at the
Trauma Foundation dinner.

147
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,063
Nice.

148
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,075
Yeah, they're looking for an
outstanding senior resident to accept.

149
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,405
So why tell me?

150
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,208
Pratt, don't fish for compliments.
It doesn't become you.

151
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,406
Eight p.m. on the 16th.

152
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,747
Seven-minute PowerPoint
presentation with slides and video.

153
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:43,048
- Cozying up with management again?
- Not in this lifetime.

154
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,421
A bunch of us are meeting later to
celebrate Weaver going on vacation.

155
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,324
- If third years are buying, I'm in.
- Well drinks only.

156
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,364
Figure it'll help shore up
support for my chief-resident bid.

157
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,761
Neela, what do you say?

158
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,596
- Well, it beats going home.
- Is something wrong with home?

159
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,238
Come on. We laugh, we bond.

160
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,897
We do a little team building
with our ducklings here.

161
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,770
- Sure.
- All right.

162
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,205
Woo-hoo. Party on.

163
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,710
What? The big
kids aren't invited?

164
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,042
<i>It's like my lips are moving,
but nothing's coming out.</i>

165
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,119
<i>- I don't feel sick. I don't feel anything.</i>
- No carotid bruits.

166
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,085
<i>- I feel something.</i>
- Platelets are good.

167
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,623
- PT, PTT's normal.
- What do you think it is?

168
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,023
<i>- This is bad.</i>
- Onset of symptoms is too quick...

169
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,722
- for a tumor. Aneurysm or AVM?
<i>- I'm healthy. I have three kids. I'm 35.</i>

170
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,232
- Could be a hypercoagulable state.
<i>- The kids. Oh, my God.</i>

171
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,700
<i>- The kids!</i>
- CT's backed up. Neuro's on the way.

172
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,136
- We have a name on her yet?
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

173
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,535
- Ellie.
<i>- I've gotta...</i>

174
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,801
- Close your eyes for a second.
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

175
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,208
<i>I have to tell you something.
Somebody's got to pick up my kids.</i>

176
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,908
- Orbicularis oculi deficit.
<i>- Call my husband and have him do it.</i>

177
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,985
- Think it's embolic?
- More than likely...

178
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,620
- to the proximal MCA.
<i>- Okay?</i>

179
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,312
<i>Please?</i>

180
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,149
I think she wants
to write something.

181
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,806
Go ahead and let her try.

182
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,452
So TPA could reverse it.

183
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,996
If there's no bleed and
we're within three hours.

184
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,634
But no one knows how
long she's been down.

185
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,997
Ellie, can you hear me?

186
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,571
<i>Yes, yes, yes. I can hear
you. His name is Dan.</i>

187
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,674
<i>- This is his number.</i>
- You had a stroke.

188
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,470
<i>Tell him he needs
to take the kids.</i>

189
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,669
It's impossible to
express language.

190
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,283
So while you might be
able to understand us...

191
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:22,053
we definitely won't be
able to understand you.

192
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,688
<i>That's not what I wrote.</i>

193
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,425
<i>- What did you do?</i> ABBY:
Neuro's not coming without a CT.

194
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,926
<i>That's not what I wrote!</i>

195
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,860
We're trying to figure out
what type of stroke you had...

196
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,125
- so that we can treat it.
<i>- I had a stroke?</i>

197
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,428
See if you can track
down any family members.

198
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,265
<i>That's impossible.</i>

199
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,771
<i>Old people get strokes. I
mean, whatever this is...</i>

200
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,841
<i>it's just temporary.</i>

201
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,208
<i>It has to be.</i>

202
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,544
- Hey.
- Hi, what's up?

203
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,346
Uh, I'm just down
on a surgical consult.

204
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,479
Did I, by any chance,
leave a watch at your place?

205
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,056
Yeah, it's in my locker.

206
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,659
Abby, do you still need that
cath UA on Mrs. Russell?

207
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,955
No. Clean catch. Negative dip.

208
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,234
Uh, I brought in some
lunch if maybe you'd wanna...

209
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,393
meet up in the break room.
- Actually...

210
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,731
I was thinking that
maybe we shouldn't be...

211
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,603
quite so together here.

212
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,043
- I thought everybody knows.
- I didn't tell anybody.

213
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,914
Except maybe one person. You?

214
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,814
- No.
- So, good.

215
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,386
Your sofa getting
much action these days?

216
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,752
- Uh, what?
- Living with Ray is... How can I put it?

217
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,518
Loud, messy and a bit crowded.

218
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,221
- I told you to take time moving out.
- It wasn't any better at your place.

219
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,588
Who's next?

220
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,256
Six-year-old with wrist pain.

221
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,529
Is there a Clayton Davis?

222
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,899
Over here.

223
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,871
- You Clayton?
- I'm Tucker, his big brother.

224
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,443
He's got a bump on
his head. Show her.

225
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,171
This hurts too.

226
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,009
How did all this
happen, Clayton?

227
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,707
He fell off the kitchen counter.

228
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,285
- And who are you?
- She's our sister, Bridget.

229
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,785
Whole family's here, huh?

230
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,423
My dad went to get some coffee.

231
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,058
I can take Clayton in for now.

232
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,093
But before he can be treated,
your father has to sign forms.

233
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,860
- I'll go find him.
- Okay.

234
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,130
So, young man, what were you
doing on top of the kitchen counter?

235
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,134
Reaching for a bowl.

236
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,795
We were hungry.

237
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,238
Let me find out where to go.

238
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,070
Hi. My neighbor was
brought here earlier.

239
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,445
I have her kids with me.
Her name is Ellie Shore.

240
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,883
<i>Okay, okay. If by some
chance this is a stroke...</i>

241
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,716
<i>it's minor. It has to be.
I can think. I can hear.</i>

242
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,380
<i>- I can feel.</i>
- CT's ready for her.

243
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,493
Put on a monitor.
Suction the secretion.

244
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,494
<i>Am I drooling? Yeah,
I am. I'm drooling.</i>

245
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,331
- This'll make you more comfortable.
<i>- She's smiling.</i>

246
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,164
<i>Maybe that means it's not so bad.
She's a nurse. Maybe she doesn't know.</i>

247
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,932
Okay, Ellie, I'm gonna
look in your mouth. All right?

248
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,667
<i>She's a doctor. She's
not smiling as much.</i>

249
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,971
<i>Maybe she's just more serious.</i>

250
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,511
- No gag reflex.
<i>- Maybe not.</i>

251
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,775
- Muscles are weak on the right.
<i>- Now this one. He is gorgeous.</i>

252
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,511
<i>- What is he? Six-four, 6'5"?</i>
- Tube her to be safe?

253
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,349
Ellie, we're gonna have to
put a tube in your throat...

254
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,151
to protect your airway.

255
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,349
Can they come in?

256
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,961
- Okay, just for a minute.
- Ellie, your kids are here.

257
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,461
<i>They are?</i>

258
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,530
She can hear you
better if you stand there.

259
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,433
- Why?
- Because your mom is having trouble...

260
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,339
moving the right
side of her body.

261
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,104
<i>Hi, guys!</i>

262
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,373
<i>Don't be scared, okay?</i>

263
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,712
Is that why her face looks funny?
- <i>Ohh...</i>

264
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,353
Is she dying? KOVAC: No.

265
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,546
- No, she's not.
<i>- Honey, Mommy's not dying.</i>

266
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,224
<i>- She's gonna be fine.</i> KOVAC:
When did you see her last?

267
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,189
Um, right after
school. She was fine.

268
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,299
You should take them outside.

269
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,860
- Why is she doing that?
- Well, we just...

270
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,163
We need to help her
breathing. She'll be fine.

271
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,466
Come on. Let the doctors
take care of your mom.

272
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,268
- Let's go. Come on.
- Mommy.

273
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,577
- Push the etomidate and sux.
- You're going to sleep now.

274
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,410
When you wake up, you'll
be breathing with a ventilator.

275
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,854
<i>Oh, God.</i>

276
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,354
<i>Am I dead? Is this it?</i>

277
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,455
<i>Is this death?</i>

278
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,819
<i>No, something's wrong.</i>

279
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,695
<i>I can't open my
eyes. I can't move.</i>

280
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,660
<i>Somebody help me.</i>

281
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,806
There's no evidence of
hemorrhage, so it's probably a clot.

282
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,368
It's too late for TPA?

283
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,308
It can cause brain bleed if
it's done after three hours.

284
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,279
If her kids saw her
a few hours ago...

285
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,644
had a rig ride...

286
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,683
ER assessment...

287
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,446
It's too close to take a chance.

288
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,487
Well, what are
our other options?

289
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,285
Well, hope that collateral
flow can develop.

290
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,325
Get her into physical therapy.

291
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:59,728
With a major stroke like this, her chances
of a meaningful recovery aren't good.

292
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,327
The only other
option is the MERCI.

293
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,834
The what?

294
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,904
It's a catheter-retrieval
system.

295
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,336
It takes you into the
brain through an artery...

296
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,500
and allows you to
corkscrew the clot out.

297
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,508
And it reverses the
stroke completely?

298
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,139
It's not without risks.

299
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,809
<i>Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm blind!</i>

300
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,148
<i>I can't breathe! Help
me! Please, someone!</i>

301
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,686
<i>Please, someone!</i>

302
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,517
<i>- Do something, please!</i>
- On my count.

303
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,886
<i>- Someone! Can't anybody hear me?</i>
- One, two, three.

304
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,887
<i>Help me. Please, God. Help me!</i>

305
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,763
Hey, can I ask you,
um, a question?

306
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,369
Yeah.

307
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,939
Did you ever ask
Luka about his kids?

308
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:44,542
Uh, one time, I
think. Yeah. Why?

309
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,871
I don't know.

310
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,536
Sometimes I think...

311
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,538
Is she crying?

312
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,409
Heart rate's up to
130. BP's 170 over 92.

313
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,851
- We have to get her to the ER.
- What's going on?

314
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,722
- When did we tube her?
- About 10 minutes ago.

315
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,883
Ellie, it's all right.
We're gonna help you.

316
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,258
The etomidate wore off before the
sux. She's conscious but paralyzed.

317
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,865
- Okay, coming through!
- Whoa. What's the story?

318
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,401
- Non-violent demonstration got violent.
- Protestors went nuts downtown.

319
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,232
That kid the cop
beat up last week.

320
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,964
This one got tear
gas to the face.

321
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,904
I was just picking up my
grandma's medicine at the pharmacy.

322
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,410
Crush injury, second-degree burns,
multiple minor lacs coming in behind.

323
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,412
Mob torched cars,
broke a lot of glass?

324
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,210
Good vitals after
four of morphine.

325
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,318
I feel pretty bad.
Could I get some more?

326
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,388
Yeah. As soon as we make
sure you're actually hurting, dude.

327
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,217
Did he just withhold pain meds?

328
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,825
I think it's safe to remove
him from our shortlist.

329
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,985
Too late. He's
officially applied.

330
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,164
- What about Nichol?
- Talks too much.

331
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,766
- Pattengill?
- I don't know. Skilled but aloof.

332
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,301
We're in trouble. The pickings for
next year's chief resident are slim.

333
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,269
- We're gonna have to look elsewhere.
- What about Pratt?

334
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,965
Susan, he's the best we've got.

335
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,939
With some serious caveats.

336
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,604
Med students and interns already
go to him with their questions.

337
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,439
Doesn't make him a leader.

338
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,344
<i>- Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>
- Need some help here.

339
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,183
She's tachycardic
and hypertensive.

340
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,450
- Sedative wore off before the paralytic.
<i>- Help!</i>

341
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,786
Get her to curtain two.

342
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,121
<i>- What...? What are they saying?</i>
- She's panicking.

343
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,662
<i>- Help! Help me.</i>
- I don't want to snow her too much.

344
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,596
- We need to follow serial neural exams.
<i>- Help me. Why...?</i>

345
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,601
<i>Help me! Why isn't
anybody doing anything?</i>

346
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,296
<i>- I swear to God, I'm losing it!</i>
- Fent's on board.

347
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,272
<i>- I swear to God, I'm losing it!</i>
- Ellie, it's okay.

348
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,105
What you are feeling
is a normal side effect.

349
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,145
We gave you a
narcotic called fentanyl...

350
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,613
- that'll help ease your discomfort.
<i>- Ohh...</i>

351
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,480
It'll make you dizzy at
first, but it'll help calm you.

352
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,985
- Okay?
<i>- Wow. What is that stuff?</i>

353
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,318
When the medication wears off,
you'll be able to open your eyes again.

354
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,982
<i>Because it is good.</i>

355
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,320
<i>Really good.</i>

356
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,187
Dr. Lockhart, a
moment of your time?

357
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,195
It's okay. We got this.

358
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,698
Neuro checks q. 10 minutes.

359
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,996
Do you remember our
abdominal wound yesterday?

360
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,332
- Guess what we found during surgery.
- Liver lac?

361
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,997
- Guess again.
- Spleen?

362
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,370
Condom full of cocaine,
lodged in the jejunum.

363
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,513
Knife nicked the bag, releasing
coke into the peritoneum.

364
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,582
- Explains the sympathetic overdrive.
- Totally fantastic case.

365
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,012
If you write it up today...

366
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,710
there's a chance to get it
into next month's issues.

367
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,219
If <i>Trauma</i> doesn't bite...

368
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,687
<i>- Annals of Emergency Medicine.</i>
- You want me to?

369
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,088
Us. I'll help you. It'll
only take a couple hours.

370
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,592
- I'm... I'm working.
- I'll talk to your superior.

371
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,061
They're prepping my
thyroidectomy. Gotta go.

372
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,929
- I'm sorry, but...
- What intern doesn't want to publish?

373
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,698
- Of course, I want to get published...
- Then it'd be idiotic to pass this up.

374
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,204
- Right.
- Okay.

375
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,309
My office at 7.

376
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,039
Your distal radius
and ulna are fine.

377
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,843
What's that mean?

378
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,714
- I don't think his wrist is broken.
- Oh.

379
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,878
You still hungry, Clayton?

380
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,553
We never ate.

381
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,552
We were making
dinner when he fell.

382
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,393
So you were both helping out,
were you? How very grown-up.

383
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,429
Hey, this is my dad.

384
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,396
- Hey.
- Hey, how's he doing?

385
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,728
How's he doing?

386
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,564
His neuro exam is normal.

387
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,263
Looks like a mild concussion.

388
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,931
He'll need observation at
home over the next 24 hours.

389
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,571
The wrist is probably
just sprained...

390
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,579
but we'll get an
x-ray just to be sure.

391
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,114
Well, whatever you need to do.

392
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,416
Have you been
drinking, Mr. Davis?

393
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,419
I had a beer.

394
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,423
I'll arrange for the
children to get food trays...

395
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,562
while we're waiting
on Radiology.

396
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,926
- Thanks.
- Okay.

397
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,163
Dr. Pratt, I have a case involving
a 6-year-old with a sprained wrist.

398
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,997
- Father appears to have been drinking.
- Present to Morris.

399
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,300
- I'd rather present to you.
- I've got six med students in my face...

400
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,070
every time I turn around. I'm
not the only third year on the floor.

401
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,751
<i>Left side still works. Sort of.</i>

402
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,287
<i>That's a good sign.</i>

403
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,320
<i>Try to write again.</i>

404
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,948
<i>Come on.</i>

405
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,928
<i>Move. Do it.</i>

406
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,795
<i>Come on. Move.</i>

407
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,159
<i>- Twitch, jerk, anything.</i>
- Your heart rate's down.

408
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,664
Fentanyl must agree with you.

409
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,493
<i>Damn it!</i>

410
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,637
- You okay in there?
<i>- The tube in my throat hurts.</i>

411
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,972
<i>I can't pee by
myself. Can't walk.</i>

412
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,808
Yeah, you got
some gorgeous kids.

413
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,843
<i>- Is she talking to me?</i>
- I cannot believe you've had three.

414
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,989
- You look great.
<i>- Okay, you've seen my stretch mark.</i>

415
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,148
<i>- You're not talking to me.</i>
- They're in our family room right now.

416
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,988
- They're hanging in there, okay?
<i>- Can't they wait here?</i>

417
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,687
<i>I mean, who's... Who's
watching? Have they eaten?</i>

418
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,924
<i>Has their father come yet?</i>

419
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,692
<i>Dear God, what is that?</i>

420
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,667
Yes. Pretty stinky, huh?

421
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,468
Ah. Welcome to my
world. I'll be right back.

422
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,809
Hey, Mrs. Lacy.
How are you doing?

423
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,875
Okay, let's put this up.

424
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,748
Watch your leg.

425
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:01,426
And let's get you out
of this thing, okay?

426
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,358
There you go.

427
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,422
Must have been 500 people there.

428
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,593
Add police presence, throw a bottle.
All of a sudden there's looting going on.

429
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,501
Not me. What are the odds
I'd have gotten hit, you know?

430
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,506
Eyes are pretty irritated.
Can you follow my finger?

431
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,039
That tear gas is
some nasty stuff.

432
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,071
Did you get a TV
out of the deal?

433
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,508
I told you, I was just
walking by. All right?

434
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,213
Extraocular movements intact.

435
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,352
Running errands for
granny during a riot.

436
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,514
- No septal hematoma.
- You don't believe me?

437
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,094
Put it this way, dude. We've
heard it all before. Right, Chuny?

438
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,721
Heart rate's down
to 90 after a liter.

439
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,232
All right. Keep him in PO. D5, half
of 125. Let's get Plastics down here.

440
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,563
We're gonna do a CAT
scan to define your injury.

441
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,535
Then we'll send
you to OR for repair.

442
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,037
Okay, thanks.

443
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,908
That guy's full of crap.

444
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,742
Don't sweat it. I couldn't spot the
con artists until my second year.

445
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,427
<i>I don't know the rest.</i>

446
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,793
Heart rate's still up. Did
you give her more fent yet?

447
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,434
<i>- Oh, yeah. More of that.</i>
- Not yet. Twenty-five mics?

448
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:16,933
- Yeah.
<i>- No wedding ring.</i>

449
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,571
Husband on his way. Can't
do anything without consent.

450
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,604
<i>Sexy accent too.
Wonder where he's from.</i>

451
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,743
Neighbor tracked him
down. He's on his way.

452
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,573
- Feeling any better, Ellie?
<i>- What big strong hands you have.</i>

453
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,012
<i>It's pathetic. This guy touches
me, and my heart races.</i>

454
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,415
<i>- What am I, 14?</i>
- BP, 127 over 77.

455
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,124
<i>Actually, it's pounding now.</i>

456
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,652
<i>- Okay, this isn't so good.</i>
- Heart rate's 240.

457
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,457
<i>- What's happening?</i>
- Looks like SVT. Get the crash cart.

458
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,430
She's hemodynamically stable.
Try meds. Six of adenosine.

459
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:52,129
<i>- I'm getting dizzy. It's hard to
breathe.</i> SAM: Is it related to her stroke?

460
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,536
No. If her atrium doesn't beat
properly, there can be pooling of blood.

461
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,109
- She threw a clot, it went to her brain?
- Yeah.

462
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:01,145
<i>I can't take this.</i>

463
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,815
Adenosine pushed at
18:57. ELLIE: <i>Ow! Aah!</i>

464
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,454
Ellie, this is gonna
slow your heart down.

465
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,557
You may feel discomfort. But
only for a few seconds, okay?

466
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,283
<i>Oh, God!</i>

467
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,537
- What's happening?
- Are you her husband?

468
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,144
- Yes.
- Back on SVT.

469
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,474
Right now she's in an abnormal
heart rhythm. We're trying to fix it.

470
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,710
We believe something similar
may have happened before.

471
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,445
It would've allowed a clot
to form, move to her brain...

472
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,284
- causing the stroke.
- She had a stroke?

473
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,392
I need the rhythm strip.

474
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,432
- Double the dosage?
- Wait. It's atrial flutter.

475
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,830
Two-to-one block.
Adenosine won't convert that.

476
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,402
Twenty milligrams Diltiazem?
- Slow IV push.

477
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,163
Can you tell me
what's happening?

478
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,308
Ellie, I'm so sorry. I
know this was painful...

479
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,843
but this drug allowed us to
figure out your heart problem.

480
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,972
Now we can give you the proper
medication. This one won't hurt, okay?

481
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,619
- Is she awake?
- We can't be sure.

482
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,652
But she has had
spontaneous eye movement.

483
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,517
Sinus rhythm at 76.

484
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,820
It's okay. You can come closer.

485
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,189
Honey?

486
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,363
Ellie, can you hear me?
- <i>You're here.</i>

487
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,936
Sir?

488
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,202
<i>No, don't cry.</i>

489
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,033
<i>No, no.</i>

490
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,871
There's a procedure we want
to try called clot extraction.

491
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,103
<i>Dan?</i>

492
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,145
A catheter is inserted
into the groin...

493
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,011
- and threaded up in the brain.
- The clot's identified...

494
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,813
- then a retrieval system pulls it out.
- How you doing?

495
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,979
If it works, the stroke
can be reversed.

496
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,179
If it doesn't?

497
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,555
There are certain risks involved.
Infection and complications...

498
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,720
- that may lead to coma or death.
- Your heart's back to normal.

499
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,865
So she's not in a coma now?
- No, no.

500
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,399
The stroke affected the
language center of her brain.

501
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,629
So she can see and hear,
but she cannot communicate.

502
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,731
Do you want us to go
ahead with the procedure?

503
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,342
<i>- Say yes.</i> DAN: What
happens if we don't do it?

504
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,073
Well, her heart condition is treated,
but she won't improve neurologically.

505
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,911
- But she won't die.
<i>- No, Dan. Listen to what he's saying.</i>

506
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,575
<i>This other thing might fix me.</i>

507
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,755
- How long can she live like this?
<i>- I can't live this way.</i>

508
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,585
Indefinitely.

509
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,224
I...

510
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,989
I don't know what to do.

511
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,497
<i>You do. Remember when
we talked about your cousin?</i>

512
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,568
<i>The one in the wreck? I said
I'd rather die than live that way?</i>

513
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,262
- She's not a vegetable, right?
<i>- This is worse, Dan!</i>

514
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,566
<i>I'm aware! I don't
get to be brain-dead!</i>

515
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,007
- We can't do this without your consent.
<i>- What about my consent?</i>

516
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:49,205
<i>I consent, damn it!
I consent! I consent!</i>

517
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,374
- Is that what's best?
<i>- Dan, have some balls.</i>

518
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,113
<i>- If you love me, don't leave me like this.</i>
- There's a chance she'll come out.

519
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,190
<i>Please, this once, hear me.</i>

520
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,020
Oh, my God.

521
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,357
Ellie? Ellie?

522
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:08,024
<i>Give consent, please.</i>

523
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,128
Okay.

524
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,236
Mmm.

525
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,313
Mr. Davis?

526
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,506
- Sir?
- Yeah?

527
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,817
Clayton's on his
way back from X-ray.

528
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,990
You'll be glad to know there
doesn't appear to be a fracture.

529
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,249
That's good.

530
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,617
What I'd like to do is
splint Clayton's wrist...

531
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,764
and have you bring him back
in a week to get rechecked.

532
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,456
Oh, all right.

533
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,231
- Where are the children?
- I had to take Bridget to the bathroom.

534
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,571
So we about done here?

535
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,302
Yes. I've already written Clayton's
discharge orders. Did you drive?

536
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,642
- You might want to bring the car around.
- No, we took the el.

537
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,774
I can give you a taxi
voucher if you'd like.

538
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,749
Yeah, taxi!

539
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,046
Sure.

540
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:07,349
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

541
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,022
Morris? MORRIS: What up?

542
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,190
Six-year-old, negative x-ray,
point tenderness at the scaphoid...

543
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,495
splinted, RICE,
follow-up in a week.

544
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,693
Say no more.

545
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,141
There seems to be a
strange family dynamic.

546
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,334
What? You talking
physical or sexual abuse?

547
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:30,006
Neither. I'm not sure, actually. What I
do know is that the father has had a beer.

548
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,310
Uh, breaking news:
Having a brew isn't a crime.

549
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,885
We got a board full
of real patients, Neela.

550
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,617
- Ever been up to Neuroradiology before?
- Nope.

551
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:43,287
- Medford seems like a solid doc.
- I hear he's the best.

552
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,727
I hear he's screwing
a med student.

553
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,063
Excuse me. Which
suite for Dr. Medford?

554
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,693
- Room A. Down the hall on your right.
- Thank you.

555
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,668
- Ellie Shore.
- Doctor's on his way.

556
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,815
Ellie, we have to go back
downstairs now, okay?

557
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,247
<i>- Wait. You're leaving?</i>
- Dr. Medford's team...

558
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,580
- is gonna take good care of you.
<i>- But I...</i>

559
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,723
<i>- I don't know these
people.</i> MEDFORD: Ellie?

560
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,881
<i>- They're strangers.</i>
- I'm Dr. Medford.

561
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,027
We're going to clean
the top of your leg...

562
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,186
at the site where
the catheter will pass.

563
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,093
And I'm Martha. I'll be
shaving part of your pubic hair.

564
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,824
<i>Fantastic.</i>

565
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:34,072
- Hi.
- Oh, there you are. Come on in.

566
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,774
Uh, I pulled the chart.

567
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,675
Good.

568
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,184
Um, do you like burgers?

569
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,554
I thought we could
do this over food.

570
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,694
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

571
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,464
- Yeah. Here. Put this on.
- Well, um...

572
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,964
- There's a good place down the street.
- I'm not actually that hungry.

573
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,034
That looks good on you.

574
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,104
Okay? Shall we?

575
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,797
Okay.

576
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:10,143
- We any closer?
- Uh, I'd say...

577
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:14,582
- Another couple of hours?
- Yeah. Well...

578
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,617
we can start with the first
course, skip to the last...

579
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,690
finish with the main.

580
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,888
Or we could just order.

581
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:28,494
- Chicago. The number for Tiny's Pizza.
- Okay, now, that's spooky.

582
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,431
What do you think? Large
pepperoni and mushroom?

583
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,666
I think I love you.

584
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:40,176
I would like to place an
order for delivery, please.

585
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,836
Brat.

586
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,282
Any nerve damage? - Nope.

587
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,680
Wound's been copiously
irrigated, Ancef on board...

588
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,822
Plastics and OMF both consulted,
waiting on an OR to open up.

589
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:53,015
- Good deal.
- This is Irene, Kevin's grandmother.

590
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,751
She's a diabetic. She needed
her insulin this afternoon.

591
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,989
My grandson's a good boy. Why
you got to accuse him of stealing TVs?

592
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,761
- Excuse me?
- He's not a thief. He goes to college.

593
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,337
- I was kidding, Pratt.
- No, man, you weren't kidding.

594
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,800
Whatever, dude. I'm
sorry if you took offense.

595
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,639
Morris, get in here.

596
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,986
- Yeah?
- What the hell was that all about?

597
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,061
He was part of a mob that
was gassed by the cops...

598
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,731
after breaking into a
bunch of storefronts.

599
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,389
You accused that kid of looting?

600
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,831
It ain't a stretch. Guys
come in all the time...

601
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,904
with stories about sick
grannies. Half the time, it's bogus.

602
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,541
You can't make assumptions
about every black kid here.

603
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:46,201
- This coming from you, huh?
- Yes, this coming from me!

604
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,813
Now I want you to go and
apologize to those people...

605
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,380
- like you mean it.
- What?

606
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,518
Just do it.

607
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,746
Well done.

608
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,851
Yeah, well, guy's
an idiot. Anyway.

609
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,691
Hey, Pratt. Carter and
Kovac think you should apply...

610
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,732
- for the chief-residency position.
- What about you?

611
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,060
If I see more of what I just saw, I
could be persuaded. Are you interested?

612
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,865
Thank you.

613
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,509
But no.

614
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,370
She had what's called
an embolic stroke.

615
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,573
It's something that
can happen to anyone.

616
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,948
- Even kids?
- Usually not kids.

617
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,118
She's in Neuroradiology now.

618
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,188
So she, like, stays
this way forever?

619
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,717
Maybe, but she could also
recover. Be just fine again.

620
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,556
Can you fix her or not?

621
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,527
We're gonna try.

622
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,600
But for now, just... Just
be here for each other.

623
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,397
Send her your love and
good thoughts, okay?

624
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:50,409
I called my mom a bitch today.

625
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,608
I'm sure she knows
you didn't mean that.

626
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,214
- Is she all by herself?
- No, no.

627
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:02,218
I'm gonna actually go now
and check on her. Okay?

628
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:07,092
<i>Lucas was 8 pounds, 4 ounces.</i>

629
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,491
<i>Christopher, 9 pounds, 1 ounce.</i>

630
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,598
<i>This is good. Stay focused.
Stay alert, and I'll stay connected.</i>

631
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,234
Gonna be a little burning
at the top of your leg.

632
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,835
<i>Ow.</i>

633
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,006
How's she doing?

634
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,996
- Putting guide ports
in the femoral artery.

635
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,575
<i>- Erin, 9 pounds, 1 1 ounces.</i>
- Nineteen-gauge single-wall needle.

636
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,110
<i>Haven't been the same since.</i>

637
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,174
<i>Wonder if they can do a
tummy tuck while they're at it.</i>

638
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,511
Thought you might want
to see a familiar face.

639
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,983
<i>Hey.</i>

640
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:39,591
Okay, so I was thinking I would
start by maybe gathering some data...

641
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,852
- on body stuffing...
- Two mineral waters...

642
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:44,496
- and a couple of burgers? Medium okay?
- Sure. Sure.

643
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:48,259
Yeah, two medium burgers
and we'll share a basket of fries.

644
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,901
You got it.

645
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,030
Thank you.

646
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,800
- Are... Are you from here originally?
- Pardon me?

647
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,536
I don't know. I detected a hint
of Minnesotan in your accent.

648
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,943
Uh, yes. Yeah, I mostly
grew up in Saint Paul...

649
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:07,142
but I've lived all over the place.
Anyway, in terms of the paper...

650
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,652
Introduction, case
summary, discussion.

651
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,653
That's all there is to it.

652
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,217
Do you...? Do you
like foreign films?

653
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,334
<i>Something's in me.
Actually in my brain right now.</i>

654
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,664
<i>Feels funny. Kind of hollow.</i>

655
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,035
Ellie, we're gonna take some
pictures of arteries in your brain. Okay?

656
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,075
<i>- Lonely.</i>
- Catheter is in the internal carotid.

657
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,078
- Let's go for it.
- Injecting the dye.

658
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,675
Should be a defect in the MCA.

659
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,216
<i>God, I'm bored.</i>

660
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,348
- That the occlusion?
- M-one.

661
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,927
- Proximal middle cerebral artery.
- Yeah, completely blocked by the clot.

662
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,360
<i>Maybe I'm tired
of talking to myself.</i>

663
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,830
Ellie, the clot's where
we thought it was.

664
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,401
- It prevents flow to the brain...
<i>- Maybe just let go.</i>

665
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:03,099
- Controlling language, motor function.
<i>- Maybe just let go.</i>

666
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,649
- So, what time do you wanna get up?
- Six.

667
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,555
How about 5, and
we work in a run?

668
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,896
You're relentless.

669
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,794
Just committed.

670
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,569
- Good night.
- Good night.

671
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,378
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

672
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,353
Morris is applying
for chief resident.

673
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,551
He is an unethical, talentless
dolt surrounded by sycophants.

674
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,561
Well, maybe he should forget
resident and run for president.

675
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,722
- Pratt should get the job.
- Need any coffee?

676
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,026
Mr. Davis?

677
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,726
Where are your children?
I didn't see them outside.

678
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,963
Mr. Davis, wait.

679
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,902
You're supposed
to be with your kids.

680
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,703
Clayton's got a concussion.
He needs to be monitored.

681
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,573
- Hey, wait up, man.
- You need to stay with Clayton tonight.

682
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,874
I ain't got no kids.

683
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,212
The oldest one gave me 7
bucks and told me to pretend.

684
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,785
- That's all.
- Pretend what?

685
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,879
That they was mine.

686
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,417
<i>Memories.</i>

687
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,757
<i>Blended.</i>

688
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:36,061
<i>Folding like water.</i>

689
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,231
<i>Lake.</i>

690
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,900
<i>That smell.</i>

691
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,375
<i>Sun block?</i>

692
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,740
<i>Jasmine.</i>

693
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,237
<i>Happy.</i>

694
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,178
<i>All of us.</i>

695
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:52,783
<i>Wet.</i>

696
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,579
<i>Kids.</i>

697
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,415
<i>Noisy.</i>

698
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,614
<i>Messy.</i>

699
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,622
<i>Love.</i>

700
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,588
<i>You.</i>

701
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:08,661
There are only two available social
workers tonight for six hospitals?

702
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,396
Well, can you try
a 911 page then?

703
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,640
Please. Neela Rasgotra,
County Hospital ER. Thank you.

704
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,367
If the kid had the smarts to
hire someone as his dad...

705
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,103
he's gonna be responsible
monitoring the concussion.

706
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,271
Yeah, but why would
he lie about his father?

707
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:27,442
Maybe his real folks aren't such prizes.
Maybe he didn't want them to know.

708
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,020
He filled out the form.
Think the address is correct?

709
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,625
- It's a real street. Crappy neighborhood.
- Phone's disconnected.

710
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,956
Twenty-two-years old, multiple
GSWs to the abdomen. BP, 90 palp.

711
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,528
Pulse ox, 97 on 10 liters.

712
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,029
- What's open?
- Trauma One.

713
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,326
Dr. Lewis? LEWIS: Ask Pratt.

714
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,226
- Dr. Pratt.
- Yeah?

715
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,065
Attendings are unavailable. I
need to leave. An emergency.

716
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,707
- Do I have permission to go?
- What kind of emergency?

717
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,469
Well, I had a patient
earlier, an entire family...

718
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,408
and I'm very
concerned about them.

719
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,175
There are no available social workers.
And all I have is an address on Duluth.

720
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,477
Well, we're pretty well
caught up here. So go.

721
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,212
But take Ray with you.
Duluth's a rough neighborhood.

722
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,226
Hello?

723
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,499
Oh, hi.

724
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,767
- Wait. What time is it there?
- Who is it?

725
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,462
I can barely hear you. Um...

726
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,069
Oh, you just got that?

727
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,701
Yeah, I thought you could
use some ceftriaxone.

728
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,078
Um...

729
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,342
Not much. Just working.

730
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,520
Where are you going?

731
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,019
See you at work. KEM:
<i>John? Are you there?</i>

732
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,191
Hey, can I call you right back?

733
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,294
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Who was it?

734
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:56,873
It was stupid, it was rude and
I'm sorry. Can we go back inside?

735
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,943
Is this a diversion for you until
she comes back to the States?

736
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,875
- It's freezing here.
- Go back inside.

737
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,777
Hey. I had a baby with her.
What am I supposed to do?

738
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,145
Cut her out of my life
because I'm with you?

739
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,547
Are you with me?

740
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,049
Can we just please
go back inside?

741
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,216
Don't... Come on,
don't walk away.

742
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,723
Okay. So that's it? One phone
call and you're gone, huh?

743
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,798
One phone call?

744
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,393
You were in bed with me.

745
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,264
You could've mentioned that
between "hi" and the weather.

746
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,904
We spend every night together.

747
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,973
We enjoy each other's
company. We have fun.

748
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:35,308
All right. I know what
you want me to say and...

749
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,079
And I can't say it, okay?

750
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,979
I'm sorry.

751
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,148
Well, at least you're honest.

752
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,789
- Look, it doesn't mean that we...
- Yeah, it does.

753
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,926
Wendall.

754
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,701
Fluoro on.

755
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,002
Torquing clockwise.

756
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,144
- Injecting.
- Cross your fingers.

757
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:12,477
One, two, three...

758
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,278
- Ten cc's in.
- Four.

759
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,978
- Think you got it?
- Pulling back.

760
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,792
- Got it.
- Beautiful.

761
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,297
Fully re-canulized.

762
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,197
No fragments in
the distal branches.

763
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,997
Wide open.

764
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,133
Wake up, Ellie.

765
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,571
Good tidal volume. Can
we get her off the vent?

766
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,007
I'm not sure. If we
extubate, it may be better...

767
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,374
to do it in the ER
just to be safe.

768
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,743
442. That's it.

769
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,218
Yeah.

770
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,400
- Who is it?
- Tucker, it's Dr. Rasgotra...

771
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,404
from the hospital.

772
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,912
Hey, buddy. Your folks around?

773
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,614
Get up, you guys.

774
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,183
Get up.

775
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,748
Come on. Get up.
They're gonna take us now.

776
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,447
- What for?
- Tucker.

777
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,353
Wake up, Clayton.

778
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,620
Remember? I told you they'd
split us up if they found out.

779
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,230
- Get your coats on.
- Tucker, where are your parents?

780
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,228
There's just my mom.

781
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,868
In there.

782
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,943
Hello?

783
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,909
Ms. Davis?

784
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,428
- Oh, God.
- Mm.

785
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,674
She got sick.

786
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,332
A week ago.

787
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:27,479
- Hey.
- Hey. Pull up a stool, guys.

788
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,087
- How come no one's here yet?
- Come on. I'm someone.

789
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,917
Come on, senior residents
don't bite. Not this one anyway.

790
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,151
Barkeep, we got some
thirsty students here.

791
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,318
- I'll have a beer.
- Me too. Light.

792
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,828
- Me three.
- Vodka, neat.

793
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:43,264
Mm. I like the way you
think, Jane. What? No interns?

794
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,529
Doctors Barnett and Rasgotra
had some patient follow-up thing.

795
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,366
- Where's Abby?
- Right here.

796
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,134
- Oh, hey. Hi. Sit down.
- Hi.

797
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,143
Where have you been? I feel
like I haven't seen you all shift.

798
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,473
Around.

799
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,046
Morris, what's this all about?

800
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,446
Mm. In a word, mentoring.

801
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,018
Um, is Dr. Pratt coming?

802
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,382
He better be. He's
splitting the bill.

803
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,146
<i>All night as they
close up to seven.</i>

804
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,717
<i>Gordon inbounds to Hinkley. Hinkley
brings it up across the half court...</i>

805
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,493
Ellie? I want you to
take a deep breath, okay?

806
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,653
Tidal volume's 1200
with an excellent NIF.

807
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,093
You ready?

808
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,322
Yeah.

809
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:53,827
Okay, I'm gonna
pull this tube out now.

810
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,397
Deep breath in.

811
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,407
And out.

812
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,510
Don't worry. That'll stop.

813
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:16,355
Okay. Okay, let's sit her up.

814
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,902
Want to try and say something?

815
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,147
Thank you.

816
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,380
Hey.

817
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,488
Hey. ERIN: Hey.
