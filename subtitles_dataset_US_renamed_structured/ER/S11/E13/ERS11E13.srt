1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,703
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,514
<i>Yes, I believe the
drug ruined her kidney.</i>

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,513
You're alleging
potential slander that

4
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:12,808
could cost the hospital
millions in support.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,209
Abby, he's all yours today.

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,748
Who? JAKE: Hey.

7
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,613
Nothing's gonna happen.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,185
Why is that?

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,583
You're my student.

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,314
Welcome, roomie.

11
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,859
God, I'm gonna regret this.

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,147
If we wanna make our patients
happier, we need to teach our residents...

13
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,537
to connect with them better.

14
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,979
- Might wanna start with Pratt.
- I'm not an intern, okay?

15
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,899
So stop acting like one.

16
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,761
Ooh.

17
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,204
No more hot water.

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,363
Sorry about that. I
should have warned you.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,601
- Building needs a bigger water heater.
- God, I'm freezing.

20
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,872
Let me see what I can do
about that. Come on in here.

21
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,451
- How about we call in sick?
- Ugh.

22
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,187
I'm arguing a motion today. It's
my first time in front of this judge.

23
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,854
Well, let's just try to hook
up after my shift, then.

24
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,001
Ah, I can't. I'm going to a friend's
birthday dinner at Dandelion.

25
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,902
Dandelion.

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,197
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

27
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,364
- Pretty swank.
- Yeah. We're splurging.

28
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,875
- It's girls' night out. She's turning 30.
- Hmm.

29
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:55,140
Well, you know, after today,
I'm on nights for a week, so...

30
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,715
Yeah.

31
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:01,354
Don't worry. I'll make
it up to you. Mm.

32
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,388
Greg...

33
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,661
I... I like you. I really do.

34
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,731
- Mm-hm.
- But I just don't think there's a future.

35
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,534
What?

36
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,532
I'm looking for a guy who's
a little further along in his life.

37
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,697
You're a student.
You live like a student.

38
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,536
I'm not a student.
I'm a Resident.

39
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,074
Listen, Greg, you're great.

40
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:31,443
But I'm looking for a
guy I can get serious with.

41
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,314
An adult.

42
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,060
Ah...

43
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,892
Hamster bite, itchy eyes.
For Abby, twisted ankle.

44
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,296
Med students, how do you
know when to order a film?

45
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,060
- Uh, Ottawa rules?
- Which are?

46
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,434
Uh, point tenderness over
the lateral or medial malleolus.

47
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,802
Mm-hm. What else?
Interns, help him out.

48
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,571
- Inability to walk on the scene.
- Or take four steps in the ER.

49
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,941
- Hey, man.
- Vomiting diabetic for you.

50
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,278
Saved the best for you.
Vertigo times six hours.

51
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,443
- Morning. PRATT:
This board's a mess.

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,988
Sam, the diabetic in Exam 3
needs a D-stick, Chem-7, and an IV.

53
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,418
How will you learn to put in a
line with somebody else doing it?

54
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,085
- Aren't IV's a nurses' thing?
- If you're R2 or below...

55
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,494
- do your own.
- I can get an IV into a scalp vein.

56
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,231
Good. Keep your skills up then.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,302
Man has a point. Today,
everybody does their own lines.

58
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,098
I will take this.

59
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,503
I need the practice. I'm
moving on to Surgery.

60
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,939
Why make up arbitrary
rules if it's gonna slow us?

61
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,238
- Because I can.
- You woke on the wrong side...

62
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,472
- of the waterbed this morning.
- Yeah, me.

63
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,617
Oh, you have a waterbed?

64
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,413
I can't make this schedule. We
don't have enough Attendings.

65
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,112
Hire a few part-timers.

66
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,918
We can barely afford to pay
the doctors we already have.

67
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,755
Call CT. Vertigo guy's gonna
need a head with contrast.

68
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,363
- You need an Attending to sign off.
- What?

69
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,795
- Residents can't order CT's.
- Since when?

70
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,026
We have to cut down
on unnecessary CT's...

71
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,934
- or we have to buy another scanner.
- Well, this is a necessary scan.

72
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,507
You were in there two
seconds. You do a neuro exam?

73
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,271
- There could be a cerebellar mass.
- Or an inner-ear infection. Do the exam...

74
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,936
and we'll see about your CT.

75
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,448
I've been ordering my own scans
since I've been here. What's that about?

76
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,645
- It's about me making the rules.
- Oh, come on. That's stupid.

77
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,790
Come on, man. Back me up.

78
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,152
It's her ER.

79
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,625
Sorry, Pratt. It
sucks to be you.

80
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,178
Mr. Turner, I'm
Dr. Pratt. How can I help?

81
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,513
- Where are my pain meds?
- What seems to be the problem?

82
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,315
What do you think? I am in pain.

83
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,617
I need pain meds. Now.

84
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,056
Mr. Turner, I can't help
you until you tell me...

85
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,026
Vicodin, morphine, go!

86
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,899
Oh, Pratt, you gotta help me.

87
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:38,004
I've been stuck with a homeless woman
named Rocky who says she knows you.

88
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,538
A frequent flyer with a
positive review of systems.

89
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,539
Complaints: headache
times two years...

90
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,907
tingling feet, cough, insomnia,
intractable emesis, pruritus...

91
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,514
- Am I supposed to work this up?
- She comes in for company.

92
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,151
Knows what to say to
guarantee she'll be here hours.

93
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,152
I can't spend any more time in
there. Her breath is killing me.

94
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,222
Call Social Work. Have
them hold her hand.

95
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,381
Half an hour with
Wendall, she'll be cured.

96
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,221
Half hour with Wendall, I'd
be cured, know what I mean?

97
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,863
Pratt, I'm applying for a
Robert Wood Johnson grant...

98
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,727
to look at the effects of
Prevnar on occult bacteremia.

99
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,769
Good luck with that. Hey, do we have
a handout for the local rehab programs?

100
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,066
We need to pull charts on kids
under 2 who've had a septic workup...

101
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,233
and record the
demographic data on these.

102
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,002
- We?
- Fill out my chart review...

103
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,113
I'll put your name on the paper.

104
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,442
Not into research, don't
care about publishing.

105
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,450
You'll be out looking for
a job in a couple years...

106
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,020
staring at a blank page
where articles should be listed.

107
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,215
When they hire the guy from
Harvard who's got a five-page CV...

108
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,917
and published three books
during his Residency...

109
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,359
you'll look back and
wish you'd stepped up.

110
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,521
Actually, I'm writing
something right now.

111
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,635
It's about the abuse of power by
Attendings in a county hospital system.

112
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,869
I need these back in a week.

113
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,534
I use the ABCD mnemonic:

114
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,613
Airway, bones,
cardiac, diaphragm.

115
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,477
And then you look
at the lung fields.

116
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,486
Is the problem that I'm a
student? Or that I'm your student?

117
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,955
Looking for infiltrates, opacity,
vascularity, pneumothorax.

118
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,755
I'm just trying to isolate the issue here.
- We've covered this.

119
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,266
- I'm your supervisor.
- Temporarily.

120
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,561
Your evaluation form is
sitting in my box right now.

121
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,565
Okay, 72-year-old
female with nausea.

122
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,266
Are you gonna let some false sense
of hierarchy get in the way of this?

123
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,968
One more word,
and I'll flunk you.

124
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,474
Hi, Mrs. McDow.
Feeling a little queasy?

125
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,777
- A little.
- Chest bothering you?

126
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,586
I think I'm having heart pangs.

127
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,484
Ever had anything
like this before?

128
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:41,185
Mm, sometimes, when
I'm walking Ferdinand.

129
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,490
He's a mutt, and I love him.

130
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,996
Pulse is racing.

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,429
My husband brought him
home from the pound...

132
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,766
just a few months
before he passed away.

133
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,270
I'm sorry to hear
that. What's your plan?

134
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,647
O2, aspirin, nitropatch,
morphine, Lopressor.

135
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,549
Okay, we'll get you
some medication.

136
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,948
That should help with
pain. My student here...

137
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,214
is going to get you an EKG
and check out your heart.

138
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,588
- You're the boss.
- Yes, she is.

139
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,786
- Okay. Say "ah."
- Ah...

140
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,230
He's only been at this school a
month, already missed five days.

141
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,302
You can close now.

142
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,098
You have a sore throat?

143
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,841
How about a stuffy nose?

144
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,566
He's quiet.

145
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,872
Said he didn't feel well
enough to go to school.

146
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,140
Okay. Wanna open your
ears for me, young man?

147
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,374
How long has he had ear tubes?

148
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,043
I'm not sure. He's
my husband's kid.

149
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,817
Been living in Detroit with
his mom till a month ago.

150
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:50,161
Mom's doing six months for selling
meth. He had nowhere else to go. Work.

151
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,026
- What's this?
- How'd you do that?

152
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,692
Does it hurt?

153
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,566
No.

154
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,263
- Culture you asked for.
- Thanks.

155
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,875
Thomas, how'd
you get that scratch?

156
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,952
Hey, it's okay. You can
tell me what happened.

157
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,211
I don't remember.

158
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,719
Oh, Jane. I'm applying for a
Pharmyxia educational grant.

159
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,362
- Okay.
- I need to give them...

160
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,226
a, uh, current inventory of
textbooks and computers.

161
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,629
It'd be a perfect job
for a medical student.

162
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,861
- Really?
- Yeah. Take stock of all...

163
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,267
computers, educational
CD's, textbooks...

164
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,206
anything used for educational
purposes, and record them on these.

165
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,639
You poaching my student?

166
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:41,213
Attending scut comes
before intern scut. Sorry.

167
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,145
I missed so much
work, I got fired.

168
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,411
So then I'm home sulking all
the time, and my boyfriend bailed.

169
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,714
Chronic pain can put a
strain on relationships.

170
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,481
- Have you considered...?
- Counseling?

171
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,988
We've been down that road.

172
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,219
Ms. Slattery, here's your note for
work. I've signed your discharge.

173
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,092
- You are all set.
- I don't know why I bother.

174
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,497
There are pain clinics,
support groups...

175
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,169
You people always give
the same useless advice.

176
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,795
Therapy, support groups. I've
tried that. I've tried everything.

177
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,740
Nothing helps. I told you
I didn't need Social Work.

178
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,304
- Hang in there. We're all done here.
- Good luck.

179
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,512
- What was that about?
- It's back pain. You heard her.

180
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,347
You called me to see a patient
who doesn't want my help?

181
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,184
She needed someone to
complain to, I needed to do work.

182
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,519
- I'm not a babysitter.
- Need you to talk to...

183
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,752
a kid in Exam 3. Has
a gash on his chest...

184
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,659
- won't tell me how it got there.
- See? A real consult.

185
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,528
Thirty-seven-year-old GSW to chest.
- You ready?

186
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,635
- Just get started.
- We should go together.

187
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,137
- His name's Thomas.
- Tachy at 114, BP, 135/80, sats, 92...

188
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,866
- on a high-flow mask.
- Mr. Lysander, I'm Dr. Kovac.

189
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,876
Ly... Lysander's my first
name. Lysander Martin.

190
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,173
- Interesting name.
- It's from Shakespeare.

191
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,817
My mom wanted to name
me after a romantic hero.

192
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,010
- Okay.
- She got it wrong.

193
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,623
- One, two, three.
- Decreased breath sounds on the right.

194
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,384
- Always wanted to ride in an ambulance.
- He needs a tube.

195
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,620
Got the Trauma page. Hi. I'm
Dr. Dubenko, Trauma surgeon.

196
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,559
So many doctors.
You all here for me?

197
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,063
Thirty-seven-year-old with
single GSW to the chest.

198
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,398
Lysander Martin was shot.
Lysander Martin was gunned down.

199
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,040
- I don't believe it.
- This guy's a talker.

200
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,733
- No kidding.
- Wound looks through and through.

201
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,369
I don't even feel the pain. Is that
like the endorphins or something?

202
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,874
Hello, doctors. He's decreased
on the right, needs a chest tube.

203
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,178
- Is this Lysander Martin?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,344
Need to put that mask
on. What's that for?

205
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,547
He's being charged with assault.

206
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,858
Nobody's gonna be mad at you.

207
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,190
- Right?
- Of course not.

208
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,923
All done.

209
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,301
You can talk to us,
you know? It's okay.

210
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,237
You're safe here.

211
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,441
I was climbing a
fence at school.

212
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,379
I slipped on the top.

213
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,951
So you got this
cut from a fence?

214
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:05,417
It's the wire kind, with the
sharp things sticking out.

215
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:10,724
I didn't wanna say because I
ripped my shirt. It was Casey's.

216
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,231
- Great, Thomas.
- It's okay. I don't care.

217
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,207
I'd like a couple minutes with
Thomas alone if that's all right.

218
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,309
It's just a scratch.

219
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,469
Is that absolutely necessary?
They'll kill me at work if I don't show up.

220
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,358
You can't go until
his rapid strep's back.

221
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,614
Cardiac unit. Excuse
me. I'll be right back.

222
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,414
She's got right bundle branch.

223
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,653
That's pretty common.
I have that too.

224
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,418
I also have an aberrant
reentrant conductance pathway.

225
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,792
- That explains a lot.
- Yeah. My EKG's kind of wild.

226
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,899
I assume you want
another 12-lead?

227
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,331
Yes. Thank you.

228
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,906
Um, there are a few findings on your
EKG that are consistent with ischemia...

229
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,168
which means that your heart
muscle isn't getting enough blood.

230
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:01,314
- That can't be good.
- We'll, uh... We'll check another EKG.

231
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,949
We'll see if they've progressed.

232
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,584
Thank you, dear.

233
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,680
And I'll be back.

234
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,519
Abby, I'm asking all Residents to keep
a tally of time spent on paper charting.

235
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,422
You switching to an
automated system?

236
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,257
If we get the money. Keep
track of start and stop times...

237
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,195
on your documentation.
Could you ask the house staff...

238
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,029
to fill out forms and collect
surveys when you're done?

239
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,932
Thank you.

240
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,638
What's the time survey about?

241
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,647
I'm applying for an
informatics grant from Genadon.

242
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,785
Genadon Pharmaceuticals?

243
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,443
Yes. Why?

244
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,680
Residents should
be treating patients...

245
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,189
not doing free research
for drug companies.

246
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:50,160
Maybe they'd be able to if someone
hadn't spilled their guts on television.

247
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,731
- I was right.
- You know, the makers of Zarictal...

248
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,834
give this hospital over
$50,000 in educational grants.

249
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,665
That's money for computers,
conferences, support staff.

250
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,136
I can't count on that now.

251
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,640
Gonna go to another drug company?
Can't we be more creative than that?

252
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,540
The county health
system's bleeding.

253
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,238
Unrestricted grants from
pharmaceutical companies pay.

254
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,576
There's no such thing
as unrestricted grants...

255
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,241
from pharmaceutical companies.

256
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,752
The fact that we rely on that
money is a serious conflict of interest.

257
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,187
Yeah. And I never thought
I'd be kissing corporate ass...

258
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,555
when I went to school.
Welcome to adulthood.

259
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,663
- We owe our patients.
- To keep our doors open.

260
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,696
- It compromises independence.
- Know what?

261
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,563
Most of us had to make compromises to
get through med school and Residency.

262
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,864
That's probably a foreign
concept to someone...

263
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,234
who's never had to worry
about money in their life.

264
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,569
It must be nice.

265
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,704
<i>Little pressure here.</i>

266
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,008
- And I'm in. SAM:
Sats up to 98.

267
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,946
Nice, Pratt. Morrison's
looks good. No fluid.

268
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,417
You haven't told us how
you got shot, Mr. Martin.

269
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,055
Lysander, please.
Call me Lysander.

270
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,124
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. Spends
the play being pushed around by Puck.

271
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,691
Puck is evil.

272
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,920
- O silk.
- Why are you looking in the abdomen?

273
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,564
- Injury's in the chest. KOVAC:
Bullet could have ricocheted.

274
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,963
- Nipples to navel, no man's land.
- I've always hated those ER truisms.

275
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,195
Wounds are aligned,
bullet went through...

276
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,396
man needs a chest
tube. Leave it at that.

277
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,371
- It's done.
- Good. Oxygen, pain control, ICU next.

278
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,272
- Do I need an operation?
- No.

279
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,070
It's not clear yet.

280
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,046
How can you be so
sure without looking?

281
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,481
- Want to scan the belly?
- Yeah. Call them down.

282
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,814
Why do ER docs radiate
the hell out of people...

283
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,252
instead of trusting your
own clinical judgment?

284
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,757
I trust my clinical
judgment, and I want a CT.

285
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,225
CT. That's a cat scan, right?
- Yeah.

286
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,330
Scanner's down. Could
be a couple of hours.

287
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,261
- Good.
- If the bullet nicked the bowel...

288
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,334
he doesn't have
hours. Needs an ex-lap.

289
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,834
Let the surgeons decide
who needs the surgery.

290
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,304
- Are these guys fighting over me?
- Come on, Kovac. Let it go.

291
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,310
He's my patient.

292
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,939
Oh.

293
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,776
Okay.

294
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:55,286
Vitals Q hour, chest tube to
suction, morphine, PRN. There.

295
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,823
He's admitted to the Trauma
service. Board him until the bed's ready.

296
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:03,122
Okay? Now he's my
patient. You can go.

297
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,462
Two small coffees. I hate when
they don't leave room for the milk.

298
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,630
If we missed that intestinal
injury, he will get septic and die.

299
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,333
Why does Dubenko think he
can act like that to the ER staff?

300
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,274
Hubris? I love that word.

301
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,710
And one more sugar, please.
- Sure.

302
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:26,113
- He doesn't get to you?
- Dr. Hair? I think he's kind of cute.

303
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,844
What?

304
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,521
Surgery and ER have these battles
in every hospital I've ever worked in.

305
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,216
It's not personal.

306
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,828
Surgeons have to believe they're
better and smarter than everyone else.

307
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,398
It's a defense mechanism to
make up for their terrible lifestyle.

308
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,901
- The guy needs an ex-lap.
- It's a pissing match, Luka. Let it go.

309
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:49,406
Come on. You're taller and
sexier. And you already got the girl.

310
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,067
- This isn't about ego.
- Oh, it's not?

311
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,240
Nineteen-year-old.
Arrow to abdomen.

312
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,847
- It hurts!
- What's your name?

313
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,143
- His name's Dan.
- Airway's fine, tachy to 130.

314
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,912
- BP, 99/50. Four of MS.
- Need a little help.

315
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,420
I need more of that stuff.
- Hang in there.

316
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,648
We're gonna fix you up.

317
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,725
- What happened?
- They made me balance...

318
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,021
an apple on my head
while they took shots.

319
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,324
- Who did?
- The DKE brothers. I'm a pledge.

320
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,262
It was a hazing stunt?

321
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,733
Said the arrow had a
plastic tip, couldn't hurt me.

322
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:18,928
They were wrong.

323
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,165
We actually didn't
think he'd let us do it.

324
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,832
God, I'm glad I'm not a guy.

325
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,440
All right, here's
your note for school.

326
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,740
- Thank you.
- No more climbing fences...

327
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,043
till you're double digits, okay?

328
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,277
Keep the wound dry
until it's scabbed over.

329
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,784
- Thank you, doctor.
- Anytime.

330
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,956
- Can you hold on?
- We really need to go.

331
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,922
No, I... Just one
minute. I wasn't done.

332
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,294
I asked you to find out
what happened. You did.

333
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,861
If you call me to consult...

334
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,261
wait for my assessment
before releasing him.

335
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,911
Your assessment was that the
injury was consistent with the story.

336
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,564
- What's the problem?
- I haven't completed my evaluation.

337
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,196
- I can't sign off until I interview him.
- I don't need you to sign off.

338
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,570
I got a 16-year-old girl
with abdominal pain.

339
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,303
Can you do the sexual history?
She'd rather talk to a woman.

340
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,711
I am sick and tired of you all
using Social Work as a crutch...

341
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:07,718
when your patient smells bad or
you don't wanna spend time with them.

342
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,550
Actually, she smells
kind of good. Thanks.

343
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,923
You should page me
before you discharge.

344
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,723
Which is it? We're calling
you too often or not enough?

345
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,230
If I don't leave now,
I may lose my job.

346
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,664
Don't worry about
it. You're all set.

347
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,407
When are you gonna
take this thing out?

348
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,009
It's not safe doing it here.
We'll do it up in the OR.

349
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,078
Dubenko's on his
way. He's got no veins.

350
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,146
I'm not having luck either.
- On the feet?

351
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,647
Set up for a central
line. Ray, let's tube him.

352
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,809
- All right.
- Sterile sixes to Jane.

353
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,750
Jake said you
were cool like that.

354
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,356
- Like what?
- Letting med students do procedures.

355
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,288
- That's how he sold me on the switch.
- What switch?

356
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,420
- Anyone reached my mom?
- We're working on it.

357
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,991
He's swapping his
remaining shifts with me...

358
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,531
so he can do nights
with Neela supervising.

359
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,464
- Oh.
- We'll put a breathing tube...

360
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,934
down your throat for the OR.

361
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:02,303
When you wake up, this thing will
be out, and you'll be all fixed up, okay?

362
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,377
- Eighteen gauge in dorsal arch.
- Twenty etomidate, 100 of sux.

363
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,843
He wants to get a sense of
how other interns do things.

364
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,609
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, systolic's down to 62.

365
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,878
Uh, okay. Abby, why don't you go
next door and get the rapid infuser?

366
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,385
Uh, yeah. Flush the line
with saline. I'll be back.

367
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,558
Etomidate is in.
- Okay, suction.

368
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,386
We hardly ever do DPL's anymore.

369
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,357
Yeah, because CT makes us lazy.

370
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,621
It's archaic.

371
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,130
DPL has a higher sensitivity
with occult intra-abdominal injury.

372
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,200
Dubenko doesn't
want us near this guy.

373
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:34,636
Well, it's safe, it's faster, and it's
indicated in penetrating thoracic injury.

374
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,834
- Lower thoracic injury.
- Is there always this much debate?

375
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,309
- Only with the really important stuff.
- Cool.

376
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,075
- I'm stealing your rapid infuser.
- Send Jane in. She should see this.

377
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,709
Okay, we're gonna put a
small catheter into your belly.

378
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,083
We're gonna run a
liter of saline in and out.

379
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,055
If the fluid comes
back clear, you're good.

380
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,751
If there's any blood,
you're gonna need the OR.

381
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,227
- Makes sense to me.
- He's not our patient.

382
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,491
Dubenko's gonna freak out.

383
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,409
- Hey.
- Hey.

384
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,602
The, uh, kid with the arrow
in his belly went up to the OR.

385
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,371
That's good.

386
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,940
I was never in a
fraternity. Boy...

387
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,445
- What?
- I said I was never in a...

388
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,857
Look, I'm sorry.

389
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,951
Maybe sometimes I'm
not the best team player.

390
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,563
I have so many balls in the
air. I'm sorry I took it out on you.

391
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,594
It was a lot easier
being a Resident.

392
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:39,261
Attendings made tough calls, protected
us from all that administrative crap.

393
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,066
Didn't seem like
that at the time.

394
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,638
Students wanna be Residents.
Residents wanna be Attendings.

395
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,043
Yup. And Attendings
just wanna be left alone.

396
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,078
I'm not doing any more
consults down here today.

397
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,153
- Why? Who's covering?
- No one. The ER's blacklisted.

398
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,449
What?

399
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,286
They all brag about the ER's
multidisciplinary approach...

400
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,724
but doctors only
listen to other doctors.

401
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:03,608
What happened?

402
00:21:03,632 --> 00:21:05,660
Have the Residents
call a candy striper...

403
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,699
if they need somebody to keep
their patients company today.

404
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,073
Okay, grasp the fascia with
the towel clips and pull up.

405
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,506
- Are you a student?
- No. She is.

406
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,506
Now just pop the angiocath
through to the peritoneal cavity...

407
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,844
and aspirate as you go.

408
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,953
Want me to hold the
clamps while you do that?

409
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,247
No. I've got it.

410
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,255
- How long have you been a doctor?
- Three years. I'm in.

411
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,124
- Nothing back.
- I've worked at the same place...

412
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,494
for the last 14.

413
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,262
Extend with the scalpel
and thread in your tubing.

414
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,372
Dr. Kovac, urosepsis guy is
coding. Morris is in there alone.

415
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,369
Okay. Dump in a
warm liter of saline...

416
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,446
and let gravity pull it back
out. It takes about 20 minutes.

417
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,173
- And if Dubenko sees this?
- Call me.

418
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,049
- You want me to go with him?
- Yeah.

419
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,217
He seems like a cool boss.

420
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,292
He's one of them.
I have a bunch.

421
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,854
I've had the same
one for the whole time.

422
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,564
Jack Meegly.

423
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,632
He's a year younger than I am, and
he's made me call him Mr. Meegly.

424
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,395
Sounds like a jerk.

425
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:21,871
Last night, I had my crew
rearrange this display...

426
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,341
so that the cell phones
were separated from the CD's.

427
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,243
This morning, he came by, and
he made me change it all back.

428
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:33,580
I don't have the authority to change
the displays in my own damn department.

429
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,051
It sucks to be the middleman.

430
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,583
For the last 14 years, I've
been working holidays...

431
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:44,162
and covering his ass while he cheats
on his wife with the girls in Cosmetics.

432
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,196
Two hundred cc's in.

433
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,930
Today, I had enough.

434
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,195
I went to the
firearms section...

435
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,362
I took a gun out of the case...

436
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:58,409
I grabbed some bullets, I went into
Meegly's office, and I fired into the air.

437
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,041
- You're kidding.
- Mm-mm.

438
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,252
I didn't wanna hurt
him. I was just mad.

439
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,051
That explains the handcuffs
and your friend outside.

440
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,858
So, what happened next?

441
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,792
He, uh, was calm.

442
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,125
He grabbed the
gun out of my hands.

443
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,460
And then he, uh...

444
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,133
He shot you?

445
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,139
Story of my life.

446
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,909
Damn. Thought I had it bad.

447
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,642
Sorry for the delay, Mr. Martin.
ICU should have a bed in...

448
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,752
Well, Dr. Pratt,
what are you doing?

449
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,447
- A DPL.
- Yeah, I see.

450
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:51,396
Well, why stop there?
Get sterile, Pratt.

451
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,761
- We're going in.
- What?

452
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,995
- Scrub up, you assist.
- He's not serious.

453
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,904
You guys are so sure he needs an
ex-lap, let's open him up right here.

454
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,402
Let's go.

455
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,116
I'm not really
getting surgery, am I?

456
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,945
Oh, no. I was just making
a point. Where's Kovac?

457
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,350
- Sam's out looking for him.
- Quick, friendly tip of advice.

458
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,651
Next time you're caught between
a surgeon and anyone else...

459
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,987
- listen to the surgeon.
- How about this time?

460
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,187
He's gotta finish
what he started.

461
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,628
Gravity's gonna pull
the fluid into the bag.

462
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,495
If it's red, we know
you're bleeding.

463
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,660
ER docs convince yourselves
of the worst possible diagnosis...

464
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,636
then radiate, bleed and
bludgeon to prove you're right.

465
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,538
Dr. Kovac is always on us
to avoid unnecessary tests.

466
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,971
So obsessed with the dramatic save
that you fail to develop any finesse.

467
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,912
- Finesse?
- Sledgehammers and carpet-bombing...

468
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,383
where discretion and
restraint are required.

469
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,717
He wouldn't push a procedure if
he didn't think we'd find something.

470
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,415
Kovac has you doing a
procedure on somebody's patient...

471
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,891
You have something to say,
say it to me, not my Resident.

472
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,087
You and I should
discuss it in the hallway.

473
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,495
- No, we can discuss it right here.
- Very well.

474
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,896
My patient is fully aware
that you and your Resident...

475
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,904
ignored my instructions
and proceeded with this test.

476
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:08,649
It's okay.

477
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,872
After years of taking
care of the cases...

478
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:14,036
that you guys blow off, I've
learned to develop intuition.

479
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:18,241
Your intuitive approach is very sweet,
but I practice evidence-based medicine.

480
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,712
Okay? Let's look at
the evidence, shall we?

481
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,932
It's pink. Does that
mean I'm bleeding?

482
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,015
No. May I?

483
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:31,190
Last vitals.
Seventy-two, 18, 114/66.

484
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,559
Note, I am reading
this through the fluid.

485
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,260
- How does that correlate to cell count?
- Ten thousand RBC's, tops.

486
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,871
- Is that bad?
- It's nothing. Tablespoon of blood.

487
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,702
- Probably from Dr. Pratt's incision.
- You don't know that.

488
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,073
Should we get another doctor?
Like a tiebreaker or something?

489
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,578
- Maybe break the tie?
- Look, if he was bleeding...

490
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,239
we'd be looking at tomato
juice, not pink lemonade.

491
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,977
He could have a small tear
that's intermittently oozing.

492
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,314
I'm getting very
tired of this game.

493
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,721
And since I can't trust you to
stay away from my patient...

494
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,721
I'm going to go and
find him a bed myself.

495
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,827
He's not mad at me, is he?

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,765
A blocked blood vessel
deprived your heart of oxygen...

497
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,666
which caused the
abnormal rhythm.

498
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,305
That's why you passed out.

499
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,409
The cardiologist will thread a
catheter through your groin...

500
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,671
into your heart and
unblock the vessel.

501
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,939
- Will it hurt?
- No. You'll be sedated.

502
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,606
Curtain B is open.

503
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,275
Is there any family you'd
like us to call for you?

504
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:30,184
My... My son lives in Seattle.

505
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,824
Got any friends who
could come be with you?

506
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,790
Uh, no. It's just me
and my dog now.

507
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,630
I'll tell you what, Gertie.

508
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,632
My shift is almost over,
and I love the cath lab.

509
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,669
I'm gonna come hang out with
you while they do your procedure.

510
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,534
You wanna stay with me?

511
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,367
Listen, I'll be quiet.
I'm not gonna bug you.

512
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,637
Privacy, please.

513
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,974
I need to do my assessment.

514
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,686
That was nice of you.

515
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:06,189
I wasn't lying. I really
do like the cath lab.

516
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,852
Hey, listen, um...

517
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,563
you did a great
job on your rotation.

518
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,859
I probably should've
mentioned that sooner.

519
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,730
- Thank you.
- And I want you to know...

520
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,031
Uh, just let me know if you
need any help down the line.

521
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,910
- Sure.
- And I think it's good that you...

522
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,538
uh, switched to have some
shifts with Neela. She's very smart.

523
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:34,016
And, uh, I... I... It's
good to have variety.

524
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,678
Abby, I was wondering
about something.

525
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:37,948
Yeah?

526
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:44,260
Do you think Gertie's blockage
is in the circumflex or the LAD?

527
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,500
You know, the next time you decide
to start a turf war with Dubenko...

528
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,264
do me a favor,
leave me out of it.

529
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,566
This isn't about power,
it's about the patient.

530
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,266
But he's seen hundreds of GSW's.

531
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,502
What makes you
so sure you're right?

532
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:04,082
If you have a strong gut feeling
about something, you have to listen to it.

533
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,777
- Come on, we were wrong.
- We don't know that yet.

534
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,511
Made us look like fools.

535
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,081
- Is that what you're worried about?
- What?

536
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:18,227
Nothing will get a doctor into bigger
trouble than the fear of looking stupid.

537
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,059
Trust me.

538
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,203
So, um...

539
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,930
you're on nights for
the rest of the rotation?

540
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,597
Yeah.

541
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:33,439
- I guess this is it. I'm on days.
- It's too bad.

542
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,413
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

543
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,224
Abby, uh, I'm sure
Neela's a good doctor...

544
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,327
but that's not why
I switched shifts.

545
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,122
- No?
- No. I switched shifts...

546
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,426
so that after today, I would
no longer be your student.

547
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,258
Oh.

548
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,405
So tonight, I want you
to fill out that evaluation...

549
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,667
seal the envelope and turn it
in. Because tomorrow night...

550
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,335
- you and me, we're going out.
- No, we're not.

551
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,943
- Yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

552
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,914
- Yeah.
- No, we're not.

553
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,350
You ever think about
Surgery? You seem the type.

554
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,750
No. A month in the Death
Star's enough for me.

555
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,017
- Death Star?
- Surgical ICU.

556
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,821
Pratt, excessive yawning
a sign of something?

557
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,293
Yeah. Sleepiness.

558
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,490
Well, Lysander doesn't seem
sleepy. He seems kind of wired.

559
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,457
- He's yawning?
- Yeah, a lot.

560
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:32,537
Detective Burowski's been
waiting two hours. Can we go in?

561
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,866
Not yet. Call Dubenko.

562
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,106
- Are you the mom?
- Teacher's aide.

563
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,507
He's in after-school
daycare. Found him like this.

564
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,442
- Rounds of epi?
- Three. No pulse.

565
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,277
- Carter. Full arrest on a schoolyard.
- Injuries to the head, chest, abdomen.

566
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,316
- Okay. Trauma 2.
- Somebody page Wendall.

567
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,456
- Why?
- She and Pratt saw this kid today.

568
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,689
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a minute, you'll see.

569
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,696
- You okay like that?
- Well, I'm sliding a little bit.

570
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,232
- Uh, maybe this will help.
- Can I make a call?

571
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:06,702
- Sure. What's the number?
- 555-0198. Thanks.

572
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,408
What is this, Medieval
Torture Day in the ER?

573
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,737
Nurse noticed frequent
yawning in an alert patient.

574
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,846
- You got 30 seconds.
- Could be a sign...

575
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,312
- of diaphragmatic injury.
- You're kidding me.

576
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,007
- It's a theory.
- Hard to prove...

577
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,585
but wouldn't necessarily
show up on the DPL.

578
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,598
<i>You've reached Jack and Sally's.</i>

579
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,818
- Machine. DUBENKO:
I've got a bed for him...

580
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,186
in the ICU upstairs, okay?

581
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,352
Hi, Sally? It's Lysander
from Electronics.

582
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,897
Methylene blue in the abdomen should
seep through the diaphragmatic tear.

583
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,864
And come out of the chest tube.

584
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,368
I've been shot, and I'm
hanging upside down...

585
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:43,066
with a tube in my belly and a
vacuum cleaner in my chest.

586
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,507
- And in case I don't make it...
- You're gonna make it.

587
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:51,082
I just wanted to let you know
that your husband cheats on you...

588
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,154
and that I love you.

589
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:08,556
Meegly's wife, well,
she works in Appliances.

590
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,727
I met her when she
was just a trainee.

591
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:15,237
Okay. Um, I want my
patient upstairs now.

592
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,108
Blue.

593
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,407
Sam, Chuny's at the blood
bank. We need a nurse in here.

594
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,105
Coming. RAY: Okay.

595
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,774
- Hold compressions.
- What can I do?

596
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,579
You can work on access.

597
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,052
My God, it's Thomas.
The kid with the chest lac.

598
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,282
- Still P.E.A. Rate, 66.
- All right, resume.

599
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,085
Hematoma, right parietal area.

600
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,196
Ecchymosis and swelling to the
right mandible and bilateral maxillae.

601
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,993
- What the hell?
- Can't get a pressure.

602
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,634
Who did this?

603
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,499
- Found him on the schoolyard.
- Is his mother here? Brother?

604
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,970
Bruising and edema
to bilateral thighs.

605
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,507
How did this happen?

606
00:31:56,348 --> 00:32:00,308
Isn't it funny how you can be so
completely sure of a diagnosis...

607
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,750
then find out you
were totally wrong?

608
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,514
You should write up
the case, Dr. Pratt.

609
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,283
Mm. Think you'll do the
surgery laparoscopically...

610
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,688
or are you gonna go open?

611
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,829
Mm, don't know yet.
We'll have to run the bowel.

612
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,433
Ah. Think the bullet may have
been bouncing around the abdomen?

613
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,832
- Know what? It's possible.
- And Dr. Kovac was right.

614
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,336
- Good night, Dr. Pratt.
- Hmm.

615
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,601
Thank you. I think this has
been the best day of my life.

616
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:31,847
- Hey, Chuny, what's going on in there?
- Abused kid. You don't wanna know.

617
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,693
You guys need an extra set of hands?
- It's Thomas.

618
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,852
- Oh, man! MARQUEZ:
Hanging the first unit.

619
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,021
- Switch out. You look tired.
- Just started.

620
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:49,225
- I should have finished my interview.
- P.E.A. at the scene.

621
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,029
There was a sock
shoved down his throat.

622
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,466
How many meds you give him?

623
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,917
- Too many.
- How much volume?

624
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,166
- Third liter's going in.
- I blew it.

625
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,536
- Wendall...
- Pace him.

626
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,302
He's oozing from his IV sites.

627
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,346
It's DIC. Go for cryo and FFP.

628
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,506
No, Pratt. Anybody got
an ETA on the family?

629
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:08,278
Another epi, another
atropine, and let's treat the DIC.

630
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,549
Come on, he's a kid,
man. I'm not stopping yet.

631
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,232
Atropine's in. RAY: Pratt,
you want me to switch in?

632
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,924
- Central access.
- It won't change.

633
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,228
Throw in a femoral.

634
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,566
He's got two large-bore
IV's with good flow.

635
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,698
- What's the time?
- It's 43 minutes.

636
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,538
The family's here.

637
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,638
Why don't you see if
they're ready to come in?

638
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,990
- How is he?
- This is Thomas' dad.

639
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:50,595
His injuries are very severe.
Do you wanna see him?

640
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,798
Sometimes it helps to see how
hard the doctors are working.

641
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,266
Casey, go back and sit down. I
don't think he needs to see this.

642
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,435
I wanna be with him.

643
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,611
- I saw them.
- Who?

644
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,122
I saw them pull Thomas behind
the swings after school today.

645
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,624
Who did you see?

646
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,957
They had a thing
about his clothes.

647
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:29,763
I gave him my shirt yesterday, but
they still wouldn't leave him alone.

648
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,096
Did they cut him?

649
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,331
I tried to get
Thomas to tell you.

650
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:39,638
But they said they'd kill
him if he said anything.

651
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,308
He was scared.
Everyone's scared of them.

652
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,642
Casey, tell me who they
are. I promise you'll be safe.

653
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,320
I still have to be in school
with them every day.

654
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:52,989
Who?

655
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,990
There's four of them.
They're sixth graders.

656
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,330
- PH is 6.8.
- Amp of bicarb.

657
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,471
Hold compressions.

658
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,005
Okay, that's it.

659
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,180
Six twenty-five.

660
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,376
Please...

661
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,854
He's still got a rhythm.

662
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,362
A non-perfusing
rhythm with a rate of 28.

663
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,697
We haven't even tried
transcutaneous pacing.

664
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,736
Forty-eight minutes
of cerebral hypoxia.

665
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:44,205
- How much fluid did you give him?
- Three liters of NS, four of O-neg.

666
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,867
Ten rounds of epi and atropine.

667
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,515
Greg.

668
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,782
Oh. No.

669
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:03,358
He's fixed and dilated, with a
pH that's not compatible with life.

670
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,400
Mr. Bryson, Mrs.
Bryson, I am very sorry.

671
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,605
- Hey.
- Hi.

672
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,303
I was about to put this in your
box. Med-student evaluation.

673
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,278
Ah, how's it going with him?

674
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,645
He's thorough. He's got
a good fund of knowledge.

675
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:00,945
That's not what I meant.

676
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,217
And I'm sorry, I didn't get
to those time surveys today.

677
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:12,225
We're so screwed at this point
another day doesn't matter.

678
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,633
What's going on? Is Carter's
press conference that big a deal?

679
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,033
If Keating-Ward pulls
funding, others will follow suit.

680
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,002
Drug companies don't
wanna associate...

681
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,042
with a department that overreacts
during a post-marketing surveillance.

682
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,305
Well, Admin somehow always
finds money to keep us open.

683
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,309
I could lose my job.

684
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,753
Why? You didn't personally run
County Health into the ground.

685
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:39,653
No, but my tenure's up for
review, and I'm way short.

686
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,226
They made you department head.
I think you've proved your worth.

687
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:46,956
The committee's only concern
is how much money I bring in.

688
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,799
- That sucks.
- I have to bring in $100,000 a year...

689
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,404
- to even be in the ballpark.
- There's a quota?

690
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,506
We're being pimped
out by the university.

691
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,471
You don't bring in
the cash, you're out.

692
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,708
Pharmaceutical grants are an easy
way to raise a bunch of money fast.

693
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:07,284
I can't lose my job. I have
Chuck and Cosmo now.

694
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,533
I just talked to the OR.

695
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:30,073
Lysander had a three-centimeter
diaphragmatic laceration.

696
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,369
- Okay.
- You saved his life.

697
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,377
We all miss things, Pratt.

698
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,183
The social worker
saw this kid too.

699
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,552
I pulled rank on her.

700
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,956
Attending trumps Resident,
Resident trumps intern.

701
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,399
We all trump the social
worker. It's a great system.

702
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,469
Most of the time it works.

703
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,541
- How do you stand it?
- What?

704
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,408
The responsibility.

705
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,072
- Busy shift?
- Oh, the usual.

706
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,740
What about you? What did you do?

707
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,115
Tried to sleep, couldn't.
Watched bad TV, ate cereal.

708
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,314
I hate working nights.
Okay, bring it on.

709
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,755
Torticollis in 2 waiting
for Benadryl to kick in.

710
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,454
And tinea capitis has a scrip for
griseo, but he needs to see an Attending.

711
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,223
- That's it?
- I'm out of here.

712
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,798
Anyone wanna go to Ike Ryan's?

713
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,562
Luka's working. Alex is at
a sleepover. I need a drink.

714
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,637
- No, thanks. I'm exhausted.
- Ooh, I'm in.

715
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,435
Dr. Lewis, the, uh, inventory of
teaching materials you asked for.

716
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,273
Thank you, Jane. You're the only
person who actually did what I asked.

717
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:45,247
Uh, textbooks and journals are in
the front. Computer stuff is in the back.

718
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,476
Come on out with
us. I'll buy you a drink.

719
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,121
I can't. There is something
you can do for me though.

720
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,416
- Shoot.
- Write me a recommendation?

721
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,855
- Okay.
- Way to work it, Jane.

722
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,995
- Ray, you coming out with us?
- Ooh.

723
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,757
Oh, I never drink with
Attendings. It gets too weird.

724
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,494
- The plumber came, the shower's fixed.
- Oh, hallelujah. I love you.

725
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:07,833
You owe me 80 bucks.
Ready to sign out?

726
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,675
Please don't give me the speech about
how we win some and we lose some.

727
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,814
I wasn't going to.

728
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,546
I didn't complete my
assessment. I didn't do my job.

729
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:27,124
What do you think
would have happened...?

730
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,419
Please, don't.

731
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,856
Don't what?

732
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,055
Try to cheer me up.

733
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,163
I should have saved that kid.

734
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:12,334
- Can I help you, sir?
- No, actually, I'm looking for someone.

735
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,204
What's the name of the party?

736
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,039
Really. I'm good. Thanks.

737
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:27,208
Oh, God! WOMAN:
Oh, no, that's awful.

738
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,844
Hi.

739
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:35,860
I'm sorry, ladies, I didn't mean to
interrupt. This will take a minute.

740
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,186
Greg?

741
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,228
I went to work thinking
about what you said.

742
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:42,890
- What are you doing here?
- And I just need to tell you something.

743
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,066
The work that I do, it's as
real and as serious as it gets.

744
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,038
Now, I don't know how
you define an adult...

745
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,145
but I assure you,
I'm all grown up.

746
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,009
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to offend you.

747
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:07,386
I don't know what you're
looking for, but I hope you find it.

748
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,591
Good luck.

749
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,904
Abby.

750
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,605
What are you doing here?

751
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,240
- Big problem.
- What?

752
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:36,111
You never signed off on
my ABG or IV placement.

753
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:40,953
So you staked out my apartment
so I could sign your book?

754
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,089
All student-teacher relations
have to be wrapped up by tomorrow.

755
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,062
That is very important.

756
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,300
I see.

757
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,797
Sign it.

758
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,380
- How do you know where I live?
- Residency office.

759
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:10,021
They just, uh, gave out my address just
like that? You could have been anybody.

760
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:14,990
It's disturbing, really. They even
gave me your phone number too.

761
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,493
Well, I guess they thought
you looked like a nice boy.

762
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,690
- I'm not that nice.
- Maybe I should change my number.

763
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,494
Good idea.

764
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,900
Okay. Well,
congratulations, Jake.

765
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:31,841
Your ER rotation
is, uh, officially over.
