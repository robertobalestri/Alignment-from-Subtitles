1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,200
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,002
<i>Dear Michael, it's been
months since I've heard from you.</i>

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,738
<i>Tell everybody I'm still here,
still doing the doctor thing.</i>

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,555
She could die without
the proper burn care.

5
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:17,946
She can't get that here.

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,142
Yeah, okay. I'll try.

7
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,119
- What's going on?
- She's talking to Gallant.

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,588
You got 72 hours,
son. Get her there.

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,887
For Laura, my little one.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,863
Neela, your favorite patient
is in Waiting asking for you.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,698
- Oh, no, please.
- Back-pain guy?

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,063
Third day in a row.
- Sign out to me...

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,766
but take care of your
boyfriend before you leave.

14
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,138
Deal.

15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,076
The Iraqi girl's coming today.
Have you talked to Gallant?

16
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,773
Not since we set it up.
When she does, I'll call CASH.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,920
All right. But this time,
I want to talk to him.

18
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,788
Who's that?

19
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:05,126
Well, that is Tio Escobar, 17.
Superficial stab wound to the right flank.

20
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,825
- Not him. Her. TIO: He
cut me, I didn't do nothing.

21
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,664
Word is you told Drake you
were coming for him with a gun.

22
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,635
- Didn't say that.
- There were witnesses.

23
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,071
- May I take a look?
- Other doctor already saw it.

24
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,110
Well, I'm the supervisor, so I
have to check it out anyway.

25
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,138
Well, the wound is superficial.

26
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,579
We'll be back to clean
it out. You got lucky.

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,944
This time.

28
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,251
- Hi. I'm Dr. Pratt.
- Olivia Evans. I'm with Ceasefire.

29
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,458
- Ceasefire?
- Violence prevention program.

30
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,318
How many shooting
victims do you see in a shift?

31
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,028
- Too many to count.
- Exactly.

32
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,132
So how could you not
know about Ceasefire?

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,292
Hey, the name sounds
familiar. Tell me more about it.

34
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,643
Tio and I, we're not... We're
not done here, are we, Tio?

35
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,142
Anything else?

36
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,172
I'll be back.

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,612
So, what's she like?

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,277
She's a health professional,
Ray. Don't be such a dog.

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,688
I shouldn't have taken Franklin.

40
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,955
Mom, what day is it?

41
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,527
- Wednesday.
- I meant date.

42
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,237
- It's right in front of you, Alex.
- The 27th.

43
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,873
Dad will be coming soon.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,635
- You spoke to him?
- No. He wrote me a letter.

45
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,869
You never said anything.

46
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:29,044
- He wrote it to me.
- And he said he was coming to see you?

47
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,479
Yeah.

48
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,914
Alex, honey, how many
times has he told you...

49
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,889
he was gonna do
something and then he didn't?

50
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,154
Okay, Mr. Kirkendall,
we'll do this one more time.

51
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,732
Thanks for your patience.

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,870
- Dr. Rasgotra, you got a minute?
- Go ahead, I'll be there soon.

53
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,905
Okay. I'll wait right here.
Thank you very much.

54
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,237
- Uh, congratulations.
- On what?

55
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,573
- The Iraqi mother and daughter arrived.
- That's great.

56
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,079
Dr. Gallant around? I wanted to
introduce him to the Plastics attending.

57
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,548
- Excuse me?
- Dr. Gallant.

58
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,620
- Michael was in the hospital?
- Yeah. I was just with him an hour ago.

59
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:08,847
Oh.

60
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,786
So if you see him,
send him my way.

61
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,289
The unit staff
wants to meet him.

62
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,674
He's, uh... He's a
bit of a hero up there.

63
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:15,698
Yeah.

64
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,780
Registration, Urgent
Care in the atrium...

65
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,509
Primary Care Clinics over here.

66
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:17,021
Thirty-six state-of-the-art exam rooms
with a dedicated outpatient pharmacy...

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,060
lab, and an X-ray suite located
behind the sculpture garden.

68
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,963
- And this? What's this?
- Commercial space.

69
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,591
We're already taking bids. It'll
probably go to some fast-food joint.

70
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,601
- What?
- Sorry I'm late.

71
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:35,036
Kerry sends her apologies but
she had an appropriations meeting.

72
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,972
So, what do you think?

73
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,942
- Very impressive.
- Well, listen.

74
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,240
Public Affairs is working
on a press release...

75
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,043
- about the Carter Foundation...
- Dr. Anspaugh...

76
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:48,245
I thought that comprehensive HIV
care would be very much a part of all this.

77
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,151
We cannot get into
subspecialties yet.

78
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,622
We struggled getting
family med to come.

79
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,957
Primary care docs
can staff the HIV clinic.

80
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,325
There is no space for that.

81
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,933
Maybe we should pitch a
tent in the sculpture garden.

82
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,798
Maybe we could stake out a
few tables in the burger joint.

83
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,735
The clinic was your idea. We
are trying to make it happen.

84
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:10,400
Primary care and
comprehensive HIV treatment.

85
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,740
Not <i>Architectural Digest</i>
and super-sized meals.

86
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,850
Call me when you
have something else.

87
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,246
Twelve-year-old Victor
Hopkins, GSW to the groin.

88
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,914
- Pulse, 115, resps, 20, 98/60.
- And my sats are okay.

89
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,783
- Ha-ha. How do you know about sats?
- I heard her say it on the radio.

90
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,795
Got two of morphine en
route. Mom's on her way in.

91
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,763
It's a weird trajectory for a
GSW. Who shot you, Victor?

92
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,768
- Nobody. It just went off.
- You shot yourself?

93
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,172
- No. It was in my pocket.
- What's a kid like you doing with a gun?

94
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,707
Protecting myself.

95
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,978
Michael, I don't know if
you're checking this cell phone.

96
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,481
Are you in town?
I'm a bit confused.

97
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,178
Call me back at the hospital, okay?
I'll be here for another hour or so.

98
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,620
You ran away from your back-pain
guy. But he's waiting for you.

99
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,316
He can wait.

100
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,624
I heard Michael was here.

101
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,665
Did you know he was coming?

102
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,827
- Yeah, sure.
- You didn't mention it.

103
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,638
Didn't I?

104
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,509
He didn't stop by?

105
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,468
I guess he just didn't
want to go over everything.

106
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,479
Should I continue being oblivious
or do you want to explain...

107
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,708
why you're bleeding
from your cuticles?

108
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,149
- I'm not crazy, am I?
- Crazy?

109
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,686
How did I manage to build
up feelings for someone...

110
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,154
I've spoken to once
in the past year?

111
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,157
Well, you exchanged letters.

112
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,685
Letters?

113
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,763
What are letters?

114
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,991
You can think, feel, say whatever
the hell you want in a letter...

115
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,329
to someone thousands
of miles away.

116
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,234
It's all speculative, imagined.

117
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,001
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just on a piece of paper.

118
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,440
- It's okay if you're mad at him.
- Mad?

119
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,841
More like furious.

120
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,245
I'm furious that he didn't
tell me he was coming.

121
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,851
I'm furious that he could
just walk away like that.

122
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,188
I'm ridiculously
desperate to see him...

123
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,382
none of which is based on
anything more substantial...

124
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,027
than the inner workings
of my neurotic brain.

125
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,859
You know, I was ready to
bestow my sage wisdom...

126
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,195
but I think you got it covered.

127
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,274
Am I so pathetic...

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,070
that I have to concoct a
love life out of nothing?

129
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,039
That's not fair.

130
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,707
You and Michael were very close. It's
not so crazy you're having these feelings.

131
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,755
Graze wound to
the right testicle.

132
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,623
It's just superficial.

133
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,164
Victor, you're a lucky man.

134
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,770
GSW to the right thigh. No exit.

135
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,139
Belly's soft. What
happened here?

136
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,031
I got hurt last summer.

137
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,440
Victor, you got shot before?

138
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,375
Some kid at school.
I'm not that popular.

139
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,605
Victor?

140
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,541
- Hey, Mom.
- Thank God you're all right.

141
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,946
What happened?

142
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,953
Well, your 12-year-old son
had a 9 mm pistol in his pocket.

143
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,556
He did?

144
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,050
- Do you know where he got it?
- No.

145
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,961
Mrs. Hopkins, who
does the gun belong to?

146
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,760
Boo, I taught you how
to keep the safety on.

147
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,901
- Oh, Neela.
- I'm sorry, Dr. Lewis.

148
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,630
- I'm getting to him now.
- Am I that much of a hardass?

149
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:03,174
- I was gonna ask if you've seen Gallant.
- Uh, no, sorry. Patient's waiting.

150
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,972
Can you sign off on an order
of Ancef for Victor Hopkins?

151
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:09,082
- The prepubescent gangbanger?
- More like aspiring vigilante.

152
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,807
- His mom's behind it.
- What?

153
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,886
- She gave him the gun.
- Get Social Services down. And, Sam...

154
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,182
- somebody called for you.
- Who?

155
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,053
Well, he didn't leave a name
and he sounded a bit agitated.

156
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,217
Frank said you got a
similar call yesterday.

157
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,558
Yeah. I took care of this
wheelchair vet with ascites last week.

158
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,326
- He's got a thing for me.
- You want me to alert Security?

159
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,732
No, no. It's nothing like
that. Thanks. It's fine. Really.

160
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,434
- What's going on?
- Oh, a patient wants me on the phone.

161
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,168
Sam, what's going on?

162
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,006
Nothing. What?

163
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,615
You don't want to tell me? Fine.

164
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,512
Hey.

165
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,850
Come on. Let's
get a coffee. Okay?

166
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,383
- Have you been taking the ibuprofen?
- Yes.

167
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,116
- Resting?
- Trying.

168
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,283
Like I said yesterday
and the day before...

169
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:55,056
It was Tuesday.

170
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,392
- I couldn't come Wednesday.
- A muscle spasm like this...

171
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,034
- can take weeks to heal.
- Oh, I know.

172
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,193
So why do you keep coming back?

173
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,705
I believe in you. And I keep
thinking maybe you can fix me.

174
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,974
All right. Let's do a full exam.

175
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,654
Uh, it's a unitard.

176
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,952
You know, like
a... Like a bodysuit.

177
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,756
Okay, I'm gonna step away
and let you take that off...

178
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,455
and get into a gown, okay?

179
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,742
Uh, ahem, I... I
can't... I can't do it.

180
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,937
Why not?

181
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,915
Mr. Kirkendall, do you
want me to help you or not?

182
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,577
Look, don't laugh. Okay?

183
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,083
- Okay?
- Okay.

184
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:04,428
My wife used to call me,
uh, Clark. As in Clark Kent.

185
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,759
I can't examine you
properly unless you undress.

186
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,869
She said she could see through
my, you know, everyday disguise...

187
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,767
and underneath my
unassuming façade there was...

188
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,931
- There was something else.
- Something else?

189
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,036
A, uh...

190
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,945
A secret strength.

191
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,805
A special person.

192
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,350
- The power of a locomotive.
- Mr. Kirkendall...

193
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,613
On Tuesday, it'll be 19
weeks since she died.

194
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,953
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,794
Yeah.

196
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,163
Allergic to nuts...

197
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,498
and accidentally ate an almond
in someone's birthday cake.

198
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,532
That's awful.

199
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,634
So, after she passed,
I bought the suit...

200
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,210
and I wear it under my
clothes on the really bad days.

201
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,507
And, I don't know, it
makes me feel, uh...

202
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,552
better.

203
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,318
You weren't
wearing it yesterday.

204
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,516
Oh, yesterday was a good day.

205
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,094
You think I'm crazy.

206
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,668
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- No, you think I'm crazy.

207
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,169
No, I think...

208
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,008
I think I can examine
you over your suit.

209
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,947
I wasn't sure what the calls were
until Alex told me about the letter.

210
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,213
- So he's here.
- I guess so.

211
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,350
What do you want to do?

212
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,084
I'm not gonna run away
again, especially not now.

213
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,231
I don't want you to have
to worry. It's my problem.

214
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,523
I kind of think
it's our problem.

215
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,471
I'm Dr. Carter. What
do you got, Dr. Pratt?

216
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:55,871
Twelve-year-old, GSW to the thigh.
Vitals stable. Waiting on an x-ray.

217
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,307
And a social-work
consult. The kid had a pistol.

218
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,471
He's too smart for his own good. Bullies
tease him, he mouths off right back.

219
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,709
He tell you what
happened last year?

220
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:09,613
Tony Ramsey, the
biggest doof at my school...

221
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,657
I told him he won a Darwin
Award for the most inbred.

222
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,256
Didn't think he'd
actually shoot me.

223
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,265
- He shot you at school?
- No. On my way home.

224
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,426
Kid went to Juvie, was back
in class four months later.

225
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,072
- A gun's not the answer.
- Didn't know what else to do.

226
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,171
Nine-millimeter in the femoral triangle.
- Pulse is weak.

227
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,607
- I'll page Angio.
- May not have time for that.

228
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,576
- What's wrong?
- Gonna need surgery.

229
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,949
- Surgery? Again?
- Afraid so.

230
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,349
Curtain 4 has biliary colic.
Ultrasound and lipase are normal.

231
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,648
- Better after two of morphine.
- Okay. Home and follow up with a PMD.

232
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,418
DUB has settled down and
going home with a gyn follow-up.

233
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,528
- And in Curtain 2, I've got the...
- The superhero over there?

234
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,665
A repeat customer
with lower-back pain.

235
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,097
- No reproducible paraspinal tenderness.
- Is it true? Is Gallant back?

236
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,430
- That's the rumor.
- Is he drug seeking?

237
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,801
- Went to his parents.
- He's lonely. I put him on ibuprofen...

238
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,143
gave him a referral
for counseling.

239
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,775
Is that right? Gallant's
parents in Texas?

240
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,141
Yeah. Yeah, I believe so.
- Is that it?

241
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,148
- I don't know much about his parents.
- I meant the patients.

242
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,945
- Oh, no. That's it.
- Okay.

243
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,384
Coffee and a jelly
doughnut, please.

244
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:19,025
Same thing every day, doc.
Try a cruller. Crullers are nice.

245
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,525
I'll stick to the
doughnut, thank you.

246
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,353
I didn't even know
you were coming.

247
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:01,361
Uh, Jamila was touch-and-go.

248
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,102
My C.O. sent me
at the last minute.

249
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,036
You didn't call.

250
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,141
We were only in Germany
for about an hour or so.

251
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,837
I meant today. Dubenko
told me you left, so I thought...

252
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,411
I had to do something.

253
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,989
But I couldn't leave
without seeing you.

254
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,517
I mean, I thought it
might be easier that way...

255
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,558
but I couldn't.

256
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,532
Everyone's sad
you didn't come by.

257
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,503
It's just, it...

258
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,410
I mean, it feels weird, you
know, being back in the world.

259
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,209
The thought of going into the ER
and having to answer the questions...

260
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,683
about, you know, what I'm doing
and what it's like over there...

261
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,049
How long can you stay?

262
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,850
I fly back out tomorrow morning.

263
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,892
I only came to make sure
the girl got here safely.

264
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,767
Hello?

265
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,102
I left all the orders on
the chart. It's all there.

266
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,570
I'm at lunch, Frank. At Ike's.

267
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,437
No, I can't come
back. He'll be fine.

268
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,579
What happened there?

269
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,920
Uh, nothing. It's
just a little gash.

270
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,123
This morning I went to, uh...

271
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,767
I went to see the family
of a guy I knew from Iraq.

272
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,640
He died right before I left.

273
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,275
And I, uh...

274
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,821
I brought something that
he got for his daughter.

275
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,823
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,289
One day, his wife...

277
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,662
saw two men walking...

278
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,470
towards her door
in dress uniforms.

279
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,376
She begged them to
go away. Told them, uh...

280
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,386
Told them that they must
have the wrong house.

281
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,853
But they didn't.

282
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,527
And she knew why...

283
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,829
She knew why they were there.

284
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,043
She knew.

285
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,519
- Neela's superhero won't leave.
- What's the problem?

286
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,388
- Won't say.
- Want me to call security?

287
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,053
Hey, um, do you think maybe
someone could page her?

288
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,863
Know what? I'm sorry.
She's home in bed.

289
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,663
- No, she's not. She's over at Ike's.
- Well, who's Ike?

290
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,328
Maybe we could call him.

291
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,534
Why don't I see if I can track her down?
- Thanks.

292
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,842
Hey, you got a hot nurse here
named Samantha Taggart?

293
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,951
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Steve. Steve Curtis.

294
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,054
It's okay, Frank. I got this.

295
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,213
You still hanging in there?

296
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,716
- Looking for Sam?
- Yeah.

297
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,225
Can't believe she lasted
over a year in this place.

298
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,455
- Need some water?
- If she hasn't run off...

299
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,864
- you must have her chained to a bed.
- Let's step over here for a minute.

300
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,103
How long do I have to wait for
these scans? I need those now.

301
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,968
Hey, Olivia. I'll
call you back. Hey.

302
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,434
I was very impressed with
what you said to that kid.

303
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,240
- Thanks.
- I was wondering if I could talk to you...

304
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,748
about another patient of mine,
12-year-old kid. Came in with a gun.

305
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,283
- Unfortunately, that doesn't surprise me.
- But this is a smart kid.

306
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,413
Not a tough guy. Not yet.

307
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,422
And I was hoping, you
know, you could do your thing.

308
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,360
My thing?

309
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,268
Wow, somebody's been practicing.

310
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:34,237
I didn't like the way you
ran the table last time.

311
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,468
- Hey, wait, wait. Hold on a second.
- What?

312
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,636
I'm your bridge.

313
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,439
Go ahead. You can reach.

314
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,520
I hope you're not about
to get too competitive...

315
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,286
because it looks as if
I'm about to beat you.

316
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,018
- Michael.
- Hey.

317
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,755
- Hey.
- Abby, hi.

318
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,493
- Thought you left already.
- Well, not exactly.

319
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,797
How's it going?

320
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,998
Uh...

321
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,270
- That's a tough one to answer, I guess.
- Yeah. How you been?

322
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,136
Very good.

323
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,853
Yeah. Uh, I came by to try to
bring you back to that Kirkendall guy.

324
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,356
- But I'll just take care of it.
- Thank you.

325
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,856
- Are you gonna stop by?
- Um, I'm not sure.

326
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,293
Say I said hi.

327
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,794
It's good to see you. - Yeah.

328
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,796
And I hope you know
we all think about you.

329
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,337
- Yeah. Me too.
- Okay.

330
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,009
I know it's a bad thing. But I'm
just trying to level the playing field.

331
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,311
They all have
weapons at his school.

332
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,183
You really want your little
boy walking around with a gun?

333
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,018
- Give us a minute to talk.
- Victor was shot last year.

334
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,183
- I can't let that happen again.
- It just did.

335
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,692
- Excuse me?
- I work two jobs.

336
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,262
I can't watch him every minute.

337
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,523
- But he's a good kid.
- I can tell.

338
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,827
But you know what?

339
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,993
A man like you can be tough...

340
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,662
just by staying away
from problem situations.

341
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,038
You gotta grow up so you can be
the president and fix our public schools.

342
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,045
I'd rather be a pilot.

343
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,909
Whatever you want, so long as
you don't mess up your young years.

344
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,713
- Avoid those bad kids.
- How?

345
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,052
They follow me on
my way to school.

346
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,222
Here's what we're gonna do:

347
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,054
You see that tough
guy over there?

348
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,960
When you get better, he's gonna
walk you to school for a week.

349
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,363
- What? Wait...
- And, if you give up your gun...

350
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:46,063
I'll have someone walk you to
and from school every day after.

351
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:51,434
And each week, your escort is gonna
get bigger and scarier than that guy.

352
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,608
Just point me to her. I
don't need a babysitter.

353
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,580
You're not allowed to be here.
We're making an exception.

354
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:02,051
- Wow, thanks.
- There's a lounge down the hall.

355
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,882
Well, aren't you the man?

356
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,724
Listen, this is where I work,
okay? I don't want any trouble.

357
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,921
- So just get her for me.
- She'll be out as soon as she's free.

358
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,932
- Any tingling here?
- No.

359
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,163
- How about here?
- Uh-uh.

360
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,167
- Here?
- A little.

361
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:31,274
All right, here we go, Victor.
I will be your driver today.

362
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,578
- Ray.
- You can thank me later, Sam.

363
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,118
Come here for a second.

364
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,755
All right.

365
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,649
Look at this bullet.
There's a chip missing.

366
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,318
Okay. Let's talk
ballistics later, all right?

367
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,794
Fifteen minutes is not
gonna change his outcome.

368
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,127
- Show this to Carter.
- Okay, Vascular's waiting.

369
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,962
He's got a bounding
popliteal pulse.

370
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,933
Surgeon's set to
do a femoral repair...

371
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,437
but he's got a fragment
in the popliteal artery.

372
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,543
He's gotta be in preop in five
or they're gonna cancel the case.

373
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,703
X-ray. I wanna make sure they're
not operating on the wrong spot.

374
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,317
- Easier to figure out upstairs.
- We need a check for a right knee.

375
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:10,016
Come on. We don't need this. This
is my patient, Sam. I don't want this.

376
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:14,627
Yeah, you do. Show that to Carter.
Make Vascular wait. Thank you.

377
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,292
She can't be pulled away
while she's with a patient.

378
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:27,136
Okay, boss. I think we're done.

379
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,672
It's okay. Thanks.

380
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,072
Got it.

381
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,509
Big guy's kind of tense, huh?

382
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,351
So it's serious with this guy?

383
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,195
Yeah, it is.

384
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,558
Glad it's working out for you.

385
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,727
Do you wanna talk?

386
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,868
- Has anybody been looking for me?
- No.

387
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,529
- Nobody's contacted you?
- Why?

388
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,505
- Never mind.
- Steve, what'd you do?

389
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:07,477
Nothing. Noth... I just... I
owe a guy some money.

390
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,582
- Can I borrow some cash?
- Steve...

391
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,317
I... I need it.

392
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,719
I do, Sam. I'm gonna take
Alex on a little trip, okay?

393
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,087
- What?
- I may not see him for a while.

394
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,751
I'd like to spend time with him.

395
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,990
- He's in school.
- What is he? Third grade?

396
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,861
So he'll miss
finger-painting class.

397
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,559
He's in the fifth grade. He's
studying the Constitution.

398
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,704
But he's still my kid, right?

399
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,236
Please, Steve. You
know it's a bad idea.

400
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,704
Yeah, I guess you're right.

401
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,175
Hey, if you want,
maybe the three of us...

402
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,787
could go get some dessert
or something together.

403
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,583
You could catch up with
him a little bit. He'd like that.

404
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,855
Yeah.

405
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,524
I gotta hit the road.

406
00:24:56,695 --> 00:25:00,257
I'll... I'll just
call him. Okay?

407
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,033
But, uh...

408
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,800
what about the money?

409
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,435
Look, I only have about 40 on
me. How much do you need?

410
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,409
A couple hundred.

411
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,781
Come on. There's an
ATM around the corner.

412
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,247
So you're still having
a bad time at work?

413
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:22,821
Oh, I'm sure I overstated it.
It's just I came to work here...

414
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:27,517
and fell into old patterns
from college, from growing up...

415
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,788
stuff I wanted to get away from.

416
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,261
And one day you realize
that's how people see you.

417
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,957
It's who you are, even if
that's not who you wanna be.

418
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,932
So you don't like who you are?

419
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,802
- I don't always like how people see me.
- Ah.

420
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,938
Well, you can change that.

421
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,980
Be someone different tomorrow.

422
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,674
- Come on.
- What? Where are we going?

423
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:57,448
Millennium Park. It's new. And
then I'm taking you to dinner.

424
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,119
Dr. Kovac, can I talk to you?

425
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,489
- Sure, Frank.
- I know it's none of my business.

426
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,031
I was a cop. And I can still
sniff out a skel when I see one.

427
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,760
- Guy's name is Curtis, right?
- Yeah.

428
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,134
A detective I know at the
one-five checked the NCIC for me.

429
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,866
- NCIC?
- National Crime Information Center.

430
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,511
He pulled up this arrest
warrant from Colorado.

431
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,204
- Thought you should know.
- Thanks, Frank.

432
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,849
Is the film back on my GSW kid?

433
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,178
I'm not sure. Pratt and
Ray are in with him now.

434
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,614
You okay?

435
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,015
- Yeah.
- Where's Steve?

436
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,850
Gone. He just wanted some money.

437
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,151
No. There's something
else we need to talk about.

438
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,658
- Hey, just a minute. PRATT:
Nobody's cutting your leg off.

439
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,559
Do I sign something? RAY:
Anesthesia has the consent forms.

440
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,198
- Where are you going?
- The O.R.

441
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,993
No. We have to
wait for Victor's...

442
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,362
- x-ray.
- X-ray.

443
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,834
You were right. Fragment
in the popliteal fossa.

444
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,030
Nice catch. Vascular's
scrubbed and waiting.

445
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,041
My mom says I can have ice
cream for dinner after I wake up.

446
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,374
Yeah? Well, your
mom is pretty cool.

447
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,142
- Thanks for everything.
- Yeah. Ditto that.

448
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,477
Anytime.

449
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:08,557
- Alex left school with Erica.
- Yeah, she's tutoring him tonight.

450
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:12,823
- Frank got this. It's about Steve.
- What? You had Frank snoop on Steve?

451
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,864
He just did it.

452
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,334
He robbed a market outside
Denver. The cashier got hurt.

453
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,768
What?

454
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,737
Oh, my...

455
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,345
He's gotten in trouble
before but nothing like this.

456
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,913
We should call the police.

457
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:33,416
No, I can't. He's Alex's dad. I can't be
responsible for getting him locked up.

458
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,215
Oh, Sam. I need you to work a couple
hours of overtime. I lost my MICN.

459
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,585
- I can't.
- I need someone who can work the radio.

460
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,694
- I'm sorry, but I got...
- Till Chuny gets in. She's on the I-90.

461
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,922
- I know. But I got to...
- I've cut you some breaks. Help me out.

462
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,294
Susan, I'm gonna take
this sled collision in Two.

463
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,936
Oh, okay. Wait. Thanks, Sam.

464
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,671
It's okay. I'll go
straight home.

465
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,674
- Call me as soon as you get there, okay?
- Okay.

466
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:03,273
Chuck and I have basically been
hibernating for a year with Cosmo.

467
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,282
And I'm trying to get us
to reenter the social world.

468
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,218
I was thinking maybe you and Wendall
could come over sometime for dinner...

469
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,620
if you don't mind talking
over a baby monitor.

470
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,987
That's a really nice
offer. Yeah, I'd love to.

471
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,927
But things with
Wendall didn't work out.

472
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,922
Oh, I'm sorry.

473
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,503
Yeah. It's weird. She's actually not
really even speaking to me. Ha-ha.

474
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,298
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. I just...

475
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,966
Just what?

476
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:39,249
I don't know. I just feel like
lately I've fallen off the tracks.

477
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,320
It's taking me a little while to
figure out how to get back on.

478
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,853
Will you call the office and let
me know how Victor's doing?

479
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,789
- You got it.
- After he's discharged...

480
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,328
we'll set up a schedule
to walk Victor to school.

481
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,092
- You weren't serious about that.
- I'm serious about everything I say.

482
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,498
- Um, I'm kind of busy.
- We're all busy, Dr. Pratt.

483
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,503
You're gonna stamp out violence
in Chicago one kid at a time?

484
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,664
That's the plan.

485
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,373
It's like any other epidemic.
How do you contain TB?

486
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,104
Knock on doors
and give out meds.

487
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,978
You stop the flu by giving vaccine shots
on street corners. It's the same thing.

488
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,778
But there's no meds
and no vaccine.

489
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,183
The kids with guns, you
can't talk them out of it.

490
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:19,154
We react to every shooting,
even if no one gets hurt.

491
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,518
We mobilize a neighborhood
response every time someone fires a gun.

492
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:28,030
Stigmatize violence
and death rates will drop.

493
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,498
Sounds good.

494
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,167
It's working.

495
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,205
Come by and see for yourself.
The address is on the card.

496
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,513
It looks like a frat house.

497
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,712
Yeah, it's definitely lived-in.

498
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,376
Well, that's what you get for
rooming with a rock 'n' roll resident.

499
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,421
- Where are you staying tonight?
- Uh...

500
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,827
A buddy of mine took
over my old lease.

501
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,224
So I'm probably
gonna sack out there.

502
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,695
I'm hungry. Are you?

503
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,162
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

504
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,901
Well, I'll just go and
get changed then.

505
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,098
Me too. I could use walking
around in some civvies for a while.

506
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,075
- Okay. Well, I'll be back in a minute.
- Okay.

507
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,408
What are you craving?

508
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,119
What's that?

509
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,118
What kind of food do you want?

510
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,058
Chinese, deep-dish, burgers?

511
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,388
Uh, deep-dish sounds good.

512
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,633
Or Thai. There's this
great place on Indiana.

513
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,704
Yeah, yeah. You know,
whatever you think is good.

514
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,292
I'm just picking up
some of my stuff.

515
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,294
You broke into our apartment?

516
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,793
- Alex let me in.
- Where is he?

517
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,265
- Upstairs.
- Where's the babysitter?

518
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,461
I sent her home.

519
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,339
- Okay, put it all back.
- What?

520
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,568
It doesn't belong to you.

521
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,073
You see this?

522
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,674
I gave her this. Okay?

523
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:33,288
- What about the TV and the stereo?
- You keep whatever you want.

524
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,323
- I'm gonna go check on Alex.
- Alex is fine.

525
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,993
- I'll go see.
- No.

526
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,138
You don't wanna do that.

527
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,647
Luka.

528
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,719
It's nothing, kiddo. Just
a little disagreement.

529
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,519
What's all that for?

530
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,625
We're going to Florida. My
dad's got a place by the beach.

531
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,198
We can watch whales migrate.

532
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,528
Mom said it was okay.

533
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,834
Alex, go back up.

534
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,297
- No.
- Alex, now!

535
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,339
Easy, hoss. Not your kid.

536
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,811
Listen, you can take
whatever you want. I don't care.

537
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,942
But he's not going
anywhere with you.

538
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,512
Think about it.

539
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,154
You really want to
get him into all that?

540
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,358
Hey. We'll catch the
whales in the fall, kiddo.

541
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,231
- I'm going the other direction.
- What?

542
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,896
- Come on, now. Don't be upset.
- You said we...

543
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,407
- You said we're gonna go to Florida.
- You can't miss that much school.

544
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,204
Doc here's got a point.

545
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,879
We'll do it next time.

546
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,415
Come on, buddy.

547
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,719
Don't make this harder on me.

548
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,793
That's my buddy.

549
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,826
Wow.

550
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,398
If that's your deep-dish-pizza outfit,
I'm glad I didn't say French food.

551
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,303
Let me just turn off the light.

552
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,995
It's pretty.

553
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,994
Can't sleep?

554
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,796
No.

555
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,839
Does it hurt?

556
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,938
No, not really.

557
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,739
What happened?

558
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:54,746
There was a... A
patient brought in.

559
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:01,359
He was a part of a unit
that got caught in a firefight.

560
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,329
They had men down and
needed help getting them out alive.

561
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,091
Get him out of here quick!

562
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,432
Let's go, let's go!

563
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,836
<i>I never thought I'd
be in the middle of it.</i>

564
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,168
Let's go.

565
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,442
We'll cover you! Get going!

566
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,945
But there I was.

567
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,811
<i>And all I cared about was
getting us both the hell out of there.</i>

568
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,466
<i>Three of our men
died there that day.</i>

569
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,303
I don't know how many Iraqis.

570
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,821
It's funny what you were saying
earlier about wanting to be...

571
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,350
someone different.

572
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,362
I keep wishing I could
go back to who I was.

573
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,895
All we can do is
keep moving forward.

574
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,342
Wish you didn't have to go back.

575
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,515
It won't be too long
before I'm home for good.

576
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,689
They're in 3L?

577
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,552
Yeah, burn unit.

578
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,230
- Morning.
- Morning.

579
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,598
- Dr. Gallant, didn't realize we'd see you.
- I'm just on my way back.

580
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,407
Hayat, this is Dr. Rasgotra.

581
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,870
Neela.

582
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,636
We were able to lighten her
sedation for a few minutes.

583
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,313
- She squeezed her mom's hand.
- Good.

584
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,047
I'm sorry.

585
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,082
It's the ER.

586
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,918
I'll be right back.

587
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,588
I'll be a minute. I probably
forgot to sign a chart.

588
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,658
Okay, uh, yeah. I'll
wait right here then.

589
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,560
Why don't you come down?
Abby's there, and Pratt.

590
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,960
I don't have a lot of time.

591
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,593
Okay. I'll come get you.

592
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,337
Systolic's down to 60.

593
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,104
Fluid's open. Hang two
0-neg, type and cross four more.

594
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:37,511
- I'm in. Pass me the bag.
- Oh, no. Saw him yesterday. He was fine.

595
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,776
Never left. He just
signed in at triage.

596
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,146
Got good breath. Call X-ray.

597
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,787
Aorta's dilated.
Abdomen's full of blood.

598
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:46,254
- What happened?
- Looks like a ruptured triple A.

599
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,586
Prep the chest.
Thoracotomy tray to Dr. Pratt.

600
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,525
- Well, his pain was musculoskeletal.
- Bradycardic: 58.

601
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,461
Mg of atropine. Get the
blood on the rapid infuser now.

602
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,100
- Ten blade.
- I missed it.

603
00:38:56,301 --> 00:39:00,261
He's a young guy with no risk
factors. It's an atypical presentation.

604
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,667
I could have done a CT.

605
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,103
Nobody would have done that.

606
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,506
- Never lost a pulse. Got a shot.
- Let's go, Neela. Get sterile.

607
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,788
I didn't know you were up.

608
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,631
I know you're mad.

609
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,159
And I know that he's your father,
nothing's gonna change that.

610
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,663
But you and me and Luka,
we're a team now. Right?

611
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,173
We're in this together.

612
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,336
And last night, he
had to make a decision.

613
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,576
And what he did, he did
because it was best for you.

614
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,087
And that was the right thing,
whether or not you like it or...

615
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,557
- I have to pee.
- Hey, come here.

616
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,162
Talk to me, okay?

617
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,366
I know you're sad,
and that's okay.

618
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,005
Subclavian's in. Good flush.

619
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,370
Run in a liter while we
wait for the other blood.

620
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,603
- This clamp keeps slipping.
- Try the DeBakey?

621
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,771
- Already did. ABBY:
Systolic's down to 54.

622
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,177
Chuny, get the burn
unit on the line for me?

623
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,114
- Don't need the unit.
- I know. I just...

624
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,948
Oh, aorta's flat.
He's bleeding out.

625
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,852
This is a race. Get that
blood up as fast as we can...

626
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,925
up the dopa to 20,
stand by with epi.

627
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,890
The O.R. wants to
know when he's coming.

628
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,929
- Not till he's cross-clamped.
- I'll make sure they get ready.

629
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,225
Neela, hold the descending
aorta. Don't let go.

630
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,268
- Neela, I can do that. It's okay.
- No. I got it.

631
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,902
Oh, look who's here.

632
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,407
Pratt, call for FFP and
cryo. He's gonna need it.

633
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:50,940
Ha-ha-ha! Big Mike, I knew you'd
show. But you got the worst timing.

634
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,381
- We got a nasty triple A in there.
- Yeah. Can't stay anyway.

635
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,886
Hold on. Yeah, this is
Dr. Pratt in the ER. No, wait...

636
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,058
You're gonna let
me buy you a beer?

637
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,783
Not this time. I need a favor.

638
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:05,087
Yeah, I need two units of cryo
and FFP right away. Name it.

639
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,425
Can you give this
to Neela? I gotta go.

640
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,659
No. Just send it straight
to the O.R. All right, thanks.

641
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,426
What's up?

642
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,799
Yeah, tell her not
to open it unless...

643
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,965
Unless something happens to me.

644
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,575
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

645
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,647
I just want her to
have it just in case.

646
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,948
You okay, man?
Everything all right?

647
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,819
Come on, Pratt. Let's go.
He could code on the way.

648
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,260
Dr. Carter.

649
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,027
Hey, Mike. Good to see you.
Take care of yourself, huh?

650
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,467
Back off the tidal volume
or you'll blow a lung.

651
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,766
Systolic: 65. CARTER:
All right. Crank up the epi.
