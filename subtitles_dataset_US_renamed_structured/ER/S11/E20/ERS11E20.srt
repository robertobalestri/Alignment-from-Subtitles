1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,867
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,804
- Church?
- Yeah. My niece is getting baptized.

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,104
- I have to hold her.
- Oh, you're the godfather.

4
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,645
You know, tenure
means financial security.

5
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,374
Tenured Attendings need
the ability to carry their weight.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,882
You mean, bring in grant money.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,452
We would be interested
in covering the costs.

8
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,953
The entire thing?

9
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,750
- I had a gig.
- Screw your gig!

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,324
Medicine isn't a day job!

11
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,893
Chief Resident in
a busy, urban ER...

12
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,792
- We're not giving it to him though, right?
- Considering it.

13
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,830
You out of your mind?

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,241
Oh.

15
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,882
Mmm.

16
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,388
- Hi.
- Hmm.

17
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,756
- Hey.
- What you doing down there?

18
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,590
I don't know.

19
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,459
Get back up here.

20
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,429
Oh, man. I can't.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,967
I want to, I do,
but I gotta jam.

22
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,899
What, you got
gigs during the day?

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,563
Different gig. I'm a doctor.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,299
Oh, yeah, right.

25
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,274
No, really, I am.
I work at County.

26
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,540
And I'm looking at a 12-hour
shift that starts in 29 minutes.

27
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,377
- So...
- You want some?

28
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,477
Better than coffee.

29
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,985
Still, I gotta pass.

30
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,048
Oh, because you're a doctor?

31
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,949
Pretty much, yeah.

32
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,118
That's one sucky
day job you got.

33
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,953
Hmm.

34
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,633
- Ha-ha. That's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah?

35
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,930
- What you know about that?
- Shut up and listen.

36
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,073
Ready to go to school,
to get an education?

37
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,969
- Show me something. Uhn!
- Okay! Uhn!

38
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,004
Hey, yo, who you bringing
to that party tonight?

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,208
What party?

40
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,945
You serious?

41
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,485
- Darnell's 30th, man.
- Oh, man.

42
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,986
Let me guess, you too busy.

43
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,292
Hey, I wouldn't be out here at
7 whupping your ass if I wasn't.

44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,952
- You ain't been back in a while, man.
- Hey, like you said, I'm a busy man.

45
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,367
Okay, Doc
Ain't-Got-Time-For-My-Friends.

46
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,002
I make this shot...

47
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,035
you dragging your
ass to that party.

48
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,002
- Right, like that's gonna happen.
- Okay.

49
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,199
Come on, show me
something. It's crunch time.

50
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,368
Don't be a bum out
there. Show me something.

51
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,275
- Crunch time, baby.
- Ugh!

52
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,877
Game over. KOVAC: <i>Hey, Sam?</i>

53
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,288
- Yeah?
- Out of shaving gel.

54
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,945
Bo... Bottom
drawer on the right.

55
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,754
Alex, move it! Carpool's here!

56
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,632
- You find it?
- Um... Still looking.

57
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,069
It's all the way in the back.

58
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,906
- What? Huh.
- The shaving gel.

59
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,084
You almost done in here then?

60
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,512
Yeah. Go ahead if you need to.

61
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,892
Um... No, I can wait.

62
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,491
Mike...

63
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,432
- She in?
- Let me check.

64
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,230
Make sure these QA files
get to Anspaugh ASAP...

65
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,771
and I need five copies
of this budget collated.

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,932
Call Surgery. Tell
them I'm still waiting...

67
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,544
for their M-and-M data
and I'm not happy about it.

68
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,941
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,446
Oh, this coffee
tastes like crap.

70
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,710
Doesn't anyone change
filters around here?

71
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,219
Sorry, new assistant.
Good help, you know?

72
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,789
Hard to find.

73
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,121
So the formal announcement
will come out later today...

74
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,092
but I wanted to tell
you the news myself.

75
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,697
You've been awarded tenure.

76
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,627
Seriously?

77
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,769
Yep. Congratulations.

78
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,740
Wow.

79
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,637
Wow, that's great! I just...

80
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,745
I wasn't expecting it until
next year or something.

81
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,040
Nonsense. You've earned it.

82
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,279
Thank you, Kerry.
That means a lot to me.

83
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,216
Sure. I still have some other
notifications to make today...

84
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,982
so if you could keep this
on a need-to-know basis...

85
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,558
After all, you got 30 years
to gloat about it, right?

86
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,519
What? You don't
like that station?

87
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,786
No, it's fine. You
feel okay today?

88
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,621
Yeah. Why?

89
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,823
Well, you... You were in
the bathroom a long time.

90
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,025
No more than usual.

91
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,777
So was it positive or negative?

92
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,474
Negative.

93
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,854
- Were you gonna say anything?
- I was worried.

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,387
I checked. I was wrong.

95
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,388
What is there to say?

96
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,058
- What, you'd rather I was pregnant?
- I'd rather you didn't keep secrets.

97
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,425
- Yeah, that's funny coming from you.
- What's that supposed to mean?

98
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,834
You've seen all of my dirty laundry.
I barely know a thing about you.

99
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,201
- That's not true.
- You don't talk, Luka.

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,104
- About what?
- About anything.

101
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,710
How am I to know you're
honest when you don't talk?

102
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,871
About what? I'm not
the one who lied...

103
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,447
- about a test.
- I didn't lie.

104
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,517
- Yeah, fine. You omitted.
- You don't?

105
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,118
What, what? What do I omit?

106
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,857
Your past.

107
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,922
Your family.

108
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,424
I should check the traffic.

109
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,432
<i>He's the author of a
wonderful new book...</i>

110
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,931
<i>titled</i> Growing Up Single.

111
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,632
Uh... Neela, cat-litter ingestion,
uncontrollable drooling.

112
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,808
- Drooling?
- Either that or a butt abscess...

113
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,068
- on a 300-pounder. Your choice.
- Drooler.

114
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,270
- The labs are back on Mr. Busto.
- All right, hang 500 of Levaquin.

115
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,938
Eugene Bradley's here
complaining about pain again.

116
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,880
Here without a parent.

117
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,747
Morris, see what
this kid's deal is.

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,446
Bet it's the same as last
month: "My pills don't work."

119
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,090
Last week: "I lost the bottle."

120
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,749
There's: "When pain's this
bad, I gotta have my IV."

121
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,761
Can't blame him. His disease
has made him narcotic-dependent.

122
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,899
- A.K.A. addict.
- No, there's a difference.

123
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,398
And we take complaints
here seriously, so go.

124
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,229
Isn't it Abby's
turn to treat this?

125
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,464
- Abby's at some family thing with Jake.
- Looks like it's your turn.

126
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,474
TMJ's going out on NSAIDS,
5-year-old gastro tolerated the PO.

127
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,511
Gram's stain's negative on
effusion. Home and ortho follow-up.

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,172
Gonna start calling you
"the closer," man. All right.

129
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,248
Hey, kid over
there. Sickle cell.

130
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,580
Bit of pain, without his
mother. Get his story.

131
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,585
Call the Heme Clinic,
give a heads up.

132
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,657
- If it's non-emergent, send him home.
- Sure.

133
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,895
Anyone ever tell you
you got a cruel streak?

134
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,460
- Have you seen Lewis?
- No, she's hiding out.

135
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,156
But congrats by the way.

136
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,825
Associate Professor
of Emergency Medicine.

137
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,630
Nice ring to it.

138
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,501
- How did you...?
- Oh, it's...

139
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,476
Who's "CoryB123"?

140
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,112
Just someone on
my IM Buddy List.

141
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,838
- A celebration is in order.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,451
Well, it's not exactly
official yet, "JerrBear99."

143
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,712
So keep it quiet,
off the Internet.

144
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,447
Good news needs to be shared.

145
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,391
My mom's at work,
but she told me to come.

146
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,520
It's a good pulse. Minimal
swelling. It doesn't look that bad.

147
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,223
Unfortunately, we can't
treat you without her consent.

148
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,833
I brought a note from her.

149
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,666
Hey, unless it's an emergency,
we need the real deal, man.

150
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,204
Look, it hurts
really bad this time.

151
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,004
Real bad. You know?

152
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,475
- What are you taking for it?
- Morphine.

153
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,911
But most of the time,
the pills are just a waste.

154
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,517
And my mom says I
probably need an IV.

155
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,085
Mm-hm. Okay. Well, I'll
tell you what I'm gonna do.

156
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,246
I'm gonna get you a
couple of taxi vouchers.

157
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,654
You're gonna go home, take
your pills, and stay off your feet.

158
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,990
If you're in pain when your mom
gets home, have her bring you back.

159
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,825
Then I'm gonna
have to wait again.

160
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,457
You just ask for Dr. Barnett.
Bring you right in, okay?

161
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,398
You getting organized on us?

162
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,562
These two shelves, free samples.

163
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,230
Those cabinets, alphabetized.

164
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,037
Benzos and narcotics
here and actually locked up.

165
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,770
If only I could do
this with my kitchen.

166
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,680
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

167
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,376
- Has Kerry found you yet?
- No, I haven't seen her. Why?

168
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,886
They're making the tenure
announcements today.

169
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,126
And you're not the
only one getting it.

170
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,059
What?

171
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,901
- When did this happen?
- Just now.

172
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,863
No. I mean, when did you apply?

173
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,233
Are you surprised?

174
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,635
No, of course you'd
get tenure. You're great.

175
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,304
I thought you said you were
gonna wait a couple years.

176
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,814
Yeah, well, they kind of
encouraged me to apply early.

177
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,549
Really?

178
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,822
They didn't encourage
me to apply at all.

179
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,816
Well, she's probably been
trying to find you all morning.

180
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,758
Well, I've been in
here busting my ass.

181
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,765
Yeah, because you're dedicated
to reorganizing the drugs.

182
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,335
Or is it because
you're avoiding Morris?

183
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,005
Complaining of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, pain.

184
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,073
- It's the flu.
- Ugh.

185
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,300
All right, I'll tell him.

186
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,174
Give the patellar
fracture a shot of Toradol.

187
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,110
I can't stand hearing her whine.

188
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,012
Isn't Toradol contraindicated
since she's going to the OR?

189
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,619
- If you're busy, I can find Dr. Pratt.
- Morris?

190
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,256
Stay here. Don't move. I'm
here for you, okay, buddy?

191
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,257
- What up, chief?
- We need to talk.

192
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,098
If this is about the lady
who refused a Pap smear...

193
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,100
You're the new chief resident.

194
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,330
Oh, my God. Oh, m...

195
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:46,947
This is fantastic. Thank you,
thank you. Thank you, Dr. Lewis.

196
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,376
Wait until my old man hears.

197
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,880
- He will eat his words.
- It is a provisional basis.

198
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,644
- Ha!
- There'll be a 3-month probation.

199
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,154
- My presentation was a hit.
- I'll be your supervisor.

200
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,517
- I could feel the room...
- Are you listening?

201
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:02,654
It is so gratifying to see that
meritocracy is alive and well at County...

202
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,856
that hard work is rewarded,
and that an individual's ability...

203
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:10,026
is valued over politics, wealth,
and the proverbial old-boys club.

204
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,173
Right. You start today.

205
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,105
Yes, I do. Yeah.

206
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,377
- Do I have any messages?
- No.

207
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,742
- Are you sure?
- Have I given you reason to doubt?

208
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:22,145
ER.

209
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,407
Kitty-litter connoisseur
given Benadryl...

210
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,643
drooling stopped.
Suggested she get a dog.

211
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,084
Hey, some guy on line
one says the party's at 8...

212
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,657
- and that a ball had too much bounce.
- Tell him a bet's a bet.

213
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,317
- Excellent as always.
- Pleurocentesis going upstairs.

214
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,760
- Need you to sign.
- Whatever happened with Eugene?

215
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,365
Sickle cell kid? Sent him home.

216
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,398
Really? Then what's
he still doing here?

217
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,366
Morris didn't tell you, huh?

218
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,438
- Tell me what?
- Eugene's a frequent flyer.

219
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Knows how to work the system.

220
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,700
- Hey, Morris?
- Hang on, kiddo.

221
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,204
Can I have your
attention, please?

222
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,577
Ahem. I am very proud to
announce that effective immediately...

223
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,581
I am your new chief resident.

224
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,554
- This is a joke, right?
- What? You didn't want it.

225
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,192
Explosion in apartment house.

226
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,055
Sixteen casualties,
seven critical.

227
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,788
Okay. Okay, nurses,
restock the trauma rooms...

228
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,456
med students find an
intern, docs at the ready.

229
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,362
Everybody, move out!

230
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,769
I wonder what Abby's gonna say.

231
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,372
Jesus Christ. JAKE: Amen.

232
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,406
- Amen.
- Amen.

233
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,739
Do you reject Satan and all his
works and all his empty promises?

234
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,278
I do.

235
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,713
Do you believe in God the Father
almighty, creator of heaven and earth?

236
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,112
I do.

237
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,619
- Are you all right?
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ... Ahem.

238
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,621
Do you believe in Jesus
Christ, his only son, our Lord...

239
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,090
born of the Virgin
Mary, was crucified...

240
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,255
died, was buried, rose from the dead,
and is at the right hand of the Father?

241
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,796
- I do.
- Do you believe in the Holy Spirit...

242
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,937
the Holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints...

243
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,006
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body...

244
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,335
- and the life everlasting?
- I do.

245
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,248
Nurse, five of morphine, normal
saline, liter of bolus. What's open?

246
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,581
- Did you call me "nurse"?
- Check for an H and H.

247
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,690
- Move him to Trauma
2. EUGENE: Hey, doc!

248
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,689
- I'm busy, dude.
- But I can't walk!

249
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,691
He's smart. That
makes it an emergency.

250
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,195
I need a wheelchair. Looks like we
have a non-ambulatory sickler here.

251
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,458
- For Eugene?
- He says he can't walk.

252
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,034
- You're the doctor.
- Get me an IV, CBC, retic...

253
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,169
one liter of saline,
two of MS, okay?

254
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,632
- Thanks, man.
- Coming through!

255
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,040
What are you doing?
We've got multiples.

256
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,338
- What's her story?
- Marilyn Bracken, 40, burns.

257
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,175
Lacs to the face,
arms and belly.

258
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,476
- Was she altered? OLBES:
No evidence of head trauma.

259
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,883
- Smoke inhalation?
- Pulse ox, 100 percent.

260
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,487
- Can't do better.
- Lungs clear.

261
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,180
What the hell is wrong with me?

262
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,037
- I was dumb. MARQUEZ:
Heart rate's to 130.

263
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,388
Pretty tachy.
Internal hemorrhage?

264
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,325
Not blood in Morrison's.
Hang in there.

265
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,158
- Tension pneumo?
- Good breath sounds.

266
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,296
- Satting on 100.
- Cardiac contusion?

267
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,703
- I shouldn't have started.
- No sign of trauma. EKG looks normal.

268
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,896
- I give up. What have we got?
- We don't know.

269
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,473
Multifocal PVCs.

270
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,803
- I didn't mean it.
- Perfect, 100 of lidocaine.

271
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,377
- Hundred percent nonrebreather.
- Down to 80/60.

272
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,038
Not bleeding. Lungs are
up. No sign of head trauma.

273
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,775
- No cardiac history.
- Respiratory rate's up to 40.

274
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,381
No tamponade.

275
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,522
Pressure's dropping.

276
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,487
- What are we gonna do?
- We don't know.

277
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,822
Be ready with Etomidate and sux.

278
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,695
- Could this be spinal shock?
- She's moving all extremities.

279
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,394
- Systolic's down to 65.
- Maybe she's allergic to latex.

280
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,097
No, no, no. Just... Okay,
let's step back and start over.

281
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,674
- Airway, breathing. CARTER:
Respiratory rate's up to 60.

282
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,436
- We need to intubate.
- Circulation.

283
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,603
- Repeat. What else?
- O-neg on the infuser.

284
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,282
- Wait. Hold the meds. Venous blood?
- Yeah.

285
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,213
- Did you hit an artery?
- No. No way.

286
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,786
- Are we still doing...
- No, it's cyanide toxicity.

287
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,583
Retinal arteries and veins
are red. Open an antidote kit.

288
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:51,952
She ingested cyanide?

289
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,924
It's released when things
like PVC, polyurethane foam...

290
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,620
and polyester wadding
burn. Amyl nitrate perles.

291
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,299
- Got them.
- Usually cyanide toxicity is fatal.

292
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,077
- Ten cc's of sodium nitrate.
- Intubation?

293
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,866
We need to watch for cardiogenic
and hemorrhagic etiologies.

294
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,064
Okay. Let's just give it a
minute for the meds to kick in.

295
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,836
- Do I just keep bagging?
- BP's 90/60.

296
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,276
She's good.

297
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,210
- Cool catch.
- Ahh.

298
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,840
Okay, let's keep her at a
hundred percent nonrebreather.

299
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:23,084
Send off for an RBC
and plasma cyanide level.

300
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,349
Excuse me.

301
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,155
I thought you
couldn't walk, man.

302
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,160
I had to pee. What
am I supposed to do?

303
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,663
Well, you can stop
playing me, for one thing.

304
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,062
No, man. It's different.

305
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,830
- I'm serious. I need to be here.
- Uh-huh.

306
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,974
The IV. That's why
my foot feels better.

307
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,631
Give me your arm.

308
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,903
- Ah!
- Okay, you got your fix.

309
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,936
- Go.
- It's different. I'm serious.

310
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,673
- I need to be here.
- I need to take care of patients.

311
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,444
- So go home and take your meds, okay?
- I can't. I'm all out.

312
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,019
All right.

313
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,885
MS Contin, 20 pills.

314
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,761
- Get your refill from Hematology, okay?
- It's gonna be bad. I know it.

315
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,592
- I'm starting to lose my patience.
- Let me stay one night. Please, one night.

316
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,200
- No.
- Oh.

317
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,372
- Nicely done.
- Thank you very much.

318
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,531
Cuts on your chest,
arms, and some bruising.

319
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,540
Remarkable,
considering your fall.

320
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,205
I jumped.

321
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,537
Oh.

322
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:26,445
- Can you feel me touching your leg?
- You're not pressing hard, right?

323
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,955
Pratt, Kovac wants
to know if you're done.

324
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,785
- We're getting slammed out here.
- Tell him we'll both be right there.

325
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,127
Lateral lower-extremity
numbness.

326
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,990
Motor exam's
limited by his pain.

327
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,722
- What?
- Peroneal nerve injury.

328
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,559
- Possible diagnoses.
- Or cord injury.

329
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,702
Contusions, lacs, and
all four limbs move.

330
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,667
You're making this
more complicated.

331
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,669
Also had some partial
saddle anesthesia.

332
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,239
DTRs are intact.

333
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,875
No sensory-level deficit.

334
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:54,173
Motor and sensory loss is usually
incomplete with cauda equina syndrome.

335
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,077
- X-ray's back.
- Good.

336
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,241
Maybe now I'll get some
respect around here.

337
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,979
Your roommates aren't here. Doesn't
mean they're not at a different hospital.

338
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,383
When did you see them last?

339
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,152
C-spine's clear. And, oh, look at
that. Bilateral calcaneal fractures.

340
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,763
I made my way to the window. I told
them, I was like, "Follow my voice."

341
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,659
Look. Compression
fracture of L1.

342
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,596
- I saw flames.
- He broke his back.

343
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,100
It doesn't mean cord
involvement. I'll call CT.

344
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,863
I felt them, you know?

345
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,564
I didn't wanna die, okay?

346
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,538
Need some help here.

347
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,235
- Another one from the fire?
- Yep. Megan Nesbitt, alone.

348
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,506
Partial-thickness burns
to hands and forearms.

349
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,910
Good radial pulses.

350
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,846
- How old are you, Megan?
- Twelve.

351
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,487
Pretty young to be home alone.

352
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,717
One percent without epi.

353
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,085
Let's buffer with bicarb.
How are you feeling?

354
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,625
- Where's my purse?
- Is she still altered?

355
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,285
- Is it here?
- All right, sit back.

356
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,260
We're gonna numb
and suture these cuts.

357
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,195
Ma'am, you remember
what happened?

358
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,801
I was in the lobby.
I was leaving and...

359
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,630
- What time is it?
- 12:45.

360
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,136
There was an explosion?

361
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,569
I have to go home.

362
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,233
- My husband travels. I should be there.
- All right. Just calm down, Marilyn.

363
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,540
And your apartment building was
very badly damaged during the fire.

364
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,815
That's not where I live.

365
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,282
It's okay to cry, Megan.

366
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,651
I know it hurts.

367
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,089
First and second degree.
Nothing circumferential.

368
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,520
Titrate two to four of MS.

369
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,660
We'll debride after that.

370
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,766
So you were home
by yourself, huh?

371
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,062
- That must have been pretty scary.
- I'm used to it.

372
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:29,342
Okay, Megan. You have
some bruising on your belly.

373
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:33,070
So I'm gonna look at it with
something called an ultrasound.

374
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,011
- Reach the parents yet?
- Jerry's calling them.

375
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,775
They're at the mall with Logan.

376
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,748
No blood in the abdomen.

377
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,549
- But we still need consent for a CT.
- Yeah, Jerry's on it.

378
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,354
Is that a problem?

379
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,554
Nope.

380
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,657
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

381
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,669
- Jake. How's my favorite cousin?
- Patrick, how are you?

382
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,206
- Hey, this is Abby.
- Abby, yes. Hello.

383
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,174
- Care for some whiskey?
- No, thank you.

384
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,313
Look, here. It's Jake and Abby.

385
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,862
Heh-heh.

386
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,711
Well, she's a tiny
little thing, isn't she?

387
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,377
- Allow me to present my aunt and uncle...
- Call us Aunt Eileen and Uncle Liam.

388
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,782
Okay.

389
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,857
So are you divorced
or never married?

390
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,484
Uncle Liam, we're gonna go sit
down. We'll catch up later, yeah?

391
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,460
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

392
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,155
- Oh, there's a seat.
- Okay.

393
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,459
Hi. WOMAN: Hi.

394
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,158
- Did you get the sodas?
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,804
I put them down when I
was shaking someone's hand.

396
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,840
- I'll go get them.
- Sit down. I'll go get them.

397
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,739
- Hi.
- Hey.

398
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,573
Hi. I'm Grandma Mary.

399
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,684
- We're so glad you could come today.
- Oh, thank you. Me too.

400
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,410
We've heard so much about you.

401
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,419
- Good things, I hope.
- Oh, Jake goes on and on. Ha-ha-ha.

402
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,182
Abby this. KELLY: Abby that.

403
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,089
- You were a nurse.
- Now you're a doctor.

404
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,753
But he never
mentioned any children.

405
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,523
I don't have any.

406
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,726
I had Eamon here when I was 35.

407
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,661
Cousin Grace
had her first at 40.

408
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:09,002
Don't worry, Abby.
You've got time. Heh.

409
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,577
- I met him online.
- I'm almost done numbing.

410
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,771
Well, I never actually met him.

411
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,176
Oh, God. I hope he's okay.

412
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,250
- So you never...?
- I got lost.

413
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,717
I found myself looking at
one of those floor maps.

414
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,686
Okay, 30 cc syringe and a
splash guard to Dr. Lewis.

415
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,348
4-0 nylon and open a ten-pack.

416
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,620
- Dropped her BP.
- This is really, really wrong.

417
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,956
Check her lungs.

418
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,632
She had equal breath
sounds and no chest trauma.

419
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,358
Blast wave can collapse a lung.

420
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,469
Okay, let's up the
dopamine to 20 mics.

421
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,469
- Dr. Lewis, Dr. Weaver's...
- Oh, great. Now she's calling me?

422
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,808
- Can you tell me where it's hurting?
- My stomach.

423
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,706
She wants you in
her office at 7:00.

424
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,643
Okay. Let's get a repeat
chest. Why so late?

425
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,579
- No life? MARQUEZ:
Repeat HemoCue, 13.4.

426
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,550
- Okay, so no blood loss.
- Temp's 101.

427
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,450
She could be
septic from the belly.

428
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,820
- She's got some guarding on the right.
- No. Look for another source.

429
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,484
The blast could've put
glass right into her intestine.

430
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,755
Nothing on the x-ray.
These are superficial.

431
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,422
Can I get 3.375
of Zosyn, please?

432
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,263
I've irrigated the lacs. Want
me to probe all 30 of them?

433
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,996
- Yeah. LEWIS: Okay,
this one's superficial.

434
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,436
I'm telling you, there's
nothing deeper than the sub-Q.

435
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,839
- Aah!
- Ow!

436
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,912
- What happened?
- Something cut me.

437
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,274
Your parents are
on their way in.

438
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,514
Did you tell them I almost died?

439
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,356
No.

440
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,951
C-could you?

441
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,261
Megan, is everything okay
with you and your folks?

442
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,728
I guess.

443
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,363
- How about your little brother?
- Half.

444
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,604
My mom got married again.

445
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,367
Could you at least
tell them I got hurt?

446
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,344
Like, really, really bad?

447
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,540
Sam?

448
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,451
Those guys you wanted me to
check on, the jumper's friends...

449
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,653
Thank you, Jerry.

450
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,859
You are all done.

451
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,467
Why don't you get some rest
and I'll be back soon, okay?

452
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,835
I think we should get Social
Services involved with Megan.

453
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,742
- The family here yet?
- No. But she is in a weird space.

454
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,146
- She just went through a traumatic event.
- Might be problems at home.

455
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,752
- Is that what she told you?
- No.

456
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,820
Her parents left her.
They went shopping.

457
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,422
We've done the same with Alex.

458
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,582
- I just think she...
- The girl was in a fire.

459
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,193
Give her family the
chance to deal with that...

460
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,092
before pushing a
social worker on them.

461
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,869
Two sets of cultures
prior to antibiotics.

462
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,063
Start another line of saline.
Titrate the dopamine to a MAP of 90.

463
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,402
Free air. Glass shard
punctured her colon.

464
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,874
- Why didn't it show up?
- Must have been unleaded.

465
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,945
Only heavy metals
show up on x-ray.

466
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,106
Dr. Carter, your father's
returning your call on line two.

467
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,217
- Excuse me.
- By the way, congratulations.

468
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,287
- I heard you got early tenure.
- Yeah. Thanks.

469
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,390
- Dr. Lewis, how's the finger?
- Sore.

470
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,958
- So is my arm.
- Tetanus hurts. What can I say?

471
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,459
Rapid HIV test on Mrs.
Brackens came back negative.

472
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,257
- Thank God.
- Hope this means...

473
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,626
you'll leave any deep
probing to the surgeons.

474
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,734
Call the O.R. Tell
them we're on our way.

475
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,304
- Weaver make tenure announcements?
- Yeah. This morning. Why?

476
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:29,874
- Wondering when she'd make her way.
- I hope ER fares better.

477
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,374
We only got one slot.

478
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,569
I'm sure it will though.

479
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,975
- Dr. Lewis?
- Yeah?

480
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,981
Could you order a Social
Services consult on Megan Nesbitt?

481
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,044
- Kovac's patient?
- Yeah.

482
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,589
- We just disagree on how to handle it.
- Oh, are you guys fighting?

483
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,126
- Lack of money, sex, communication?
- The last one.

484
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,161
Yeah. There's a lot
of that going around.

485
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,059
- Where is he?
- Who?

486
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,723
- Luka!
- What are you doing?

487
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,664
My job.

488
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,770
Come here.

489
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,670
Sam thinks that Megan Nesbitt
needs a Social Services consult.

490
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,473
Went over my head?

491
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,877
You totally blew me off.

492
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:18,414
Okay, despite working here 12
hours a day, this isn't your home.

493
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,819
This is a workplace.

494
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,858
It's an emergency room,
my emergency room.

495
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,930
If you're having trouble, see a therapist.
If you can't, work separate shifts.

496
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,589
Does that make sense? - Yep.

497
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,031
And as far as a consult
goes, just call them...

498
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,934
because the parents will probably
get here before they do anyway.

499
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,011
I took the clavicle fracture
out of a figure-of-eight.

500
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,046
- All your fault by the way.
- What?

501
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,049
Morris. If you'd taken the
job, we wouldn't be living this.

502
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,949
First day and already a
mutiny? I'm ready to keelhaul him.

503
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,885
I'll try back.

504
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,218
MRSA abscess. Allergic to sulfa.

505
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,556
- Clindamycin.
- Two words: voice mail.

506
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,289
- Ha-ha-ha.
- What's all that?

507
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:03,527
Friends of mine bugging me to go
out and party after a long 12-hour shift.

508
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,228
That's the problem with
non-medical. They don't get it.

509
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,169
Dodged the admission of
Eugene Bradley, foot pain.

510
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,810
Party at Ike's tonight.
Boss man is buying.

511
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,311
- Who's onboard?
- Half the time medical types don't get it.

512
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,643
- Ray?
- Other plans.

513
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,580
- Neela?
<i>- The Apprentice</i> is on.

514
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,449
- Pratt?
- I'm busy.

515
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,982
- Dr. Carter?
- Hmm? Oh. Um...

516
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,823
<i>Happy tenure to you</i>

517
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,227
<i>Happy tenure to you</i>

518
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,560
Don't I get a cake?

519
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,727
<i>Happy tenure, Dr. Carter</i>

520
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:43,200
<i>Happy tenure to you</i>

521
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,379
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

522
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,077
Excuse me. Excuse me.

523
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,950
They said my wife was in a fire?

524
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,850
It's just down here.

525
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,427
She responded very well
to the cyanide antidote.

526
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,530
Her blood pressure
and pulse normalized.

527
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,861
- Good. Good.
- A piece of shrapnel from the blast...

528
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,559
may have perforated her bowel.

529
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,638
She's gonna need
surgery, maybe a colostomy.

530
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,105
- Oh, God.
- Which hopefully will be temporary.

531
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,244
I don't understand.

532
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,276
- I'm sorry?
- How this happened.

533
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:23,883
From what I was told, there was an
explosion... We're going over here.

534
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,314
- Followed by a fire.
- We live in Tinley Park.

535
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,784
Why was she at some
apartment in the city?

536
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,218
I don't know.

537
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,588
- She told me she had a dance class.
- Have a seat right here.

538
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,730
I know she's alone
a lot. It's my job.

539
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,893
We fight about it.

540
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,169
Yeah. Well, listen.
Let me see if I can...

541
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:43,193
Can I talk to her?

542
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:44,828
Um...

543
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:48,030
- You probably wouldn't be able to...
- Can you tell her something?

544
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,405
Yeah.

545
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,169
Tell her...

546
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,341
that I'm here.

547
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,099
Susan. How long have
you been standing there?

548
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,470
Not long.

549
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,701
Sorry I'm early. You
wanted to talk later.

550
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,108
Oh, sit down.

551
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,782
No point in rushing to
tell me I didn't get tenure.

552
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,981
I'm sorry. I've just
been incredibly busy.

553
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,517
Hmm.

554
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,616
You wanna at least tell me why?

555
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,584
There were a number of factors.

556
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:44,894
Significant budget cuts, your
lack of published materials...

557
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,024
The criteria are complicated.

558
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,170
How about I simplify it? I've
been an Attending for seven years.

559
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,896
Two more than Carter. I've
been an outstanding doctor...

560
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,075
a dedicated teacher
and a committed chief.

561
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,075
No one's refuting your abilities
as a clinician or a teacher.

562
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,713
And you do an excellent
job running the department.

563
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,543
Which is where you want me
to stay until you replace me.

564
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,643
- I don't follow.
- The ER runs smoothly.

565
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,617
One less thing for
you to worry about.

566
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,186
That's ridiculous.

567
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,488
Because if I was tenured, I might work
less shifts in favor of doing research...

568
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:20,827
and you might actually give a damn
about the first floor of this hospital.

569
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,334
Did you honestly think your interest in an
academic track would be taken seriously?

570
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,167
What?

571
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,171
That you could wait
until your seventh year...

572
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,209
to start aggressively
pursuing grants?

573
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,872
- I've brought in some grants.
- $75,000.

574
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,175
By now you should've
hit at least a million.

575
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,285
The university depends on
grants to cover your salary.

576
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,422
That's not only unacceptable
for a physician seeking tenure...

577
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,682
that's embarrassing.

578
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,627
So forget excellence,
forget performance...

579
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,730
just write a check
to build a new wing.

580
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,231
This hospital is in the
business of staying open.

581
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,393
We have to make our
choices accordingly.

582
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,403
Hmm.

583
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,969
Finger dislocation's at X-ray.

584
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,648
And shrimp allergy needs
a recheck after sub-Q epi.

585
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,078
So why tell me?

586
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,913
If I don't leave now, my band
can't make its Evanston gig.

587
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,816
And that's my
problem how exactly?

588
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,321
Neela, I dispo'd ten
patients in the last hour.

589
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,584
You get to pop a finger
back in place. Please?

590
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,422
- Fine. But you're cleaning the bathroom.
- All right, deal.

591
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,655
With actual cleaning products.

592
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,134
- Banker's hours now, Ray?
- I'm like an ATM, babe.

593
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,326
Do business 24/7.

594
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:35,071
There we go. Oh, taxi!

595
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,143
Hey! Hey, taxi! Damn it.

596
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,319
Eugene?

597
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,312
Wha...? Uh...

598
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,016
What are you doing?

599
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,856
Hey, you need el fare?

600
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,633
There we go.

601
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:07,869
Well, it's getting pretty late.
Your mom's gonna worry.

602
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,134
She's still at work.

603
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,813
Eugene, you need to go home
now. We are not going to admit you.

604
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,883
They're not gonna give you any
more drugs. You need to go home now.

605
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,384
Man, I ain't going
back. I can't.

606
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,983
Why not?

607
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,693
He'd be there.

608
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,562
- Who?
- Her boyfriend.

609
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,262
Your mom's.

610
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,072
Okay, so the two of
you don't get along?

611
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,899
He just does stuff.

612
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,813
Stuff like what?

613
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,227
I just need to
get some Dilantin.

614
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,696
Where is...?

615
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,430
Whoa, did somebody
alphabetize these?

616
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,869
Yeah, believe it or not.

617
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,909
- Why don't you just say it?
- Say what?

618
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,574
- You're mad.
- I'm not.

619
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:27,117
Right. It didn't bother you one
bit that I went over your head.

620
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,850
- See, that's what I'm talking about.
- What?

621
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,512
You won't tell me how you feel.

622
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,525
- Because it's fine.
- It's not fine, Luka.

623
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,788
If it were fine, you wouldn't have
avoided touching me just now.

624
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,955
- What?
- You... You bury your feelings...

625
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,431
you pretend that
they're not there.

626
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,900
I have feelings. But I
don't need to share them.

627
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,971
And I don't need to
share them here, okay?

628
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,041
Sorry to interrupt, but Megan
says she's in a lot of pain.

629
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,345
Give her another
four of morphine.

630
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,886
Bye.

631
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,253
Just try four of Zofran.

632
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,829
- How's your cake?
- It's good.

633
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,464
It was unexpected.

634
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,396
They should've waited.
Could've had a cake for both of us.

635
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,900
- Snack cake?
- No, thank you.

636
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,632
- What's wrong?
- Tsk. I didn't get tenure. Heh.

637
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,437
What?

638
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,837
Wait. Susan, who got
the slots if you didn't get it?

639
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,006
Slot, single. Well,
that'd be you.

640
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,412
I am so sorry.

641
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,349
Yeah, they gave me the usual
drivel about budget cuts and...

642
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,149
No, no, no. They've always
had more than one tenure slot.

643
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,782
Well, till now. Too bad it
was the year you applied.

644
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,428
What do you mean by that?

645
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,029
Just that... Nothing.

646
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,098
No, what do you
mean? I didn't earn it?

647
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,530
My funding of the outpatient
clinic got me tenure?

648
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,000
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- Worked my ass off.

649
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,435
- Yes, I know.
- Brought grants, published, taught.

650
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,472
I never asked for this.

651
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,211
You never wanted it,
Carter. You never did.

652
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:04,543
This is my home.
This is where I started.

653
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,785
This is where I want to stay.

654
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:11,987
And I get the feeling that half the time,
you would rather be anywhere but here.

655
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,726
Yeah, I thought so.

656
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,495
Iron Chef in 3 needs a non-occlusive
dressing, then he can go.

657
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,335
- How about you? You gonna go?
- You don't give up, do you?

658
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,035
Car's outside. Give me
trouble, you ride in the trunk.

659
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,804
All right, give me two minutes.

660
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,846
Don't try sneaking out the back.

661
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,643
Jerry, what's open?

662
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,377
I thought you'd be covering
"Smells Like Teen Spirit."

663
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,715
- Anything in Exam Two?
- We got one free bed.

664
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,085
- What are you doing?
- Admitting him.

665
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,522
I can see that. The
question is why?

666
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,717
Chuny? MARQUEZ: Yeah?

667
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:51,864
- Can you get Eugene settled in?
- Oh, sure.

668
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,431
You wanna come with me?

669
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,160
Uh...

670
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,360
He was raped.

671
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,102
This'll make you feel better.

672
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,208
I know her. She
lives in my building.

673
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:12,573
Her burns are minor. She's
gonna be okay, like you.

674
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,281
She used to bring food...

675
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,752
to the guy next door.

676
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,448
He was weird.

677
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,827
Had all this stuff stacked up.

678
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,959
He's probably dead, isn't he?

679
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:32,361
Your neighbor? I don't know.

680
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,900
I was the one who called 911.

681
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,872
Smart girl.

682
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:46,314
They didn't come as quick
as I thought they would.

683
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,750
I thought if I called
them before I did it...

684
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,553
I tried to put it out...

685
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,252
but it got too big.

686
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,492
Honey, are you okay?

687
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,624
Mommy. Mommy.

688
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,464
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

689
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,933
It's okay.

690
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,506
It's gonna be
okay. It'll be okay.

691
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,666
Yeah.

692
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,345
Now, how do you get an Irishman
up on the roof, huh? Ha-ha-ha.

693
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,674
You tell him the
drinks are on the house.

694
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:22,443
There's a man from Kerry, comes
into the bar with a pig under his arm.

695
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,645
The bartender says...

696
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,848
- Whoa! There you go.
- Thanks, lady.

697
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:29,517
- Mm-hm.
- Hey. Hey, get over here.

698
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,755
- Her name's Abby.
- Sorry, Uncle Jake.

699
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,093
All right, get out of
here. Get out of here.

700
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,032
- They're cute.
- Ha-ha.

701
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,171
A little loud.

702
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,831
You have to be. You gotta
raise your voice in a clan this big.

703
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,475
How am I doing?

704
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,945
Let's see.

705
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,981
With 99 percent
of the votes in...

706
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,054
it appears that
you are a keeper.

707
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:01,017
- Who's the holdout?
- Aunt Cecelia.

708
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,221
You lost points
when you told her...

709
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,556
you weren't sure if there
was a heaven or hell.

710
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,461
- Well, I'm not.
- Ha-ha. Doesn't bother me.

711
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,162
- I'm a pick-and-choose Catholic.
- Doesn't work that way.

712
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,203
Yeah, it does.

713
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:18,537
Honor thy father and mother,
thou shall not kill, given.

714
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,147
No premarital sex, no
birth control, not so much.

715
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:25,710
- Hey!
- Heh.

716
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,648
Pretty overwhelming, huh?

717
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,723
But in a good way.

718
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:39,595
- Do you wanna hear something stupid?
- I'd love to.

719
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:47,003
I never imagined there
were families like this.

720
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,509
- You're really lucky.
- Thank you.

721
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,176
And having said that...

722
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,440
- Yeah?
- I'm really, really ready to go home.

723
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,383
- All right. Okay.
- Okay.

724
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,618
There you are.

725
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,352
And to think I was gonna leave
because there wasn't any real men here.

726
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,257
- Mm. Good to see you.
- Give me some sugar.

727
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,227
- Ha-ha-ha.
- About damn time...

728
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,424
you got your fine self here.

729
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,694
- How you doing?
- Where have you been anyway?

730
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,134
Just working hard. I
ain't going nowhere.

731
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,740
Keep it moving. Sorry,
ladies. We'll be right back.

732
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,702
Yeah.

733
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,572
- Ha-ha. Yeah, yeah, look who's here!
- Ahhh!

734
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,547
- Oh!
- Oh, the doc.

735
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,481
Oh, man.

736
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,121
- Oh, my man.
- Happy birthday. Now shut up and dance.

737
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,758
- Who the man?
- You, son.

738
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,257
What's up, boy? What's up?

739
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,991
- Happy to see your boy up.
- What's up?

740
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:49,567
What you talking about? I see you
here by yourself. Where the chicks at?

741
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:52,330
Just get Mrs. Grayber
started on Compazine.

742
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:53,561
Yeah. CARTER: Haleh.

743
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,969
We need an ankle
series on Joan McVey in 3.

744
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,610
- Sure thing.
- Let me know how she's doing, okay?

745
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,104
What's Eugene still doing here?

746
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,545
Dr. Barnett admitted him.

747
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,016
Ray, your band's on two.

748
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,245
- You're late.
- Tell them I'll be right there.

749
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,820
- Yes. No, I realize that.
- Ray.

750
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:14,255
But no, no. Hold on. Yeah? Yes?

751
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,862
You dispo patients faster than a
speeding bullet and not in a good way.

752
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,123
Now that we're slammed, you
dump a drug seeker on the next shift...

753
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,927
so you can get to your next gig?

754
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:25,434
- I tried to warn him.
- It's more complicated.

755
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,834
Know what? You wanna
be a rock star, go for it.

756
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,635
But play weddings and bar
mitzvahs to make ends meet.

757
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,779
Because medicine is not a hobby
or another way to pay the bills.

758
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,346
Or plan B in case you
don't sell a million records.

759
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,177
It's what you wanna do or not.

760
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:47,186
Didn't mean for the fire to get so big.
She just wanted the firemen to come.

761
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,350
Pretty desperate for
her parents' attention.

762
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,359
I think she felt
shut out, you know?

763
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,230
Now she has to live with even more
pain. Three people dead, more wounded.

764
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,805
Social worker said she's gonna
go to juvie. Twelve years old.

765
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:05,410
- Sad.
- Yeah.

766
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,844
Why is it that we can talk
about anything other than us?

767
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,224
I don't know.

768
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:33,829
I think Lewis is right.
I think we need help.

769
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,348
- You good?
- No, man. I'm good.

770
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,386
Hey, man. Thought you had the
job at print shop. What happened?

771
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,854
Downsize, man. Gotta
get a new job soon.

772
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,687
Teesha says I get in her way
being home, mess up her routine.

773
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,228
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I know. Be a doctor.

774
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,729
Oh. Tss. ALL: Ha-ha-ha.

775
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,868
- Yeah. If Greg's one, how hard can it be?
- Right, right.

776
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,197
What time is it? I gotta
get up in the morning.

777
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,862
Hey, yo, check this out. - Uhn.

778
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,706
- Look at this.
- What you doing?

779
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,536
- Put that away.
- You don't need that.

780
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,769
- Come on, man. What?
- That loaded?

781
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,709
- Hell, yeah, it's loaded.
- Put it away.

782
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,406
- What are you doing?
- Let's get back to the party, man.

783
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,882
- What you doing?
- This is the real party here.

784
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,486
- Rooster.
- Remember...

785
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,527
- when we shot the lights out?
- I remember.

786
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,369
- That was a long time ago. Now stop.
- Oh!

787
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,982
- What you doing?
- Put that away!

788
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,559
This fires a bit crooked.
I think that's the problem.

789
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,697
No, you drunk, man.
That's the problem.

790
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,852
I'm 30. Last thing I
need is to be arrested.

791
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,267
- Put that away. ROOSTER:
Nobody's gonna get arrested.

792
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:42,154
I'm still nice with it.
You're just jealous.

793
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:43,178
Stupid.

794
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,467
Let's haul ass.
Let's haul ass, man.

795
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,657
How you doing?

796
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,530
Listen, I...

797
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,531
I really wish you'd told me.

798
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:25,740
Or, uh... That I'd asked.

799
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,988
Are you tired?

800
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,284
No.

801
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,058
Okay.

802
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:48,196
Why don't I stay here
until your mom gets here?

803
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,576
Are you a musician?

804
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,317
Not tonight, man.

805
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,378
Oh, yeah.

806
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,075
You know what, babe?

807
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:37,451
Weaver and the tenure board can
kiss my big, white, semi-hairy ass.

808
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,518
I shouldn't have got my
hopes up. Our hopes up.

809
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,387
It's okay. We're gonna be fine.

810
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,362
I just had all the money spent.

811
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:52,698
Buy a house, start a college fund
for Cosmo, take a damn vacation.

812
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,771
Hey, we'll figure it out.

813
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:00,242
You know what's funny?

814
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:02,138
I really wanted this.

815
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,243
I know. I know you did.

816
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,350
I know.

817
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,117
Hello? Kem?

818
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,655
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

819
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,458
Oh, not much.

820
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,627
I got awarded tenure today.

821
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:28,672
Thank you.

822
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:34,273
No, no, it is. It's very
nice. It's very nice.

823
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,613
We will. We will have
to celebrate sometime.

824
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:41,919
Really?

825
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,585
Are you serious?

826
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,989
How's the clinic?

827
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:52,825
Oh-ho.

828
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,330
Oh, they must have loved that.

829
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,903
I miss you too. Yeah.
