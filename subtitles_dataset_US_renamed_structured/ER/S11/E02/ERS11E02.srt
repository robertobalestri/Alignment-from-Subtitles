00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,302
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,740
- I don't know what to do.
- Go to your car and follow me to Chicago.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,304
Welcome to County, Dr. Lockhart.

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,677
Eight years of school.
So close to the finish.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,751
You gonna throw
away your future?

6
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,581
I'm not sure it's
the future I want.

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,518
You don't work here anymore.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,818
- When are you coming back?
- I'm not sure.

9
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,519
I've gotta rest.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,926
Get back into work.

11
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,002
<i>John.</i>

12
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,340
Kem?

13
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,839
Kem?

14
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,386
Can't sleep?

15
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,554
You'll get cold like that.

16
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,761
He'll come back.

17
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,694
We won't have any idea when.

18
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,365
Sleeping in one morning or on our way
home from a movie, he'll just show up.

19
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,871
Well, we'll deal with that.

20
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,609
- I don't know why you'd want to.
- I can think of a reason.

21
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,709
This place is too small.

22
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,047
- Maybe you should both live with me.
- What?

23
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,557
My apartment has two floors.

24
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,056
Alex can sleep downstairs.

25
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,925
Luka...

26
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,620
if we move in, it's gonna
be because we want to.

27
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,890
Not because you think
we need to be protected.

28
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,590
- Hey.
- I need to take a shower.

29
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,326
Hey.

30
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,729
Scrambled or fried?

31
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,834
Poached.

32
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,242
Poached?

33
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,655
Hello?

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,797
- What? Hello? WOMAN:
<i>This is Neela's mother.</i>

35
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,698
<i>We're on the way
in from the airport.</i>

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,702
Hold on a second.

37
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,643
It's for you.

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,875
<i>Hello, Neela?</i>

39
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,329
- You didn't tell your parents?
- I was waiting for the right time.

40
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,668
- When?
- My wedding day.

41
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,038
Hey, you know, you can
just put those anywhere.

42
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,009
They phoned Michigan.

43
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,171
The department head
told them I wasn't there.

44
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,011
- Those are still dirty.
- I'm totally screwed.

45
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,244
- What are you doing?
- Getting out of your way.

46
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,254
- Oh, please don't leave me.
- Neela, they're just your parents.

47
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,518
You think you've seen trauma at
work? You don't know the Rasgotras.

48
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,889
I know this may not
be the best time to ask...

49
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,361
but how long do you think
you'll be needing my couch?

50
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,129
Damn it.

51
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,805
Mom. Dad.

52
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,841
You remember Abby.

53
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,874
You look like hell.

54
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,383
Yeah, <i>The Searchers</i>
was on channel 9 last night.

55
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,079
It's tough to sleep in the
middle of a John Ford movie.

56
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,554
Talk to Jing-Mei?

57
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,125
Yeah, she's gonna start
seeing a physical therapist.

58
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,092
Pratt keeps calling, wants
Weaver to put him on the schedule.

59
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,461
- Doesn't even have his stitches out yet.
- Kyle Skinner, 23 years old.

60
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,898
- Found altered by his mom.
- He's had skin grafts.

61
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,902
- His headache's worse.
- Looks like dehiscence with cellulitis.

62
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,403
- What happened to him?
- Iraq.

63
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,236
He was a HEMTT driver in
the Sunni Triangle near Fallujah.

64
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,776
- One, two, three.
- Any meds? Allergies?

65
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,073
- Just Vicodin when he hurts.
- Lungs are clear.

66
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,649
What's the differential for altered
mental status with fever and headache?

67
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,653
This guy's a setup for all kinds of stuff.
But I'd go with meningitis all the way.

68
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,582
- Uh, Dr. Carter? KYLE:
Take me home, Ma.

69
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,197
All right, CBC...

70
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,425
blood and wound cultures,
LP, ceftriaxone, and a head CT.

71
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,042
- Roll him over.
- Easy, man.

72
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,968
We're gonna fix
you right up, okay?

73
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,505
No, you won't.

74
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,303
Head and shoulder in 3, Harold.

75
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,502
- Herman.
- Howard.

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,706
Ha. There is a God.

77
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,214
Took me five minutes to
track down a strep culture.

78
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,478
What are you waiting
for on this ankle sprain?

79
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,452
Needs a wrap, as soon as I
swab my football player's throat.

80
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,989
How many patients do you have?

81
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,387
- Ten.
- Twelve.

82
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,791
Can't be efficient if you get hung
up doing jobs other people can do.

83
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,523
- Sometimes it's easier...
- Your job is to move patients...

84
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,134
not wrap ankles or go
on hunts for strep cultures.

85
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,634
Learn to delegate to
nurses and med students.

86
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,137
Go see the migraine in 1.

87
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,635
Abby, your med student ordered
a bolus on the dehydrated kid.

88
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,575
- My med student?
- Penny Nicholson.

89
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,544
Dr. Weaver told me
I'd be shadowing you.

90
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,741
I need you to cosign the order.

91
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,744
Weird. Last week someone
was cosigning for me.

92
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,855
- Nice to be the boss.
- Sam, can you prep my forehead lac in 2?

93
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,492
- Yeah, I'm on my way.
- And can you do a throat swab...

94
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,356
- for the guy in Sutures.
- Fine.

95
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,994
- Something the matter?
- I'm getting slammed here.

96
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,430
In the time it took you to ask me,
you could have swabbed him yourself.

97
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,832
But you can do a setup
for Dr. Tiger Beat over there.

98
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,099
- That's my patient.
- It's okay, Sam. I'll do it.

99
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,174
- Thanks, Haleh.
- No problem.

100
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,902
Haleh, I think you might
have been off a decimal point...

101
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,276
- on my pyelo patient's dopamine.
- Excuse me?

102
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,679
I noticed it was running
at 3 cc's instead of 30.

103
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,686
I caught it early, but next time
maybe you could double-check.

104
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,693
Double-check the concentration
before you mess with the IV pump.

105
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,591
I mixed it 10 to one.

106
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,291
- Don't we always mix it one to one?
- No, you always mix it one to one.

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,935
- I always mix it ten to one.
- I didn't realize.

108
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,468
If you concentrate the drip...

109
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,299
- the bag will last longer.
- Sorry.

110
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:24,103
I'll go turn down her rate, make
sure her BP hasn't hit the roof.

111
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:30,543
Um, you know, nurses really are
the backbone of a place like this.

112
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,152
It's good to get
on their good side.

113
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,890
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

114
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,063
So when are you going
to tell us what's going on?

115
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,731
Ajay, relax.

116
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,620
I don't know if I
wanna be a doctor.

117
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,251
What?

118
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,986
I'm not sure I'm good at it.

119
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,757
Of course you're good at
it. You're good at everything.

120
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,630
Some send their children to medical
school, get a Nobel Prize on the mantel.

121
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,600
- Ajay, please.
- Why does she punish us?

122
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,605
I'm not trying to punish you.
I'm trying to figure things out.

123
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,608
- What's there to figure out?
- Like how I want my life to be.

124
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,509
- Neela, you're not a child anymore.
- Then stop treating me like one.

125
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,278
What about your
brothers and sisters?

126
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,510
Don't you think they
want to go to university?

127
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,848
We don't make enough
to pay for all that.

128
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,548
You promised to help out
once you began your Residency.

129
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,193
I'll help soon enough.
You'll have to wait a little.

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,455
Is that what you're going to tell
them? Their futures have to wait?

131
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,293
Because their sister is not
sure what she wants to be?

132
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,492
I'll have a job soon
and I'll send money.

133
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,570
- What job? Where?
- Here at the hospital, I hope.

134
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,037
- That's possible?
- I've talked to my supervisor.

135
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,505
She's trying to arrange it.

136
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,168
- Starting when?
- I'm supposed to discuss it today.

137
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,142
If the third neb doesn't
break her, call her up.

138
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,308
- Call her up?
- To Medicine, to be admitted.

139
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,545
- Call the Resident.
- Should I write this down?

140
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,817
- What year did you say you were?
- Labs are back on your guy, Dr. Lockhart.

141
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,654
- Something wrong?
- I heard what you did.

142
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,853
- Um, excuse me.
- Changed the bedpan in 2...

143
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,430
- and dug out the earwax in 1.
<i>- Et tu</i>, Chuny?

144
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,432
Acetaminophen
level on pharmacy girl.

145
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,160
- What, so now I'm the bane of all nurses?
- Anything else?

146
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,669
- You can stop the Mucomyst.
- Yes, doctor.

147
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,034
- Abby?
- What?

148
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,405
Anterior glenohumeral dislocation.
I was hoping you could take a look.

149
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,012
- Did you try to reduce it?
- The girl won't let me.

150
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,944
She's crying a lot.

151
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,617
Hi. I'm Dr. Lockhart.

152
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,776
- Are you her mom?
- I'm her aunt.

153
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,115
She cannot move it. I
tried to fix at home but...

154
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,849
- Okay. What's her name?
- Marta.

155
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,585
Marta, I'm gonna show
you a trick with a sheet...

156
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,196
that's gonna make your
arm feel much better, okay?

157
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,891
- She doesn't speak much English.
- Um, okay.

158
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,793
All right?

159
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,701
- Three of Versed, 50 of fent.
- You sure you wanna use both?

160
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,466
Yes. Can you hook
up some blow-by?

161
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,143
- Blow-by?
- I'll get it.

162
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,803
- You don't think the Versed is enough?
- I think it will be too painful.

163
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,039
Marta.

164
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,981
Uh... Sheet. Okay?

165
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,283
Here you go.

166
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,890
- Versed's in. ABBY:
Penny, come here.

167
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,489
I'm not really familiar
with this technique.

168
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:28,153
It's okay.

169
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,728
All right.

170
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,388
- Go ahead with the fent.
- O2's not ready.

171
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,058
Fifty of fent sounds like
a lot on top of the Versed.

172
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,796
- That's what I was saying.
- Listen, team.

173
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,134
We're shoving a bone
back into its socket.

174
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,142
- You'd want all the meds in the hospital.
- It could suppress her respiratory drive.

175
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,177
I'm aware of that, Howard.

176
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,976
That's why I asked
for oxygen. Okay.

177
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,580
On the count of three, I want you
to lean back as hard as you can.

178
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,244
This is gonna go fast.

179
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,850
Okay, one, two, three.

180
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,593
- Cool.
- We can go now?

181
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,254
Um...

182
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,627
There's a cut here too.

183
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,530
We should clean that out.

184
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,170
Ceftriaxone's in.

185
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,933
The CT shows a sinus
infection that's spread to his brain.

186
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,977
We can isolate it with a tap but he
has to go up to the O.R. for drainage.

187
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,613
Hold still, Kyle. Little pinch.

188
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,980
- When was he wounded?
- In February.

189
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,608
- Okay. One more minute.
- I've been with him the whole way.

190
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,119
Finally got him home
on Tuesday and now this.

191
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,892
Yeah, fluid's cloudy.

192
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,999
That means an infection, right?

193
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,635
Almost done. You okay, Kyle?
- Yeah.

194
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,567
Okay, we are done.

195
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,900
- You want me to run those to the lab?
- Yeah.

196
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,975
Stay there while they
do the Gram's stain.

197
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,736
They like to lose
things up there.

198
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,403
Okay, you can sit up now.

199
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:00,310
Why don't you try and get some
sleep, and I will be back in a little bit.

200
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,352
- Can't sleep.
- I will see what I can do...

201
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,650
- about moving you to a...
- Doesn't matter.

202
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,383
Try to get some rest, huh?

203
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,996
In my dreams, I'm still
the guy I used to be.

204
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,662
But I always wake up.

205
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,329
Did you get a history?

206
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,438
<i>No hablo</i>, and they didn't
have any paperwork, so...

207
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,041
And no address and
no phone number.

208
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,677
- Okay. ROSARIO:
She better now. We go.

209
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,608
Get a guard over here, okay?

210
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,845
- Hi.
- Feels good, <i>gracias.</i>

211
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,349
Okay, but I'm gonna
give you a complete exam.

212
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,850
What for?

213
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:41,851
<i>Hermanos?</i>

214
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,123
Sisters, three.

215
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,467
See there?

216
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,696
<i>- Qué pasó?</i>
- The girls play crazy sometimes.

217
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,075
Okay. <i>Los pantalones.</i>
Can you take them off?

218
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,244
- Why you look at her legs?
- Everybody gets a full exam.

219
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,413
We don't have time.
Marta, <i>vámonos.</i>

220
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,058
Ma'am, you can't leave.

221
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,251
Ma'am, you don't want
to do that. Stop them.

222
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,791
- What are you doing?
- Calm down, ma'am, calm down.

223
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,230
- Calm down.
- Get away from me.

224
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,734
Take her to the conference
room. I'll get the girl.

225
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,098
Marta. Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

226
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,444
- Slut, <i>puta!</i>
- Okay, listen, listen.

227
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,241
<i>Tranquila. Tranquila,</i>
okay? I'm not gonna hurt you.

228
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,577
I'm not going to hurt you.

229
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,614
Okay?

230
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,145
Okay.

231
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,459
I wasn't aware that
there was a dress code.

232
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:51,223
I just don't want you to create
any discomfort with the patients.

233
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,697
The patients, or
the other doctors?

234
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,369
- It's the jewelry, isn't it?
- No.

235
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,233
Fingernails, tattoo, the hair?

236
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,730
It's the whole package.

237
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:06,004
Okay. I'll talk to my band mates
and see if I can't pull it back a little.

238
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,576
- Band mates?
- It appears we've hired...

239
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,913
the love child of Ozzy Osbourne.

240
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,916
- So did Kem get back okay?
- Yep.

241
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,352
- Have you heard from her?
- She sent me an e-mail.

242
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,515
- Dr. Weaver.
- She and I are just sort of...

243
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,752
taking a little time
to... How's Henry?

244
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,829
He's pretty great. Thanks.

245
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,487
Your folks are back in Chicago.

246
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,193
- That's great. Where are they?
- They're across the street. Dr. Weaver in?

247
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,201
Yes, she is, just
down the hall there.

248
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,431
Hi, Dr. Carter.
How is everything?

249
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,007
Um... Nice to see you, Neela.

250
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,876
- Wait, what's she doing here?
- I'm not really sure.

251
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,278
- I am not a victim!
- Whose patient is that?

252
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,786
- I did the H and P, waiting on a doctor.
- Okay, ma'am. You need to settle down.

253
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,084
- I am the solution to the problem!
- Hard restraints.

254
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,126
I am not the problem!

255
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,627
Actually, right now you are.

256
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,629
- He forgot to write it down.
- He's lying.

257
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,791
- He wouldn't let me take it.
- You're a liar.

258
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,231
- You a liar.
- You are.

259
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,805
- Dr. Weaver, do you have a minute?
- Malik, take his temperature again.

260
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,306
I decided not to do my
internship at Ann Arbor.

261
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,307
I know. Your department
head called me.

262
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,414
He wanted to know if we detected any
psychiatric problems during your rotation.

263
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,107
- What did you tell him?
- I lied.

264
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,779
I didn't wanna be there. I'm not
even sure I want to be a doctor.

265
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,923
So, what can I do for you?

266
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:29,295
Give me a position, a job, any kind
of job, just until I get myself refocused.

267
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,391
- But you don't want to be a doctor?
- No, what I meant...

268
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,093
I have no idea what I meant.
I just... I need some work.

269
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,397
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't...
Can't really help you.

270
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,099
I'll take anything. I can stock
supplies or be a candy striper.

271
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,073
Neela, can I give
you some advice?

272
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,235
Go back to Michigan
before it's too late.

273
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,579
<i>Está bien?</i> Does that hurt?

274
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,089
Well...

275
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,826
your aunt has to
answer some questions.

276
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,498
Why do you call her <i>mamacita?</i>

277
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,030
Is she your mother?

278
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,666
You said she was
your aunt, right?

279
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,347
What?

280
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,685
She... She keeps us.

281
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,320
She keeps who?
You and your sisters?

282
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,359
Not sisters. Only girls.

283
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,830
Is <i>mamacita</i> the one
that's been hurting you?

284
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,133
You can tell me.

285
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,841
Okay.

286
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,808
It's okay. You're safe
here. Who's hurting you?

287
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,681
Marta, who hurt you?

288
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,882
<i>Los hombres.</i>

289
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,923
Military medical record on Kyle Skinner.
His mom had someone drop them off.

290
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,690
Yeah, thanks.

291
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,575
Coffee break?

292
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,115
No, I put vodka in
here on special days.

293
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,828
I wasn't trying to be
a hero this morning.

294
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,136
I asked you to
move in because I...

295
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,534
I love you.

296
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,478
I'm in love with you, and I...

297
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:05,209
I thought, I don't know,
maybe you feel the same.

298
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,819
Did you just say that?

299
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,151
I've spent too much
time wasting time.

300
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,558
So whenever you're
ready, just let me know.

301
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,295
You guys doctors? My
buddy needs some help.

302
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,135
Herm Bullard. I'm a marine
biologist over at the aquarium.

303
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,470
Hey, over here. HERM:
There's been an incident...

304
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,840
- during a tank cleaning.
- What the hell is that?

305
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,608
<i>Ginglymostoma
cirratum,</i> a nurse shark.

306
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,341
Damn fish just latched onto me.

307
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,349
- We need them disconnected.
- You think?

308
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,978
It's important that neither Mr. Fahey
nor the shark be damaged in any way.

309
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,590
- I'll get a gurney.
- Wheelchair.

310
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,750
Keep pouring water on
him, Mort. He's suffocating.

311
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,422
Chuny, I have a patient in Sutures.
I need you to help me get a history.

312
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,692
Last I checked, an H
and P was a doctor's job.

313
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,529
She's in trouble, and my
Spanish is not very good.

314
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,433
- The one with her aunt?
- Not her aunt.

315
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,938
Chuny, can you change
the pressure dressing in 1?

316
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,135
- Security has her in custody.
- I'll be over there in a minute.

317
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,940
- He'll only live for 30 minutes like this.
- What?

318
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,709
- Not you, Mort, the shark.
- You're just making it worse.

319
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,817
Get me three grams of Unasyn IV.

320
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,853
- Can you feel this?
- Clem, go get the tank from the truck.

321
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,490
He's got a mouthful
of subcu fat.

322
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,888
Is that something
I can live without?

323
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,392
- Is that my subcu fat...
- Hey, watch it.

324
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:33,032
Okay. You don't have a job here,
so we are taking you to Michigan.

325
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,674
- No, Dad.
- It's a good hospital.

326
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,504
- Dermatology is a lucrative field.
- It's not what I want.

327
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,647
What do you want?
To be like this man?

328
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,406
- Ajay.
- I don't know.

329
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,210
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- I've heard enough.

330
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,518
Ajay, will you go get us a cab?

331
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,689
Excuse me?

332
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,083
We are getting your
things. We rent a car.

333
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,457
And then we go.
And that's final.

334
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,464
He doesn't get it, Mom.

335
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,007
You think he doesn't
get it? We get it.

336
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,610
- You're the one that doesn't get it.
- Don't you start in on me.

337
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,441
Neela, when I married your
father, I was younger than you are.

338
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:19,381
Sure, I loved him. But do you think I
didn't have grander ideas for my life...

339
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,453
than running a curry
house in Southall?

340
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,555
Then let me find my own path.

341
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,216
Passing up the opportunity that you
have been given is not the way to do it.

342
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,760
- I've worked hard for it.
- So have we all.

343
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,627
All those years at the restaurant,
saving, planning for your future.

344
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,201
- I just need some time.
- Sorry, love. Time's up.

345
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,272
I've always done
everything you've asked.

346
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,069
Everything. Even the damn viola.

347
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,803
I had to learn to play
the sheet music perfectly.

348
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,913
I was never allowed
to play what I wanted.

349
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,313
- You wanted to play rock music.
- Or to improvise, or be creative.

350
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,613
- You can't improvise the viola.
- You can try.

351
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,815
- So you want to be a musician now?
- No, Mom.

352
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,323
I want to improvise.

353
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,599
A man abducted her
from a bus stop in Mexico.

354
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,173
When did this happen?

355
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:20,774
You were 12? How
old are you now?

356
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,537
<i>No sé.</i>

357
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,547
So, what happened
after the man took you?

358
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,830
They made me <i>dañada.</i>

359
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,688
Damage girl.

360
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,831
What is "damage girl"?

361
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,375
The men, they hit her,
or do what they want.

362
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,569
Anything they want.

363
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,344
When's the last time
you spoke to your family?

364
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:08,225
Once, a long time ago, she
snuck off and called her parents.

365
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,825
She told them she didn't
know when she'd be home.

366
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,998
She told them not to cry.

367
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,540
Okay, Marta.

368
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,908
We're gonna help
you now, all right?

369
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,748
Okay?

370
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,187
My name's not Marta.

371
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,482
My real name is...

372
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,659
Tesoro.

373
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,594
- We are going, Ajay.
- Good.

374
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,597
- Home. Neela's staying here.
- What?

375
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,996
I love you, Mom.

376
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,636
Get in the car, Ajay.

377
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,271
I hope you know that we
can't help you anymore.

378
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,875
I'll find a job. I'll send
something for Rajiv when I can.

379
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,587
When you were little, you used to tell me
that you always dreamed of being a bird...

380
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:13,055
so that you could
fly far, far away.

381
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,358
Well, you've finally
done it, haven't you?

382
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,146
I called the factory where
Tesoro's parents work.

383
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,479
- Did you talk to someone?
- Through a translator.

384
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,918
- Secretary gave us this number.
- Great. Get Chuny for me, will you?

385
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,786
She's a real piece of
work. Asking for asylum...

386
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,758
saying she's as much a victim
of the Lenones as the girls.

387
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,558
- Lenones?
- Organizations of traffickers and pimps...

388
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,496
that bring these girls in
and set them up in houses.

389
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,135
- You've seen this before?
- A bit.

390
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,829
She'll be put in custody and
we'll search the apartment.

391
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,237
- What about the girl?
- All the girls we've put into foster care.

392
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,674
Children's Services and
the INS will get into it.

393
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,008
- She needs to go home to her parents.
- Yeah.

394
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,454
- Hey, where are your folks?
- Gone.

395
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,518
- Are you crying?
- No.

396
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,024
I'm sorry. I'm off at
8. We can talk then.

397
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,026
- I'll wait around.
- You're waiting around for three hours?

398
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,756
I've got nothing better to do.

399
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:32,166
Okay. Hey, you don't
speak Spanish, do you?

400
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:37,003
Punjabi, French, a bit of Farsi,
smattering of German, some...

401
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,372
All right, all right, all right.

402
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,749
Hi.

403
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,878
- How's your shoulder?
- What happens now?

404
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,515
Maybe you can go home to Mexico?

405
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,190
They don't love me.

406
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,332
They don't want me.

407
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,758
Of course they do.

408
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,166
No more.

409
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,840
Wanna call them?

410
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,413
I have a number
where I think they'll be.

411
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,289
- Maybe we should try.
- Too long now. I'm gone too long.

412
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,221
Let's try it.

413
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,692
It's ringing.

414
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,011
Hello?

415
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,581
Mama?

416
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,460
- Get any sleep?
- What do you think?

417
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,123
So your mom says that
you don't want the surgery?

418
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,694
It's relatively minor. They're just
gonna touch up your cheek implant.

419
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:17,775
A drop in the ocean,
right? Whatever.

420
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,477
Okay.

421
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,937
You a Democrat?

422
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,914
Yeah, most of the time.

423
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,452
People rag on this war.

424
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:34,450
I say it was a good thing. Gave
a lot of people their freedom.

425
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:41,258
- Well, it's good that you feel that way.
- Where the hell would I be if I didn't?

426
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,873
- I hear you got engaged.
- I was.

427
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,912
Her name's Karen.

428
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,080
- What happened?
- She tried to come see me at Bethesda.

429
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,648
I wouldn't let her.

430
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,084
You think she would've
given up on you that easy?

431
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:09,490
Karen's a good
girl. She's the best.

432
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:14,029
Sometimes things happen that
even the best people can't get past.

433
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,702
Maybe in a few years I
won't think about her anymore.

434
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,370
What kind of shark was it?
- A nurse shark.

435
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,274
We got a few of
those working here.

436
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,540
It says here they
adapt well to captivity.

437
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,480
Sounds like a nurse to me.
- Not all of us.

438
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,713
"They tend to move slowly within a
relatively small range during the day."

439
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,515
- Hey, easy.
- Watch it.

440
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,050
Nobody has any
work to do today, huh?

441
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:53,005
- Want me to take a look at that?
- This? It's nothing.

442
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,574
Why don't you take off early?
We got things under control here.

443
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,872
I got some follow-ups
to do. And my vet guy...

444
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,241
I'll take care of it.

445
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,582
Okay. Thank you.

446
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:13,052
Nineteen-year-old attacked in
Grant Park. Complains of belly pain.

447
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,217
I'm Dr. Lockhart. Can
you tell me your name?

448
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,728
Good airway, sats 98,
pulse 133, BP 104/58.

449
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,695
- They hit us.
- Who hit you, honey?

450
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,428
- They hit us with a tire jack.
- Initial GCS 15, mental status is waning.

451
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,767
- Help my boyfriend. Help Zack first.
- Wait here, I'll check the other.

452
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,909
Blunt trauma to head and torso.
Agonal on the scene, LMA placed.

453
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,205
Sats 78/100 percent. Pulse
thready and irregular, 120.

454
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,371
- Flail chest.
- God, are they gonna be okay?

455
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,949
- Give us room to work.
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.

456
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,519
We were sitting in the grove, a
bunch of us. I'd never been there before.

457
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,714
- Belly's tense.
- Four guys came from nowhere.

458
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,554
Just started beating them,
just because they were kissing.

459
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,787
I'll take this one in T-2. You
and Haleh with the other in T-1.

460
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,237
This guy's less critical.

461
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,264
- Shouldn't I...?
- Just go.

462
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,627
- Curved Kelly.
- Sats are 72. Heart rate's dropping.

463
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:03,503
- Sure the ET's in good position?
- Put it through the cords. 36 French.

464
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,805
- What do you hear?
- Distant breath sounds.

465
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,574
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

466
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,014
- Okay, I'll tighten up the clamp.
- Hook him up. Get the Cell Saver.

467
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,987
HemoCue's 5.2 after
two units of O-neg.

468
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,147
Hang another two on the
rapid infuser. Start another PIV.

469
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,987
- He's too clamped down.
- Well, set me up for a subclavian.

470
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,823
- I'll do it right after this. Ten blade.
- Sats down to 68.

471
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,499
- It's getting harder to bag.
- Bradycardia at 47.

472
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,431
- Mg of atropine, amp of epi.
- There's blood in the ET tube.

473
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,664
Well, suction it. Open
platelets and FFP.

474
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:37,837
I'm in.

475
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,308
- Any blankets in here?
- Check in the warmer.

476
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,175
- You guys okay?
- Lost the pulse.

477
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,312
PEA. Starting compressions.
Sam, get Kovac in here.

478
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,085
- Sats are down to 82.
- I got a good look at those guys.

479
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,491
- I can tell the police.
- The grove always seemed safe.

480
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,859
Tom, we're inserting a
tube to help you breathe.

481
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,193
- Twenty of etomidate.
- Abby's asking for you.

482
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,337
This guy needs to be tubed now.
Where's Howard? He can help.

483
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:08,099
- Stuck in CT with a kid in status.
- Meds are ready.

484
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,869
We're gonna send you to the O.R. so
surgeons can stop the bleeding, okay?

485
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:16,071
- Zack. How is he?
- He's gonna need another crit.

486
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,883
- He's out.
- They'll be able to fix it, right?

487
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,881
The surgeons, they'll stop the
bleeding. That's what you said.

488
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:29,391
- They're gonna do everything they can.
- What's that mean?

489
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,789
Tube.

490
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,328
It's really tachy, 145.

491
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,899
What do you mean,
"Everything they can"?

492
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,899
Okay, page Corday again.

493
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,869
You can't just kill people
for kissing in the park.

494
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,368
- Robert, don't go in there.
- Hold compressions.

495
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,035
Still PEA. Rate 38.

496
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,908
- What's happening?
- Let them work.

497
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,345
Resume compressions.
How long since the last epi?

498
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,882
- About 30 seconds.
- Atropine?

499
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,871
- Just pushed it.
- How much fluid?

500
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,584
Liter of LR, seven units of
O-neg, and another two going in.

501
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,419
Can I switch out?
My arms are tired.

502
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,118
- Maybe the meds aren't getting in.
- We got good flow through all the lines.

503
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,498
No pneumo, no tamponade,
temp's okay, tube's good, got bicarb.

504
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,365
The obvious cause is hypovolemia.
We're slamming fluids in.

505
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,905
- Can you check the pupils again?
- Tox screen's back. Negative.

506
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,643
- Thoracotomy?
- Not with blunt trauma.

507
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,880
Fixed and dilated.

508
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,540
Should I put in a central line? You
think that would make any difference?

509
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,211
- Haleh?
- You have three IVs with good flow.

510
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,292
Yeah, but if we had central access,
maybe we could get the blood in faster.

511
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,756
- Sam?
- Maybe. I don't know.

512
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,456
Okay. Two liters out of the
chest. Two liters out of the chest.

513
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,760
If anybody has any opinion
about this, please speak up.

514
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,805
It's your call, Abby.
You're the doctor.

515
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,982
Hey, Dr. Carter.

516
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,585
Patrick.

517
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,694
Hey, I'll get you an iced
coffee and a BLT right away.

518
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:15,062
Maybe something else today.

519
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,176
- Holding compression.
- Junctional rhythm: 24.

520
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,837
- No pulse.
- What's our time?

521
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,246
Forty-two minutes.

522
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,754
You have anything
you wanna say to him?

523
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,871
Zack, thank you.

524
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,214
You made me strong.

525
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,884
You let me see who I was.

526
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,418
And to know that it was okay.

527
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,761
Come on, Robert. Let's go
talk to the police now, okay?

528
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:31,009
I didn't know I was gay
until they became my friends.

529
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,081
Four fifty-three p.m.

530
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,384
Guide wire back. Run the
FFP and platelets up here.

531
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,962
- My guy died.
- Can you throw in a femoral line?

532
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,294
Tell the O.R. if Corday isn't
here soon, I'll bring him up myself.

533
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:59,464
- Hematoma on the left. Try the right.
- Could've used a little help in there.

534
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,305
- BP's dropping, 55/44.
- Narrowed pulse pressure.

535
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:07,742
- Muffled heart sounds.
- Pericardiocentesis needle to Abby.

536
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,814
Raise the head of the bed.

537
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,085
- Lost the pulse.
- Okay. Mg of epi. Have atropine ready.

538
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,952
- Angle the needle.
- I know.

539
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,482
Ectopy on the monitor.

540
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,753
I need another syringe, quick.

541
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,429
Carotid's back. Good job, Abby.

542
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,931
- Sorry, I was going to Grand Rounds.
- Trauma, bleeding into the belly.

543
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,934
Complicated by a bloody
pericardial effusion and tamponade.

544
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,596
Set up Room 5 for an ex-lap. Tell
Dr. Edson he's gonna have to do it.

545
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:40,439
- Two hundred and fifty cc's out.
- Right. Let's get him upstairs.

546
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,377
Systolic's up to 88.

547
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,020
- Nicely done.
- You left me alone in there.

548
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,158
We had two traumas.

549
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,692
Last week I had to get
approval for everything I do.

550
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,022
Suddenly, I'm supposed
to run a code by myself.

551
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,631
- Welcome to internship.
- I was tentative and unsure.

552
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,359
- I was asking nurses for advice.
- They respect openness.

553
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,697
They respond to being
treated like team members.

554
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,339
- You always did.
- Luka, the boy's dead.

555
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,202
And I don't think he got
the best possible care.

556
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:14,710
We gave the best possible care
to the one I thought we could save.

557
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,713
And we gave the
next best to your guy.

558
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,678
- What?
- He had coded when they brought him in.

559
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:26,223
He had barely any vitals, and he was fixed
and dilated. The guy was already gone.

560
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,751
- So, what? I never had a chance?
- He never had a chance.

561
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:34,263
You'll have one sooner than you want.
15 minutes, an hour, tomorrow maybe.

562
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,428
You still here?

563
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,434
- I'm addicted to this zombie game.
- You missed that guy.

564
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,834
- Which one's that? "Pain Killer"?
- No.

565
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,200
- Hello again.
- I thought you went home.

566
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,744
There's something I meant to do.

567
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,507
- Everything okay, John?
- I just gotta talk to this guy.

568
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,412
- Can we talk, please?
- Just one minute.

569
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:56,715
- I thought you were gone.
- Call Karen. Okay?

570
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,356
Bad things happen to everybody.

571
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,755
But you two have to at least
take a shot at getting through this.

572
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:05,590
So... call her.

573
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,559
You can live through this.
You can live through all this.

574
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,794
- But you may never get over losing her.
- Dr. Carter.

575
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,931
- Okay, you guys. Let's take a walk, John.
- Call her. You hear me?

576
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:21,102
- Yeah, he hears you.
- Let's go to the lounge.

577
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,941
Call her.

578
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,640
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's fine.

579
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:29,185
The lady from CPS is here.
- Thank you.

580
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,113
Hi. I'm Dr. Lockhart. You're
from Children's Services?

581
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,091
- Marie Barclay. Here for Marta Delgado.
- Her name's Tesoro.

582
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:39,390
- They told me Marta.
- No. So when can she go home?

583
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,590
We'll be in touch with
the Mexican Consulate.

584
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,292
They'll locate the family, we'll
send someone to pick her up.

585
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,563
- The family's very poor.
- We'll figure it out.

586
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,970
- And how long will that take?
- Well, she'll be placed in foster care...

587
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,441
until the INS clears her. Once that
happens, should be a few months.

588
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,445
- Like two?
- Six, eight months at the most.

589
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,845
Of getting bounced around
between foster families.

590
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:02,749
- I don't think she can take it.
- We'll do our best to look after her.

591
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,957
Sorry. Okay, I'll go
get her. Just wait here.

592
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,570
I have a conference
soon. Will it be long?

593
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:12,996
No, I'll make it quick.

594
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,335
- The train station?
- She'll need ID for the airport.

595
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,836
- Do you have money?
- Do you know what you're doing?

596
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,975
I'm calling her parents to tell
them she'll be there in two days.

597
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:27,772
There's all my cash. Take this cred...
Don't take that one, take this one. Okay.

598
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,940
- I can't just whisk her away.
- Do you have something better to do?

599
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:36,113
- I go? ABBY: Yep.
Honey, you go now. Okay?

600
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,778
- Your name?
- Abby.

601
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,187
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> Abby.

602
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,361
Okay, you gotta run.

603
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,895
And don't take her through
the bay. Take her out the front.

604
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,373
I don't know what happened.

605
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:01,904
You had a rough time.
It's not hard to understand.

606
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,539
I guess I just thought
it would help somehow.

607
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,981
Help what?

608
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,328
- What else is going on?
- Nothing.

609
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,395
No, I'm fine.

610
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:25,894
Looked bad all day. I wasn't
the only one who noticed.

611
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,863
Well, I did get hit in the
head by a psycho patient.

612
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,110
You can talk to me, John.

613
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,321
I've been having
trouble sleeping.

614
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,360
I keep having these dreams.

615
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,738
And I miss her.

616
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,777
And I miss the baby.

617
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,479
And I miss all the stuff that I
thought we were gonna have.

618
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:29,424
And I don't know how
to get any of it back.

619
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,772
Here's your ticket.
Chicago to L.A...

620
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,605
L.A. to San Diego,
then a bus to Tijuana.

621
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:44,112
This envelope has $200
in it. It's yours. Keep it safe.

622
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:46,751
The train leaves from Track
11 in five minutes, okay?

623
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,813
Okay, good luck.

624
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,681
You need to get
on that train now.

625
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,026
It's all right. You can do it.
It's simple. Tickets. Money.

626
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,998
- Dr. Lockhart, I'm still waiting.
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

627
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,168
When I went to get
Tesoro, she wasn't there.

628
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,507
- I think she ran off.
- Was anyone watching her?

629
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,981
- I have a nurse looking for her right now.
- I have to call my office.

630
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:24,486
- You people need better security.
- We say that every year.

631
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,623
- Hi.
- Hey.

632
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,958
I lost my cell phone.

633
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,629
There's a meeting over at St.
John's if you want me to go with you.

634
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,702
Yeah. No, that's all right.

635
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,729
Just a little slip.

636
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:46,304
All the crap I used to give
you. I'm kind of a hypocrite.

637
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,675
No. We're all hypocrites.

638
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,749
- Need a ride home?
- No, I took the train.

639
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,647
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

640
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,654
Hey. What do you want me to do
with the med records on the vet guy?

641
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,257
Um...

642
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,087
I'll take them. I'll have
them sent up to the O.R.

643
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,358
Luka.

644
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,070
- I thought you were still on.
- For a while, yeah.

645
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:21,271
Uh, you know what you
said earlier over on the steps?

646
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,241
Me too.

647
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:33,623
So come on by later and
I'll make you some eggs.

648
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,592
Okay.

649
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,631
Hey.

650
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:31,580
Hey, Kem. It's John.
