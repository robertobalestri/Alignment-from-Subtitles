1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,897
<i>Previouslyon</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,202
- What do you want me to call you?
- How about introducing me as Abby?

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,470
You don't want people
to know we're going out.

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,671
- Dr. Pratt.
- Olivia Evans, I'm with Ceasefire.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,941
- Ceasefire?
- Violence prevention program.

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,278
- What's she like?
- She's a health professional.

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,478
- Don't be such a dog.
- Where did this happen?

8
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,282
Twenty-third. BIRDY: Wabash.

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,123
- Well, it... It was near the corner.
- Did you file a police report?

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,819
- What's the point?
- She and her sister panhandle on Wabash.

11
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:32,228
- I give them a buck once in a while.
- I need this for my application.

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,426
Trust me. It's gonna take a
hell of a lot more than that.

13
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,610
Yeah, I called Sid. And, no, he
doesn't have anything new to show us.

14
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,044
We need a new realtor.
He's shown us 17 houses...

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,117
- not one of them close.
- Don't think the problem could be us?

16
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,311
All right, what
about this one? No.

17
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,615
It doesn't seem fair
to schedule it like that.

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,351
You work all night, now you
gotta rush back. You're tired.

19
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,961
What do you mean, I'm
tired? Do I look like I'm tired?

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,690
Of course not. No. You
look chipper. It's just...

21
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,768
- Ah, smoodge.
- You're just... You're worrying so much.

22
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,100
You know, they don't schedule
tenure meetings around the candidates.

23
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,400
Hey, at least you're
overthinking the wardrobe.

24
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,477
I am not worrying. And
I am not overthinking.

25
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,977
You know, tenure
means financial security.

26
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,447
We could get a house, start
a college fund for Cosmo.

27
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,609
What if Cosmo doesn't
want to go to college?

28
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,756
- What?
- Baby, I can go back to work.

29
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,183
- I know.
- You can make more at a private hospital.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,194
No. It's not about the
money. I want to be at County.

31
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,161
It's where I belong.

32
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,769
Okay. I'm gonna leave these here.
Promise me you'll step over them.

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,700
- I promise.
- All right. I gotta go, baby.

34
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,000
I love you. And you too.

35
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,941
- Oh, Susan.
- I have one meeting, then I will be home.

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,444
- Susan.
- How do I look?

37
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,344
You look great except, uh, just:

38
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,780
Smoodge.

39
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,145
Ugh.

40
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,821
Jules Rubadoux, 85.

41
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,687
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

42
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,419
You're a doctor? You
got a high school diploma?

43
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,858
Eighty-five, fainted.

44
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,626
- I did not faint. I was tripped.
- It was witnessed.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,133
Syncopal event at his club.
Unconscious 30 seconds.

46
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,499
Who told you that?
Those old geezers?

47
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,698
They're unconscious
most of the day.

48
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,139
- Must've been a long ride.
- Oh, tell me about it.

49
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,040
Get out of here!
Bring back the omelet!

50
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,840
- Okay, we'll see what we can do.
- Now!

51
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,040
Delirium, tachycardia,
hyperthermia, mydriasis.

52
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,412
- Better not have spinach!
- What do you think?

53
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,451
Don't get high by
snorting antihistamines?

54
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,644
I hate spinach.

55
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,551
Come on, guys. This is classic.
Mad as a hatter, red as a beet...

56
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,717
- Dry as a bone.
- Anticholinergic toxicity.

57
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,692
Bingo. What's your plan?

58
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,355
IV, tox screen,
activated charcoal.

59
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,694
- Yes. What else?
- EKG, rule out cardiac effects.

60
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,700
- Mm-hm.
- Ativan for the agitation.

61
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,031
Excellent. Ah.

62
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,403
And what happens if the
delirium worsens despite benzos?

63
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:00,514
Physostigmine. The only
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor...

64
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,515
that crosses the blood-brain
barrier. Everybody get that?

65
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,516
Where do I sign
to get out of here?

66
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,086
We need to examine you first.

67
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,418
If I wanted help, I wouldn't
come to this place looking for it.

68
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,253
- I want another hospital.
- We're just gonna check you out.

69
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,953
- I don't want this place.
- It won't take long.

70
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,689
- I don't want your doctors.
- Dr. Carter, we need you.

71
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,697
- Okay.
- Especially that one.

72
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,599
I don't want that one
anywhere near me.

73
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,262
He killed my wife.

74
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,330
Sam, what's the deal
with my lymphoma guy?

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,298
CT was ready for
him 40 minutes ago.

76
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,334
Man, I totally spaced.
I'll go take him.

77
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,736
Uh, don't bother. They got a seizing
ICU player. Be backed up a while.

78
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,375
Okay. Oh! PRATT: Whoa.

79
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,943
- Crap. Sorry.
- That was the Guatemalan blend.

80
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,307
- I said sorry.
- Come on. Let's move some bodies.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,779
Transfer from Seashore
House, fever and incontinence.

82
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,044
I got stuck with the last dump.
Abby, I'll trade you. Whatever you get.

83
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,155
- Uh, no, Ray. Don't think so.
- Neela, 85-year-old man with syncope.

84
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,959
- The one you brought in.
- The guy that yelled at Carter?

85
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,255
Afraid so. And as much as I hate
doing this to you, I'm out of here.

86
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,026
Exam 3.

87
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,964
I've served on the curriculum and
admissions committees for three years.

88
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,505
And we appreciate that. We're also
looking for excellence in teaching.

89
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,508
You've won the Resident
teaching award three years running.

90
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,203
- That's very impressive.
- Seven years as an Attending...

91
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,373
- only four publications?
- No original research? First author?

92
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,714
I just submitted a review article.
And I have other studies lined up.

93
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,379
- I'm waiting to hear about the grants.
- Emergency medicine's a smorgasbord.

94
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,583
Sometimes it's hard
to find your niche.

95
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,158
Excuse me?

96
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,999
The university is willing to float
junior faculty for a few years, but, uh...

97
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,033
Tenured Attendings need the
ability to carry their own weight.

98
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,536
You mean, bring in grant money.
Okay, my focus hasn't been research.

99
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,005
I've spent the last seven years
becoming a good clinician and teacher.

100
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,237
That's clear, Susan. And we
put a great deal of value on that.

101
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:52,044
Well, I don't want you to do anything
until I can talk to my own doctor...

102
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,678
- Stanley Obermeyer.
- Right. We have a call in to him.

103
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,657
Yeah? Well, Stanley's not gonna like
what you guys are doing, prodding me here.

104
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,091
Mr. Rubadoux, I can't
hear while you're talking.

105
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:06,632
- You've been listening for five minutes.
- You've been talking for five minutes.

106
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,538
- Anyone ever tell you you have a murmur?
- A what?

107
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,266
A murmur? The sound of
blood rushing through the heart.

108
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,868
- You think I have that?
- I'm pretty sure, yeah.

109
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,573
Oh, "pretty sure"? Is
that all you can say?

110
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,944
I'd like to run some tests.

111
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,212
- What tests?
- EKG, chest x-ray.

112
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,912
Draw some blood.

113
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,550
Look, no offense, but I don't want
some nurse calling the shots around here.

114
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,789
Mr. Rubadoux, I am not
a nurse. I am a doctor.

115
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,899
Well, you're not my doctor.

116
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,060
And I'm not gonna let you do
anything else until I talk to him.

117
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,433
- Okay.
- Okay.

118
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,270
Jeez.

119
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,781
- I'm Dr. Pratt. Take a deep breath for me.
- Sats 88 on a nonrebreather.

120
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,319
- Is he dead? Is my husband dead?
- Behind us. Doctors are working on him.

121
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,922
He's alive? PRATT: Whoa!

122
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,251
Wife fired a couple
of rounds to his chest.

123
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,122
Pulse at 133, BP, 90
palp, went apneic in the rig.

124
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,526
- Access?
- Two large-bore IVs. Liter en route.

125
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,793
- Another day, another happy couple.
- On my count: One, two, three.

126
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,494
- Two of Versed right away.
- Your husband stabbed you?

127
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,368
He cornered me in the
kitchen, had a knife to my throat.

128
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,510
- Ooh, definite ETOH.
- Have you been drinking, Mrs. Casey?

129
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,647
I didn't know what to do. I
grabbed his gun from the kitchen.

130
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,511
Decreased breath sounds. You have
a collapsed lung. I need to reinflate it.

131
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,949
Sam, you were supposed
to check the airway boxes.

132
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,452
- I don't think so. MARQUEZ:
According to the schedule.

133
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,490
- I thought it was Malik's turn.
- We're out of 8.0s.

134
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,425
- Malcolm, who's sorry now, you bastard?
- What did you do? Take a vacation?

135
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,689
Not my fault Sam
didn't stock the shelves.

136
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,459
- Tube. RAY: I can
barely palpate a femoral.

137
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,262
Heart rate's up to 140.

138
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,837
Okay. Hang the O-neg
and call for type-specific.

139
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,305
- Ray, he needs an IJ.
- And a surgeon. O.R. 3's on hold.

140
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,807
You got this? DUBENKO: Uh-huh.

141
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,639
I need to check next door.

142
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,542
- How's she doing?
- Her lungs are down.

143
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,650
She's stable but she's agitated.
Sam, where's that Versed?

144
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,479
What are they doing? - Here.

145
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,917
- I was getting it.
- Okay. I was just right here.

146
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,579
- I've got it covered, Luka.
- Okay.

147
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:13,352
They better not send him home. I'm
changing the locks, not gonna let him in.

148
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,394
Mary, you need to calm down
and answer some questions for me.

149
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,156
- Where are you?
- Some hospital.

150
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,732
- And what year is it?
- 2005.

151
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,233
- Good. And where do you live?
- West Garfield.

152
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,066
West Garfield?

153
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,707
Do you got a problem with that?

154
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,372
Bilateral crackles, 3/6,
harsh systolic murmur JVD...

155
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,911
and the liver's down
four centimeters.

156
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,049
You heard him. He
doesn't wanna see me.

157
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,685
- Why don't you present to Kovac?
- Tied up in a trauma.

158
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,617
We're waiting on a call from
his doc. I got him to calm down...

159
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,383
by promising to bring in
an experienced physician.

160
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,050
- Which means an Attending. Means you.
- All right. Any cardiac history there?

161
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,892
Chronic CHF and
evidence of an old infarct.

162
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,367
I sent off troponins. I'll get
an EKG when you're done.

163
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,203
And did Obermeyer call yet?
- Mm-mm.

164
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,605
Hello.

165
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,247
I'm Dr. Carter.

166
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,578
Don't worry. I
remember your name.

167
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,952
Ten years, I don't forget.

168
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,915
- I understand...
- You remember my name?

169
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,755
Rubadoux?

170
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,895
- That's a very unusual name.
- You don't even remember.

171
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,463
And you don't remember
my wife then either, do you?

172
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,465
Just some other old person.
Give them the old song and dance...

173
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,900
and ship them off.

174
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,900
Okay. We need to hear from
your doctor. So in the meantime...

175
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,967
I knew she didn't
have much time left.

176
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,113
But why did you have to
put her through all that?

177
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:45,314
My sweet Sylvie. Keeping a
smile every step of the way.

178
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,114
- Let's take a quick listen.
- No, no, no.

179
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,485
I want my own doctor.

180
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,657
Uh, Mr. Rubadoux, he's the
Attending. He has to examine you.

181
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,697
What do you mean, "has to"?
What is there, a law around here...

182
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,766
a rule when you
come into this place?

183
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,266
Yes. Actually, there is.

184
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,636
All right. Make it fast.

185
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,674
Hmm.

186
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,242
What was that about?

187
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,886
A very unsatisfied customer.

188
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,983
- He needs an echo.
- I called Kayson. He's on it.

189
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,626
Uh, Radiology called about
that kid with the huge head.

190
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,523
- Hydroceph...? ABBY:
Hydrocephalus, yeah.

191
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,459
I'll call Neurosurg.

192
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:32,830
Ooh.

193
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,136
- Even more of a handful than before.
- You remember him?

194
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,171
Don't let him get to you,
Carter. It was a long time ago...

195
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,468
and you were just a student.

196
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,912
Dr. Lewis, thought you
were off. What are you doing?

197
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,381
- Don't ask.
- Been paging you.

198
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,417
I was in a meeting. I
turned my pager off.

199
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,714
Got a double trauma.
Long as you're here...

200
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,656
- I'm not here. JERRY: The
meeting got changed to 3:30.

201
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,158
- What?
- That's why I've been paging you.

202
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,661
I just worked all night.
I can't stay till 3:30.

203
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,394
Oh...

204
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,036
"Rubba-ducks"?

205
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,934
Rubadoux, Sylvie.
How long will this take?

206
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,371
Ten-year-old chart?
Could be a while.

207
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,907
I'll wait.

208
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,287
Certainly thinks highly of you.
- Mm.

209
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,791
Well, that's very
flattering coming from him.

210
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,090
Oh, and don't get me wrong. He
was brilliant. But he drove us crazy.

211
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,529
Made us do a full workup
on every single sniffle.

212
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,536
Mm. Well, ha, ha,
that's my Dr. Obermeyer.

213
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,465
Nothing if not thorough.

214
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,068
Dilated left ventricle,
gradient's 86.

215
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,939
- Those calcifications?
- Shh.

216
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,171
I'm listening to
the doctor, please.

217
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,215
Ejection fraction's only 45,
but seeing as he presented...

218
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,320
with both syncope and failure,
there's really only one option.

219
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,720
Mr. Rubadoux, you have
critical aortic stenosis.

220
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,123
One of the valves in
your heart is narrowed.

221
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,958
- We have to operate to open that valve.
- Operate?

222
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,292
Mm-hm.

223
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,128
- When? KAYSON:
As soon as possible.

224
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,762
Your heart's not generating enough force
to push blood through that constriction.

225
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,408
And you can do
something about that?

226
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,409
Well, we have to run a
few tests. But, yes, we can.

227
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,481
I'll talk to Anspaugh. You check
his BUN, creatinine, order PFTs.

228
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,448
- Hang in there, Mr. Rubadoux.
- Call me Ruby.

229
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,778
Ruby.

230
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,354
Hmm. Yeah.

231
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,961
Hey, pretty lucky, huh?
Same school as my doc.

232
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,594
Nothing personal...

233
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,828
but they both have a little bit
more water under the bridge...

234
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,736
- if you know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

235
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,509
- Did you understand everything he said?
- Yeah.

236
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,011
Yeah, I need a heart operation.

237
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,012
Do you have any questions?

238
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,817
- Heart surgery's a big deal.
- I know that.

239
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,284
What am I, an idiot?

240
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,353
Well, do you also know
that, given your age...

241
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,687
the risks of surgery are higher?

242
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,793
- What risks?
- Complications.

243
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,497
I mean, I need to get
some more information...

244
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,637
on your lung function
and your kidneys.

245
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,296
- Something wrong with my kidneys?
- No. I don't know. I don't know yet.

246
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,877
Yeah, well, uh, why don't you
come back when you're less confused.

247
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,473
Okay. Mr. Rubadoux, I just
want you to understand...

248
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,415
that this surgery
is very serious.

249
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,317
And that we don't know yet if
you're even a good candidate.

250
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,659
And that it's important you
consider all of your options.

251
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,722
Listen, doll...

252
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,901
can you fix my heart?

253
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,226
No.

254
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:01,170
Then I'm going with the
guy who can. All right?

255
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,411
Bye.

256
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,130
Prior MI, marginal ventricular
function, and his creatinine's 2.3.

257
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,529
He's 85.

258
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,636
He has significant
coronary-artery disease...

259
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,136
renal insufficiency,
and a history of COPD.

260
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,640
- What do you think about his lungs?
- We can check his PFTs, but he's old.

261
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,210
- They're not gonna be perfect.
- Anything else you want?

262
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,211
Send coags. Have
him typed and crossed.

263
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,840
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry, but
don't you think, just maybe...

264
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,987
open-heart surgery might not
be such a good idea for this man?

265
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,749
Don't you think, just maybe,
that's the surgeon's call?

266
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,726
Actually, no. I think
it's the patient's call.

267
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,824
He could spend the rest of
his life on a beach in Miami...

268
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,831
- or hooked up to a ventilator.
- He wants the surgery.

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,231
She's trying to advocate
on behalf of her patient.

270
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,340
CICU's full, and Mr. Rubadoux needs a
bed. She could advocate for him there.

271
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,669
Anspaugh's on his way down.

272
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,871
What?

273
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,683
- So how's it going in there?
- I'll take a 12-year-old gangster...

274
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,982
over a domestic-violence
case any day.

275
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,487
She said she was from West Garfield.
I figured I should give you a call.

276
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,256
But I wasn't sure if this
was a Ceasefire kind of thing.

277
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,161
Every shooting is
a Ceasefire thing.

278
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,359
If she gets out of this mess,
there's a lot we could do for her.

279
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,698
I don't know. She seems
pretty far gone to me.

280
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,965
- How do you stay so optimistic?
- How do you?

281
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,077
What? Stay optimistic? I don't. Three
years in this place, I'm jaded as hell.

282
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,612
You just saw a drunk, battered
woman who shot her abusive husband...

283
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,444
- and saw some hope in the situation.
- I did?

284
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,553
You wouldn't have called me
if you didn't think I could help.

285
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,613
I see right through
you, Dr. Pratt.

286
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,889
- Is that right?
- Mm.

287
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,288
We'll follow up with her
after she's discharged.

288
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,229
- So that's it? You're done?
- For now.

289
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,131
Shouldn't you stick around?
She's bound to have questions...

290
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,465
- once sedation wears off.
- You can handle it.

291
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,608
But I don't know too much about
domestic-violence counseling.

292
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,903
I would love to give
you a lengthy tutorial...

293
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,978
- but I'm out of time.
- How about later?

294
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,381
You can school me over dinner.

295
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,321
Pick me up at the office at 7.

296
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,459
Is this gonna take long?

297
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,658
We've been here quite a while.

298
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,595
We'll need to be going soon.

299
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,759
You had a low-grade temperature
when the nurse took it earlier.

300
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,768
Beautiful girl. REBECCA: Mm...

301
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,965
- Caramel skin.
- Like a young June Allyson.

302
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,905
- Maureen O'Sullivan.
- Susan Hayward.

303
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,807
- Ava Gardner.
- Myrna Loy.

304
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,472
- Sophia Loren.
- Sophia Loren?

305
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,878
Okay. I heard some
crackles on the right side.

306
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,852
Could be a sign
of a lung infection.

307
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,458
- You'll need to have a chest x-ray.
- Crackles?

308
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,721
- The other doctor didn't mention crackles.
- No.

309
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,491
That's right. Uh, you were
in here over a week ago.

310
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,031
You saw Dr. Lockhart?

311
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,965
Lovely woman.

312
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,694
Like a young Patty Duke.

313
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,302
Now, your aortic valve right
here is stiff and stuck shut.

314
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,470
What we're going to do is cut
out all of the stenotic material...

315
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,878
and replace it with
a porcine valve.

316
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,847
So it's definite he's
having surgery?

317
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,012
It is.

318
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:40,486
Isn't it? I mean, it's... It's
the only way to go, right?

319
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,825
We could treat you with digoxin and
diuretics, but that would be short-term.

320
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,933
At this stage, surgery's
the only definitive treatment.

321
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,332
Just so you know, Dr. Anspaugh,
his FEV 1 is only 53 percent.

322
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,440
- Thank you.
- Make him NPO after midnight.

323
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:58,374
And don't his decreased lung capacity
and renal insufficiency strongly con...?

324
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,051
What I mean is, shouldn't
we be discussing the risks?

325
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,188
Yeah. But we
talked about all that.

326
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,553
The risk, the
complications, the kidneys.

327
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,217
We're going to talk about
them again, Mr. Rubadoux.

328
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,621
Oh. Call me Ruby.

329
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,657
Will you excuse me for just a minute?
- Certainly.

330
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,426
Dr. Lockhart.

331
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,378
I take it you have a problem with
Mr. Rubadoux's decision to have surgery.

332
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,741
I'm concerned it's not
an informed decision, yes.

333
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:38,612
And is that because you failed
to adequately explain the risks?

334
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,950
Do you think I would operate on this man
if he didn't understand the consequences?

335
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,918
Why would I do that? Because
I have nothing better to do?

336
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,294
- No, certainly.
- If you have concerns...

337
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,329
you ask the consulting
doctor to step outside.

338
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,433
You do not, in front of a patient,
attempt to subtly disagree...

339
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,331
with the senior cardiologist
and the chief of surgery.

340
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,633
That kind of behavior
is helpful to no one.

341
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,105
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

342
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,440
I have concerns.

343
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,294
Knowing you as well as I do...

344
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,523
I'm gonna guess you
hate when people do this.

345
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,533
Uh, the come-from-behind-
and-put-your-hands-over-the-eyes thing?

346
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,295
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. Words can't express...

347
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,598
exactly how much I hate it.

348
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,801
Pretty cool that I knew
that, don't you think?

349
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,373
- Bad timing?
- Yes.

350
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,707
- Want to talk about it?
- No.

351
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,776
So I'm back.

352
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,545
Oh, my God, Jake.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

353
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,484
- It's okay.
- How was, uh, San Francisco?

354
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,783
Amazing faculty.
Lots of O.R. time.

355
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,119
I thought Boston was
first until I saw UCSF...

356
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,127
- but it's a long shot.
- They wouldn't have invited you...

357
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,356
if they weren't interested.
Where's Carter?

358
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,502
- MRI.
- Thanks. So UCSF, huh?

359
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,537
Yes. Uh, I liked it. But, you
know, I still could match right here.

360
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,141
- Yup.
- What would happen if I did that?

361
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,301
Well, Jake, then you'd
be working at County.

362
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,379
Dirk Harmon, 14. Crashed
headfirst into a retaining wall...

363
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,676
while luging down Sheridan Road.
- Luging?

364
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,046
Street luge. You don't
watch those guys on ESPN?

365
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,156
- When do you watch ESPN?
- Pulse, 72. BP, 112/65. Sats 100.

366
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,189
I'm Dr. Pratt. How
fast were you going?

367
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,657
- Forty, maybe 50.
- All right.

368
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,821
- Come on, you guys.
- He's one of the qualifiers at Super Mass.

369
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,522
But I'm really more into dual.

370
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,691
- Where do you find hills in Chicago?
- Luka.

371
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,962
You do snow too? - Totally.

372
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,572
Hello, everyone. He just
rammed his head into a wall.

373
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,504
Yes.

374
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:48,244
- Hey, dude. My hands are numb.
- Weird.

375
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,383
- When did that start?
- Just noticed it.

376
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,018
Pratt, hold the C-spine.
Let's move him carefully.

377
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,784
Hey. I need to talk to you
about the Rubadoux thing.

378
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,085
Birdy Chaddock, 72-year-old
female with cough and low-grade temp.

379
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,752
Sats fine. No shortness of breath,
right middle lobe infiltrate on the film.

380
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,058
She was your patient last week,
so perhaps for continuity of care...

381
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,725
- In with the same thing?
- No. Had facial contusions.

382
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,736
- Her sister was with her?
- Oh, yeah. She's here this time too.

383
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,099
She's got family support. Treat her
like an outpatient, send her home.

384
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,211
- They're panhandlers. Both.
- Everybody's gotta make a living.

385
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,807
What is wrong with you?

386
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:25,210
- She won't get better on the streets.
- Call Social Services...

387
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,398
hook her up with
elder assistance.

388
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,913
They did express
interest in leaving soon.

389
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,690
Call Social Services.

390
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,591
Okay, about Mr. Rubadoux.
Nobody is painting him a clear picture.

391
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,230
Surgery is a lousy choice.

392
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,628
- His choice.
- He does not have an objective view.

393
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,601
Seventeen-year-old, avulsed finger.
Sign so we can treat without the parents.

394
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,966
- How'd he do it?
- Slammed his hand in the car door.

395
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,438
- Somebody needs to talk to him.
- You're his doctor.

396
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,338
You're the Attending.
He's old school.

397
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,240
He needs to hear it from a guy.

398
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,348
It's that time. Girl Scout
cookies. I'm feeling the pressure.

399
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,484
- Okay.
- We'll find you later, all right?

400
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,085
- Just...
- Okay.

401
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,619
What is going on with you?
Why keep blowing this off?

402
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,950
- I'm not.
- You tried to stop our conversation...

403
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,615
to buy Girl Scout cookies.

404
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,361
- Talk to this guy.
- I'm not the one to do it.

405
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:14,593
Okay. I don't know exactly what went
on between you and him, but right now...

406
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,362
Look. Once in a while you're
gonna find these old guys...

407
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,802
that would rather be treated by a
gray-haired guy with a white coat.

408
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:25,138
- Figure out a way of getting to him.
- Been trying for an hour. He's a wall.

409
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,836
Well, then you did your job.

410
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,810
Move on.

411
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,749
Dr. Lewis?

412
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,119
- Dr. Lewis?
- Yes, Jerry.

413
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,384
Are you sleeping?

414
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,827
Probably not, huh? Uh, the Chief
Residency meeting is starting.

415
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,529
Thank you, Jerry.

416
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,731
Uh, are you really up?
Because I have to leave now.

417
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,601
Yes, Jerry.

418
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,654
Eighteen hundred
Solu-Medrol going in.

419
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,487
- What do you got?
- Keep your eyes closed, Dirk.

420
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,858
Traumatic C-spine injury. I didn't
wanna just yank the helmet off.

421
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,191
Pretty cool, huh?

422
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,664
Dude, one move, they'll
slice through your head.

423
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,700
Shut up, man. This is gnarly.

424
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,668
Compared to the Gravity
Games, this is nothing, man.

425
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,671
Except for a little
cord compression.

426
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,433
Anybody seen Carter?

427
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,008
He's probably at the meeting
where Luka and I are supposed to be.

428
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,275
Anspaugh wants a central line
on our aortic-stenosis patient.

429
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,715
Pratt, go help Abby. I'll finish that.
- Okay.

430
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,412
Sterile 9s and
prep for a cordis.

431
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,059
- Nice suit, Morris.
- Thank you.

432
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:54,030
It's important for the Chief Resident
to project a certain professionalism.

433
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:58,364
And I must say, life in the ER doesn't
offer enough opportunity to dress up.

434
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,198
- Sorry I'm late.
- You haven't missed anything.

435
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,570
Dr. Lewis, if you don't mind.

436
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,705
The lights, please.

437
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,080
The Chief Resident in a busy
urban ER must wear many hats:

438
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:23,352
Uh, teacher, mentor,
counselor, friend.

439
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,389
- Over the course of the next hour...
- Hour?

440
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,934
I will review my proposed strategy
for making the Residents' schedule...

441
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:35,875
and address how the new
ACGME/RRC work-hour mandates apply.

442
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,808
I will also identify common stumbling
blocks that may affect the schedule...

443
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:45,111
and present my patented win-win
approach to problems and changes.

444
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:46,513
Next slide.

445
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,176
Whoa, you can't just leave.

446
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,823
Oh-ho-ho, yes,
at our age we can.

447
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,754
I'm sorry Social Services...

448
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,485
is backed up, but we need
them to see you before you go.

449
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,096
We saw them the last time
we were here. Lovely woman.

450
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,528
- Oh, a regular young...
- No, no. God, no, please.

451
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,760
- Please, just... BIRDY: Oh.
Dr. Barnett, we are grateful.

452
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,928
And we're gonna
do the best we can.

453
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,768
But it's important
that we leave now.

454
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,740
We cannot miss the
rush hour at the El.

455
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,779
And if it gets you in any
kind of trouble, I'm so sorry.

456
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,247
- We could write you a note.
- A note?

457
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,783
It's not gonna be good enough.

458
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,511
You see...

459
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,119
last week, two of my other
patients, they left on me.

460
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,452
And my boss is really
unhappy with me.

461
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,685
Oh? RAY: Mm-hm.

462
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,456
He says if this happens again,
they're gonna send me to...

463
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,631
- Away?
- Well, to...

464
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,564
the morgue.

465
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,771
- The morgue?
- Yeah.

466
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,531
It's a...

467
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,232
big demotion.

468
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,745
- He's clever.
- Oh, yeah.

469
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,009
You gotta give him that.

470
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,148
Page me from MRI. I
wanna see the scan.

471
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:08,161
- Sam, what's going on?
- Nothing. I'm cleaning up and restocking.

472
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,996
- Is this about the luge boy?
- You were encouraging him.

473
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,662
- I wasn't.
- Pratt and Ray, that I can understand.

474
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,673
Sam, I wasn't, and
you're overreacting.

475
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,980
- A little bit?
- Oh...

476
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,749
Ah. I'm just having a bad
day. I have a headache.

477
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,224
Just... Hey, just tell them
you wanna leave early.

478
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,692
- I'm fine.
- No, really.

479
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:40,458
Tell them you wanna go home. If there
are any complaints, they can talk to me.

480
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,191
Okay.

481
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,333
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

482
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,541
Okay, aim your
needle inferiorly.

483
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,813
And watch the screen
as you enter the vein.

484
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,718
How are we doing, Mr. Rubadoux?

485
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,052
I don't know. You tell me.

486
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,261
- Doing just great.
- Got a flash.

487
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,159
Guidewire.

488
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,164
- What is that? What's going on?
- It's okay, Mr. Rubadoux.

489
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,741
- Throwing PVCs.
- Pull back.

490
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,774
- Run of V-tach.
- Pull back.

491
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,007
Yeah, I am. I'm nowhere
near the myocardium.

492
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,583
I don't feel right.

493
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,145
- V-tach again.
- All right, I'm coming out.

494
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,854
- What's happening?
- Hang in there.

495
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,754
- A hundred of lido.
- Mr. Rubadoux?

496
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:45,086
Mr. Rubadoux? All right, let's get him
into a trauma room now. Come on, let's go.

497
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,462
With the Morris-modified
circadian scheduling system...

498
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,126
we can build needed
flexibility into the program.

499
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,602
A sample sequence
might go like this:

500
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,937
Uh, three days, two off, three
evenings, two off, three nights, two off...

501
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,212
- 911. It's the ER.
- Liar.

502
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,317
- Morris, I apologize.
- Uh, I'll put a hard copy in your box.

503
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,079
- That'd be great.
- Get on with it, Dr. Morris.

504
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:12,349
Uh, three nights, two off, and
repeat until the end of the block.

505
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,958
Next slide.

506
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,320
Good news. Social Services is...

507
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,861
- Hello.
- Hi.

508
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,727
Uh, this is our niece, Shelley.

509
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,461
I just found out they were here.
Thank you for taking care of them.

510
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,164
We wanted to leave, didn't we, doctor?
- Yes, we did try, right?

511
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,832
- You made... You made us stay.
- Yes, I did.

512
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,171
So now Shelley's here,
we can go with her.

513
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:36,905
Uh, no, no, no. You have to wait...
- Could we talk?

514
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,481
Oh, yes. Go ahead. That's fine.

515
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,511
Okay.

516
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,527
Listen, we're waiting on Social
Services to come down here.

517
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,666
Yes. And they're wonderful.
They've been so helpful.

518
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,495
But, you know, it's been a
long day, and they're both...

519
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,661
- They're really getting tired.
- It shouldn't be too much longer.

520
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,439
Yeah.

521
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,009
They're both so stubborn...

522
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,575
those two. I, um...

523
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,013
I've been trying to get
them to move in with me.

524
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,177
You know, they just... They
want their independence.

525
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:18,017
So they can panhandle.
Isn't that unbelievable?

526
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,419
Yeah.

527
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,459
I told them that I could get
them right home, into a hot bath.

528
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,722
Our oldest moved
in with her boyfriend.

529
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,558
We've got the extra bedroom now.

530
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:30,302
I just... I've tried everything.
I don't know what else to do.

531
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:33,268
I don't know how to make
them accept some family support.

532
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,600
Okay, let me talk
to them, all right?

533
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,103
Okay.

534
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,102
Birdy? Rebecca?

535
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,247
Still V-tach.

536
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:44,746
All right, another
epi. Chase it with lido.

537
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,545
All right, switch out.
Set up to intubate.

538
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,620
- What happened?
- A central line.

539
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,258
It was fine until he started
having runs of V-tach.

540
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:57,260
- Must have an irritable myocardium.
- Three-sixty. Clear.

541
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,695
No change.

542
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,233
- Why is Anspaugh opening this guy up?
- Critical AS.

543
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,067
- Epi's in.
- Move that.

544
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,469
Man can't tolerate a central line,
he isn't gonna do well in the O.R.

545
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,108
- He wants the surgery.
- So what?

546
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,143
- So we're giving it to him.
- Those guys got nothing better to do?

547
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,743
Ah, damn it. I
think I broke his rib.

548
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,279
All right, clear.

549
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,925
- Normal sinus. PRATT:
That's what I'm talking about.

550
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,283
The Chief Resident position
is 90 percent administrative.

551
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,686
Morris can handle that.

552
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,123
Yeah. But even the med
students think he's a joke.

553
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:05,958
- We should get someone from the outside.
- It's very difficult on the staff.

554
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,293
You came from the outside.

555
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,168
- How did the Morris meeting go?
- You missed a fascinating lecture...

556
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,238
on circadian scheduling.

557
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,254
We're not giving it
to him, though, right?

558
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:17,001
Considering it.

559
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,167
- You out of your mind?
- If you don't show up...

560
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,575
I was in a trauma.
We should vote.

561
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:26,077
- You can't. You weren't there.
- I don't care. On 36 hours. I have to go.

562
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,742
- And I'm late.
- John.

563
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,388
- What happened on the meeting?
- I don't know. I left.

564
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,583
- Kerry's leaning towards him.
- Yeah. Well, okay.

565
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,194
"Well, okay"?

566
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,659
We've had worse.

567
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,264
- Don't think so.
- Then maybe she won't give it to him.

568
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,891
Hey, Frank, can you come and find
me when the labs are back on Gase in 2?

569
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:49,406
Yeah. Got it. You were gonna take
that haggard mom, five kids, Exam 3.

570
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,975
Rubadoux's back, complaining about
his tube and telling the nurses no Jell-O.

571
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,516
Good.

572
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:04,054
I told Kayson and Anspaugh about
the ribs and the resultant pneumothorax.

573
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,521
- What about the surgery?
- Not right away.

574
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,856
They're going to stabilize him in CICU
for a few days, let the pneumo resolve.

575
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,861
But everyone remains hopeful.

576
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,932
We're just waiting on a bed.

577
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,580
- Can I help you?
- How you doing? Looking for Olivia Evans.

578
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,877
- I'm supposed to meet her.
- She's in the back.

579
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,153
- Follow me.
- Okay.

580
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,720
Three grandmothers...

581
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,887
reclaimed 78th and
Hermitage by opening a bakery.

582
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:50,024
Turned one of the roughest
corners in our city into a coffee klatch.

583
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,134
Dr. Pratt, just in time.
Everyone, this is Greg Pratt.

584
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,105
He's an ER doc at County.

585
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,608
- Hello.
- How y'all doing?

586
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,373
Dr. Pratt gets to see
how senseless shootings...

587
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,448
are overwhelming
our city's hospitals.

588
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:09,179
And we were just talking about various
job opportunities in the neighborhood.

589
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:13,792
So maybe you'd like to say
something about jobs in health care?

590
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,364
Um...

591
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,330
- Felix, get back here.
- This is for Tasha's ear infection.

592
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,033
- Twice a day for a week.
- Holly's the one with the ear.

593
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,110
Right. Uh, Tasha has the eczema.

594
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,476
Apply to the affected area
three times a day for a week.

595
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,776
- Just like the ears.
- Uh, no.

596
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,442
Ears twice a day.
Uh, rash, three.

597
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,714
Found him. He was
running off with your hammer.

598
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,653
Thanks, Chuny.

599
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,919
Just a minute.

600
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,030
- I'm gonna go. Good night.
- I could use a little help here.

601
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,994
One, two, three,
four, five. I'm off.

602
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,833
I'll be home by 8. You
wanna grab a dinner?

603
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,976
Uh, I'm kind of beat.
Maybe stay in tonight.

604
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,971
Okay. See you later.

605
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,519
Good night.

606
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,159
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

607
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,390
Sorry to hear it.

608
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,662
- Really awful this time of night.
- Oh, I know.

609
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:47,651
When I was a student on my surgical
rotation, Rubadoux's wife was very sick.

610
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,420
She was part of
this research study.

611
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,452
When her results, um...

612
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,487
When she wasn't useful, there
was pressure to get her out.

613
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,962
So I did. I dumped her
into a nursing home.

614
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,563
Did she belong in one?

615
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:08,969
We all figured she'd end
up back in the hospital.

616
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,866
But she'd be on the
Medical Service and not ours.

617
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,773
So...

618
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,439
Surgery dumps another
patient on Medicine.

619
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,711
Happens every day.

620
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,213
I told Rubadoux that, um,
she was gonna get better.

621
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,558
I told him that her situation
was gonna improve.

622
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,597
I told him what
he wanted to hear.

623
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,595
You know, when
you're a student...

624
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,931
you're so desperate
for approval.

625
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,771
You want patients to like
you, their families to like you.

626
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:51,276
You gotta be efficient too, though.
You gotta impress your superiors.

627
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,917
You don't have to tell me. I'm still
on the bottom rung of the ladder.

628
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,784
When the Chief of Surgery
says, "Get rid of her," you do.

629
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,084
Yeah.

630
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,964
And then she came back
about three days later...

631
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,294
and she died...

632
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,128
and Rubadoux was so surprised.

633
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,045
Ultimately, it was
the Attending's call.

634
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,580
Wasn't my responsibility.

635
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,319
You wanna help with this?

636
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,489
- Take it easy, man.
- All right. You too, man. Right.

637
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,892
One of my guys has
a real thing for science.

638
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,499
I could bring him to County,
have you show him around.

639
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,690
Sure.

640
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,495
Never been out of
the neighborhood.

641
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,535
- Don't realize there's a city.
- I know.

642
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,469
I was 10 before I
saw Lake Michigan.

643
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,835
- You from Chicago?
- Mm-hm.

644
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,034
Ah. Any relation
to, uh, Charlie Pratt?

645
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,645
Charlie Pratt who works for
Parks and Recs over on Lamont?

646
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,374
- Yeah. The older fellow.
- I don't know him.

647
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,849
Hey, that was a really
nice meeting tonight.

648
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,851
I gotta run. - Oh, okay.

649
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,649
- It's nice meeting you.
- You too.

650
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,489
You're still speaking to me.

651
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,491
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'm not sorry.

652
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,358
I want you to see what we do.
You'd never come on your own.

653
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,329
And I'm not apologizing
about the tuna casserole.

654
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,733
But since you're being such a
good sport, I'm willing to buy dessert.

655
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,931
So ice cream or key-lime pie?

656
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,109
- I'm sorry. What?
- Dessert?

657
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,677
Um...

658
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,371
Past your bedtime?

659
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:34,349
No, no. It's just that I have this patient
I have to check back on in the ER.

660
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,354
Well, then, um, I guess... I
guess you'd better be going.

661
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,683
I'll call you.

662
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,469
Fifteen ninety-five.

663
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,851
Where you going, Ray?

664
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,458
Look, I know I'm on for another half-hour,
but I have taken care of everything.

665
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,159
Filled in Abby on all my cases.

666
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,068
Is Abby your Attending?

667
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,739
Right. Uh...

668
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,104
ulnar fracture up
getting casted in Ortho.

669
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,508
Malignant otitis
admitted to ENT.

670
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,615
Tongue lac wants a vasectomy,
you know, as long as he's here.

671
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,478
Gonna follow that
up with Urology.

672
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,247
Oh, and the Olsen twins. They decided
to leave with their niece and a Z-PAK.

673
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,356
Follow-up in a week.

674
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,452
What did Social Services say?

675
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,988
They actually didn't make
it down. I mean, in time.

676
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:54,930
But you released them anyway?

677
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,167
I felt they had a strong
family support system.

678
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,328
- These are the panhandlers, right?
- Mm-hm.

679
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,034
You felt comfortable releasing
them to a family member...

680
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,337
who obviously hasn't
been much help so far.

681
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,948
Their niece, yes. She admitted it's
been hard getting them to accept help.

682
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,482
- They are moving in with her now.
- Is Social Services going to follow up?

683
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,418
I mean, seeing as how you prevented
them from doing their job today.

684
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,725
I will make those arrangements.

685
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,452
I need to know everything.

686
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,654
I need to know the
status of every one:

687
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,665
How they are, where they are,
where they're going, why they're going...

688
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,530
You're still an intern, Ray.

689
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,171
I'm the Attending.

690
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,273
I'm responsible.

691
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:43,806
I'm sorry.

692
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,577
Hernia guy's HMO...

693
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,347
- refuses to cover.
- He's not stable. I'm not discharging.

694
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,716
You wanna tell them?

695
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,882
- I'll call. MARQUEZ:
Sedation for Mr. Garrity.

696
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,721
- Kovac was there. He can sign them.
- Okay.

697
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,989
Won't believe this.
Your tibial fracture's...

698
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,997
- requesting an organic cast.
- I'll be right there.

699
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,674
Mr. Rubadoux?

700
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,169
I'm not feeling well.

701
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,712
So if you don't mind...

702
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,720
I just wanted to...

703
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,753
say that I'm sorry.

704
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,053
I couldn't believe
it when I saw you.

705
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,560
You're still here.

706
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,224
Been 10 years since my...

707
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:40,031
My Sylvie's gone
and you're still here.

708
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,702
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

709
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,874
And you didn't even remember.

710
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:48,941
Oh, well.

711
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,648
They gave me
six other doctors...

712
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,048
so I won't need you this time.

713
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,159
I made a mistake with your wife.

714
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,564
And I made a mistake with you.

715
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,396
You don't think I know that?

716
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,401
Huh?

717
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:17,235
You don't think I regret ever
bringing my poor Sylvie...

718
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,139
down to this damn place?

719
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,444
You and your fancy tests.

720
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:26,914
"We'll put her through this.
We'll put her through that."

721
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:32,786
"Oh, Sylvie? Oh, she'll practically
be back on-stage dancing again."

722
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,586
- Well, we did try.
- You tried?

723
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,490
You tried?

724
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:42,056
It became a very
complicated situation.

725
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,170
And I didn't have the
experience to handle it properly.

726
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,797
All you had to be
was a human being.

727
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,372
You lied to me.

728
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,514
And I believed you.

729
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,952
My Sylvie. My Sylvie.

730
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,322
She was really something.

731
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,936
Mr. Rubadoux...

732
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,076
what you have wrong
with you, aortic stenosis...

733
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,646
can oftentimes be
corrected with surgery.

734
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:33,273
But that doesn't mean that
that's the right thing for you to do.

735
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,849
You're 85 years old.

736
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,752
You have chronic
respiratory problems.

737
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,018
The chances of you
coming through surgery...

738
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:45,061
and getting back to the
shape that you're in right now:

739
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,697
Pretty slim.

740
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,897
If you go ahead with it,
there is a good chance...

741
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,765
that you will never
leave this hospital again.

742
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,236
You'll be connected
to a ventilator...

743
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,502
and you will live out the remainder
of your life in the Intensive Care Unit.

744
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:05,749
Now, without the surgery, it's
true, you're not gonna get any better.

745
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:12,915
But I believe that you will leave
this hospital under your own power.

746
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,550
And you will have more time
with the people that you love.

747
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,224
You will have more time...

748
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,533
being the person
that you are today.

749
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,204
And, yes...

750
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,407
10 years ago I lied
to you about your wife.

751
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,551
But I am not lying
to you right now.
