1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,868
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:10,568
I was thinking that maybe we
shouldn't be quite so together here.

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,009
- I thought everybody knows.
- I didn't tell anybody.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,460
Dad's taking me to Florida.

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,814
You can take whatever you want.
But he's not going anywhere with you.

6
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,978
We'll catch the whales in the
fall. I'm going the other direction.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,724
I know what you
want me to say and...

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,422
And I can't say it, okay?

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,927
But things with
Wendall didn't work out.

10
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,429
Oh, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:35,899
Yeah. It's weird. She's actually
not really even speaking to me.

12
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,626
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What? What?

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,235
- You have to get up. Get up, get up.
- What? What? What?

14
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,371
- It's 7:32.
- Yeah?

15
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,329
Rounds are at 8.

16
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:17,103
- I hit the snooze.
- No, you shut the alarm off.

17
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,510
Sorry.

18
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,683
I thought you were gonna
go home and change.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,546
- It's okay.
- No, it's gonna look weird.

20
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,381
- No, it won't.
- You're back in the ER.

21
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,682
- People will think...
- What are they gonna think?

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,018
That I don't do my laundry?

23
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,660
That I sleep in the park?

24
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,798
- What?
- Abby needs to take a few pass-ons.

25
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,130
- She's late.
- Brushing up on your Spanish, huh?

26
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,896
It helps me relate
to the community.

27
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,041
- Oh, yeah? What's her name?
- Okay, one left.

28
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,574
- Asthma going to the ICU. Get an art line.
- Got it.

29
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,302
- Meaning...?
- I'll take care of it.

30
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,674
- Teach the residents how to do it?
- Absolutely.

31
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,406
That's the board.

32
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,848
Alex has soccer after school. I
thought you could drop him off.

33
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,487
Isn't the carpool
picking him up?

34
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,748
Yeah, but he needs to
work on his corner kick.

35
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,824
He's still pretty mad at me.

36
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,484
Well, think of it
as an icebreaker.

37
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,653
Maybe we should
give it a little more time.

38
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,731
- I'll see you tonight.
- All right.

39
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,366
Have a good nap.

40
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,067
- Morris!
- Sorry.

41
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,229
I came in to work on
our manuscript revisions.

42
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,738
We'll see if I have the time.

43
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,570
They're due by 5 p.m.

44
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,874
- Today?
- We don't wanna miss the deadline.

45
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,240
You two are publishing?

46
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,009
"Oligoanalgesia in Long-Bone
Fractures: A Retrospective Review."

47
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,051
Accepted in the annals next
month if we can make a few changes.

48
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,916
Some substantial changes.

49
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,114
Go to the doctors'
lounge. I'll be right in.

50
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,619
Consider it done.

51
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,786
You're working with Morris?

52
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,898
Yeah. You know, he's
thorough, good with statistics.

53
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,762
And the only resident
desperate enough to write it up?

54
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,425
- You got it.
- Dr. Lewis...

55
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,062
- would you let me run a trauma today?
- Do you think you're ready for that?

56
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,104
In a couple of months I'll be
an R2 supervising the interns.

57
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,711
It might be good to get practice.
- Need a bed.

58
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,643
- Hypothermia.
- All yours.

59
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,547
Elena Tabajas, 39. Passed
out at the immigration building.

60
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,947
- Tachy at 120.
- She's cold.

61
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,314
Some kind of a protest.

62
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,547
You need to call Benjamin
Coe. He's my lawyer.

63
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,124
- What?
- Don't do anything until he's here.

64
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:16,559
CBC, chem panel, EKG, a liter of saline,
O2 at 2 liters, and get a rectal temp.

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,199
- What are you doing? SAM:
We're giving you warm IV fluid.

66
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,891
Don't do that.

67
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,536
- It will help.
- No.

68
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,502
- What?
- I'm on a hunger strike.

69
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,368
They want to deport my son.

70
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,406
- Elena, you're cold and dehydrated.
- Maybe now the INS...

71
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,909
will give us a new hearing.

72
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,776
Do you know the risks
of refusing our care?

73
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,649
Do you know that you
could go into a coma and die?

74
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,512
I don't want to lose my son.

75
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,983
Okay. Cancel all the orders.

76
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,494
No fluid bolus?

77
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,857
No labs, no EKG?

78
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,965
You heard her. Nothing.

79
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,999
No one is going to
remember what I was wearing.

80
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,003
- No, people notice.
- Watch out. Watch out.

81
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,272
- Are you all right?
- Yup.

82
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,934
- Morning, Jake.
- Hey, Liza.

83
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,604
- How's the ER?
- Good.

84
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,181
This is Abby, my girlfriend.

85
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,211
Liza's the night
clerk on Surgery.

86
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,408
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,522
- We're kind of late, so...
- Me too. Hey, stop by sometime.

88
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,520
Did you say "girlfriend"?

89
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,355
- What?
- Nothing.

90
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,121
Takes me right
back to junior high.

91
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,031
- What do you want me to call you?
- How about introducing me as "Abby"?

92
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,399
You don't want people
to know we're going out.

93
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,508
- We're late.
- No. Hey, look, this is important.

94
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,337
Well, let's just
talk about it later.

95
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,149
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it can wait.

96
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,638
You look ridiculous.

97
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,005
What was I supposed to do?
They only had small and extra large.

98
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,338
What's up, homey?

99
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,681
- Sorry about being late.
- Nice scrubs.

100
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,047
- You should coordinate outfits every day.
- Yeah, it's cute.

101
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,121
Maybe we can find you some
matching stethoscopes or...

102
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,348
Victim of assault for Abby...

103
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,493
and low blood sugar
for your boy toy.

104
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,685
Okay. All right, all right.

105
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,259
It's rough when everyone
knows you're an item.

106
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,763
- That could work.
- What?

107
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,094
"This is Abby. She's my item."

108
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,759
Ninety-six point one.

109
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,098
- Do you want a warm blanket?
- Please.

110
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,832
- I am thirsty.
- Some orange juice?

111
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,670
Only water.

112
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,837
Elena?

113
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,571
<i>Amigo.</i>

114
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,242
- I'm Benjamin Coe from Legal Aid.
- I'm Dr. Lewis.

115
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,716
How's she doing?

116
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,288
Malnourished and
dehydrated, heading for a coma.

117
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,986
Maybe we'll see
some movement now.

118
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,755
This should get the INS
to grant us a new hearing.

119
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,462
- Her son's an illegal alien?
- Undocumented immigrant.

120
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,259
They can just
send the kids back?

121
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,697
Elena has her green
card. She came here in '89.

122
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,599
Her brother brought Santiago up
through Mexico seven years ago.

123
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,741
- How did the INS get involved?
- Santiago got into trouble.

124
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,376
Attempted robbery.

125
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,807
They locked him up
for two years in juvie.

126
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,413
Once he did time, they
transferred him to Immigration.

127
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,072
He won't last in El Salvador.

128
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,275
The police there round
up gang members.

129
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,512
Sometimes they get beaten to
death, sometimes they just disappear.

130
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,721
If he goes home,
they'll kill him.

131
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,827
I brought her durable power.
- What's that?

132
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,155
Says she's competent to start a
hunger strike and refuse nutrition...

133
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,822
even if she's unconscious.

134
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,362
We can't give her an IV?

135
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,630
That would be felony assault. If
you try to treat her, I'll call the police.

136
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,164
We need a kitchen.

137
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,674
The staff break room can
accommodate a refrigerator...

138
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,402
No, I mean a commercial kitchen.

139
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:29,447
The HIV daycare program should
be able to provide a hot lunch.

140
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,915
I'll mention that
to the architect.

141
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,920
So, John, if you're okay...

142
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,149
we're ready to go to
the contractors for a bid.

143
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,628
I'm thinking 150
million is in the ballpark?

144
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,766
That's a nice ballpark.

145
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,632
A leadership gift from the Carter
Foundation would help get it rolling...

146
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,775
and we've drawn up a list
of potential corporate donors.

147
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,503
We were hoping that you could make
some calls on the hospital's behalf.

148
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,772
No, thanks.

149
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,047
Your personal involvement would
be very useful in contacting the...

150
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,211
We weren't happy with the
idea of corporate sponsorship.

151
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,586
So we would be interested in
covering the construction costs.

152
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,292
The entire thing?

153
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,725
Mm.

154
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,596
Plus an endowment...

155
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,099
to supply the center's annual
budget to treat uninsured patients.

156
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,002
This is an incredibly
generous offer.

157
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,631
We would appreciate
a naming opportunity.

158
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,969
Of course. Do you
have some suggestions?

159
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,109
I do, actually.

160
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,175
But I would like to discuss it further
with a few family members first.

161
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,842
To the side.

162
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,489
Up and down.

163
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,985
How many times were you punched?
- Just once.

164
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,491
- Then he grabbed her purse.
- Where did this happen?

165
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,889
Twenty-third. BIRDY: Wabash.

166
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,131
Uh, well, it... It
was near the corner.

167
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,161
Did you file a police report?

168
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,800
What's the point?

169
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,700
They might catch the guy.

170
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,171
We didn't get a
good look at him.

171
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,070
Okay. I'm going to take you to X-ray.
- Wanna look this way?

172
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,282
Can...? Can I stay with her?

173
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,751
Uh, no, I'm sorry. Chuny, maybe
Rebecca would like some coffee?

174
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,447
- Can I have tea?
- Sure. You wanna come with me?

175
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,752
Stay out of trouble, sweetie.

176
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,791
Okay, Roberta. I just have a
couple more questions for you.

177
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,955
Birdy. Everybody calls me Birdy.

178
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,195
Um, who do you live with?

179
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,237
Just my sister and me.
Been that way for 50 years.

180
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,968
- Is there anything you wanna tell me?
- Like what?

181
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,780
Like sometimes
people are injured...

182
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,611
by their friends or
their family members.

183
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,044
It... It was a kid,
just some punk.

184
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,984
Are you sure?

185
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,619
And you feel safe at home?

186
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,318
Of course.

187
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,222
Okay.

188
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,796
I'm gonna order x-rays.

189
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,304
I left a voicemail for the
caseworker at the INS.

190
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,239
- Can you talk to her?
- And say what?

191
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,776
- Hey, Frank?
- Hold on.

192
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,470
Just tell them how sick she is.

193
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,774
Dr. Lewis, I converted
the tables to a TIFF file.

194
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,850
- You removed the P-values?
- Oh, crap.

195
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,145
They want differences
expressed as relative risk.

196
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,846
- I'll be back.
- Well, page Social Work again.

197
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,856
- I need a facial series in 4B.
- For Birdy?

198
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,585
- You know her?
- She and her sister panhandle on Wabash.

199
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,320
I give them a buck
once in a while.

200
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,592
It's a travesty what we
let happen to the elderly.

201
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,496
Hey, Wendall, I
have a consult for you.

202
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,297
- Hunger-strike lady?
- That's mine. Sorry. Elena Tabajas?

203
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,700
- I read about her.
- You did?

204
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,366
She was in the newspaper a few weeks
ago. Trying to get asylum for her son?

205
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:47,173
A few weeks. I had pancakes
for breakfast. I'm starving already.

206
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,838
I don't know what to say.

207
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,383
Well, I've been looking for some
time for the right thing to donate to.

208
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,884
It seemed only fitting.

209
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,046
Have you thought about any
future role in the outpatient center?

210
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,055
Yeah. I'd like to
sit on the board.

211
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,888
And I suppose I might
see a few patients.

212
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,691
You agree it's better to recruit someone
with more experience as director?

213
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,356
Definitely.

214
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:12,572
Yeah. I don't want to run the
place, Kerry. Too much paperwork.

215
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,733
Good. I've identified four
outstanding candidates.

216
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,937
Oh. Well, I'd be happy
to look over their CVs...

217
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,582
but I've actually been
talking to Todd Becker.

218
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,412
- Todd Becker from Stanford?
- Well, he's at Columbia now.

219
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:29,215
He's set up a network of clinics in Harlem
and the South Bronx. He'd be perfect.

220
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,325
- Why are you doing this?
- Oh, he'd be a great director.

221
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,826
No, I mean the whole thing.
The center, the 150 million.

222
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,931
- What's going on?
- City needs it.

223
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,258
There's no prevention,
there's no primary care.

224
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,096
The whole system's broken.

225
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,431
Well, that's not new. Why now?

226
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:51,043
For 11 years I've been here patching
up people who fall through the cracks...

227
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,840
and it hasn't been
enough. I wanna do more.

228
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,809
Dr. Carter. Tier-two trauma.

229
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,848
- MVC?
- Fell down a flight of stairs.

230
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,508
- Chest and hip pain.
- Good vitals.

231
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,552
You guys get started.
I'll be right there.

232
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,280
So you'll send me that file?

233
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,049
- What's that?
- The guy from Columbia.

234
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,421
Todd Becker. You're
gonna love him. I promise.

235
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,119
- Hey.
- Hi.

236
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,627
How are you?

237
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:14,529
I'm okay. I'm gonna finish an
eval before Psych gets here.

238
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,602
Trauma panel, C-spine, chest
and pelvis. Type and cross for two.

239
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,800
Did you fall down
a flight of stairs?

240
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,377
From the very top.

241
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,073
Mm. Was there carpeting?
- Cement.

242
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,808
I slipped while I was mopping.

243
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,146
- Pulse ox, 92.
- Decreased breath sounds here.

244
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,384
What's this gonna cost?

245
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,650
- That's what insurance is for.
- I don't have any.

246
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,287
Workers' comp will cover it.

247
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,326
I'm a temp.

248
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,522
Once a month, they pay me
$50 to clean the warehouse.

249
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,496
You're in County.
We'll take care of you.

250
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,158
Put your right leg down, please.

251
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,668
I... I can't.

252
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,967
Looks like posterior hip.

253
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,337
I should go home and rest.

254
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,706
It... It... It just
feels like a bruise.

255
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,474
You have a collapsed
lung, your hip is out of joint...

256
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,209
- and you could be bleeding internally.
- I'm okay.

257
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,183
- Jake, chest tube on the left.
- Got it.

258
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,254
- Ray, you take the hip.
- Etomidate.

259
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,358
Please! Just... Just... Just
take all this stuff off of me.

260
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,855
Ma'am? Ma'am.

261
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,021
Head trauma. She's
not thinking clearly.

262
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,292
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not. Keep going with that.

263
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,265
You'll thank us
later for this, ma'am.

264
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,037
I spoke to Psychiatry. They support
her competency to refuse nutrition.

265
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,233
- Even if she's unconscious?
- Even then.

266
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,879
So we're all in agreement.
No treatment, right?

267
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,015
Dr. Lewis, she's seizing.

268
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,410
Probably hyponatremia.

269
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,045
You need to let this happen.

270
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,051
Her only intake has been water.
Her serum sodium is too low.

271
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,813
- Got a vein. COE:
What are you doing?

272
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,424
- Keeping her alive.
- She doesn't want to be treated.

273
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,184
- Sam.
- A patient takes an overdose...

274
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,556
we tie them down and
pump their stomach.

275
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,027
But we let this woman die?

276
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,429
- Yeah, what's the difference?
- She isn't suicidal. Wasn't depressed.

277
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,059
She's motivated by desire to achieve
an end, not by a desire to kill herself.

278
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,729
- Same outcome.
- We have to respect her autonomy.

279
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,035
We have a duty to
act in her best interest.

280
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,405
Heart rate's up, poor air
exchange, getting dusky.

281
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,638
Dr. Lewis, what do you wanna do?

282
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,175
- How about oxygen?
- Nothing.

283
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,047
- Five liters.
- Dr. Lewis.

284
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,450
It's a comfort measure.
Won't save her. Go ahead.

285
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,921
You may not like what she's
doing, but she has the right to do it.

286
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,219
How long can this go on?

287
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,727
After 30 minutes, there's a
very high risk of brain damage.

288
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,455
- She's bleeding.
- Oh, God.

289
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,825
Can somebody find
out if the INS has called?

290
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,095
She bit her tongue. Yankauer.

291
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,499
What is that? Stop.

292
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,271
Ativan, two milligrams.

293
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,769
Neela!

294
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,240
We have a document stating...

295
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,437
she did not want to be treated
for the consequences of her fast.

296
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,208
- Neela, get out of the room.
- It could have saved her life.

297
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,409
Thank you. You're off the case.

298
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,157
Your sedative's gonna
wear off in about two minutes.

299
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,193
- 32 French. RAY:
It won't budge.

300
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,830
Keep going.

301
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,625
I can't get this.

302
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,290
Try the Whistler technique.

303
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,335
I, uh, don't know that one.

304
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:11,340
All right. Your arm goes under
the bad knee, over the good one.

305
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,309
Stabilize the ankle
with your right hand.

306
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,641
- Pass the chest tube?
- Check the tract, wait.

307
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,875
Chuny, would you come
over here and help me?

308
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,519
Matter of fact, I'll
stabilize the pelvis.

309
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,484
Ray, get in the
position I was just in.

310
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,021
- Okay. JAKE: I
feel lung tissue.

311
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,386
Unh... MARQUEZ:
She's starting to wake up.

312
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,720
Okay, listen.

313
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,125
Arms level. Stand up
straight. The femoral head...

314
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,198
will slip over the
acetabular rim.

315
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,630
- Was that it?
- I heard a pop.

316
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,966
You got it. Good
job, Pratt, Ray.

317
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,540
All right. Let's
fix the lung up.

318
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,035
- There's some resistance.
- Okay. Just give it a little more muscle.

319
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,180
Hey, man.

320
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,146
- Nice.
- What are you doing? Pull your pants up.

321
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,112
- Sterile gloves.
- Oh, that's a bummer.

322
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,051
- Dr. Pratt, do you think you could...?
- Hell, no.

323
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,888
- Ray?
- No.

324
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,721
I need to do a
post-reduction exam.

325
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,763
- Uh, Chuny?
- That would be sexual harassment.

326
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,494
Okay. All right. Thank you very
much, everybody. 0-silk, please.

327
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,865
Yes, Roberta and
Rebecca Chaddock.

328
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:16,066
All inpatient records and
ER visits for the past year.

329
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,438
Thanks.

330
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,045
- Anybody to present?
- Yes. Elder assault, possible abuse.

331
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,513
Social Services on it?

332
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,280
Um, yes. And I'm
reviewing all the old charts.

333
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,150
- Good.
- Abby, I'm all yours.

334
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,883
I was just, uh,
filling in Dr. Carter.

335
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,654
- I can come back.
- No, that's okay.

336
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:40,466
Why don't you two go see the patient
and you can bring me up to speed later.

337
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,595
Okay.

338
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,296
- My head hurts.
- Yeah. That's from the seizure.

339
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,671
Elena, I don't know how much
longer your body can take this.

340
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,176
Do you have to do that again?

341
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,613
We're trying to
respect your wishes...

342
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,783
but I would hate for you
to do this unnecessarily.

343
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,924
It's not unnecessary if
it helps save Santiago.

344
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,185
What if they don't
give you a hearing?

345
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,955
Want your son to live with
your death on his conscience?

346
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,627
I wasn't there
when he was little.

347
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:19,097
My husband was killed
in the war, so I came here.

348
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,306
I sent Santiago
money for seven years.

349
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,935
When he was 12, I got tired...

350
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,413
of waiting for the
papers to come through.

351
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,649
He was old enough.

352
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,947
So my brother
Alfonso snuck him in.

353
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,152
You've done
everything you could.

354
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,418
You don't have to do
this. Let us treat you.

355
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,929
I'm so tired.

356
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,332
We'll let you rest.

357
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,842
I can't believe she
has to go through this.

358
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,105
She's a mother
trying to save her son.

359
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,478
I'd throw myself in front
of a train for Cosmo.

360
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,985
Where's Chuny?

361
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,294
Okay. All right.
We need a BOA kit.

362
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,058
His wife's having a baby?

363
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,342
- Okay?
- Should I get a gurney?

364
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,212
She's crowning. We need a
bulb syringe and some towels.

365
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,214
Okay, now push it for me, mama.

366
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,050
Okay? Come on. Push it! Push.

367
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,691
Uh... <i>Puta.</i>

368
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,087
Come on. <i>Puta.</i>

369
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,854
<i>Puta.</i> Come on. <i>Puta.</i>

370
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,063
What?

371
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,526
What are you
doing? Are you crazy?

372
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,398
Get off me!

373
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,337
Hey, get off me!

374
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,540
What the hell's the
matter with this dude?

375
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,201
<i>Puje</i> means push.

376
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,439
- You said <i>puta.</i>
- What does that mean?

377
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,583
You called his wife a whore.

378
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,546
Okay, here we go, honey.

379
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,052
Hey, Dr. Lewis.

380
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,054
- I'm getting coffee.
- Chuck's on line two.

381
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,886
- Sounds like Cosmo's sick.
- With what?

382
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,687
No, I'm at the hospital now.

383
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,124
I'll take it in the lounge.

384
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,025
- I've got the doctor right here.
- Wait.

385
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,462
- I've prepared the graphs.
- This is not a good time.

386
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,431
Four hours before
we have to turn it in.

387
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,766
Did you include the
95-percent confidence intervals?

388
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,463
Catch me later.

389
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,379
- Hey, Chuck.
- No, she'll be right with you.

390
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,073
Any vomiting?

391
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,446
He's alert? Good eye contact?

392
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,620
Okay. Well, just call me
when his fever comes down.

393
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,987
Okay, listen, I gotta go. All
right. Bye. Bye. Bye, Chuck.

394
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,720
I've got the INS.

395
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,459
This is Dr. Lewis.

396
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,929
Yes, I am.

397
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,397
She's dying.

398
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,263
No, but there's
something you can do.

399
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,770
You can give her son a new hearing.
She may not make it another day.

400
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,304
- Thank you.
- Sure.

401
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,305
I know she didn't want to be
overfed, but I gave her Ativan.

402
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,007
Ativan doesn't
have any calories.

403
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,121
Would you shock an end-stage
cancer patient with a DNR?

404
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,813
- What you did was just as wrong.
- She was suffering.

405
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,253
She was unconscious.

406
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,858
I couldn't just watch her die.

407
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,518
Then you should've
left the room.

408
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,497
It doesn't seem right.

409
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,797
It's not.

410
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,527
It's just the rules.

411
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,835
Pre- and post-reduction hip.

412
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,000
- No fracture.
- And the lungs expanded nicely.

413
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,271
Good. What happened to you?

414
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,041
Had a rough delivery.
Hip lady's labs.

415
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,015
- Crit's okay?
- Yeah, but calcium's 12.4.

416
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,517
What caused the bump?

417
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,521
- It's a long differential.
- But the top two causes are?

418
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,785
- Hyperparathyroidism.
- And cancer.

419
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,825
Yeah. You see these
rib fractures here?

420
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,556
There's lesions underneath that
may have weakened the bone.

421
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,167
- Metastases.
- That isn't where the malignancy started.

422
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,396
No. You have to go back and
find the site of the primary tumor.

423
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,638
- Damn.
- Well, that sucks.

424
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,401
- She's a nice lady.
- Yeah.

425
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,136
I hear that's a risk
factor for cancer.

426
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,048
The nose is slightly cracked, and
the knee is bruised. Nothing serious.

427
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,345
Oh, she's a tough one.

428
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,089
You two have been mugged
several times in the past year.

429
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,250
Occupational hazard.

430
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,327
How come you have to panhandle?

431
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,798
Because they aren't
hiring at Hooters. Ha-ha.

432
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,763
Well, I'm serious.
It's dangerous.

433
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,860
Don't tell me you haven't
been smacked in here.

434
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,064
What about Social Security?

435
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,701
We have rent and heating
bills, electrics, medications.

436
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,870
We should have Adult
Services make a visit.

437
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,080
Again?

438
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,276
They went out last summer.
The place was pretty messy.

439
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,354
Well, we would have cleaned it
up if we knew they was coming.

440
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,721
You didn't have much
food in the cabinets.

441
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,754
We like to eat out.

442
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,624
Is there anything
we can do to help?

443
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,696
We do just fine.

444
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:22,207
- I could request another home visit.
- Suit yourself.

445
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,370
I'll be back with your
discharge instructions.

446
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,141
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,287
<i>Still tachy at 120.</i>

448
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,947
She can have some more water.

449
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,322
Dr. Lewis, navicular
fracture has his thumb spica.

450
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,759
- Is that the hunger-strike lady?
- Yeah.

451
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,422
- There's gotta be a better way.
- She's got no money...

452
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,536
no political influence. This
is it. Ortho clinic in a week.

453
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,169
You got it.

454
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,031
She should at least
get to see her son.

455
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,573
If they know she's dying,
maybe they'd let him visit.

456
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,235
Maybe he can get her to eat.

457
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,314
- Worth a shot.
- He'd better get here fast.

458
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,149
Thyroid feels good.

459
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,480
You say I got holes in my bones?

460
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,648
It's in two of the ribs.

461
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,150
I should drink more milk.

462
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,993
I need to do a breast exam next.

463
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:20,827
What for?

464
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,432
Well, your bone lesions could have
been caused by the spread of a tumor.

465
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,068
You mean cancer?

466
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,499
Possibly.

467
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,522
Have you felt this before?

468
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,828
A mass?

469
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,228
- Upper outer quadrant, five centimeters.
- Five?

470
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,192
When did you first notice it?

471
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,599
A couple years ago.

472
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,664
Why didn't you see a doctor?

473
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,035
I've been fine.

474
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,473
Yeah, you could have
caught this before it spread.

475
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,705
Surgery might not be as
effective at this advanced stage.

476
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,612
You wanna cut
me? I don't think so.

477
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,683
An operation might be
part of the treatment plan.

478
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,154
- Where are my clothes?
- Okay, take it easy. You're all hooked up.

479
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,192
- I never should've come.
- You have to stay.

480
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,990
- I don't want you cutting into me.
- Okay, relax.

481
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,188
- Relax, please.
- No!

482
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,594
- It's okay. It's okay.
- No!

483
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,201
- You don't cut into cancer!
- Okay. We're not going to.

484
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,395
- I know what happens when you...
- Settle down.

485
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,096
- It spreads.
- Mrs. Graham.

486
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,935
It spreads.

487
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,240
And you die.

488
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,513
Okay. All right.

489
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,818
Okay?

490
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,893
- Wound check in two days.
- We'll see you then.

491
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,222
- Thank you, doctor.
- Bye-bye.

492
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,057
Hey, uh, hold on.

493
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,632
Um...

494
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,529
Why don't you guys
have a nice dinner tonight.

495
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,133
You are so sweet.

496
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,409
Was that a 20?

497
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:20,812
No wonder your patient-satisfaction
scores are so high.

498
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,413
- You waiting on a run?
- Sort of.

499
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,723
- See you later.
- Yeah.

500
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:29,827
Come on.

501
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,764
Keep moving.

502
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,969
Boxers would stick out more.

503
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,236
- It could be tighty whities.
- Thong.

504
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,607
- Maybe Abby can settle this.
- Settle what?

505
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,214
Boxers or briefs?

506
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,446
Actually, he goes commando.

507
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,285
- A hunger strike?
- It's been 41 days.

508
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,357
Damn. All I heard
was she was protesting.

509
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,756
She's weak. Lost
a lot of weight.

510
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,556
- Can't you make her eat?
- That's why you're here.

511
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,221
Do you want to go in?

512
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,432
Elena?

513
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,975
- Elena? SAM:
Someone's here to see you.

514
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,780
Ah. Take a step back.

515
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,656
- Is that necessary?
- He's still in custody.

516
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,155
Can you give them a minute?

517
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,122
As long as he
keeps his distance.

518
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,921
I'm okay.

519
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,491
I haven't seen
him in six months.

520
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,101
How long can she last?

521
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,435
- It's hard to know.
- A few days at most.

522
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,803
- You should be helping her.
- We're trying.

523
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,140
No, you're not doing anything. You're
doctors. You're supposed to help.

524
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,775
Please let these
people help you.

525
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,486
People think that about
cancer? It's an urban myth.

526
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,247
Not to her. To
her, it's a reality.

527
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,686
Yeah. Superstition.

528
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,351
Yeah, well. There's no screening,
no early detection in her community.

529
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,292
She only sees
friends diagnosed late.

530
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,523
Look. Check this out.
Guy with colon cancer...

531
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,100
he comes and he presents
with bowel obstruction.

532
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,203
Gets surgery, mets
are everywhere.

533
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,771
They do the colostomy,
they close him back up.

534
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,339
- Dead in six months.
- Exactly.

535
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,239
All his friends say, "He was
fine till he got the surgery."

536
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,870
How you doing, Mrs. Graham?

537
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,543
Had the chance to think
about what we discussed?

538
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,214
I don't want no surgery.

539
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,116
They put a thin needle into
the lump and pull out some cells.

540
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,517
What happens then?

541
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,020
Well, based on the findings, we can
recommend the appropriate treatment.

542
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,955
Like what?

543
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,566
Well, you know, that
really depends on the tumor.

544
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,134
Could be radiation.
Could be chemotherapy.

545
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,134
Oh, no. I don't want that.

546
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,899
Look, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but is this about money?

547
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,375
You know, because with
cancer, you qualify for state aid.

548
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:01,207
It's not about money.

549
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,748
Look, if the biopsy shows
a certain kind of tumor...

550
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,909
your options are very good.

551
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,878
You could take medication
once a day and survive for years.

552
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,083
You're telling me I got
cancer in my bones...

553
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,091
and all I got to
do is take a pill?

554
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,919
If it's the right kind of tumor.

555
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,331
I'll take the pill then.

556
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,230
Good. First we have to do the
biopsy to make sure it'll work.

557
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,236
No. No needles, no surgery.

558
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,341
I've had it for two years,
and I been doing fine.

559
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,568
We can't help you
if you don't let us.

560
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,105
Who's gonna help me get
to the doctor all the time?

561
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,807
Gonna stay with me when
I'm spitting up all night?

562
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,050
Who's gonna help me up the
stairs when I'm too weak to walk?

563
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,817
Who's gonna do that? You?

564
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,893
Why do you want to kill yourself?
- To save you.

565
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,588
- She needs food.
- We know that.

566
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,427
Then feed her. Give her something.
- She wouldn't eat it.

567
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,570
- You can force it down her throat.
- Please.

568
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,762
I don't need help. I
can take care of myself!

569
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,770
Where can we put him?
- Family room.

570
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,172
- Bring the van around.
- You want to help. All you do is mess up!

571
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,745
- Don't talk like that.
- You should've forgot about me!

572
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,779
I was better off in El Salvador!

573
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,317
Hey. Hey! What is your problem?

574
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,785
- She has the problem.
- She's doing this for you.

575
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,753
Well, I never asked her to!

576
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,557
Come here.

577
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,962
Maybe we will force-feed her...

578
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,895
because your getting deported
sounds like a good idea now.

579
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,365
- I'll go back home. I don't care.
- So you wanna die?

580
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,095
Look, it's not like she
says. I had a good life there.

581
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,867
- She ruined everything.
- She wanted you to be together.

582
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,307
Right. Yeah. She worked
two jobs. I hardly know her.

583
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,777
She wanted a
better life for you.

584
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,506
Oh, yeah?

585
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,583
You think it worked out?

586
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,011
She loves you.

587
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,680
She isn't doing this for me.

588
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,382
She's doing this
because she feels guilty.

589
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,789
- Let her go, if that's what she wants.
- You don't mean that.

590
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,191
Sure, I do.

591
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,399
Just let her die.

592
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,709
Do you have Mueller's chart?

593
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,608
Oh, yeah.

594
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,408
Sorry. I'm doing three consults.

595
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,442
That's all right. I
just need to cosign it.

596
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,551
You wanna grab some lunch?

597
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:26,453
I, um... I have to
get up to the unit.

598
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,493
- Dinner?
- I don't know.

599
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,991
Look, I feel bad
about everything.

600
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,428
- Me too.
- Well, I'm sorry.

601
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,635
You know, I'm really good at
getting in my patients' heads.

602
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,241
I wish I'd been able to figure
out what was going on in yours.

603
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:56,416
I have to get up to the
ICU. There's a family waiting.

604
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,649
You left some stuff at my place.
I can bring them by sometime.

605
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,693
- I can come by tonight and pick it up.
- Okay.

606
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,523
Leave them in a
bag on the steps.

607
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,923
Sure.

608
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,465
If that's what you want.

609
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,234
Thanks.

610
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,605
Doc, think she'll eat now?

611
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,269
- Probably not.
- Too bad.

612
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,176
She'll die, the kid
will get deported.

613
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,182
- What about the hearing?
- Not sure if it'll change anything.

614
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,183
We'll see what my boss says.

615
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,844
<i>Good to go.</i>

616
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,786
- Thanks for your help.
- Can't say we didn't try.

617
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,587
Dr. Lewis, Elena's unresponsive.

618
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,390
I checked the Internet.
Forty-five days.

619
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,862
- For what?
- I.R.A. prisoners in Belfast.

620
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,796
They started dying
45 days after fasting.

621
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,732
- How long has she been going?
- Forty-one.

622
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,067
Oh, Sam. Paramedic's
on the MICN.

623
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,308
Hey. Okay, I made all the revisions,
rewrote the abstract and conclusion.

624
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,540
- I can't deal with this now.
- We got an hour.

625
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,151
Look it over. I can e-mail
it. We'll make the deadline.

626
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,651
- It's important to me too. Sorry.
- Dr. Lewis, please.

627
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,813
- May I call you Susan?
- No.

628
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,655
I need this publication for
my Chief Resident application.

629
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,756
Trust me. It's gonna take a
hell of a lot more than that.

630
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,773
Convert the chest
tube to a Heimlich valve.

631
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,275
Call for an ambulance and
have a nurse drop in on her.

632
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,415
You're sending her home? We
need to put a bit more pressure on her.

633
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,846
- I just tried.
- Not very hard.

634
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:35,010
- Well, we can't force her.
- Yeah, but we can help her.

635
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,884
Maybe in a couple days she'll
change her mind and reconsider.

636
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,356
- If she goes home, she's not coming back.
- Respecting her wishes is first.

637
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,119
Then maybe she'll
get into Oncology.

638
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,823
- Or she's lost to follow-up.
- This lady does not have a doctor.

639
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,866
She doesn't feel comfortable
with the medical system.

640
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,867
That's what's making it tough.

641
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,668
I'm feeling a lot better.

642
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,969
Beta-blockers kicked
in. Your heart rate's down.

643
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,204
- Cool.
- Overactive thyroid can cause glaucoma...

644
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,349
- so I need to check your eye pressures.
- Go for it.

645
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:07,315
First, a drop.

646
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,686
Now, this might
feel a little weird.

647
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,762
Excuse me. I need
a Heimlich valve.

648
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,894
- Go ahead.
- It's okay. It's okay.

649
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,295
- You use proparacaine?
- Yeah.

650
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,236
- Here.
- Did my eyeball come out?

651
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,929
Oh, my God! ABBY: Chuny...

652
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,598
10 of morphine right
away. Jake, dribble the local.

653
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,610
Adrian, what's happening to you is called
a subluxed globe. Get me an Attending.

654
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,680
- Kovac is here. ADRIAN:
Everything's blurry!

655
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,441
That's normal.
You're gonna be okay.

656
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,609
- Adrian, we need you to stay still.
- I can't!

657
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,185
Okay, you have to.

658
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,218
Is that Legal Aid
lawyer still here?

659
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,360
No. He had to go to class. Turns
out he's a third-year law student.

660
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,428
Cocky little bugger.

661
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,561
Hey.

662
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,260
Five more minutes and I'd
have given her the Ativan myself.

663
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,528
Sam, your hunger-strike
lady's asking for you.

664
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,831
- In there?
- She's coming around.

665
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,599
Elena, what do you need?

666
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,369
The bathroom.

667
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,377
The bathroom.

668
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,375
Where did this come from?

669
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,915
I don't know.

670
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,749
I didn't have an
order for an IV.

671
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,213
With an amp of multivites.

672
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,119
- Did you do this?
- No.

673
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,958
What's going on?

674
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,262
Uh, well, Elena's
awake. With an IV.

675
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,455
- Yeah, I can see that.
- What is this?

676
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,430
- We just...
- Could you two step outside?

677
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:30,933
I need to talk to Elena alone.

678
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,100
What happened?

679
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,804
It's okay.

680
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,811
Elena, it's okay.

681
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,140
- Wow.
- What?

682
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:47,184
Who knew Lewis could
start an IV all by herself?

683
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,621
All right, I'll stop by. Thanks.

684
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,991
Pratt, we'll run the board
as soon as I help Abby.

685
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,929
- I need to go up to Oncology for a bit.
- Okay.

686
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,027
Okay, Adrian. Keep looking down.

687
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,672
- You needed an Attending?
- Welcome to your night shift.

688
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,331
Subluxed globe. Scleral
pressure's not doing it.

689
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,001
- Okay. We need a Desmarres retractor.
- We don't have one.

690
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,512
Do we have a paper clip?
- A paper clip?

691
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,149
Yeah.

692
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,610
You're sticking a
paper clip in my eye?

693
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,844
Don't worry.

694
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,682
- You won't feel a thing.
- Oh, God.

695
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,517
Okay. How about some Versed?

696
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,917
Don't you have an eye
specialist or something?

697
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,528
Everything's okay,
Adrian. Stay still.

698
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,095
Nice and relaxed.

699
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:36,729
Okay, insert between the
upper lid and the superior rectus.

700
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,230
Right there.

701
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,501
It's... It's tough.

702
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,038
Jake, retract the lid superior.

703
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,369
Got it. KOVAC: Good.

704
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,874
- A little bit more.
- Cover the end...

705
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,675
depress with your ring finger.

706
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,079
You're doing great.
Take a deep breath.

707
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,723
Let it out. We're almost done.

708
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:02,023
Okay. The eyelid...

709
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,422
is past the equator.

710
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,257
Okay. Look up, Adrian.

711
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,892
Oh, my God.

712
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,697
I can see.

713
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,567
Nice.

714
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,735
I'm cold.

715
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,072
They're getting you
some warm blankets.

716
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,005
Did you do this?

717
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,249
It's just one bag.
After that, it's up to you.

718
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,652
But it was up to me already.

719
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,952
You know, I talked to some reporters.
You're getting a lot of attention.

720
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,357
Mm. Because I'm dying.

721
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,929
Here you go.

722
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:44,260
The INS is taking your demand
for a hearing very seriously.

723
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,234
They don't want the bad press.

724
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,938
You have done all you can.

725
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,977
It's okay to eat now.

726
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,305
Not until they let him stay.

727
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,117
He wasn't always like
this. He was a good boy.

728
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:05,621
He did a stupid thing, and
then, in jail, he joined the gang.

729
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,952
You try so hard, but you
never know how they'll turn out.

730
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,965
All he has now
is anger and hate.

731
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,630
But you want to keep going?

732
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,771
He's still my son...

733
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,970
even though he
doesn't care about me.

734
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,803
I think he does.

735
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,809
He just doesn't
know how to show it.

736
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:32,480
The last thing he said
to me on his way out was:

737
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,209
"Please don't let her die."

738
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,993
What time is the ambulance
coming to take me home?

739
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,824
Should be in about an hour.

740
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,829
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

741
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,294
As long as it's no surgeon.

742
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,831
She's not even a doctor.

743
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,472
Debra Graham, I'd like
you to meet May Crawford.

744
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,010
- Hello.
- What are you?

745
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,511
The social worker?

746
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,346
No.

747
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,346
A psychologist.

748
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,851
I'm a secretary at an ad agency.

749
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,818
And a breast-cancer survivor.

750
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,117
It's been three years now.

751
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,520
We'll let you two talk.

752
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,662
I had some spots on my bones.

753
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,026
That's how they found it.

754
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,727
- Really?
- Okay, where did you find her?

755
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,394
A cancer support group upstairs.

756
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:29,541
They have patient navigators to
help people get through the system.

757
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,073
Think it'll work?

758
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:34,045
Maybe she'll listen to her
more than she'll listen to us.

759
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,915
Hey.

760
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,222
Thought you were gonna
leave the stuff on the steps.

761
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,794
Yeah, I got stuck doing
an LP on a 300-pound guy.

762
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,930
- It's cold, huh?
- Yeah.

763
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,296
Springtime in Chicago.

764
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,501
Wanna come in for a
second and get warm?

765
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:04,042
I don't think so.
You have my stuff?

766
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,570
Yeah.

767
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,075
Hang on a second.

768
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,875
Thanks.

769
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,312
You need to get that?

770
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,453
No. The machine will pick it up.

771
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,723
Sure you don't wanna
come in? I could make coffee.

772
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,356
Or some tea.

773
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,567
No, I should get going.

774
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,432
Yeah.

775
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,604
Good night, John.

776
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,439
Good night.

777
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,085
We did a good job getting
that kid's eyeball back in.

778
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,982
Yes. We're a pretty good team.

779
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,612
Yeah. "This is Abby.
She's my teammate."

780
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,123
"This is Abby.
She's my partner."

781
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,727
No.

782
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,292
It sounds like we work
at a law firm. How about...

783
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,400
"my special friend"?

784
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,661
What are you afraid
that people will think?

785
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,863
- What?
- This morning, that's what you said.

786
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,608
I just don't want us to go too
fast and get ahead of ourselves.

787
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,274
- You have two weeks to decide.
- Decide what?

788
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,114
How fast you want to go,
how you'd like to be referred to.

789
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,813
What happens in two weeks?

790
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,457
- Big family thing.
- Oh, yeah?

791
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,423
- Yeah. It's like a Saturday brunch.
- Okay.

792
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,621
And before that, we're
gonna have to go to church.

793
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,834
- Church?
- Yeah. My niece is getting baptized.

794
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,197
- I have to hold her.
- Oh, you're the godfather.

795
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,602
Yeah. If something happens
to the parents, I'm responsible.

796
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,436
- That sort of thing.
- Mm-hm.

797
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,444
So I'm going to a baptism
as the godfather's...?

798
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,179
Fill in the blank.

799
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,844
<i>Dr. Carter? Ed Miyamoto.</i>

800
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,320
<i>The revised architect's plans will
be in my office Friday. Stop on by.</i>

801
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,355
<i>Hello. If your current
mortgage rate is more than...</i>

802
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,459
<i>Hi, John. About 6
in the morning here.</i>

803
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,362
<i>Just wanted to say hello.</i>

804
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:12,368
<i>You could call, but I'm
leaving for work in an hour.</i>

805
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:13,732
<i>Bye.</i>

806
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,542
Hey. Hi.

807
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,052
It's me.

808
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,586
I wasn't sure I was
gonna catch you.

809
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,027
Well, I just got home from work.

810
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,894
It was good.

811
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,391
I looked at the plans today.

812
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:44,596
Yeah. And I've been thinking
about a name for the building.

813
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:49,731
Well, how would you feel about
"The Joshua Carter Center"?

814
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,045
Yeah, after the baby.

815
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:01,252
For the first two days,
it's pretty much all IV...

816
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:05,083
but we can try a small
amount of clear liquids.

817
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,723
- That's it? SAM:
Just a few spoonfuls...

818
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,192
until your stomach
gets used to it.

819
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,633
I swore I wouldn't
stop until he was safe.

820
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,401
Bless us, O Lord,
in these, thy gifts...

821
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:30,446
which we are about to receive from
thy bounty through Christ our Lord.

822
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,317
Keep my son away from harm.

823
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,285
Amen.

824
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,721
- Amen.
- Amen.

825
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,525
Hello? Uh, yeah. Hey.

826
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,221
Okay, hold on.

827
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,824
Dr. Lewis, it's
Chuck on line four.

828
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,765
Oh. I'll take it in the hallway.

829
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,075
Okay. Okay, put him on.

830
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,017
Hi, baby. It's Mommy.

831
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:14,682
Yeah. You need to go
to bed for Daddy, okay?

832
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:17,192
I'll be home soon.

833
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,957
No, I'm sorry. I can't
do that right now.

834
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,665
Yeah. All right.

835
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,929
All right, I'll try.

836
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:30,475
"One hippo, all alone...

837
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,169
calls two hippos on the phone.

838
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:37,315
Three hippos at the door...

839
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:40,384
bring along another four.

840
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,680
Five hippos come overdressed.

841
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:47,019
Six hippos show up with a guest.

842
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:50,525
