00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,869
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,399
I take full responsibility for
what happened with Sanders.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,272
It won't happen again.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,437
Please, you got to help
him. I think he's dying.

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:14,974
Hey!

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,944
That man's just been
told his cancer has spread.

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,644
- Don't you think he has a reason to cry?
- Yes.

8
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,154
Fix my brother, bitch,
before I blow your head off!

9
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,758
I'm telling you to trust
yourself enough to comfort.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,529
- I said let's go.
- Please.

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,425
You don't have to do this.

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,498
I said lay down.

13
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,476
<i>I'm Ren√©e Montagne.
Today is Monday...</i>

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,696
<i>and this is</i> Morning
Edition <i>from NPR News.</i>

15
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,668
He's too young and he
shouldn't listen to that music.

16
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,541
I didn't know you
already said no.

17
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,181
I'm trying to teach him the value
of a dollar. You give him everything.

18
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,819
It was only 50 bucks.

19
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,046
For a concert ticket
for a 10-year-old? No.

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,690
I don't think you should
be worried about money.

21
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,827
Look, Luka, I appreciate
your generosity...

22
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,156
but I'm not gonna let
you pay for everything.

23
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,198
You don't have to pay half the
rent and the bills every month.

24
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,530
I managed to support me and
Alex for 10 years. I can handle it.

25
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,835
You know what?
This isn't about money.

26
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,169
You're worried about losing
your independence or something.

27
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,005
And about my role in Alex's
life. What, you're worried...

28
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,044
about losing control
over him or what?

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,879
- You know, you always do this.
- Do what?

30
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,711
Telling me what
I'm really mad about.

31
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,786
Most of the time you don't know
what you're really mad about.

32
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,287
Sam, this isn't our stop.

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,868
Hey.

34
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,870
Sleep okay?

35
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,402
Yeah.

36
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,737
Better than the night before?

37
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,408
You wanna eat anything
before you smoke?

38
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,074
No.

39
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,847
But thanks.

40
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,056
I can make French toast.

41
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,593
Aren't you on your way out?
- I have time.

42
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,764
Want anything to drink?

43
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,094
I bought groceries.
We've got milk, juice.

44
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,134
No, thanks. Were you
vacuuming last night?

45
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,738
- Sorry. Did I keep you up?
- No, I just...

46
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,639
No. That was very nice of you.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,978
Your shift starts at 2,
right? You ready to go back?

48
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,782
Well, I can't keep hanging
around here. I gotta get going again.

49
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,124
Everyone's been
asking how you are.

50
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:21,627
- So you're sure you're okay?
- What I really need is a little space.

51
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,762
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. I just...

52
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,601
You're right. I should find
a place. I'll start looking.

53
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,640
- You don't have to rush.
- No, really.

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,608
I'll see you at work.

55
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,200
They're not closing
the ER, are they?

56
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,308
The county health
system ran out of money.

57
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,706
They say that so the
government will bail us out.

58
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,973
- They're not meeting on the match.
- No. The applications aren't in.

59
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,514
That's why it's not the match.

60
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,016
- It's an Attendings meeting.
- But they usually meet upstairs.

61
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,848
Enough with the paranoia,
people. Let's get back to work.

62
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,582
- What's going on?
- Attending meeting.

63
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,557
Why? Why here? Why now?
- I don't know.

64
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,722
- Maybe they're cutting a Resident.
- No. You think that's what this is?

65
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,893
I don't know. But whatever
it is, it can't be good.

66
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,536
Uh-oh. Go, go, go!

67
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,502
What color are you
painting the room?

68
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,335
- Lime green.
- Why?

69
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,170
Because it's my favorite color.

70
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,678
Okay, the Attendings note. It's
not enough just to co-sign the chart.

71
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,943
You have to write your own
history, medical assessment and plan.

72
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,399
- On every patient? WEAVER:
It's the only way we get paid.

73
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,485
Sorry. Very long shift.

74
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,526
Yawning's contagious.

75
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,926
Cosmo's teething. I was
up all night. I'm exhausted.

76
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,261
We're down two
nurses. Anything else?

77
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,800
If we don't get our
patient-satisfaction scores up...

78
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,903
we can't start pursuing
HMO contracts.

79
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,939
- Okay, who's low?
- Ray, Neela, Morris.

80
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,600
- Abby's the only one with a decent score.
- Even Pratt's on the low end.

81
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,303
Pratt's okay with the patients.

82
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,379
It's the other doctors
he has a problem with.

83
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,643
Need the room for a brachial
artery laceration, 10 minutes out.

84
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,879
And Neela brings up the
rear with a score of 2.21.

85
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,956
If we wanna make
our patients happier...

86
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,457
we need to teach our residents
to connect with them better.

87
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,394
- What are you, the Croatian Dr. Phil?
- They can't communicate with each other.

88
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,295
Have you seen Neela and Pratt
work together? Ray and Morris?

89
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,665
We can teach them to make
eye contact, introduce themselves.

90
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,170
Act like human beings
in front of the patients.

91
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,639
That would change their
personality structure...

92
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,177
which would be great if we could
make their parents love them more.

93
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,976
Med schools churn out scientists. It's
up to us to turn them into physicians.

94
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,811
Try it. They can't do any worse.

95
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,777
I'm gonna get coffee.

96
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,586
I'm going home.

97
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,987
- How long you been waiting?
- About six hours.

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,322
Six hours? Ha.

99
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,830
A little longer, my friend, and you're
looking at a big cash settlement.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,595
- Here. Take one of my cards.
- Out of my way!

101
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,998
- Give one to your buddy.
- Out of my way.

102
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,834
My first job was working
in an orange juice factory.

103
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,500
Amy, could you sit down, please?
- But I got canned.

104
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,043
Couldn't concentrate.

105
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,544
I'd rather stand.

106
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,306
The seats are too small for her.

107
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,677
Oh, shut up, Cullum.

108
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,342
I'll get you in soon, okay?

109
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,351
Pratt, knee contusions, slipped
at work, can't bear weight.

110
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,823
I've got a hot MI so
it's gonna have to wait.

111
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,293
I didn't say it can't wait. I said
"can't bear weight," as in stand up.

112
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,625
I'll get to it when I get to it.

113
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,634
Plan to help Residents communicate,
you might wanna start with Pratt.

114
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,238
Tell me the truth. How
many Vicodin will it take...

115
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,534
for you to go away?
I'll write it down.

116
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,738
I'm doomed. Morris!

117
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,369
Relax and come talk
to me when you're done.

118
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

119
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,314
- Going home?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,045
I'm gonna go home, sleep off my shift,
come back in 12 hours and pick you up.

121
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,314
- Oh, really?
- Puccini's can take us at 9:00.

122
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,391
For me, it'll be breakfast. For
you, it'll be whatever you want.

123
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,394
Fantastic. I'm craving a pound of
pasta and some oily garlic bread.

124
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,234
- She's carbo-loading for a marathon.
- Enjoy your honeymoon.

125
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,064
- I'm gonna be fighting with Sam.
- Okay. Have fun with that.

126
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,230
Dr. Kovac, can you get
gastritis after 16 ibuprofen?

127
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,572
Uh, why's your patient taking that
much medicine? Is he depressed?

128
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,543
I was just about to check.

129
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,740
There you go. SAM: Neela.

130
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,045
Amy Packer, an obese
15-year-old with a forehead lac.

131
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,243
What happened?

132
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,651
Brother hit her over
the head with a lamp.

133
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,419
Hi, Amy. This is Dr. Rasgotra.

134
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,721
- Hi.
- Hi. This is Cullum.

135
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,421
- I can't get up.
- Oh, here. Let me help you. Here.

136
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,760
She's too fat to get up.

137
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,283
Oww.

138
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,113
Oh, my goodness. That
was quite the fall, young lady.

139
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,619
- Oh, thank you. HERB:
Okay. Can you believe it?

140
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,954
There you go. All this ice and
not a speck of salt to be seen.

141
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:51,223
I think the hospital is negligent
and responsible for your injury.

142
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,957
Oh, no. I don't have an injury.

143
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,730
Well, gonna feel okay
probably for the first 24 hours.

144
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,462
And then the pain develops.

145
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,267
You could be looking at
long-term disability from...

146
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,740
for example, lumbar
myofascial strain...

147
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,312
or disc herniation
syndrome with radiculopathy.

148
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,675
It's just a bruise.

149
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,317
I think an MRI is
indicated definitely.

150
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,817
- Are you a doctor?
- Uh, no. Attorney.

151
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,088
Herb Spivak, attorney
at law. My card.

152
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,493
Dr. Lewis, OIG, line 2. Claiming
we transferred an unstable patient.

153
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,653
- You're a doctor, huh?
- Yeah.

154
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,492
Let me tell you something.

155
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,827
You never know when you're
gonna need more protection.

156
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,937
These hospital bigwigs
will let you hang out to dry...

157
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,470
if you ever get sued.

158
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,337
If you solicit any more patients in my
bay, I will have you forcibly removed.

159
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,277
How about a free pen?

160
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,714
Follow my finger, um...

161
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,612
- Amy.
- Thank you.

162
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,047
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.

163
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,812
- Neela, present to me when you're done.
- Oh, okay.

164
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,856
- Am I in some sort of trouble?
- No, no. Just keep going.

165
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,654
- It's Mr. Meacham, right?
- The one and only.

166
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,990
Tell me about your pain.
Did you have an injury?

167
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,031
- I was moving boxes at work.
- Where do you work?

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,691
I used to work as a lumberjack.

169
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,167
But I couldn't hack it,
so they gave me the ax.

170
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,329
Is it worse when you walk?

171
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,204
- Can I help with something, Dr. Kovac?
- Just observing.

172
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,208
- You have pain in any of the joints?
- No.

173
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,711
Can you get a postural
vitals for me in Exam 2?

174
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:18,010
Getting slammed. I'm setting
Neela up for suturing, I got a Foley...

175
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:23,088
an NG, two IVs to start, and a
five-page patient-transfer summary.

176
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,054
I got your tray.

177
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,586
Amy, I talked to your
mom. She's on her way.

178
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,891
Oh, my foster mom.
He's her real son.

179
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,901
- How long have you been with them?
- Since last March. Ow!

180
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,367
Sorry.

181
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,904
Uh, that was lidocaine
to numb up your cut.

182
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,735
Die! Ha!

183
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,070
I hope he's
referring to his game.

184
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,744
Cullum needs his meds adjusted.
That's why he has tantrums.

185
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,780
- Die, die, die.
- Is that what happened?

186
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,713
- He lost his temper?
- Kind of.

187
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,083
- What meds is he on?
- Adderall and Depakote for ADHD...

188
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,689
and ODD.

189
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,057
I'll be back to sew you up.

190
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,862
Does it seem like every 10-year-old
boy you see nowadays has ADHD?

191
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,763
ADHD, a Game Boy and an iPod.

192
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,803
Foster kid, head injury,
unsupervised home...

193
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,566
- We should call Social Work.
- I think Wendall's on.

194
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,768
- Look, I know how to do an H &
P. NEELA: Excuse me, Dr. Kovac.

195
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,914
Hold on. How long did you let
him talk before interrupting him?

196
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,110
- Twenty, 30 seconds.
- Four.

197
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,152
- What color were his eyes?
- I don't know. We weren't on a date.

198
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,447
Didn't make eye contact.
Listen to his heart?

199
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,955
The guy had a twisted knee.
- Doesn't matter.

200
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,221
Listen to his heart to show you care
and that you're paying attention to detail.

201
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,558
- I don't have time.
- It takes one minute.

202
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:43,396
Makes a difference between your patient
feeling taken care of and feeling ignored.

203
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,301
We got patients that have
been waiting over nine hours.

204
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,805
Believe me, they
already feel ignored.

205
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,309
- You ready to present?
- I think I need to redo my exam.

206
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,615
Listen, it's about
connecting better. If

207
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,011
your patients trust
you, she'll heal faster.

208
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,123
- That's what all the studies say, okay?
- Okay.

209
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,519
I find it really distracting working
with somebody so good-looking.

210
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,129
Who? Dr. Kovac?

211
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,162
Oh, come on. Don't
pretend he's not hot.

212
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,028
I don't know, you
just get used to it.

213
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,465
- Yeah. But he's gorgeous.
- Who's gorgeous?

214
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,434
Got a John Doe.

215
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,540
Looks about 16. Multiple
GSWs to the chest.

216
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,471
- Any vitals in the field?
- Nothing.

217
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:26,704
Luka. Tier one, no BP. Never
had a rhythm. Fixed and dilated.

218
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,711
- You wanna call it?
- Let's see.

219
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,679
Should we get some O-neg?

220
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,979
- Am I missing something?
- No. Let's stick with saline for now.

221
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,952
I thought asystole in the field
meant zero percent survival.

222
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,523
Sam, start compressions.

223
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,853
- You want labs too?
- No. Just check a crit.

224
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,156
- Oh, this is like some sort of practice.
- Apparently.

225
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,855
Oh, can I do a chest tube?

226
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,898
No. Neela's gonna do
a saphenous cutdown.

227
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,399
- She is?
- I am?

228
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,696
Oh, cool.

229
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,363
Okay, let's prep and drape
the ankle. 10 blade to Neela.

230
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:02,338
Okay. Now make your incision from
the anterior tibia to the medial malleolus.

231
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,750
You a doctor? I think
I'm having an aneurysm.

232
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,547
Sir, please wait back inside
for a doctor to get to you.

233
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,054
- Pratt, you got a sec?
- I could be having a stroke!

234
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,659
- Probably a headache.
- They might cut a resident?

235
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,692
I'm gonna sue you
if I end up paralyzed.

236
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,421
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.

237
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,088
- Gentlemen, please!
- I'm serious.

238
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,756
My attorney's
office is right there.

239
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,607
<i>Did a doctor screw you up?</i>

240
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,100
<i>Come visit the
Mobile Law Office...</i>

241
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,765
<i>of Herb W. Spivak.</i>

242
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,276
He's had two rounds of epi and
atropine. Holding compressions.

243
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,914
One more tie on the distal segment.
- Okay.

244
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,244
Asystole. How much longer?

245
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,717
Until the third liter's in.

246
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,183
Sam, resume compressions.

247
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,030
Now, get your femoral pulse.

248
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,967
- Can't quite get one.
- It's because he bled out.

249
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,070
Third liter's in.

250
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,630
Uh, no pulse. Okay, that's it.

251
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,537
Time of death, 9:52.

252
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,111
- Thanks for showing me.
- Yeah. Write up your note. I'll co-sign.

253
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,271
Any identifying marks?

254
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,110
Brand-new sneakers, blue.

255
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,253
Wonder what he was thinking
when he put those on this morning?

256
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,481
- What?
- Had it been just us...

257
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,286
you would've
pronounced him dead.

258
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,952
- He was hypovolemic.
- He never had a pulse.

259
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,564
There was a chance he
might respond to a fluid bolus.

260
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,998
If you were really serious, you
would have ordered the O-neg.

261
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:33,162
Someday they might find themselves with
no rapid infuser or a central-line kit.

262
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,579
If they know how to do a
cutdown, they could save a life.

263
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,635
I can't afford to waste time on teaching
cases when there's real work to do.

264
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,576
This is what we
do. We train doctors.

265
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:45,116
Sometimes that means running through
codes so residents learn procedures.

266
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:49,016
- I mean, it's a teaching hospital.
- Yeah! It's also a real hospital...

267
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,419
with patients who
didn't get antibiotics...

268
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,651
because I was in here
doing compressions.

269
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,422
So you did some extra compressions.
What are you really mad about?

270
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,426
Are you in all seriousness telling
me for the second time today...

271
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,572
that I am not mad about
what I'm really mad about?

272
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,171
I have no idea
what you just said.

273
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,375
Forget it.

274
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,851
Nine hundred dollars for
a studio in Andersonville.

275
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,615
- What happened? Abby kick you out?
- No.

276
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,349
- Yes.
- When's she coming in?

277
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,187
Shift starts at 2.

278
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,488
You know, I've missed her.

279
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,959
What? I have.

280
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,862
I just got a two-bedroom
sublet on North and Oakley...

281
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,525
for just 1000 a month.

282
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,965
Wicker Park.

283
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,072
But my roommate
just flaked out on me.

284
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,435
Back in rehab, huh?

285
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,043
You wouldn't happen
to be interested in, um...?

286
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,702
You mean you and me?

287
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,646
- Five hundred's better than a grand.
- Thanks. I'll think about it.

288
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,374
Morris.

289
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,783
Hey, isn't that
our local shyster?

290
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,419
- Damn.
- No, no, no. Allow me.

291
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,323
Go for it, Archie.

292
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,458
Hi, I'm looking for
a Dr. Ras-goostra.

293
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,124
Rasgotra? That's me.

294
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,238
Hi. I'm Kitty Peyser. I'm
Amy's foster mom. Is she okay?

295
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,239
She's fine. She's just needs
some stitches and a tetanus shot.

296
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,435
I heard they got in a fight. Cullum's
not bad. He needs his meds.

297
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,137
Perhaps you'd like to
talk to our social worker?

298
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,942
No, I just wanna
see my daughter.

299
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,277
I should tell you, I had
to notify Social Work.

300
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,977
- They'll probably be contacting DCFS.
- What?

301
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,091
- When children come in with suspicious...
- No, no, no, come on. Hey, kids fight.

302
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,750
- It's a standard situation.
- There is no situation.

303
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,361
Mrs. Peyser...

304
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,863
Look, don't do this to us. We
love Amy. They'll take her away.

305
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,094
- Amy, I'm here.
- Hi.

306
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,971
Multiple GSWs. Gang shootout
on the corner of 51st and King.

307
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,009
Tachy at 138. BP, 85 palp.
- I'll take the airway.

308
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,676
- What do you got? PRATT:
Three gunshots to the abdomen.

309
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,372
Run it, Pratt.

310
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,882
No breath sounds on the left.
Morris, chest tube. Jane, subclavian.

311
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,453
Ray, stop staring at the
monitor and concentrate.

312
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,784
I've never done a subclavian.
- Hey!

313
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,121
It's time to buck up. Central-line
kit. Did you get rid of Herb yet?

314
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,889
No. He says he has a client
at the hospital revising her will.

315
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,089
Ho-ho. He is wily, that one.

316
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,970
- Stay in the midline, Ray.
- I got it.

317
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,734
Does he need atropine or epi?

318
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,141
No. He needs oxygen.
The tube's not in.

319
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,333
Oh, great.

320
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,741
You have to see it
go through the cords.

321
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,814
- Give me the blade.
- Let me try again.

322
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,415
Maybe next time. Tube.

323
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,182
- Pratt, why don't you try teaching?
- Oh, okay.

324
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,615
You did it wrong. Watch me.

325
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,884
Call Surgery. This
guy needs an ex-lap.

326
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,651
And I'm in.

327
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,193
See? It's just that simple.

328
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,059
- Thank you, Greg.
- Anytime, Ray.

329
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,666
Am I gonna have a scar?

330
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,324
Just a little line.

331
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,596
We'll take you to
Darlene's salon tomorrow.

332
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,501
- We'll get you bangs.
- That'd be nice.

333
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,767
Keep the wound dry
till the stitches come out.

334
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,501
So no baths and no swimming.

335
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,709
I should go check on Cullum.

336
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,444
Mary, can you take Mrs.
Peyser to the family room?

337
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,241
- Sure.
- Don't worry, Amy.

338
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,511
Everything's gonna be fine.

339
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,728
So Neosporin twice a day...

340
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,028
and come back if it's red,
painful or draining fluid.

341
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,803
Does your cut hurt?

342
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,945
- What's wrong?
- I know what's gonna happen.

343
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,644
Once you call in Social Work...

344
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:46,259
- Amy, don't get ahead of yourself.
- I can't leave. They need me.

345
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,497
I give Cullum his pills every
morning, and I get him ready for school.

346
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,462
That's a lot of responsibility
for a girl your age.

347
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,000
It's the only home where I
haven't been beaten up or ignored.

348
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,435
Kitty loves me. She needs me.

349
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,804
My whole life, I've
never felt that before.

350
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,351
- Sam.
- Yeah?

351
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,681
Did you already call Social
Work on Amy Packer?

352
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,756
Yeah. Wendall will be down soon.

353
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,589
What is that?

354
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,258
It's still caffeine.

355
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,422
Call Wendall back and
tell her not to bother?

356
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,535
- Why?
- I was too quick. I should have waited.

357
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,330
She's a foster kid. We
always call Social Work.

358
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,169
- What are you doing?
- Stabbing me to death.

359
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,315
I think he's dehydrated.

360
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,712
Ow! Do I look like
a pincushion to you?

361
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,285
He's my patient. Why are
you torturing my patient?

362
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,548
Jane said Dr. Kovac told her
you needed some help today.

363
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,652
Sats, 79. Barely any pulse.

364
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,294
Let me do it. You can
practice later on a dummy.

365
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,329
- I can't get the tube into the space.
- Use a twisting motion.

366
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,524
- Systolic's only 60. Cycle the DynaMap.
- Your incision big enough?

367
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,964
- I don't know.
- Morris.

368
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,299
- You've done a chest tube before, right?
- P.E.A. Lost the pulse.

369
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,737
- Give me the tube. Out of the way.
- No, I got it.

370
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,208
- You need to manage your team.
- I don't know how to explain any better.

371
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,643
- Bradying down to 50.
- Amp of epi.

372
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,910
- You criticize and make them nervous.
- What do you think you're doing to me?

373
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,883
Kid doesn't have
time for them to learn.

374
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,522
- Hello. We can hear you.
- We're standing right here.

375
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,282
He's pulseless.

376
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,793
Check it again.

377
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,325
- Good carotid.
- Tension pneumo.

378
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,396
- It's a common cause of P.E.A.
- His sats are rising.

379
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,902
So do you mind if I ask our
Residents to roll him up to the O.R.?

380
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,007
Or do you think that that
would hurt their feelings?

381
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,676
What was that all about?

382
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:50,840
That was an intubation, a chest tube
and a central-line in under 15 minutes.

383
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,008
The point is not
to do it all yourself.

384
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,547
Because you all had a
group hug this morning...

385
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,384
do I have to listen to this
touchy-feely crap all day?

386
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,856
- Yeah.
- I'm not an intern, okay?

387
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,289
So stop acting like one.

388
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,397
You have people under you.
You're responsible for teaching them.

389
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,261
So are you gonna build
their confidence or destroy it?

390
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,530
Well, if the choice is between building
up self-esteem and saving my patient...

391
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,937
I'm gonna have to go
with my patient every time.

392
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,151
I don't know, they
were unsupervised.

393
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,882
The mother seems overwhelmed,
the brother has problems.

394
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,253
This is her fifth home.

395
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:38,261
It's not a perfect family, but she
says it's the best she's ever had.

396
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,231
I haven't spoken to their caseworker.
Safest thing is pull her from the home.

397
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,496
She's happy there. No guarantee
things will be better anywhere else.

398
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,799
You guys talking
about that foster kid?

399
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,605
They're happy together. The
family seems to be working.

400
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,977
If the mom agrees to parenting
classes, I'll consider re-evaluating...

401
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,743
Neela, some landlord
for you on line two.

402
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,581
I'll take it in Admit. She'll
do whatever you need.

403
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,486
I tell you, I find hospital
conditions absolutely woeful.

404
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,924
- Are you overworked and underpaid?
- I'm a nurse.

405
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,622
- You can't be back here. Get out.
- You can't kick me out. I'm a patient.

406
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,962
- What?
- That's right. Very bad sore throat.

407
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,933
- Sore throat?
- I signed in. Yeah.

408
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,971
I know you guys are backed
up, so don't worry, I'll wait.

409
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,168
Just take all the time you need.
I'm gonna fetch me a lozenge.

410
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,478
- Haldol and hard restraints?
- Huh?

411
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,015
We could treat him like a psych
patient with delusions of being a lawyer.

412
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,482
- Abby?
- Abby.

413
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,281
- Hi.
- Hi.

414
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,151
- Um, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

415
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,656
- Good to see you.
- You too.

416
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,454
- Oh, my God, Abby. Did you get my card?
- Yeah. Thank you.

417
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,153
I prayed for you.

418
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,392
No windows at all? Shared
bathroom? Is that even legal here?

419
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,163
- Abby finally kicked her out?
- Well, how much a month?

420
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,801
Whew. It's ugly out there.

421
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:02,376
You usually do early shifts, right?
So you can go for gigs with your band?

422
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,382
Yeah. And if you stick to
your late shifts and overnights...

423
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,146
Weeks could go by, we
might never see each other.

424
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,549
Months even.

425
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,653
Welcome, roomie.

426
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,823
God, I'm gonna regret this.

427
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,898
Excuse me, please. Excuse
me. I need to see my grandson.

428
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,039
- What's his name?
- Michael. Michael Barnes.

429
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:30,665
- His friends said he got shot.
- I don't see the name.

430
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:36,347
He's 16. He was wearing jeans,
a gray T-shirt and sneakers.

431
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,679
- Blue sneakers?
- Yes. Yes. You saw him?

432
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,412
A patient came in earlier
matching that description.

433
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,682
- Is he okay?
- If you'd like to take a seat...

434
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:48,726
- I can get the Attending for you.
- Wait a minute. Has something happened?

435
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,123
- Ma'am...
- Is he dead?

436
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,269
I can't give any more
information until...

437
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:53,926
Is he okay? Why
can't you tell me?

438
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,796
- Ma'am, please calm down.
- Where is he? I need to see him.

439
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,369
- If you'd like to take a seat...
- Where's my grandson?

440
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,031
- We can't confirm anything until...
- His name is Michael Barnes. Michael?

441
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,303
We can't confirm anything
until the body's been ID'd.

442
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,106
What?

443
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,312
Oh, God.

444
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,451
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

445
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,052
Just let me go and
get the Attending. I'm...

446
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,628
Ma'am, if you'd just like to take a
seat, and I'm sure the Attending can...

447
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,928
Oh, Michael. God.

448
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,068
- Where's the grandmother now?
- Crying it out in the family room.

449
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,180
I guess Neela needs to work
a little on her death notification.

450
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,546
A little? Grandma's traumatized. I
can't believe we didn't have to sedate her.

451
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:49,587
You can't teach basic people-skills.
You know how to relate to people or not.

452
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,223
- Croissant?
- I'll go talk to her.

453
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,256
You realize you're
just encouraging him.

454
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,418
Just because he's a shark doesn't
mean we can't eat his pastries.

455
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,124
Hey, who's on call for
general surgery tonight?

456
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,562
- Sung.
- Okay.

457
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,260
I have to track down an
abdominal series from Radiology.

458
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,964
And I have a puking lady that had a
dystonic reaction to phenothiazines.

459
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,405
- Zofran?
- Yeah, right.

460
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,306
- So how are you doing?
- Good.

461
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,912
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Never better.

462
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:18,646
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes.

463
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,921
I processed feelings of anger, shame and
guilt in an emotionally safe environment.

464
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,989
I've addressed the
urge to use alcohol.

465
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,059
And I've consulted both a
shaman and a guru, so I'm all good.

466
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,593
That was Wendall,
our social worker.

467
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,062
She's getting information
from your foster mom.

468
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,167
- She's not gonna take me away?
- No.

469
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,402
Your foster mom's
gonna take some classes.

470
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,336
You and Cullum will start an after-school
program so you can go home together.

471
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,304
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,239
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,280
Mary, can you take Amy up
to the seventh floor, please?

474
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,784
- Sure.
- They'll be waiting for you.

475
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:06,129
- So you convinced Social Work, huh?
- It seems so.

476
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,826
- Good job.
- I took your advice. I tried to connect.

477
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:13,097
Didn't do such a good job
with the grandmother though.

478
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,342
You and Dr. Lewis must
think I'm a complete idiot.

479
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,809
No, no. You're just inexperienced.
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

480
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,216
First, you bring them into the family
room for a death notification. Sit down.

481
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,315
Somewhere away from
the patients and the staff.

482
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,652
- She just got so hysterical.
- Make sure they are sitting down.

483
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,795
Don't be evasive and
don't use euphemisms.

484
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,988
- Use the word "dead" and the word "is."
- I know all this.

485
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:43,625
Give them a tissue. Look them
in the eye and make a connection.

486
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,340
Then just say, "I'm very sorry."

487
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,581
- It's okay.
- I suck.

488
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:02,119
No, you don't suck.
You're still learning.

489
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:18,332
I can't believe this. I'm in
a wedding next weekend.

490
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:24,374
- One percent lido with epi, 6-0 Vicryl.
- God, I'm gonna ruin all the photographs.

491
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:27,069
They won't look at you,
they'll be looking at the bride.

492
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,238
- You owe me one.
- What? No, I don't.

493
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,543
Yeah, you do. I put down
the NG on Mrs. Leerburger.

494
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,016
I didn't ask you to do that.

495
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,121
- Dr. Kovac did.
- What?

496
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:40,749
He said you were a little
overextended today, unlike the rest of us.

497
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,359
Uh, Abby, will you excuse me?
I have to go yell at someone.

498
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,089
Have fun.

499
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:51,860
Okay, Miss Tobel, in the future, try not
to pluck your eyebrows in a moving car.

500
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,303
Okay, numb and prep
the wound. I'll be right back.

501
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,610
Get away from me! I
know what you want!

502
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,939
- You wanna make me suffer!
- Security!

503
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:05,312
- Lockhart, you're back. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

504
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:09,387
I called John Manning at the International
Society for Traumatic Stress Studies...

505
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,218
We're looking for our son.
We've been waiting for an hour.

506
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:15,054
His name is Tevin. Tevin Burrough.
- Hold on. I'll check.

507
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,890
We've been here an hour.
Where you going? Get back, bitch!

508
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,589
Effective in the treatment
of traumatic disorders.

509
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,463
You focus on the most vivid
image, emotion or sensation...

510
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,402
in traumatic memory, simultaneously
focusing on an external impulse.

511
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:31,801
I printed out a bunch of the studies
for you. You can take a look at them.

512
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:35,414
- We can talk about them tomorrow.
- Okay, thank you.

513
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,641
Good. Okay.

514
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,607
Abby, eyebrow lac's ready.

515
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,273
You were gonna show me
how to do a running subcuticular.

516
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,650
Right.

517
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,051
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yeah, I'm fine.

518
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,013
This won't leave
a mark, will it?

519
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:49,553
Dr. Lockhart is using a special
technique to minimize scarring.

520
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,088
Abby?

521
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,599
Um...

522
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,227
I'm sorry. I can't
do this right now.

523
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:10,336
What? ABBY: Sorry.

524
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,011
- Joe, what happened?
- He threatened to sue me.

525
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,581
He's parked in
front of a hydrant.

526
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,160
What's with the motor home?

527
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,846
I'm getting rid of it.

528
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,379
- Susan.
- Yeah?

529
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,183
Uh, I think maybe I
came back too soon.

530
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,620
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

531
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,885
I'm not in the right
frame of mind to do this.

532
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,724
- Take all the time you need.
- Ray's staying late to cover.

533
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,696
No, it's okay. Don't worry
about it. I'll call you later.

534
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,365
Sorry. Sorry.

535
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,117
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

536
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,647
God.

537
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,087
You'll catch the next one.

538
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,628
Thank you.

539
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,269
Spivak, get out here now.

540
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,609
- Hello, doctor.
- Oh, come on. We fixed you up.

541
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,606
- Jerry.
- The guy has really great coffee.

542
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,422
Sorry.

543
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,588
Ahh.

544
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,790
Dr. Lewis. Are you ready to
discuss this morning's fall?

545
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,333
- Did you sign Mr. Fayen in to CT?
- Yeah.

546
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,372
I had to go up to CT to push
morphine instead of doing it here.

547
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,942
- Just trying to help.
- No. You're being passive-aggressive.

548
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,544
- Why are you so mad?
- Because...

549
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,011
I'm used to having control over my life.
- Sam.

550
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,621
- What?
- Do you know where Neela is?

551
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,308
No.

552
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,680
You're the Attending on
Amy Packer, the foster kid?

553
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,880
- Yeah.
- This is Mari Hinojosa from DCFS.

554
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,319
I have bad news.

555
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,131
- I think that's everything.
- Thank you.

556
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,792
- "Desensitization reprocessing"?
- Yeah.

557
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,200
It's some crazy stuff
Dubenko gave me.

558
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,372
- Want me to give it a try?
- No. I think it's dead.

559
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,869
Procrastinating.

560
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,644
Didn't miss it at all.

561
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,878
Work, over the holidays.

562
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,393
I must've made an impression on you.
You didn't notice I was gone for a week.

563
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,560
No, I remember. You're
the guy with the beard.

564
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,199
Yeah.

565
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:52,562
- Where did you go?
- Yellowstone.

566
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,265
The most beautiful place
on earth. You ever been?

567
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:01,041
I didn't realize it until I was smack
in the middle of the geysers...

568
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,479
but the whole thing is actually
one gigantic active volcano.

569
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,575
- Did you know that?
- No, I did not.

570
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:12,281
It could blow at any second.
It's actually 30,000 years overdue.

571
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,853
And what would happen if it did?

572
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,126
It would wipe out most
of the western U.S.

573
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:25,601
Cover the rest of the country in ash.
Wreak havoc on the global climate.

574
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,680
Is that all?

575
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:31,775
We'd be gone in an
instant, just like that.

576
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,913
That's how fragile life is. You
know that. You work in the ER.

577
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,639
Yeah.

578
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:46,219
The human life span is so short
anyways. It's almost irrelevant.

579
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,527
Are you high?

580
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,895
There's your train.

581
00:33:56,935 --> 00:34:00,303
- See you later.
- Thank you.

582
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,833
Bye.

583
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,680
Between the paramedics and the doctors
here, we worked on him for 45 minutes...

584
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:21,486
- but his injuries were too severe.
- His mother died when he was 5.

585
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,597
Your son did well in surgery. They were
able to control the bleeding in his liver.

586
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:28,728
Since then, it's just
been the two of us.

587
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:31,670
He wasn't in pain,
and he didn't suffer.

588
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,305
I knew something like
this was gonna happen.

589
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,276
His heart and his brain were
spared. He'll probably do just fine.

590
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:43,174
- He was talking about going to college.
- I'm very sorry.

591
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,791
He's gonna be groggy...

592
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,295
but he might be able to
hear what you're saying.

593
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,325
Take as much time as
you need to say goodbye.

594
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,412
This isn't my grandson.

595
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,880
This isn't my son.

596
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:25,346
Oh, God.

597
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,226
Hello?

598
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,029
Hi.

599
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:39,229
No. No, they can't refuse to admit
her. She's got post-op adhesions.

600
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,373
<i>The surgeon's gonna
rip our heads off...</i>

601
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,734
Haleh.

602
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,375
Haleh. Listen. Listen. Okay.

603
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:49,344
Just push four of morphine,
and I'll be there in a minute, okay?

604
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,380
- Fine. Bye.
- How the hell did this happen?

605
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,541
- I'm not sure yet...
- Were they mislabeled?

606
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,710
- I don't know.
- Did they look the same?

607
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,879
- Was there a computer glitch?
- I don't know.

608
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,184
All I know is that there
were two John Doe's...

609
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,259
both 16, gunshot
wounds, gang-related.

610
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,453
Both treated in Trauma
1 a few hours apart.

611
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,894
Susan, I just do not
understand how this happened.

612
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,193
There was a massive
communication failure.

613
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,235
Well, it's your job to make
sure that people communicate.

614
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,238
I take full responsibility for it.
- We screwed up.

615
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,104
We didn't know there
were two John Does.

616
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,211
We didn't speak to each
other or check the board.

617
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,573
Who was in which trauma?

618
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,580
Neela, Sam and I worked on a
kid with a saphenous cutdown.

619
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,581
Morris, Ray, Pratt
and I had the other.

620
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,380
There was no overlap
between the traumas?

621
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,113
I was in both.

622
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,384
- Who's that?
- Med student.

623
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,460
- I put a name alert on the board.
- Why didn't you say anything?

624
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,557
No one listens to me. No one
even remembers I was in the room.

625
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,767
- You look like you could use a vacation.
- No.

626
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:51,569
I got this great time-share down in
Boca Grande that I let friends use.

627
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:55,077
- Friends?
- You know, friends that refer friends.

628
00:36:55,447 --> 00:37:00,784
It's got a great house and this
beautiful boat and a pair of Jet Skis.

629
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,250
Spivak? HERB: Ohh...

630
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,082
Security.

631
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,315
Come on, give me
a break, will you?

632
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,127
- You're back.
- Yep.

633
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,598
- Thought your shift was over.
- No, not till 10.

634
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,533
- So you were just taking a break?
- I guess so.

635
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,969
- Up on the El tracks?
- Yeah.

636
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,640
- I love it up there.
- Me too.

637
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,142
Never know who
you might run into.

638
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,478
We just put them through
hell. What will you say?

639
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:35,211
I'll tell the truth. Families of dead
patients don't remember much.

640
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,288
The only thing they remember
is if it seemed like you cared.

641
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,551
If you were honest
and direct with them.

642
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,994
Did Dr. Lewis tell you to
keep me away from them?

643
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,565
Yeah.

644
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,471
- I wanna go in with you.
- Okay.

645
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,683
It's unconstitutional.

646
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,845
Thank you. Do not cross this
line, or I will have you arrested.

647
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,015
- I don't see any line.
- You know what I mean.

648
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:17,185
- You can't come back here.
- This is a public institution.

649
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:21,197
- It doesn't matter.
- Well, you're violating my civil rights.

650
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,335
I never got to see a doctor.

651
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,594
So sue me.

652
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,772
Your office is being
towed, by the way.

653
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,203
Yo! Yo, yo, yo!

654
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:35,407
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Come
on! Come on! Have some pity!

655
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,881
- So much for Herb.
- Whatever. You know he'll be back.

656
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:48,452
Amy? What's going on?

657
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,026
- Who are you?
- I'm her doctor.

658
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,562
- I'm bringing her to the Haley Home.
- She lied to me.

659
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,461
- Go talk to your social worker.
- I don't understand. Stop.

660
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,398
I have two more kids to pick
up. Don't make my job any harder.

661
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,404
- Amy, wait.
- She told me I could go home.

662
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:07,311
- Thirty days?
- You can have visitors after two weeks.

663
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,778
- I need to talk to you.
- Cold turkey, just like that?

664
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,748
Well, they give you medication
to help ease the withdrawal.

665
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,910
Think about it, okay?

666
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,914
How could you pull Amy out
of her home behind my back?

667
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,424
It wasn't behind your back.
We got new information.

668
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,893
- We had a plan.
- Her caseworker was out of town...

669
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,726
- Why didn't you tell me?
- If you would stop interrupting...

670
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,927
- You're supposed to consult the doctor...
- Kovac signed off.

671
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,765
- Hey.
- I'm hating doctors right now.

672
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,604
Neela's mad, Ray practically
accused me of elder abuse.

673
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,269
Morris laughed when this
kid kicked me in the shin.

674
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,645
- I was gonna ask if you were ready.
- That's all you have to say?

675
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,480
You know, we come from
different perspectives sometimes...

676
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:52,454
and sometimes we disagree. But
whatever happened, you were right.

677
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,957
- Why didn't you tell me about Amy?
- I was going to.

678
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,321
- When?
- When I had time.

679
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,123
Thought it might be better if
you found out after your shift.

680
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,323
I'm an adult. I don't
need you to protect me.

681
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:05,300
I wasn't trying to. You made a good
decision based on information you had.

682
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,939
- But there was a pattern of incidents.
- Like what?

683
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,789
Like April 16th, scald
injury to shoulder.

684
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:14,641
Sounds pretty minor to me.

685
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:18,806
- July 14th, bite inflicted by brother.
- Who we know has behavioral issues.

686
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,452
October 20th, clavicular
fracture after a fall.

687
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,613
November 30th, 14-centimeter
leg lac after tripping on stairs.

688
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,952
Her history wasn't
consistent with her injuries.

689
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,651
Okay.

690
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,224
Each one is not a big
deal, but together...

691
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:33,248
I got it.

692
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,202
I thought it was a done deal, told
Amy everything would work out.

693
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,360
- I got her hopes up.
- Well, in the end...

694
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,633
- we're doing the right thing for her.
- So why not just tell me that?

695
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:48,135
I was worried that finding out
would make you lose your confidence.

696
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,976
And I didn't want
that to happen, so...

697
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,311
If I was trying to protect
you, I'm sorry, okay?

698
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,193
You know, I didn't always
used to be a mobile lawyer.

699
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,691
I used to have big
money. Big, big money.

700
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,766
I lost my shirt
on niftypets.com.

701
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,869
- Can I get something for the pain?
- Sure.

702
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,699
Soon as we finish this
paperwork required by our lawyer...

703
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,036
- to guard against frivolous lawsuits.
- I ain't signing nothing.

704
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,077
This document gives us
permission to treat you.

705
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:25,182
This second one specifies whether you
have an advance directive or living will.

706
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,615
- Are you serious?
- If your heart stops...

707
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,220
do you want us to use
measures to resuscitate you?

708
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,050
Just put me out of my misery.

709
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,359
- Hi.
- Hey. I'm leaving for the day.

710
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,691
I'm waiting on a transfer
patient so I'll walk out with you.

711
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,766
- Listen, I'm sorry about this morning.
- No. I'm sorry.

712
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,062
I've been camping on
your couch for six months.

713
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,398
Yeah. But I didn't mean
to be a jerk about it.

714
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:51,566
No. I needed a good kick in
the ass, and I found a place...

715
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,736
with, uh, Ray, actually.

716
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,643
So I'll be leaving at
the end of the week.

717
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:03,445
Well, take your time. There's no
rush. And by the way, are you nuts?

718
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,122
Yes. Yes, I am.

719
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,818
So random question. - Yes?

720
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,930
Do you ever get crushes
on people you work with?

721
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,827
- What do you mean?
- You know.

722
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,936
- Crushes on people you work with.
- Yeah, I guess. Sometimes. Why?

723
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,765
I don't know.

724
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,567
- What?
- What?

725
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,440
- Are you leaving for the night?
- Yeah.

726
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,445
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

727
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:33,449
- Night.
- Night.

728
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,187
- See you at home.
- Okay.

729
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,766
You know, you're really good at
teaching other people how to communicate.

730
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,439
Thanks.

731
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,443
We should try it
ourselves sometime.

732
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,682
Yeah.

733
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:22,532
My English, you
know? Still working on it.

734
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,967
Now you're gonna pull the
Croatian card? That is low.

735
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,870
- You were right about one thing.
- Oh, only one thing?

736
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,671
Mm-hm.

737
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:37,805
Fifty bucks was too
much for a concert ticket.
