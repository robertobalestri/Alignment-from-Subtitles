1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,905
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,593
What? You got Frank
to snoop on my ex?

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,236
He robbed a market outside
Denver. The cashier got hurt.

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,346
Failure to recall basic
respiratory principles...

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,676
unsupervised umbilical
lines in an infant...

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,909
and a fatal air embolus, wow.

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:22,079
Don't sign this contract unless you
are sure this is what you want to do.

8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,256
You from Chicago?

9
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,791
- Any relation to Charlie Pratt?
- I don't know him.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,238
I'm moving back to Africa.

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:31,858
And I'm not leaving without
you and I'm not living without you.

12
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,491
I love you.

13
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,068
I rented a ninja movie for Alex.

14
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,939
We can watch it
tonight when I get home.

15
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,808
He's got a math
test in the morning.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,779
Hard to keep track. He's
not talking much lately.

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,144
Alex keeps asking me
when he can visit his dad.

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,923
- You think that's a good idea?
- He doesn't know.

19
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,187
Steve keeps telling him that
he's got some new job in Colorado.

20
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,662
Sam, you've got
to tell Alex the truth.

21
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,500
Steve promised me that he would.

22
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,836
You want me to tell him?

23
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:16,603
Hey, hey. Can I
get a hand with this?

24
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,769
- Farewell feast?
- Yeah, take that.

25
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,006
Pizza and sodas. I
think I got off cheap.

26
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,809
Africa, huh?

27
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,679
That's where she is.

28
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:28,515
I gotta go, I don't have a babysitter.
Sorry I'm gonna miss your party.

29
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,849
Take care of
yourself, Dr. Carter.

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,327
Party?

31
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,966
Shut up. It's a surprise.

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,097
- I can't believe it's your last shift.
- Last 72 minutes, to be exact.

33
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,971
But who's counting?

34
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,700
Okay, come and get it.

35
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,908
Carnivores, veggies.

36
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,344
Eleven years, all we
get's a few lousy pizzas?

37
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,815
- I was gonna get Search and Rescue.
- I took a detour by the river.

38
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,217
Wanted to see the lights
at the Wrigley Building.

39
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,825
Must have been after you
picked up the pies. This is cold.

40
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,683
You wanna rethink the pizza?

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,160
Dr. Carter, we have a Resident
for a fall, an outstretched hand?

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,164
- I'll take it.
- I'm Miss Fleming, the school nurse.

43
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,893
- This is Janell.
- How did this happen, Janell?

44
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,335
Well, I tried to spike the ball
and I got caught in the net.

45
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,169
- Ah-ha.
- She's very energetic.

46
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,743
Are they Residents because
they live in the hospital?

47
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,880
And very curious.

48
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,073
Is it true people can
have face transplants?

49
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,378
Yes, it is. In fact,
I'm 80 years old.

50
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,248
I got this off a dead guy.

51
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,947
I'm leaving an 18-month-old
with febrile seizure in 2.

52
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,592
- Give it to Abby or Neela.
- All right.

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,286
- Still post-ictal but temp's coming down.
- You got a CT?

54
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,226
- No history of trauma.
- Healthy?

55
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,958
- The kid's got a URI, no meningismus.
- So you've figured out...

56
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,536
a way to evaluate meningismus
in toddlers? Congratulations.

57
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,729
- How long's the kid been here?
- Half an hour.

58
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,034
LP's not indicated, but if he's
not back to baseline in an hour...

59
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,437
- we get it anyway.
- Good.

60
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,772
The next set of
victims is on their way.

61
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,143
We got four locals, plus one
from Penn and one from Vanderbilt.

62
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,376
Hacker with a paronychia
needs a quick I&D in Exam 2.

63
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,920
But since my shift's not over
for six more minutes, I'll handle it.

64
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,456
Come on, what's some
cuticle pus between friends?

65
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,116
You gotta get
each other's backs.

66
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,455
Exam 2, paronychia, I&D.

67
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,292
- I'll get your next prolapsed rectum.
- You're a peach.

68
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,559
Cubs game starts in an
hour. You wanna grab a beer?

69
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:24,068
Um, sorry, but my buddy's having
a party and I promised I'd be there.

70
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,637
Sounds good. Meet you in front.

71
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,139
- What?
- We'll stop by my place so I can change.

72
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,937
And if you look here,
this is the Admit area.

73
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,606
I want you to take a look
at these sad and tired faces.

74
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,613
See, you're the
before pictures...

75
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,649
and I want you
to meet the after.

76
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,482
- Trying to frighten them?
- Jane, congratulations.

77
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,453
Yeah, I was
counting on Bellevue.

78
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,751
Nice to see you again, Abby.

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,661
- I'm sorry?
- I trailed you a few days...

80
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,924
- during my third year, Jim Babinski.
- As in the Babinski reflex?

81
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,364
- Cool. Any relation?
- Nope. Not at all.

82
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,198
I'm gonna go get them some lockers
and then let them tail you guys around.

83
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,237
Finally getting the
long coats, huh?

84
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,002
Pretty thrilling.

85
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,372
Here we go. Lesson
number one: floor control.

86
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,141
Sir, sir, you have to get
back on the gurney, come on.

87
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,384
Are we really about
to become R2s?

88
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,986
No turning back now.

89
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,714
My contract is signed
and sealed on Lewis' desk.

90
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,153
Mine too.

91
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,693
- Yeah, I got some things to think about.
- Like what?

92
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,195
Susan was just pushing
you, Ray. Don't let it get to you.

93
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,028
I don't know.
Maybe she was right.

94
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,630
Maybe it's time for
me to make a change.

95
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,398
Get back on the gurney. - No.

96
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,136
- No! MUNSON: Sir,
you got to calm down.

97
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,678
Get him off!

98
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,525
- Take it easy.
- Calm down.

99
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,383
Lucky for us interns bounce.

100
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,202
I might not have any fun?

101
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,067
You're not gonna know anybody.

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,607
You never know, I'm
into the music scene.

103
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,540
Gigs, demos, whatnot.

104
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,270
How's it going, guys?
- All good.

105
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,779
- Is Nick around?
- Try in the penthouse.

106
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,351
Good to get out
sometimes, isn't it?

107
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,223
Forget about the daily
responsibility we carry as healers...

108
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,987
and just mingle
with regular people.

109
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,960
Okay, listen,
don't talk like that.

110
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,224
- What? Like a doctor?
- Like a bonehead.

111
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,097
I wouldn't wanna see you get
bounced down all these stairs by my pals.

112
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,000
Duly noted.

113
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,234
- Hey, Riles. What's up?
- What's up? Make yourself at home, bro.

114
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,969
- Beer upstairs?
- Yeah. Catch me later.

115
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,977
- This is about me being chief.
- What?

116
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,480
- You're a little bitter.
- I couldn't care less.

117
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,017
- Been meaning to talk to you about that.
- What?

118
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,018
Your lack of initiative.

119
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,785
- Yo, Barnett.
- Hey.

120
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,358
What's up?

121
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,586
Hey, bro. MORRIS:
How's it hanging?

122
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,322
Uh, this is Archie.
We work together.

123
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,364
Thought you were
gonna bring the roomie.

124
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,664
Neela had to work. Is
Jessica here? Yeah, she is.

125
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,335
So you a doctor?

126
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,841
- Ah, Chief Resident.
- Wow.

127
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,644
That means, like, nothing to me.

128
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,844
Hey, Vanessa!

129
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,214
Nice meeting you.

130
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,629
- Okay, Mr. Enriquez.
- Are you gonna crack his chest?

131
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,130
That feels like a ganglion cyst.

132
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,326
What's ganglion mean?

133
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,733
Have you had any
luck finding her parents?

134
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,907
She was to be at a
friend's house tonight.

135
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,133
They're stuck out
on a lake cruise.

136
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,471
They wanted a
romantic night out.

137
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,636
Just the two of them.

138
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,077
I bet they did.

139
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,013
So? Can you fix it?

140
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,383
Well, unless it bothers you,
I would avoid the surgery.

141
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,047
Most of the time, these
things turn out to be benign.

142
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,556
If you say so.

143
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,819
What's benign mean?

144
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,520
Janell, stop
bothering the doctor.

145
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,364
Who says I'm bothering him?

146
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,058
Dr. Carter, I just got a
call from Building Services.

147
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,170
The sewer pipes they fixed last week...
- They're broken again?

148
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,863
So we only have one O.R. open.

149
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,272
All right, let's watch the Trauma
traffic and try not to get overextended.

150
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,839
- Break out the buckets.
- Is Curtain 2 clear?

151
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,379
Pick a bed, any bed.

152
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,915
Thirty-two-year-old actor
smacked by falling scenery.

153
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,451
Now, are you a bull cow
or are you for milking?

154
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,659
- Bleeding won't stop.
- Should have been wearing...

155
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,053
- your headpiece.
- I was. It broke.

156
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,590
A and O times four, no LOC.

157
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,194
- All right, Neela, got it?
- Good thing I'm not Hindu.

158
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,423
Thirty-seven-year-old male,
burns to the torso and extremities.

159
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,965
- What's this about?
- Community theater gone bad.

160
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,262
- It's an Equity showcase.
- Excuse me?

161
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,531
We're mounting an original
musical about the Great Chicago Fire.

162
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,938
I had a little tiff with Mrs.
O'Leary's fat cow over there.

163
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,080
- Learn the blocking, you clod.
- Listen for your cue, Elsie.

164
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,774
- I'd say you definitely have this.
- I love the theater.

165
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,644
And where might
you two be going?

166
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,651
- Get some coffee.
- Ambulance run.

167
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,289
Asthmatic in 3's waking up.

168
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,719
Hey, Chuny, you seen K.J.?

169
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,621
- Who?
- The volunteen kid I hooked up.

170
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,557
Oh, yeah. Nurses' desk.

171
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,061
Hey, man, it's not gonna
be the same without you.

172
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,790
Oh, you'll survive.

173
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,229
See you at the party?

174
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:58,668
Party? I don't know
anything about any parties.

175
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,302
Hey, finished breaking
down those charts?

176
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,468
Yeah, I took yellows back to
Medical Records like you told me.

177
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,342
Good. It's after 8:00. What
are you still doing here?

178
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,278
Waiting on my dad. He's late.

179
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,817
Well, did he say how
late he was gonna be?

180
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,850
You have anybody
that can take you home?

181
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,457
No, but he'll show, though.

182
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,789
All right, come on.
I'll take you home.

183
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,499
- But first, I gotta hit this party.
- What party?

184
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,158
Check it out, huh?

185
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,271
- Oh, music notes?
- No, man.

186
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,500
Try the opening guitar
licks to "Freebird."

187
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,046
Yo, Benny, we got it.

188
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,115
Ah, you had a hep B shot lately?

189
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,947
That tat's really red around the edges.
You might wanna keep an eye on that.

190
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,650
Oh, my God. Doc Barnett
talking the talk, man, you!

191
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,990
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

192
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,393
That's really cool.

193
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,193
Yeah? Then, yes, I'm a doctor.

194
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,892
The baby's really kicking.

195
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,696
You got anything for heartburn?

196
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,568
No, man. How about
some mellowing agents?

197
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,040
Man, there's mellowing
agents all over this place, okay?

198
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,679
It's kind of hot in here.

199
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,678
You want to go get a drink?

200
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,476
Sure.

201
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:22,887
Uh-oh.

202
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,189
- I thought you were a musician.
- Oh.

203
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,354
Medicine's the way
I pay the music bills.

204
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,932
Oh. SOL: Ow-whoo!

205
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,693
Hello, up there.

206
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,064
Yo? SOL: Beers here!

207
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,663
- What's up?
- Toss us down a couple of brews, bro.

208
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,502
All right.

209
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,580
Ready? SOL: Yeah, yeah.

210
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,111
Get off. Get off. SOL: Yeah.

211
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,020
So how's the double
life treating you?

212
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,562
Some days better than others.

213
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,199
Hey, any more
Jägermeister around?

214
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,529
Uh, try inside.

215
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,227
Hey, Archie.

216
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,568
Yeah, I introduced
you two 10 minutes ago.

217
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,175
Oh...

218
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,748
- Is that guy really your boss?
- Huh?

219
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,043
That's what he's been saying.

220
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,316
<i>I hadn't even kicked
the lantern yet.</i>

221
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,318
You missed your cue
on account of mooing.

222
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,889
Ten cc's of lido and 5.0
on a needle driver, please.

223
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,491
I'm doing the job of two actors.

224
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,787
- And giving half a good performance.
- Son of a bitch.

225
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,989
Look, unless you'd like a saline
shower, keep your head still.

226
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,067
- How'd you get these burns?
- It must have been the light stand.

227
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,794
I'm not gonna be scarred, am I?

228
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,495
Nothing too serious.

229
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,503
Hey, Abby. Got a minute?

230
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,437
- Sure.
- Because I usually play leads.

231
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,510
Six hundred of
ibuprofen and Silvadene.

232
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,113
I use my body a lot as an actor.

233
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,840
You mean like in pornos?

234
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,315
You've seen my work?
- What an idiot.

235
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,213
Okay, I'll be right back.

236
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,619
What do you need?

237
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,693
There's, uh, people waiting at
Ike's, I thought I'd walk Carter over.

238
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,692
- You guys are good?
- We taking traumas?

239
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,457
Pipes won't get fixed for
three hours, so not until then.

240
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,761
Okay. And I'd like to get
over there at some point too.

241
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,870
Yeah, we'll rotate.
Back in half an hour.

242
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,836
- You ready to go to my surprise party?
- Yup.

243
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,873
Hey there. ALEX: Hey.

244
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,874
Did you check your
sugar before dinner?

245
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,342
Ninety-two.

246
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,105
That's good.

247
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,677
Did Erica help you
with your math?

248
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,342
Yeah.

249
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,847
Did you tell her to
pick you up tomorrow?

250
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,456
No.

251
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,029
- Are you done with your homework?
- I'm doing it.

252
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,325
Oh, looks like you're
watching TV to me.

253
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,336
Got a letter from your dad.

254
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,474
As soon as you finish studying.

255
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,174
- Mom.
- Alex.

256
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,218
- It's my mail.
- My rules.

257
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,551
You're such a...

258
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,718
Excuse me?

259
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:13,716
Where's Luka?

260
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,722
He's at work.

261
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,156
You still fighting?

262
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,068
No.

263
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,437
We're gonna have to
move again, aren't we?

264
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,579
Yeah. I'm bringing
him right now.

265
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,046
Okay. Right.

266
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,014
What was that about?

267
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,586
Uh... Just telling
them to be ready.

268
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,747
- Act surprised.
- I'll act surprised.

269
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,620
Surprise!

270
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,855
You guys, you got me!

271
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,401
Ray.

272
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:02,099
Yo, Ray, your boy's
hurling in here, man.

273
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,975
Stay here, okay?

274
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,976
I won't move.

275
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,218
He almost made
it to the bathroom.

276
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,910
Hey, sweetie. You okay?

277
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,282
You gonna come out here?

278
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,948
Hang on one second. Let
me finish talking to these guys.

279
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,753
Oh.

280
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,395
- Oh, I'm stupid, stupid, stupid.
- Okay, easy.

281
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,966
- Easy.
- Oh...

282
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,928
Hi.

283
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,275
You know, I admire you, Ray.

284
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,177
You're one of those
guys who just...

285
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,779
glide over every speed
bump. It all comes so easy.

286
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,815
But me...

287
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,249
No, people don't
expect much from me.

288
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,321
Most of the time I
prove them right.

289
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,918
I guess that's why I
wanted chief, you know?

290
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,891
Show them I could do it.

291
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,023
Well, look, it's not
so easy for me either.

292
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,167
I'm just pretty
good at faking it.

293
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,003
Yeah.

294
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,329
Oh, my God.

295
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,799
I'll get you some water.

296
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,500
I swear to God,
that's what she said.

297
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,942
Get out of here. Hey, he okay?

298
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,014
Uh, he gets excited.

299
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,480
Ray!

300
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,845
Find me some aspirin too.

301
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,452
- Sure thing. MAN:
Yeah, what's up?

302
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,694
Molly!

303
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,865
- Oh, my God.
- Ray?

304
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,667
Ray! Aah!

305
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:42,865
Jess!

306
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,401
No!

307
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,207
Oh, God... Oh, my God...

308
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,154
Jeremy, open your eyes for me.
Listen to me. Open your eyes, Jeremy.

309
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,691
Okay, call 911! We got at
least 20 people injured here.

310
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,228
- Oh, man. KYLE: Molly,
where are you, baby? Molly!

311
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,633
My back! MAN 3: Give
me a hand here, move it!

312
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,664
Duncan's not breathing.

313
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,363
Jess! Jess, I got
you. I got you.

314
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,064
- You all right?
- I'm burning.

315
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,369
- You breathing okay?
- Yeah.

316
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,943
Molly!

317
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,013
Help me.

318
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,082
- Hey, over here. This kid's stuck.
- You. You, get over here.

319
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,651
Get over here.
Stay with her, okay?

320
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,245
Help me! Somebody help me!

321
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,981
The ambulances are on their way!

322
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,859
Stay with her. Don't move her.

323
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,552
If she passes out, come get me.
- No, Ray! Don't go!

324
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,220
I'll be back.

325
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,094
Hey, man! Stop that. Come
over here, help me get him out.

326
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,327
Okay, okay. MAN 4: Ow.

327
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,768
Talk to me, Molly. Come
on. Keep talking to me.

328
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,212
- My friend's been hurt.
- Can we move this beam?

329
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,436
Okay, everybody, stop! Stop!

330
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,101
Shh, shh.

331
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,610
I'm a doctor, okay?

332
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,509
The paramedics are on their way.

333
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,015
We need to clear out all this crap,
uncover as many bodies as we can.

334
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,086
But nobody move anybody...

335
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,853
until I get to check
them over first, okay?

336
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,856
- Is the cow all fixed up?
- Both ends.

337
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,519
- May they go now?
- I'll be with you in a moment, sir.

338
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,363
He's here for the actors.
It's his play they ruined.

339
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,004
- Mm. MALCOLM: My
stage manager is filling in.

340
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,134
Horrid. But if I can get them back in
time, I might still have a second act.

341
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,509
I doubt these
guys are up for it.

342
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,212
Oh, they're professionals.

343
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,075
You know, the show must go on.

344
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,813
Yeah.

345
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,746
Why is that exactly?

346
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:35,719
I mean, why can't the show
just stop once in a while?

347
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,916
Keep the pressure
going, okay? Don't move.

348
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,119
Tachy at 120. Pulse
is weak and thready.

349
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,822
Hurts when I breathe.
- All right, all right.

350
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,632
- Breath sounds on the bad side.
- No tension pneumo?

351
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,498
Paramedics to him first.
He needs two liters of saline.

352
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,900
Ray, please.

353
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,735
Just another sec, okay?
Jess, you're okay, you're okay.

354
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,672
- Ray!
- They're coming, man.

355
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,170
Oh! KYLE: Ray, come here, man.

356
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,844
I think she cut her ear.

357
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,677
Okay, well, that's
one possibility.

358
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,581
Molly! Molly, follow my finger.

359
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,921
- You got a headache?
- I feel okay.

360
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,685
- How many weeks are you?
- Thirty-eight. Is the baby okay?

361
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,788
It's okay, it's okay. - Okay?

362
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,465
We need some help!

363
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,328
Benny? WOMAN 2: Oh, my God.

364
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,367
- Keep breathing.
- Oh, my God.

365
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,868
You're gonna be okay.

366
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,503
Can I have it now?

367
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,676
On the table.

368
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,721
- Mom?
- Hmm?

369
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,485
Are we ever gonna
live with Dad again?

370
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,220
- Alex.
- He's got a good job now.

371
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,729
He's a river guide. It's cool.

372
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,895
We're not gonna
live with your dad.

373
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,135
Hey, I got you those
marshmallow cookies.

374
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,901
I'm gonna go read my letter.

375
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,574
Easy, we're gonna
get you fixed up.

376
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,582
Four of MS and
monitor the foot pulses.

377
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,916
We got at least four other criticals.
I'm not sure who's under there.

378
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:19,820
Loading pregnant lady and chest pain.
Working on the impaled girl. What else?

379
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,257
Okay, we got six
dead over there.

380
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,523
Also about another 15 noncriticals,
fractures and contusions.

381
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,429
- We were only 8 minutes behind the call.
- Yeah?

382
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,603
You assessed 25
patients in eight minutes?

383
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,763
- There's no paperwork out here.
- And Morris is with you, right?

384
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,931
Send him to St. Rafe's,
he needs a banana bag.

385
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,441
We'll send the criticals
there, the rest to Lakeview.

386
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,839
St. Rafe's? Why not County?

387
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,174
You guys closed the
Trauma. Got a call an hour ago.

388
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,611
Whoa, this is a Level One.

389
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,082
St. Rafe's can't take care
of patients like we can.

390
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,780
If you can get County to open,
all the better. It's a lot closer.

391
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,060
County General on two-bravo.

392
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,259
Ray? You're with Rescue 56?

393
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,864
Our Ray?

394
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,694
No, she's not here. Him either.

395
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,392
We got Abby.

396
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,162
Thanks.

397
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,541
- Ray, what's going on?
- Porch collapse. Lots wounded.

398
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,974
Uh, five criticals. We
need you to open up.

399
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,943
- We only have one working O.R.
- They won't all need the O.R.

400
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,480
It's mostly blunt trauma.

401
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,810
Okay. Uh, we can
accept one critical.

402
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,543
Come on, Abby. Take all five.

403
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,655
No, we're understaffed here.

404
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,156
- They might not make it anywhere else.
- We don't have any Attendings.

405
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,794
- You're a doctor, you can do this.
- No, no.

406
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,395
I have to run it by Kovac.

407
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,895
There isn't any time.

408
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,760
The CPR guy's flatline.

409
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,095
Okay, we are down
to four criticals.

410
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,337
- Ray, I can't.
<i>- Come on, County General.</i>

411
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,337
Will you accept these patients?

412
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,939
Abby, you're being
recorded, you know.

413
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,908
I know.

414
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,852
Rescue 56, we're taking
four trauma patients.

415
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,489
You have blanket orders
for IVs, C-spine and O2.

416
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,491
Thank you, County.
We are four minutes out.

417
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,859
Okay.

418
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,125
Okay, let's get patients out of
Trauma, Sutures and Curtain 2.

419
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,670
Jerry, tell the O.R. to set up
another room. Chuny, page Kovac.

420
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,174
Okay, listen up.

421
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,968
Okay, first of all...

422
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,605
you should all eat and drink well
because the party's on Weaver.

423
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,649
Now, that is a surprise.

424
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,049
Guys on duty, don't let
me see beer in your hand.

425
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,383
Hey, 11 years, couldn't we
spring for some caviar for the man?

426
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,253
Anyway, uh...

427
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,059
there's something, uh...

428
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:40,063
my father would say when, uh...
When a friend went on a journey.

429
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,558
And, uh...

430
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,568
he said it to me when I
came to the United States first.

431
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,138
So I thought of it
today when I realized...

432
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,644
I wouldn't be working
with this guy anymore.

433
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,844
Not for a long time, at least.

434
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,812
Uh...

435
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:07,358
My father would, uh,
clasp the person's hand...

436
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,791
and say, uh:

437
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,795
"We only part to meet again."

438
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,772
Hear, hear.

439
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,869
Cheers.

440
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,439
Cheers. PRATT: To
Carter. Cheers, yes.

441
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,311
To the doc.

442
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,351
Burst eardrum, no Battle's
sign. When's her due date?

443
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,285
- Uh, May 29th.
- Tachy at 128 after a liter.

444
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,982
- Systolic's only 84. NEELA:
All right, get her on her side.

445
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,627
- One, two. KYLE:
What are you doing?

446
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,922
- Same question. NEELA:
Supine hypotension syndrome.

447
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,793
Uterus compresses the vena
cava, reducing cardiac output.

448
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,935
We're getting her
blood pressure back up.

449
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,629
You're okay, Molly. We've got you.
- My back.

450
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,169
Does it hurt here? - No.

451
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,811
All right. Those back pains,
they were contractions.

452
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,951
- What? Now? NEELA:
Baby's crowning.

453
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,643
- Should I get a screen?
- No. Flip the bed.

454
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,518
Get a warmer, a
BOA Kit and page OB.

455
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,860
- BP's 80 palp.
- Ten blade. Chuny, everything okay?

456
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,363
Baby's coming, mom's hypotensive
and we don't have fetal heart tones.

457
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,831
Well, a simple no
would have sufficed.

458
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,028
- Where's Kovac?
- On his way, I guess.

459
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,366
- Doesn't he need an x-ray?
- Thirty-two French.

460
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,508
He's unstable with
evidence of a hemothorax.

461
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,234
Tube first, ask questions later.

462
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,072
Good. Systolic's
up to a hundred.

463
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,645
You did that test tube quick.

464
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,180
O-neg on two pressure
bags. Set up for subclavian.

465
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,648
- Are you the, uh, Senior Resident?
- No, I'm an intern.

466
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,151
What you're gonna
be in a few days.

467
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,155
- BP is 110/76.
- How's Riley doing in there?

468
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,157
Need a central line.
- Is he okay?

469
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:53,356
Yeah, he will be. How's your throat?
- Little raw, all the yelling.

470
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,560
No dorsalis pedis.
No posterior tib.

471
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,535
- That doesn't sound good.
- You cut the artery in your foot.

472
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,676
- You need surgery, all right?
- We only called a few minutes ago.

473
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,243
- I doubt the O.R.'s gonna be ready.
- No, they will be.

474
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,710
Have them call us back...

475
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,409
- as soon as they can. RAY:
Off the phone. Go. Go. O.R.

476
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,076
I called OB. They're in the
middle of a crash section.

477
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,418
- There we go.
- Head's out, Mom. Lots of hair.

478
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,889
Molly, you're doing so good, baby.
- Suction.

479
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,762
- Uh, Neela?
- Turtle sign.

480
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,457
Jerry, 911 them. Tell
them we've got a shoulder.

481
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,399
- Shoulder dystocia.
- Is something wrong with our baby?

482
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,371
He's a bit big for your pelvis.
You can do this, Molly. Push again.

483
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,568
Really hard, okay? Pull her legs back.
- Aah!

484
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:42,272
- Anterior shoulder is stuck.
- Supra-pubic pressure, hard as you can.

485
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,417
Another big push, Mom. Come on.

486
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,449
Molly, push again,
all you've got.

487
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,712
- I can't.
- You can, Molly. I know you can.

488
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,118
- Come on, baby.
- She can't, contraction's over.

489
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,226
- Fetal pulse is coming back up.
- All right.

490
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:57,329
All right, support
her head. Right here.

491
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,989
- I'll be back in a second. KYLE:
She's leaving? Why is she leaving?

492
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,761
Abby, I've got a shoulder
dystocia and OB's MIA.

493
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,565
Did you try a Wood's screw maneuver?
- Never heard of it.

494
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:10,107
That gives me satisfaction. I'm
getting a flash, I can't thread the wire.

495
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,403
They need someone
with experience. I'll do this?

496
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,978
- Okay. SACKOWITZ:
You're giving up?

497
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:17,173
If you can't get a procedure after
the third attempt, you never will.

498
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,182
- Is that from Tintinalli's book?
- No, the book of John Carter.

499
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,866
- Heartbeat's up to 140.
- This guy needs tons of volume.

500
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,062
Stay ahead four units.
- What's going on?

501
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,616
- Mom's pressure's borderline.
- Baby decels with contractions.

502
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,957
- Okay, hi. I'm Dr. Lockhart.
- Are you from OB?

503
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,656
I used to be, yes. Okay.

504
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:38,202
Let's see if we can, uh,
coax this little guy out, huh?

505
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,464
- It's a girl.
- Her name's Janis.

506
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,801
Janis. Okay.

507
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:49,779
Okay, I'm going to rotate
Janis' posterior shoulder.

508
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,974
Aah! MARQUEZ: Here's
another contraction.

509
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,313
Come on, push. MOLLY: Aah!

510
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:00,118
Flex the arms across the
chest. Come on. Big push, okay?

511
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,694
- Baby's pulse is dropping again.
- In the 80s. Poor variability.

512
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,422
All right. Come on, Molly,
focus. Really big push.

513
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,031
- She's tiring out. Sats, 91.
- Okay. All right, all right, relax.

514
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,172
Put her on oxygen.
Have O-neg standing by.

515
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,864
- Someone asked me to bring you this.
- Did OB call back?

516
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,476
Stuck in the O.R. They
said it'd be about 15 minutes.

517
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,443
- How long ago was that?
- Eight minutes ago.

518
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,007
- What about Luka?
- Want me to page him again?

519
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:27,244
- No. All right, you.
- Me?

520
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,547
Yeah. You know where Ike Ryan's is?
- Yes.

521
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,486
Get over there, find Kovac
and bring him back here, fast.

522
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,819
Okay, we can't wait,
not with the late decels.

523
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,224
Betadine, lido and a 10 blade.
- Get her out!

524
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,864
You're doing a
section by yourself?

525
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,029
Where the hell is Luka?

526
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,102
I only needed one more shot.

527
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,209
- Ah, I got lucky.
- Three times in a row?

528
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,436
You guys just missed Kovac
running the table on me.

529
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,672
I've heard Kovac cheats.

530
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,283
Yeah, I didn't even know
they played pool in Croatia.

531
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,886
Sure, but we just use
broomsticks and goat testicles.

532
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,420
- Get out of here.
- No, it's hard.

533
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,921
Those balls don't roll straight.

534
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,456
Alrighty then. On that note, I'm
gonna take the young man home.

535
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,723
Ah. CARTER: Greg.

536
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,563
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

537
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,533
- For everything.
- Anytime.

538
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:21,572
All right, and I'll see you
suckers later. Enjoy yourselves.

539
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,299
See you.

540
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,538
- Got your toast ready?
- Yeah.

541
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,738
Gotta say something, don't you?

542
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,783
- Do I?
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

543
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,749
Let me go lick my wounds
first. I'll be right back.

544
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,293
Dr. Lewis said wait
till she gets here.

545
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,726
When's that gonna be?

546
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:49,096
She's on the overnight. She's
gonna stop by on her way in.

547
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,932
Who's...? Who's Kovac?

548
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,999
- Neela, talk to me.
- Porch collapse in Wrigleyville.

549
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,644
I know. Tell me
about the patient.

550
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,642
Chest trauma, two
liters out the left.

551
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,943
- We're doing a cutdown. Ray?
- Open it up to the femoral sheath.

552
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:12,183
This is the fastest way to
resuscitate a peri-arrest patient. Right?

553
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,850
That's right. Looks
good. Run the level one.

554
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,363
Do you know Abby's doing
a symphysiotomy in here?

555
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,998
By dissecting the ligaments
connecting the pubic bone...

556
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,163
you can get up to three more
centimeters of pelvic space.

557
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,640
- Fetal tracing is holding in the 90s.
- Feels like we opened up a bit.

558
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,975
- So next contraction, big push, okay?
- Okay.

559
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,480
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

560
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:41,986
All right, come on, Molly.
Come on, Molly, push.

561
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,649
- Push.
- Here she comes.

562
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,955
And the anterior
shoulder is out.

563
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,291
Suction. And clamp.

564
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,834
Scissors to Dad.

565
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,035
Oh, wow.

566
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,637
Hey, big girl.

567
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,167
Hi, Janis. Hi.

568
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,995
Congratulations. She's a beauty.

569
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,179
Ah.

570
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,446
- So how's school?
- It's all right.

571
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,415
You doing okay?

572
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,584
Well, you know, I'm pretty
damn good with science.

573
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,691
So if you ever need a
hand just give me a call.

574
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:56,886
Uh, thanks. I got it from here.

575
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,294
- Hey, Dad.
- Huh?

576
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,935
Hey, Dad, come
on, let's go inside.

577
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,205
- Oh, man.
- Here, I'm gonna help you up.

578
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,435
- K.J., go put some coffee on.
- It's okay.

579
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,070
Don't worry, I got him.
Go ahead. Go inside there.

580
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,309
Come on, man. Let's go.
Come on. Come on, man. Get up.

581
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,316
You know how to walk.

582
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,221
- Come on, sit down.
- He giving you any trouble, man?

583
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,482
Go ahead. Yeah,
go get the coffee.

584
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:31,091
Getting a little older,
thinks he's smart.

585
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,596
Don't give him no excuse
to give any lip, though.

586
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,256
How come you didn't
pick him up, man?

587
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,464
Damn. What time is it?

588
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,835
He was waiting on you, D. You
never showed up. Where were you?

589
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:47,109
Hey, listen. You his
father. You understand that?

590
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,339
The only one he's got.

591
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,712
Oh, man.

592
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,190
- Systolic's up to 110.
- Where's Dubenko?

593
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,593
- He's getting the O.R. ready.
- Jessica's ex-lap?

594
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,666
The impaled girl? Anspaugh took
her up to Surgery. She's stable.

595
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:12,502
Ray, he's getting stridorous.
- Ah. Ah.

596
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:16,041
Okay. Sit tight, Riley. I'll
check up on you in a bit, okay?

597
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,870
All right, come get me
if he decompensates.

598
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:22,479
- How's your breathing, man?
- Little rough.

599
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,677
Hello, Dr. Neela.
You missed the party.

600
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,947
How are you doing, Nick?

601
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,854
- Ow.
- Sorry. There's crepitus.

602
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,017
I had a dream like this.

603
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,063
Only Ray wasn't with us.

604
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,324
Ha, ha. C-spine's
clear. Losing the collar.

605
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,629
- Pulse ox, 90 on 5 liters.
- Twenty of etomidate, 120 sux.

606
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,964
Hello.

607
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,675
Yeah, speaking.

608
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:58,846
My credit card? No.
It hasn't been stolen.

609
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,576
Alex?

610
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,891
Alex!

611
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,425
I'd like to thank you
all for coming tonight.

612
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:23,832
I consider myself a lucky man.

613
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,343
Yeah, lucky man. That's
good. Who are you, Lou Gehrig?

614
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,025
It's been...

615
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,229
11 years.

616
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:53,728
I feel like I grew up
here with all of you.

617
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,542
Hmm.

618
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,651
Where did everybody go?

619
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:15,157
Work. They said they'd be back.

620
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,458
- Are you new in the ER?
- Mm.

621
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,467
- Geriatrics. Heard there was free food.
- Ah.

622
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,004
I like you with the beard.

623
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:06,208
- Keep an eye on the sats, all right?
- I'll check your crit in Angio.

624
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,977
- Symphysiotomy, huh?
- Uh-huh.

625
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,945
Healthy girl. Eight
pounds, 10 ounces.

626
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,675
Dr. Barnett, I was
told you demanded...

627
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,013
we not take any patients
before the tib-fib guy.

628
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,520
I reprioritized. Take Neela's
patient first, my guy can wait.

629
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:28,161
They took me to Lakeview.
I couldn't find a taxi.

630
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,495
- What do you guys need?
- We're all good, Morris.

631
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,865
- Really? You sure?
- Mm-hm.

632
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,132
I'm gonna go lie down.

633
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,005
Hey, you guys
all ditched Carter.

634
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,515
He was hugging some
huge orderly when I got there.

635
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,881
- We got it under control now.
- Well, that's good.

636
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:52,821
Cosmo's been screaming like a banshee.
I intend to spend my shift sleeping.

637
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,517
Carter, your volleyball
girl's ready for the reduction.

638
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,528
- It's okay, I'll get it.
- I'll take it. One more for the road.

639
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,326
- How long are you here?
- Just have to pick up some stuff.

640
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,866
- How about you?
- I'm off as soon as you're ready.

641
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,867
How does never sound?

642
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:12,204
Luka. Luka. Did you hear
from Alex? Is he here?

643
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,676
Why do I have to hang
my hand from these things?

644
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,873
- Janell, manners.
- So that I can realign your bones.

645
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:22,783
- Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.
- Clyde Parkerson. My wife, Eva.

646
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,617
I'm sure that Janell told
you she broke her wrist.

647
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,691
A.k.a. Colles' fracture.

648
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,193
- And we gave her a local anesthesia.
- A.k.a. hematoma block.

649
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,458
Hmm. And that she has a
future in medicine, it would seem.

650
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,896
A.k.a. I'll be rich.

651
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,263
I'll give you countertraction.
- Okay.

652
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,531
Dr. Carter, do you remember us?

653
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,709
Um...

654
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,374
I'm sorry, I don't.

655
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,814
Cast padding.

656
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:54,418
- I was a patient here in 1994.
- Huh. Really?

657
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,885
We went into premature
labor at 32 weeks.

658
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,148
There was no time to
get me to the OB floor...

659
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:04,058
so I gave birth here in
the ER. You delivered her.

660
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,035
I did? EVA: Yes, you did.

661
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,105
Hmm. Cool.

662
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,139
Two-inch roll.

663
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,905
Um...

664
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:27,412
- Can I have the purple cast?
- Whatever you want.

665
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:33,324
- He must have gone through my purse.
- Tried to buy a bus ticket?

666
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,325
They wouldn't let him. He took
off while they called the cops.

667
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,191
- Probably went to a friend's apartment.
- I called them all.

668
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,593
What did the police say?

669
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,166
They said to, um, wait at
home while they're searching...

670
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,929
but I'm not gonna sit, I
have to go try to find him.

671
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:49,438
- What if he shows up at the apartment?
- Erica's there. She's gonna stay.

672
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,167
- How much cash did he get?
- Uh...

673
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,369
About 80, maybe a
hundred, I don't know.

674
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,947
- He's pissed. He's walking it off.
- He tried to buy a ticket to Colorado.

675
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:01,018
He's gonna do whatever he can
to see Steve. He's not gonna stop.

676
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:04,054
He doesn't have his Glucometer.
He doesn't have his syringes.

677
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,987
- He doesn't have his insulin.
- Sam, Sam, Sam, hey, hey, hey.

678
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,390
He'll be okay for the next 12
hours. We'll find him way before then.

679
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,359
Let me get my jacket.

680
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,958
Hey, uh, Luka, will you, uh...?
Will you get some NPH from lockup?

681
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,900
And some, uh, D5 and
some D10 too, okay?

682
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,539
Okay.

683
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,658
I'll get it.

684
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:56,630
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Charlie Pratt.

685
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:01,540
- I know you?
- Your name is Charlie Pratt?

686
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:03,938
Yeah.

687
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:10,751
I'm sorry, I must have got it wrong.
- Chaz, who is it?

688
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,017
Is there a problem?

689
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:20,293
- Are you Charlie?
- Are you a bill collector?

690
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,797
Then, yeah, I'm Charlie.

691
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,731
I'm an ER doc over at County.

692
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,935
- Is somebody sick?
- No. No, nothing like that.

693
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,671
I, uh... I got your name
from the folks at Ceasefire.

694
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,412
Couldn't wait till morning?

695
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,881
I'm gonna be there tomorrow
for a meeting anyway.

696
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,719
You're right. It can wait.

697
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,291
You all right, son?

698
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,893
Yeah, I'm okay.

699
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,731
Hmm. Maybe you ought to come in.

700
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,635
Sorry if I disturbed you.

701
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:15,148
Did I spell symphysiotomy right?

702
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,585
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

703
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,923
- How's your friend?
- Missed the aorta.

704
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,926
Anspaugh fixed her up.
Jessica's gonna be fine.

705
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,096
- You look tired. You should go home.
- Mm-mm.

706
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,241
I wanna be here when
my friends wake up.

707
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:41,272
All right, then. Help
yourself to a chart.

708
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,490
Dr. Carter.

709
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:58,562
I was just on my way
out. Thought I'd stop by.

710
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:03,133
- Sorry we missed the party.
- Eh. You weren't the only ones.

711
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,899
So I just found
this in my locker.

712
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,470
It has been in there
for a very long time.

713
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:15,205
And, to be honest, I haven't given
it much thought for many years.

714
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,981
Not since Mark died.

715
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,816
When you interned
for Dr. Greene...

716
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,888
he would have everybody
write a letter to themselves...

717
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,424
that they wouldn't open until
their very last day of Residency.

718
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,419
So that's your
letter to yourself?

719
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,860
What does it say?

720
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,327
It says...

721
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,838
that I'm scared.

722
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,674
And that I know I
have a lot to learn.

723
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,046
And I hope I learn it quickly.

724
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,520
And that I pray to God
that I don't kill anybody.

725
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:01,258
And it says, um, that
if I'm good at this...

726
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,355
and I can stick it out and
become an Attending...

727
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,701
well, that will be
all I ever need.

728
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,211
I got a plane to catch.

729
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:36,383
<i>One day you'll look up, and
maybe 10 years will have passed.</i>

730
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:40,555
<i>Carter, you're gonna
make a good doctor.</i>

731
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:44,726
<i>Carter, you gotta hurry it up.
You got a million things to do.</i>

732
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,596
<i>You set the tone, Carter.</i>

733
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,411
Oh.

734
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:05,148
- Morris?
- I think I might puke again.

735
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,629
You set the tone, Morris.

736
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,389
Huh?

737
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,001
Never mind.

738
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,448
- What's that?
- My contract.

739
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:35,519
Oh. Okay, then I guess you
have some more writing to do.

740
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,855
It's good enough for Carter.

741
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:48,366
Think it's weird if I
put, "Dear Neela"?

742
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:51,230
Hey, Erica, any word?

743
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:54,702
Did Bobby's mom call
back? He wasn't with him?

744
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:59,572
Okay. Yeah, it's
gonna be all right.

745
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,040
Uh, what about Navy Pier?
He likes the rides there.

746
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,309
- It's after 11, it's closed.
- What about your phone, is it charged?

747
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:11,252
Sam. Sam. It's
all gonna be okay.
