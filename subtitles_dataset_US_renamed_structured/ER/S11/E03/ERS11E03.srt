00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,100
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:09,072
I don't know if I
wanna be a doctor.

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:11,212
I'll have a job soon
and I'll send money.

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,744
What job? Where?

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:17,078
Give me a position, a job, any kind
of job, just until I get myself refocused.

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,516
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't...
Can't really help you.

7
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,851
I've been having
trouble sleeping.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,491
I keep having those dreams.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,330
- What are you doing?
- Couldn't sleep.

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,974
Thought I'd get a
jump on the day.

11
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,837
- How's the night shift going?
- Ugly.

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,411
It's been quiet for
the last hour or so.

13
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,241
Well, that won't last.

14
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,476
Sunburns, blown-off fingers,
potluck food poisoning.

15
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,625
Nothing like the ER
on the Fourth of July.

16
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,555
Sound like you're
looking forward to it.

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,918
Mix alcohol, gunpowder
and the great outdoors...

18
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,855
you're in for a good time.

19
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,019
You talk to Kem?

20
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,755
Yeah. A couple days ago.

21
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,061
The time change makes
it hard, so we e-mail.

22
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,994
- She doing okay?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,537
You know. These
things take time.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,872
How about you?

25
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,909
I'm here, aren't I?

26
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,842
So much for quiet.

27
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,039
See you inside.

28
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,372
<i>The greater Chicago area...</i>

29
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,864
<i>for our nation's birthday today.</i>

30
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,863
<i>So celebrations
planned all over the city...</i>

31
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,059
<i>will have great weather
and good turnouts.</i>

32
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,728
<i>Perfect conditions for the many fireworks
displays we expect to see tonight.</i>

33
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,101
Oh, we're out of milk.

34
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,302
<i>Joining the folks out in Lisle to look in
on the annual Eyes to the Skies Festival.</i>

35
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,538
<i>We're gonna catch
the hot-air balloon...</i>

36
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,706
Do you need me to give
you a ride anywhere?

37
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,483
No, thanks.

38
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,279
- You're sure? I don't mind.
- I'm okay.

39
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,115
You should watch
this. There's a woman...

40
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,588
on next who fought a mountain
lion that was trying to steal her baby.

41
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,492
No. I have to go to work.

42
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,096
If you want, I can take
another run at Weaver.

43
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,289
Maybe something's
opened up at the hospital.

44
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,264
I don't wanna
work in the hospital.

45
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,460
I've got a couple of
job interviews today.

46
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,230
You do? What are they?

47
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,104
<i>Good morning, we're back.</i>

48
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,798
I don't wanna jinx anything.

49
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,103
<i>Hey, Bobby. What
do you have for us?</i>

50
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:29,409
Okay. Well, I'll just see you
when I get back from work.

51
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,418
I can pick up groceries
today if you'd like.

52
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:35,988
That would be great. Thank you.

53
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,818
I'll need to borrow some money.

54
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,489
Just until I get
my first paycheck.

55
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,158
Forty-two-year-old female. She
came in with shortness of breath.

56
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,133
Harris can go home
with a knee immobilizer.

57
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,331
Hey, Frank. That's a very
nice touch. You look, um, very...

58
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,204
- Gay?
- Patriotic.

59
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,346
Granger and Granger, waiting
on streps. Find me if positive.

60
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,811
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

61
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,177
- Hennessey in the suture room.
- Two-layer repair.

62
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,115
Neosporin, after-care instructions,
and send her out the door.

63
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,312
Ssst. You're on fire, dude.

64
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,287
How many Red Bulls you have today?
- Hey, Morris.

65
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,290
- Take care of Delacourt?
- Back strain.

66
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,292
Don't forget femoral
and pedal pulses.

67
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,521
I never do.

68
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,895
- Why is it important to check leg pulses?
- Arterial embolus?

69
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,536
- Unh! Penny, to you.
- Peripheral vascular disease.

70
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,966
Close but no cigar.

71
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,038
More studying, less
time at the salon.

72
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,004
Next contestant?

73
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,805
Back pain can be the presenting
symptom in abdominal aortic dissection.

74
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,471
- In abdominal aortic dissection.
- Can I get some fries with that?

75
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,518
I guess it's true what they
say. Those who can't do, teach.

76
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:44,215
But what is he teaching them? Caught
him injecting lido with epi in a toe.

77
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,360
- Oh, I'm not kidding.
- No chest pain.

78
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,722
Hey, Morris? Wait up.

79
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,160
And she's still hypoxic
and tachypneic.

80
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,233
EKG's normal, no cough,
nothing showed up on the x-ray.

81
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,166
So should I order a spiral CT?

82
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,566
You think I should.

83
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,608
Yeah, I should order the CT to rule
out PE. Right. Of course. I knew that.

84
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,770
I knew that. Spiral
CT for chest pains...

85
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,898
- All right. What else we
got? NAJEEB: Mr. Wallace.

86
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,403
Day three, postop, hernia
repair. We call Surgery.

87
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,235
They like to know
when patients come.

88
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,570
This is Dr. Pratt. He's
one of our Residents.

89
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,736
You present to him,
he presents to me.

90
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:17,283
Dr. Pratt, instruct our med students
on the initial management of chest pain?

91
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,753
All chest pain consistent with ACS gets
O2, IV aspirin, beta-blocker and nitro.

92
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,256
- Well, what if the EKG is normal?
- I repeat.

93
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,918
O2, IV aspirin,
beta-blocker and nitro.

94
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:34,261
All right. Fall to outstretched arm,
earache, belly pain and vomiting.

95
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,836
Go, go. Make me proud. First
one to kill a patient buys me lunch.

96
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,240
- I didn't expect you back so soon.
- A guy can only play so much Xbox.

97
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,276
- How's the head?
- Hard as a rock.

98
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,574
- Yeah? No headaches? No dizziness?
- No, man. I'm cool.

99
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,377
I wouldn't miss this for
the world. July's my favorite.

100
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,281
New interns, new med students.

101
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,945
I know more than any of
the newbies this time of year.

102
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,591
That's not necessarily
a good thing.

103
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,060
Hey, how's Deb?

104
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,459
I think she's good.

105
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,630
Yeah? You talk to her?

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,736
Carter! Pratt! Twenty-four-year-old
male. Stabbing victim.

107
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,465
I ain't no victim. The other guy's
the victim. Do I look like a victim?

108
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,268
- Settle down.
- You settle down.

109
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,276
- And let me the hell up.
- You could be seriously injured here.

110
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,607
- I've been shot six times before.
- 118/78. Pulse, 86.

111
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,220
- Mild tenderness.
- I'm bulletproof!

112
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,302
- 94 on two liters.
- I got the bulletproof monk.

113
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,976
- You sure?
- Yes.

114
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,848
Trauma panel,
HemoCue, type for two.

115
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,819
Let's start with
an upright chest.

116
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,019
- Last patient. Couldn't get rid of him.
- You're leaving me Mr. Body Fluids?

117
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,959
- Sorry.
- Hey.

118
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,598
- You going home to crash?
- Yeah.

119
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,825
- You wanna get together later?
- Maybe.

120
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,594
Alex has a soccer game.

121
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,297
Steve talked him into signing up. He
never stuck around to see any games.

122
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,998
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

123
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,004
Dr. Carter, hat's the
special of the day?

124
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,172
58-year-old found in the street with a
blood alcohol of 500 and a foot drop.

125
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,614
Neurology won't take him
until Neurosurg cleared.

126
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,219
They won't come until he sobers.

127
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,049
- MRI to rule out cord compression?
- They're gridlocked.

128
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,782
What am I supposed to do?

129
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,654
Babysit. Hang your banana bag.

130
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,852
And I would hunt around
for a mop and a bucket.

131
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,030
All right. Forty bucks says I get
that guy upstairs in 20 minutes.

132
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,669
You're on, hotshot.
Starting now.

133
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,031
All right.

134
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,169
<i>- MRI Department.</i>
- Hello, this is Dr. Barnett from the ER.

135
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:30,181
Yeah, I have a patient who needs
an L-spine with gadolinium today.

136
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,147
Well, when then?

137
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,914
Look, I need to take a
look at your MRI schedule.

138
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,557
I gotta get a patient
in there pronto.

139
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,886
It's a holiday.
They're booked solid.

140
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,990
Maybe.

141
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,858
Yo, Lockhart. I need
to borrow your students.

142
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,899
- They're not my students.
- That's good.

143
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,004
Come on, kiddies.
It's teaching time.

144
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:55,370
We heard you had a good one
up here in the ICU for my students.

145
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,908
Patient named Robinson.

146
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:02,677
Thanks. So he's scheduled
for an MRI on his knee?

147
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,460
Yeah, but that's the
least of his problems.

148
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,750
Guy needs a workup before surgery
will take him for the replacement.

149
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,183
- It's a scheduling nightmare.
- I'm sure it is.

150
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,853
Pay up, Uncle Cracker.

151
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,591
- Six and 30 makes 10. May I help you?
- Can I get a job application?

152
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,132
Need to speak to the manager.

153
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,862
- Is he here?
- Unfortunately.

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,307
Yale, University of Chicago
Med School, interesting.

155
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,278
This is all very impressive, but what's
the extent of your barista experience?

156
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,383
- Excuse me?
- Starbucks, Diedrich's...

157
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,779
Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.

158
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,379
- I've never actually worked in a café.
- I see.

159
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,751
But I'm used to working
in a very busy hospital.

160
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,393
So I'm sure I can handle
a few coffee orders.

161
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:52,324
Really? How do you prepare a venti,
triple skinny, no-foam caramel macchiato?

162
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,438
That intern, Abby, do you
know if she's seeing anybody?

163
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,835
Just me.

164
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,979
It's a casual sexual relationship,
but we're always looking for a third.

165
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,840
Abby, what if the UA's normal
on a 2-year-old with fever?

166
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,350
Viral syndrome. Have them
follow up with their PMD.

167
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,784
What if the kid vomited
Tylenol he got in triage?

168
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,584
Give a rectal dose and
explain that fever won't hurt him.

169
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,024
And what would you do if a
med student asked you out?

170
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,595
Call for a Psych consult.

171
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,823
Twenty-four-year-old
cyclist collided with another.

172
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,468
- Hold up.
- No LOC, GCS, 15, vitals stable.

173
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,433
- Complains of knee pain.
- What is this?

174
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,004
Bike versus bike.
Abdomen soft, pelvis stable.

175
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,142
- Don't move your neck.
- What?

176
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,340
Don't do that.

177
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,372
Funky Monks. Chili
Peppers tribute band, right?

178
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,175
We were until our
lead singer found Jesus.

179
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,444
That's a bummer. Thinking
about putting a band together.

180
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,952
Abrasions and ecchymosis
to the hip, Dr. Bon Jovi.

181
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,955
You on any medications?

182
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,821
- I don't take medicines. MAN:
I need to make a statement.

183
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,222
That's the other guy.

184
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,125
That idiot rode
right in front of me!

185
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,461
- I didn't see you, man.
- Because he was riding like a maniac!

186
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,530
- Hey!
- I got this guy.

187
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,297
- Gee, thanks.
- Road rash over left chest, arm and face.

188
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,306
- Complains of shoulder pain.
- I ride 200 hundred miles a week.

189
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,843
Irrigate the abrasions and apply
Neosporin. Were you wearing that helmet?

190
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,480
Of course. When can I see
a cop? He ruined my bike!

191
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,412
You did a little more damage
to him than he did to your bike.

192
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,848
It's a $6000 Serotta Legend.

193
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,749
You paid six grand for a bike?

194
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,691
Hey, Mr. Zeller, please. No,
I need this to examine you.

195
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,328
Oh, my God.

196
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,426
I'm fine! I keep
telling you that!

197
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,037
- How are you doing, Mr. Hanson?
- It don't even hurt!

198
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,071
- There's blood in Morrison's.
- Bull!

199
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,233
- Do know what Morrison's is?
- Do you?

200
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,411
Chest is clear. Don't think
it crossed the diaphragm.

201
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,172
Hemoglobin is 13.2.

202
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,079
Give him a gram of cefotetan
just in case he nicked the bowel.

203
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,243
You heard the man.
Give me some medicine.

204
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,412
- Let me get the hell up out of here.
- You're not going anywhere.

205
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,057
- You need surgery.
- For what?

206
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:02,685
He didn't shoot me. Ain't no bullets in
there. Don't know what y'all looking for.

207
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,956
- Bleeding in your belly.
- Punctured intestines.

208
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,600
- You can get an infection and die.
- Forget that.

209
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,793
I need to call my
brother to get out of here.

210
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,701
I know you're tough, but what part of
"you could die" don't you understand?

211
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,206
I ain't dying. I'm walking.

212
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,039
- Man, get me a damn
phone! CARTER: Dr. Pratt?

213
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,942
Get me a phone, man!

214
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,549
Let the fool go.
He deserves to die.

215
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,278
Yeah. If that's what you want.

216
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,616
- Yeah, I don't care.
- You're not the Attending.

217
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,123
Since my name's on the
chart, we should call Psych.

218
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,955
He's not crazy, he's stupid.

219
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,730
Okay, hey, whatever. I'll call
them down for an idiot consult.

220
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,164
Look, he's not drunk,
he's not on drugs...

221
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,736
and if he leaves AMA
and goes home and dies...

222
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,396
you better believe his
family's gonna sue us.

223
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:51,568
All right. I'll call his brother. Maybe a
family member can talk sense into him.

224
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,512
Mr. Zeller? Sir? Can...?

225
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,649
Mr. Zeller. Mr...

226
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,585
Hey, I've been here for four hours.
Still haven't had a doctor check my foot.

227
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,656
- You seem to be walking on it all right.
- That's not the point.

228
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,452
Well, you see all
these patients?

229
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:10,119
Chances are we're not gonna get
to you until most of them go home.

230
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,427
So why don't you find a magazine
and make yourself comfortable?

231
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,463
How's he doing?

232
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,265
Crepitus bilaterally,
decreased range of motion.

233
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,169
- How's the other guy?
- Obnoxious.

234
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,940
So how many miles
do you ride a week?

235
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,443
Lots. Lots and lots of riding.

236
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,948
I ride here. I ride
there. I'm like the wind.

237
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,554
Hey, man! I told you that
they hurt. What's the matter?

238
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,452
- Sorry. I'm just checking your reflexes.
- There's nothing wrong with my reflexes.

239
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,891
I got good ref... Cat-like
reflexes. I'm like a cat.

240
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,529
Really?

241
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,961
Which is it? A cat or the wind?

242
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,326
Like a cat in the wind.

243
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,905
I got nine lives, and I
always land on my feet.

244
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,705
Hey.

245
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,137
Did you order a head CT?

246
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,146
Low-speed mechanism.
Didn't indicate.

247
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,308
He wasn't wearing a
helmet and seems altered.

248
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,478
It's just a mild concussion.
We'll observe him for a bit, okay?

249
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,056
- Where's the drunk with the foot?
- MRI.

250
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,659
- I thought they were booked.
- I pulled a few strings.

251
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,824
- Pull more and get this guy one.
- What's his problem?

252
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:21,161
He collided with another cyclist. His
neuro's non-focal, responds to commands.

253
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:24,668
- He seems altered to me.
- Did he get knocked out?

254
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,500
He just said he didn't hit his head.
- Carter!

255
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,872
Forty-five-year-old, GSW to the
head following a liquor store holdup.

256
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,740
- Is this the perp?
- No. He got away.

257
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,609
- This guy's the hero.
- Derek tried to help the store owner.

258
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,181
- You the wife?
- Girlfriend.

259
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,546
Okay. BP, 100/60, tachy to 115.

260
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,585
- Abby, you wanna run this?
- Sure.

261
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,181
Dr. Barnett, get that
head CT just to be safe.

262
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,498
- Lungs are clear.
- Doll eyes.

263
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,399
- What's that mean?
- BP, 108/80. Sinus tach, 110.

264
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,767
- Can I get an otoscope?
- Who are you?

265
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,775
Dubenko, surgical Attending.
I'm covering trauma today.

266
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,644
- His limbs are flaccid.
- CSF in the ears.

267
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,476
Somebody tell me
what's happening.

268
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,141
Doing everything we can.
His injuries are severe.

269
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,353
Derek's tough.

270
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,512
- He's a fighter.
- No corneal reflexes.

271
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,692
He's not breathing
over the vent.

272
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,292
It's been 40 minutes.

273
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,589
No. No. No.

274
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,326
He's tough. He's...

275
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,702
I'm sorry, ma'am.

276
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,931
Every indication suggests your
boyfriend has no brain activity.

277
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,540
That's it?

278
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,043
There's nothing else
we can do for him.

279
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,839
I'm very sorry.

280
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,021
Do you think that you can help
us get in touch with his family?

281
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,786
Uh...

282
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,957
I'm the closest thing
he has to a family.

283
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,491
Screen him.

284
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:04,835
CBC, chem panel, ABG, type and
Rh cultures, UA, HIV, Hep B and C.

285
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,974
- I forget anything?
- VDRL, RPR.

286
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,303
I'm very sorry.

287
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,580
If you have time to sit, you
have time to treat patients.

288
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,855
Start him on dopamine
if his diastolic's...

289
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:27,426
Unless he signs a consent form
for drug testing, we can't do that.

290
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,228
No. That's not the
same as consent.

291
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,196
Really? Same to you.

292
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,764
Calling your mom?

293
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,270
Bike courier's boss
wants us to drug-test him.

294
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,272
- So did you?
- There's no need.

295
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,741
And his head CT was
negative, thank you very much.

296
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,006
Mr. Tunny, do you
remember your doctor's name?

297
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,712
Yeah, it was him.

298
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,613
Do you know where you are?

299
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,617
No place I wanna be.

300
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,518
What are the first chords of the
Chili Pepper's "Californication"?

301
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,125
- A minor, F major seventh, A minor.
- Thank you.

302
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,093
- That means nothing to me.
- You're just gonna have to trust me.

303
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,790
Trust you to what? The
guy still seems altered.

304
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,460
Drug screen for opiates, benzos or
even cannabis would give us an answer.

305
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,317
- Then we don't have to keep looking.
- Won't change our management.

306
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,966
Still gonna observe. Tox
screens can stay positive for days.

307
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,977
- Could lose his job for smoking last week.
- It's confidential.

308
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,139
Not if it becomes a workers'
comp case. Then it's on his record.

309
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,751
What is he? Your dealer?
Maybe we should tox screen you.

310
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,325
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah?

311
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,224
- You have a UA for Tunny in there?
- Yeah.

312
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,886
- Add a tox screen.
- Sure.

313
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,090
Thank you.

314
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,304
Is your supervisor here?

315
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,072
- That would be me.
- I'd like to apply for a job.

316
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,744
- You've worked in one of our stores?
- No. But I like the clothes.

317
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,318
Really? That looks
more like Old Navy.

318
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,014
- Have you ever worked retail?
- No. But I'm a quick study.

319
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,354
Unfortunately, I'm looking
for experienced help right now.

320
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,019
I can work a cash register
and I'm a people person.

321
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,358
I worked at my parents'
restaurant for years.

322
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:17,869
I really need people with a strong
fashion sense and personal-style statement.

323
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,132
Why don't you leave your name
and number and I'll get back to you.

324
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,913
- What are you doing?
- I like them to be the same length.

325
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,157
Hey, Malik, where's the fire?
- Exam 3.

326
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,391
- What happened?
- Somebody set off a stink bomb.

327
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,932
Let's hope there's
no asthmatics around.

328
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,628
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

329
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,738
- Come here. Is that the Colles' fracture?
- Yep.

330
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,635
The wrist has to be
flexed for proper alignment.

331
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,970
The wrist has to be
flexed for proper alignment.

332
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,080
- What do I do now?
- You cut it off and you start again.

333
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,375
What do I tell her?

334
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,720
We're gonna leave that for 20
minutes until the mold is ready.

335
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,849
And then we're gonna put on
a fiberglass cast. Okay, dear?

336
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,371
- This hurt?
- No. We'll knock you out...

337
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,162
put a little incision by your
bellybutton, take a look.

338
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,936
- That's it? CORDAY:
Hold on, Mr. Hanson.

339
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,041
You hear that? My man says he can
fix me up, have me out of here tomorrow.

340
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,871
Gonna do exploratory laparoscopy
on a penetrating trauma?

341
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,569
- Yep.
- No, he's not.

342
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,840
You guys don't know
what the hell y'all doing.

343
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,615
- Piece of cake.
- What if there's a liver lac?

344
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,049
- I'll buzz it with cautery.
- What if it's too big?

345
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,180
If it were large, he'd have clinical
evidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

346
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,382
Ha!

347
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,791
You better ask to see a specialist
you wanna get out of here without dying.

348
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,556
- What if the knife nicked the colon?
- I'll run the bowel.

349
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,725
- Nobody can do that with a scope.
- Um... I can.

350
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,137
Welcome to the world of
modern medicine. Let's go.

351
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,036
So long, suckers.

352
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,038
Well, don't look at
me. I didn't hire him.

353
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,015
Okay, Mrs. Isley, all your
blood tests came back normal.

354
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,660
Yes. Well, I'd like
to see a specialist.

355
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,127
Ray. How about clearing
in a few of these beds?

356
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,823
What? I'm taking them
through like fast-food orders.

357
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,664
- It's the back door that's plugging up.
- You got rid of that drunk pretty quick.

358
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,964
Let me see some more of that.

359
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,342
Sam, I need McCarthy out of here.
And why hasn't Tunny been discharged?

360
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,740
We're still waiting
on his tox screen.

361
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,439
- I didn't order a tox screen.
- Abby did.

362
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,822
Whoa!

363
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,726
- What are you doing?
- Chest pain.

364
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,230
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

365
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,893
Dr. Pratt said all chest pain gets
O2, IV aspirin, beta-blocker and nitro.

366
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,563
- What physical activity have you done?
- Nothing. I was just watching TV.

367
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,403
What about yesterday?

368
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,510
- I worked out a little.
- Weightlifting?

369
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,909
- Bench press.
- I almost did 200.

370
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,813
Where's Dr. Pratt?

371
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,586
Comfortable?

372
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,348
I prevented one
of your students...

373
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,721
from giving nitroglycerin to a
17-year-old on your recommendation.

374
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:05,263
- I didn't tell him to do that.
- You have to be specific with these kids.

375
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,229
Sorry.

376
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,761
- You all right?
- Just a headache.

377
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,533
- You said you weren't having those.
- Only when I'm working here.

378
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,609
- Okay, go home.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

379
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,771
No harm, no foul. I'll
keep an eye on him.

380
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,610
You have been
dragging your ass all day.

381
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,754
- I've had time-consuming cases.
- Maybe you came back too soon.

382
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,122
So go home.

383
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,554
Get yourself in shape
before you fix anybody else.

384
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,957
Can't afford to send me home. I'm
worth two doctors and three interns.

385
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:40,759
Not today you're not. Go home. I'll
find somebody else to cover your shift.

386
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,263
Hey.

387
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,895
The biker's blood work came back.
HIV-positive. No good for organ donation.

388
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,803
That's too bad.
Frank, call Kovac.

389
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,570
I need him to come and
finish the rest of Pratt's shift.

390
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,112
Sure. Make me the
holiday hatchet man.

391
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:59,309
- Do you have any plans for this evening?
- Takeout. And the Cubs/White Sox game.

392
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,717
I was thinking about going to a
meeting then getting something to eat.

393
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,380
- Interested? My treat.
- You're buying?

394
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,118
Did you order a tox
screen on my patient?

395
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,154
Which one?

396
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,231
You know which one. Tunny.

397
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,163
The altered bike courier.

398
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,566
You can't order tests on
my patients behind my back.

399
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,639
Urinalysis was negative
for opiates, benzos, PCP...

400
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,833
cannabis, cocaine,
amphetamines, name it.

401
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,001
- Okay. So now we know.
- No.

402
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,774
We know this is the second time you've
been wrong about my patients today.

403
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,440
And you know
what? It's the last.

404
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,984
You treat your cases
and I'll treat mine.

405
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,689
- You believe this guy?
- Hey...

406
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,328
if you have a problem
with a Resident's workup...

407
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,521
- take it up with the Attending.
- It's easier just to fix it.

408
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,029
That's what the nurses do.

409
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,702
You're gonna have to work
with this guy for four years.

410
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,167
Dr. Carter?

411
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,205
I suggest that you figure out a
way of getting along with him.

412
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,366
This is Douglas James.
He's a friend of Derek and me.

413
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,205
- Hi.
- Hi.

414
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,176
Douglas is waiting for a liver.

415
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,612
And him and Derek
have the same blood type.

416
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,274
Right. I'm sorry. We
screened Derek...

417
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:10,446
and we found that he is
non-eligible as a donor.

418
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,026
- Because of his HIV?
- Yes.

419
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,320
I'm HIV-positive too.

420
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,192
I've been taking
interferon for hepatitis C...

421
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:22,529
but they've given me three
months without a transplant.

422
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,636
Well, direct donations
are not encouraged.

423
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,901
I'm HIV-positive.

424
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,976
You really think anyone's
ever gonna give me a liver?

425
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,573
- I'll be back to discharge you.
- Can you get serum organic acids...

426
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,250
lactate and a VDG?

427
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,318
- On Mulhoney?
- Throw in a free T4...

428
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,853
- and TSH while you're at it.
- Are you kidding?

429
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,251
- Did I miss something?
- No.

430
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,858
The kid's got a second-degree
burn on two fingers...

431
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,757
- he doesn't need this.
- You only do unnecessary tests...

432
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,488
on my patients when Abby asks.

433
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,190
- I thought you were working together.
- He's my patient.

434
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,825
- I'm the only one who can write orders...
- Hey, Luka.

435
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,098
- What are you doing here?
- Carter needed me to cover for Pratt.

436
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,775
Why didn't you say no?

437
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,343
- Labs are back on Tunny.
- Thanks.

438
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,275
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little.

439
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,006
Jane Doe, 23, found down
in the park by some kids.

440
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,516
Breathing's labored. Sats,
92. Pulse, 111. Systolic, 93.

441
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,211
Ma'am, wake up.

442
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,583
Inspiratory stridor.
Aeration is terrible.

443
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,386
Sub-Q epi and get her in
a trauma room. Howard?

444
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,257
Could be an allergic reaction.
Was there any food on scene?

445
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,626
You see any bee
stings? Hurry up, Howard.

446
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,596
Okay, okay.

447
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,137
- Sub-Q epi's in.
- Finally.

448
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:40,836
Any medic alert bracelet? Asthma inhaler?
- Didn't see any.

449
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,645
Periorbital petechiae.

450
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,146
Luka?

451
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,919
Ecchymosis on the neck.

452
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,646
Well, what's that mean?

453
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,253
It means someone
tried to strangle her.

454
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,489
God bless America.

455
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,905
Kerry.

456
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,007
- Elizabeth.
- I've been calling you all day.

457
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,633
Yeah. I've been in meetings and
I've got another one three minutes ago.

458
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,440
Call my office, tell them I
said to fit you in tomorrow.

459
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,344
I need to talk about
Dr. Dubenko today.

460
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,109
- How's he working out?
- He's not, to be quite frank.

461
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,187
- I haven't received any complaints.
- Consider this your first.

462
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,517
No one even bothered
to tell me you'd hired him.

463
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,594
That's what search committees do.
You should've attended more meetings.

464
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:33,756
Kerry. I missed one meeting.

465
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:38,131
What, did you wait till I wasn't there to
hire the only candidate I didn't endorse?

466
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,534
Why are you taking this
so personally, Elizabeth?

467
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,699
I've got to go. I'm sure the
two of you can work this out.

468
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,173
Oh, hey, um, Dr...?

469
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,647
- Dubenko.
- Right. Sorry. John Carter.

470
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,651
- You remember the GSW this morning?
- Yeah, brain-dead biker.

471
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,588
His girlfriend says he
wanted to be an organ donor.

472
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,785
- Great.
- But he's HIV-positive.

473
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,620
Well, no can do.

474
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:06,629
Well, his buddy needs a liver
ASAP and he's the same tissue type.

475
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,826
It's against the law to harvest
organs from an HIV-positive patient.

476
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,233
- You know that.
- The recipient is HIV-positive.

477
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,307
It doesn't matter. UNOS won't
approve and no surgeon's gonna operate.

478
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,370
What's that smell?

479
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,909
- Stink bomb.
Frank! FRANK: Got it!

480
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,016
They warned me about this
place. They weren't kidding.

481
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,316
- Uh, Dr. Corday.
- Carter.

482
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,721
Maybe you can help me.
I need help with a patient.

483
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,520
I believe Dr. Dubenko
is covering...

484
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,162
I don't think that he wanted to.

485
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,560
And what is it? Too mundane
for our new superstar?

486
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:43,759
- I think it may be too illegal.
- Oh, so he's cowardly and cocky.

487
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,929
He's the perfect complement to
Weaver's treachery and ambition.

488
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,269
I'm sorry, Carter. But I have
to deal with him, so do you.

489
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,040
Good luck.

490
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,447
Stridor seems to be improving.

491
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:03,383
Keep an eye on her pulse ox.
Come and get me if she de-sats.

492
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:12,389
- I'll notify the police.
- What happened to her? Hey, Luka.

493
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,226
- Hey.
- Alex, what are you doing here?

494
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,301
You're supposed to be with Steven
and Monique at the soccer game.

495
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,631
- I gotta find someone to cover me.
- Don't bother.

496
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,274
- It's probably gonna suck anyway.
- You're going to the game.

497
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,773
I can take him. I'm off in 20.

498
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,037
I was filling in for Pratt. You can
pick him up at my place after work.

499
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,477
Hey, are you busy? I
need your expertise.

500
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,480
- Have Alex meet me in the lounge.
- Thanks.

501
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,605
You worked at a restaurant
from the time you were 6 until 16?

502
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,072
- It was a family restaurant.
- What kind?

503
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,575
Indian. I never want to
work in a restaurant again.

504
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,840
- I don't even like eating in them.
- You haven't worked since then?

505
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,814
- I've been in school.
- Studying...?

506
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,146
Medicine. Oh, wow.

507
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,117
I'll be honest. We don't get
many doctors looking for jobs.

508
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,190
So you placed very high
on your placement test...

509
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,957
but you haven't got a lot of
experience in any other service industry.

510
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,363
No retail, no sales.

511
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,596
- Secretarial?
- No.

512
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,797
- Bookkeeping?
- Not really.

513
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,772
Horticulture?

514
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,001
Mechanics?

515
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,309
Electrical?

516
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,251
Perhaps we'd have better luck
if you told us what you can do.

517
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,814
Let's see. I can crack
open your chest...

518
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,753
re-inflate your lung and
squeeze your heart back to life.

519
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,318
Okay.

520
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,791
Dubenko was right to pass.

521
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,333
Why are you pushing
so hard for this?

522
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,504
Because we're
this guy's last hope.

523
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,970
Because I couldn't
save his friend.

524
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,173
Because some good
should come out of this.

525
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,175
And what if they sue?

526
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,213
Who? His buddy wants the liver.

527
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,509
He's not gonna
live long without it.

528
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,247
The hospital could fire me.

529
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,684
The guy's gonna die without the
liver, he's never gonna get another.

530
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,653
- They could pull my license.
- Unlikely.

531
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,555
- Acting in the patient's best interest.
- Or jail.

532
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,855
There's already
legislation allowing this.

533
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,091
It's waiting for the
governor's signature.

534
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:27,727
It'll still violate regulations.

535
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,233
I know. But it is ridiculous to let a
perfectly good organ go to waste.

536
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,865
The liver's not gonna
affect the recipient...

537
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,271
the recipient's got the virus.
He's got a good heart, good lungs...

538
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,705
low viral load...

539
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,436
How's Weaver gonna react?

540
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,547
Well, she... Yeah, she might
have a little issue with this.

541
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,553
She'll have a
bloody conniption fit.

542
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,187
Which in itself is
almost worth the risk.

543
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,457
Screw it.

544
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,728
Screw it. Prep him.
I'll mobilize the team.

545
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,562
Mwah.

546
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,031
Sneaking tests on
other doctors' patients?

547
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,261
- Ray?
- You totally boned me.

548
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,736
- I felt like an idiot.
- Sorry.

549
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,374
- Well, you were right.
- Really?

550
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,067
Mm-hm. Check out
the serum salicylates.

551
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,237
- I'll let you know next time.
- Don't do it next time.

552
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,814
- Where's he going?
- To the O.R.

553
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,746
Corday agreed to do the surgery.

554
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:23,446
- You talked her into it?
- No. Well, maybe a little.

555
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,095
- So you never responded to my offer.
- Uh...

556
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,099
- I'll take a rain check on dinner.
- What about the meeting?

557
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,238
- Do you still go to meetings?
- I'll go if you go.

558
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,737
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

559
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,110
I see how hard you're throwing
yourself into the job, Carter.

560
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,145
- It's a hard job.
- So is sobriety.

561
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,782
And so is losing a child.

562
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,185
- Hey, where's Dr. Kovac?
- I don't know.

563
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,037
What's wrong?

564
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:58,084
I think Jane Doe's
having trouble breath...

565
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,952
Call Respiratory Therapy.

566
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,253
- I need to talk to you.
- Talk to your patient.

567
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,124
And you might want to add
an amp of bicarb to his IV.

568
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,459
- You need to alkalinize his urine.
- What?

569
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,261
He's got a toxic aspirin level.

570
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,971
Hey.

571
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,476
Hey. What are you doing here?

572
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,481
Oh, pediatrician visit. Somebody
was being checked for Pyloric stenosis.

573
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,982
Hey, Cosmo.

574
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,644
- How's he doing?
- Oh, good. Just reflux. Oh, hi, Frank.

575
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,187
Hi.

576
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:35,655
- So, wow, you look great.
- Oh, thanks. How's it going?

577
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,353
Twelve new med
students. How do you think?

578
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,226
Is Chuny or Haleh around?

579
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,458
Yeah, Chuny's around.
Why? You need a nurse?

580
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,660
I need somebody to watch him.

581
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,668
I could do it.

582
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,344
Well, are you sure? Because
he can be really cranky.

583
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,238
Yeah. No, yeah, of course.

584
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:02,014
Okay. Well, you'll need
this because he spits up.

585
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,021
That's what he does basically:
spit, poop, eat, sleep, repeat.

586
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,681
Yeah, just like his daddy.

587
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,089
How is Chuck
taking to fatherhood?

588
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,221
You mean motherhood? The guy's more
maternal than I am. Thanks. I'll be back.

589
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,196
Okay.

590
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,404
She'll be right back.

591
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,243
The IV's blown. I need
to start another line.

592
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,712
Okay, seven P's.
Preparation, pre-oxygenation...

593
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,250
pre-treatment, paralysis and
sedation, protecting the airway...

594
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:39,016
passing the tube, proof of placement,
post-intubation management.

595
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,092
Okay, preparation suction. Good.

596
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,525
Yankauer's ready.
Pre-oxygenation, O2...

597
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,689
100 percent non-rebreather.

598
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,563
Uh, 7.0 stylet, half
centimeter from the end.

599
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,898
You got this, Howard?

600
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:54,194
Yep. Six-five is
ready if cords are tight.

601
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,706
Laryngoscope bulb is good.

602
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:04,414
- I can't believe how big he is.
- Oh, he should be. He doesn't stop eating.

603
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,211
Where have you
been? I was parked.

604
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,410
I had to pee and everybody
wanted to see him.

605
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,079
What's wrong with you people?
You've never seen a baby?

606
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,725
Can you give him room?
No one's wearing masks.

607
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,157
- Relax.
- There's germs everywhere, babe.

608
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,762
It's good for his immunity.

609
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,489
I called for a consult and
I don't think I should have.

610
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,225
- What patient?
- Which of you is Carter?

611
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,097
I'm Dr. Carter.

612
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,835
- You know what otitis media looks like?
- I do.

613
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,632
Then teach it to your students.

614
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:33,609
So they don't call me for a ENT consult
every time a kid comes with an earache.

615
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,947
She's closing up. You're not gonna
get any sized tube in if you don't move.

616
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,777
- Find Kovac?
- Couldn't find him.

617
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,181
Sats are down to 79.

618
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,323
CO2 monitor's ready, purple.

619
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:50,122
Paralysis and
sedation, 82.5 of sux...

620
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,787
and 17 of etomidate.

621
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,794
- Heart rate's 66.
- What are you doing?

622
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,696
- Checking the doses.
- You've done that.

623
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,962
She's gonna end up
cricked if you don't move.

624
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,333
Oh, God. Now look what you've
done. You ruined everything.

625
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,478
Howard, get it together.
You can do this.

626
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,807
- She messed it all up.
- She's bradying down.

627
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,480
Suction, oxygen, laryngoscope...

628
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,553
All right, give her the meds
and have a 7.0 ready to go.

629
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,586
I got this. She's my patient.

630
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,686
- Pulse ox, 72.
- Suction.

631
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,226
Suction!

632
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,161
- Sux is in.
- Tube.

633
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,593
- It was on the floor.
- Give it to me!

634
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,367
Bradycardic, 55.

635
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:35,166
- The cords are so tight.
- Fifty-four, 52.

636
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,504
All right. Have epi and ready.
Howard, stand by with a 6.5.

637
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,373
I always check four times.

638
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,213
I'm in.

639
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,484
Good color change.

640
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,415
Heart rate's
coming up. Sats, 88.

641
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,022
Call for an x-ray. See if CT's ready
to take her. Pupils are non-reactive.

642
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,522
Were they non-reactive before?

643
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,360
- I don't remember. I'll check the chart.
- Howard.

644
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,639
- Nice pass! He's good.
- Thanks.

645
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,502
Come on. Come on. There we go.

646
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,145
Shoot! MAN: There we go.

647
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,906
Shoot.

648
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,353
- Tough break.
- Yeah.

649
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,731
- You played a good game.
- My team blows.

650
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,027
Every team has
good and bad days.

651
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,899
The most important
thing is to try your best.

652
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,533
- Want to grab a pizza on the way home?
- Sure.

653
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,906
I can help you practice someday
if you want to kick around.

654
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,910
- No, thanks.
- I don't mind.

655
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,879
I played football in
school. I mean, soccer.

656
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,245
I was pretty good.

657
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:57,355
- We could go to the park near my place.
- Look, Luka...

658
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,020
I'm glad we're friends.

659
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,423
But I've got a dad.
And he's coming back.

660
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,061
- What happened?
- Abby saved Kovac's patient.

661
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,601
- Delayed laryngeal edema.
- And a freaking intern.

662
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,295
- Have you seen Howard?
- Nope.

663
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,565
- Hey, Abby?
- Just a minute.

664
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,938
- Could you show me how to use the slit...?
- Not now.

665
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,373
You need something?

666
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,572
Think you could get
me her phone number?

667
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,809
What's going on, Howard?

668
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,379
Just needed some air.

669
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:35,592
- Sometimes it's olfactory overload.
- I was talking about the trauma.

670
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,995
You were looping in there.

671
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,565
Checking things three or four
times, repeating your actions.

672
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,464
I like to be thorough.

673
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,229
Come on.

674
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,707
What is it?

675
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,742
Sometimes I get nervous.

676
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,438
It didn't seem like nervous
to me. Do you have OCD?

677
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,480
I've got to get back to work.

678
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,857
Yo, doc. The freak in the cape just put
his hand through the window to Exam 2.

679
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,460
All right. Set him up
for sutures in Curtain 1.

680
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,096
I gave Mr. Ogilvie
too much oral contrast.

681
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,629
- Can I ask you a question?
- No.

682
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,630
My patient has
a 2-inch head lac.

683
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,463
Should I use 3.0
Prolene or 4.0 to suture?

684
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,845
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

685
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,947
Chuck? What are you doing?

686
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,751
Oh, it's a supplemental
nursing device.

687
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:45,054
What? You've never seen
a father breastfeed his kid?

688
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,002
- Can't say that I have.
- I tell you, these things are amazing.

689
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,968
It allows the father to bond
the same way the mother does...

690
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,074
if you can get
past sore nipples.

691
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,209
- You want to give it a shot?
- No.

692
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,281
My patient has a head lac. Should
I use 3.0 Prolene or 4.0 to suture?

693
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,679
Hey, Rockheart.

694
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,913
- What did you call me?
- Lockhart.

695
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,524
- Are you heading home?
- That's what most of us do...

696
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,024
- at the end of our shift.
- Yeah.

697
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,857
Well, I'm sort of in
between places right now.

698
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,828
Listen, I'm sorry we
got off on the wrong foot.

699
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:27,029
- Can I buy you dinner? Make it up to you?
- No, thanks.

700
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:30,232
You were right. He was
altered from an aspirin overdose.

701
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,673
The more he popped, you
know, the more his knee hurt.

702
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,712
- He was popping them like M&M's.
- You might wanna suggest endoscopy.

703
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,611
He probably ate out his stomach
lining. Can I ask you a question?

704
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:42,210
- How well do you know Howard?
- Not very. Why?

705
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:45,016
- He doesn't seem a little strange to you?
- How so?

706
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,558
Maybe a little
obsessive or compulsive.

707
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,026
- He froze in a trauma today.
- You've been in thousands of codes...

708
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,860
he's probably seen six.
Cut the guy some slack.

709
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,593
You don't think I should
mention it to an Attending?

710
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,935
What are you? The hall monitor?

711
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,565
- Brauts?
- I like to live dangerously.

712
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,973
Come on, you got to wolf down a
few dogs on the Fourth. It's tradition.

713
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,044
Didn't she use to
work in the hospital?

714
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,911
Neela?

715
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,384
Hello, and welcome to
Jumbo Mart. Can I help you?

716
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,421
- What are you doing?
- Working.

717
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,821
Here?

718
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,758
We have a special on our
cupcakes. Buy two, get one free.

719
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,489
- Oh, sweet.
- When you said you were looking...

720
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,601
I thought you meant at another
hospital or a clinic maybe.

721
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,900
- Well, I didn't have much luck.
- You only looked for one day.

722
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,772
This is the only job I can
get because I'm a loser.

723
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,970
You are not a loser.

724
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,274
At least you're
close to the hospital.

725
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:48,119
- Which is as close as I'm ever gonna get.
- That's not true.

726
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,755
Yes, it is. I blew it.
I blew everything.

727
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,858
I've got no job, no
apartment, no money.

728
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:57,621
I mean, look at me.
I'm not even American.

729
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,594
Oh, you are going
down, you little freak.

730
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,532
- You suck.
- You're worse at this than at soccer.

731
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,467
Bite me, you Slav bastard.

732
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,135
Alex.

733
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,632
What did you just say?

734
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,045
- What?
- What did you say?

735
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,477
- Nothing.
- I heard you.

736
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,107
- You heard him. What did he say?
- I didn't hear. Might have been the game.

737
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:23,117
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
you heard the game, Mom.

738
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,649
Yeah, well, I don't want to
hear that kind of talk out of you...

739
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,315
or you.

740
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,159
How was the game?

741
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,664
- We lost.
- Yeah, but he played well.

742
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,062
Still lost.

743
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,204
Well, maybe next time.

744
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,805
Come on, grab your stuff.
- After this game.

745
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:46,075
Alex, please, now. Or else I'm gonna
fall asleep right here on this couch.

746
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,876
You can stay here for
tonight. Plenty of room.

747
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,151
Actually, you can stay
as long as you like.

748
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,847
Well, that's something that me and
Alex would have to talk about first.

749
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,752
Talk about what?

750
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:04,456
Talk about you getting
your butt in gear.

751
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,547
Kramer can go home.

752
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,042
Balmore's waiting for a
transfer to the jail ward.

753
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,776
Henderson needs
a monitored bed...

754
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,581
or the morgue if he
doesn't get admitted soon.

755
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:33,384
- Where is Ray?
- Try the roof.

756
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,550
- What's he doing?
- I think he lives there.

757
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,720
He lives in the call room.
He just cooks on the roof.

758
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,380
What are you doing?

759
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,450
Just chilling.

760
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,623
Looks like you're
all moved in up here.

761
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,764
Yeah. Well, the rent's right.
And, hey, you can't beat the view.

762
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,331
While you've been up
here on your little cookout...

763
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,935
your patient has
been circling the drain.

764
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,935
He needs dopamine
and a trip to the ICU.

765
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,630
He's a DNR.

766
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,276
His daughter's bringing the
paperwork from Milwaukee.

767
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:26,775
Oh.

768
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,946
Want a beer?

769
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:31,677
No. Thank you.

770
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,613
I can throw on a dog.

771
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,780
No, I'm good.

772
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,421
I heard about your son.

773
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,797
I'm sorry.

774
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,867
Thank you.

775
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,435
That's gotta be hard.

776
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,305
Sometimes.

777
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,776
You aren't really living
in the hospital, are you?

778
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,150
Why? Would that be a problem?

779
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,449
Might be a problem
for Dr. Weaver.

780
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,816
She has the place
sprayed for interns.

781
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,822
Hey, dude. Check it out.

782
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,104
Happy Fourth of July.

783
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,842
Yeah, you too.
