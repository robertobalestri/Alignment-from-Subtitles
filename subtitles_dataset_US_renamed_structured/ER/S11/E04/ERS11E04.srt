00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:05,885
<i>NARRATOR: Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,039
Who are you?

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,438
Dubenko, surgical
Attending. I'm covering trauma.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,706
What did you do? Hire the
only candidate I didn't endorse?

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,601
Maybe something's
opened up at the hospital.

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,049
I don't wanna
work in the hospital.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,630
Welcome to Jumbo
Mart. Can I help you?

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,117
- What are you doing?
- Working.

9
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,880
You can stay here for tonight.

10
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,967
Actually, you can stay
as long as you like.

11
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,153
Sometimes I get nervous.

12
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,659
It didn't seem like nervous
to me. Do you have OCD?

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,509
It's against the law to harvest
organs from an HIV-positive patient.

14
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,123
The recipient is HIV-positive.

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,202
It doesn't matter. UNOS won't
approve and no surgeon's gonna operate.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,204
But it is ridiculous to let a
perfectly good organ go to waste.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,569
Prep him. I'll
mobilize the team.

18
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,318
Go away! MAN: Let me in!

19
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,920
- Open this damn door!
- Why can't you leave us alone?

20
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,419
Mama, what's wrong?

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,586
Just leave us in peace!

22
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,489
I'll kill all of you!
The kids too!

23
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,429
Just let us alone.

24
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,732
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Go, go!

25
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,530
Is that what you want?
You want me to kill the kids?

26
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,835
- Mama, please. NICHELLE:
It's gonna be okay.

27
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,034
We just gotta go. Come on.

28
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,078
Open it or I'll kill them one
by one, and make you watch.

29
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,341
Go where he can't find you.

30
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,508
Open this damn door!

31
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,450
Come on. Come on.

32
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,123
Saige!

33
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,524
Mama!

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,680
The transplant
wasn't a total success.

35
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,684
I still have to meet with the
Medical Executive Committee.

36
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,253
Yeah. Makes me nervous too.

37
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,516
Mommy, in the picture?

38
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:41,423
Look, John, I'll have to go. I'll call
you when I hear something, all right?

39
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,894
Yeah. Okay, bye.

40
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,192
Sorry, sweetheart.
What were you saying?

41
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,732
Is this Daddy?

42
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,433
Yeah. You know that.

43
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,740
Who are they?

44
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,013
That's your nana
and your grandpa.

45
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,641
Are they dead too?

46
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,452
I've been to the science
museum like 10,000 times.

47
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,885
Why can't I just stay home?

48
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,923
This way maybe
you'll learn something...

49
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,652
instead of zoning out all
day in front of that Xbox.

50
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,126
You can learn from that too.

51
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,959
Luka taught me how to
rob all 15 stores in Vice City.

52
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,796
- Looks cool on his plasma.
- You like it over there at Luka's?

53
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,801
Like the neighborhood
and everything?

54
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,234
Guess so.

55
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,931
- You like him too, right?
- Yeah, why?

56
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,675
Just wondering.

57
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34,946
Well, then how would you feel
about maybe moving in with him?

58
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,949
- You serious?
- He offered.

59
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,450
You want to?

60
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,111
I don't know. We never
really lived with anyone before.

61
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,848
We lived with Dad.

62
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,583
Can I put our TV in my room then?
- Mmm...

63
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,790
- Maybe we should think about it more.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,868
Sir, please don't read that
paper until you've paid for it.

65
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,803
- Just this, please.
- Sure, $1.19.

66
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,642
One-one-nine. I'll
be right with you.

67
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,171
- Is there a problem?
- I got it.

68
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,647
I'll get it the next time.

69
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,719
I think Howard
has a touch of OCD.

70
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,382
Is that even possible,
to have a touch of OCD?

71
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,357
Three-ten, please.

72
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,724
- Busy over there today?
- I wouldn't know.

73
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,158
I thought you'd gotten out
of your mandatory ride-along.

74
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,894
It doesn't matter that
windowless vehicles make me sick.

75
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,834
That's why they call it
mandatory. How's it going here?

76
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,804
Eight-forty-two, please. Great.

77
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,501
I get 10 percent off
all my purchases.

78
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,513
- Abby, we gotta roll.
- See you later.

79
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,172
Bye.

80
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,688
- I talked her into doing it.
- Your hand never touched a scalpel.

81
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,814
Look, we're just trying to determine
Dr. Corday's understanding of the law...

82
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,188
- That's about to change.
- Find the current law...

83
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,421
regarding HIV-positive
organ transplant.

84
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,496
The donor was
originally my patient.

85
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,601
I'm just trying to ask for an
opportunity to speak in her behalf.

86
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,227
Attendance is limited to department
heads. Last I checked, you weren't one.

87
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,068
Bring it on. Dr. Pratt is on
the clock, and ready to rock.

88
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,540
Which reminds me, I'm
concerned we have doctors...

89
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,236
using work as therapy
for post-traumatic stress.

90
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,850
- He's fine.
- I'm not talking about him.

91
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:21,546
Look, I got your
request for extra shifts...

92
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,885
and it seems to me you're glossing
over some of your susceptibilities.

93
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,856
Hold the elevator. - Too late.

94
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,427
Sorry.

95
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,190
I'm sorry to bring up your
history of substance abuse...

96
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,590
but the fact is,
you're still an addict.

97
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,929
You've been through an
emotional roller coaster.

98
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,628
And I know what it's like.
Why push it? Why tempt fate?

99
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,400
God knows you
don't need the money.

100
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,101
There's no problem, Kerry.

101
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,074
Good.

102
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,875
Because I'm not in the business
of safeguarding doctors' licenses.

103
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,781
- Not twice anyway.
- So no extra shifts?

104
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,285
Go to the movies. Take trips.

105
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,753
Do something other than
hang around this hellhole.

106
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,118
- Kerry.
- What?

107
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,261
I tried to make an appointment.
Your assistant's being snarky.

108
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,920
Let me guess. You wanna
extend your maternity leave.

109
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,589
I was wondering if you found
a permanent replacement...

110
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,598
for the chief of
Emergency Medicine?

111
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,634
- Someone you want to recommend?
- Yeah, me.

112
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,433
- Told her you're busy.
- I offered you the position...

113
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,803
- and you turned me down.
- That was pre-baby.

114
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,945
- Post-baby that bad?
- I like kids better...

115
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,512
when they're not sucking
the life force out of me.

116
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,478
Chuck doesn't mind
staying at home...

117
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,709
as long as we can
make up the lost income.

118
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,787
A grand more per week
with a two-year commitment.

119
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,619
Deal. When do I start?

120
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,521
We need six months' worth
of variant x-ray interpretation...

121
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,097
unscheduled returns and a pneumonia
pathway compliance by day's end.

122
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,700
Oh, and the toilets in
the ER are backed up.

123
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,961
Good luck finding Maintenance.

124
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,357
About time. Getting
crazy out here.

125
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,805
How young are the kids?
- Four and five.

126
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,465
Three-story fall
from a window ledge.

127
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,021
Miracle they're breathing and talking.
- What happened?

128
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,480
Some domestic disturbance.
Mom's pretty worked up.

129
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,116
Please, God, please.

130
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,842
He tried to kill my babies.

131
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,987
- Who did, ma'am?
- My husband.

132
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,952
Looks like an
angulated fracture.

133
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,349
Spontaneous resps. Get
her on O2, and start a line.

134
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,654
I need a leg splint.

135
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,633
Hi. Hello. Can you
tell me your name?

136
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,994
Kali. ABBY: Okay, Kali.

137
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,031
- He had a gun. YARWOOD:
Any idea where he is now?

138
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,401
Oh, God, why did
you let this happen?

139
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,134
Oh, God.

140
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,005
Can you wiggle your toes?

141
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,172
Great.

142
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,215
That is perfect.

143
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,353
Are you an angel?

144
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,515
Vascular's intact. A what?

145
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,519
An angel? Gonna
take me to heaven?

146
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,320
Will somebody please answer my
question? Are we talking urticaria?

147
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,759
We're not sure.

148
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,526
Insect bites, lymphadenopathy,
erythema nodosum.

149
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,567
- It's possible.
- Which one is possible?

150
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,034
All of the above.

151
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,368
Come on, guys. Were the bumps
firm? Were they non-tender?

152
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,908
- Were they freely moveable?
- They're just bumps.

153
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,012
All right. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

154
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,545
First of all, read up on derm.

155
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,015
Secondly, learn to describe lesions
systematically so your superiors...

156
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,586
don't look at you like
you're complete dumbasses.

157
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,382
How are you doing,
Mr. Hayslip? I'm Dr. Pratt.

158
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,050
- You mind if I take a look?
- That's what I'm here for.

159
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,820
Good. Alrighty.

160
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,456
So, what are they?

161
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,229
Um, let me run some tests
and we'll find out, okay?

162
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,564
In the meantime, take a
more thorough history...

163
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,070
and get his labs cooking.

164
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,470
Jing-Mei, hey. Hey.

165
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,735
- What are you doing here?
- Ortho's slammed.

166
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,141
Borrowed a cast cutter,
figured I'd do it myself.

167
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,942
I know you're limber, but you're not
that limber. Come on, let me help you.

168
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,710
Thanks.

169
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,148
Anytime.

170
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,455
- It happened so fast.
- BP's 106/60 after morphine.

171
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,092
- Pushing another two.
- I got it.

172
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,457
The way he came right at us, and
then my babies were down here...

173
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,497
Ma'am, we're taking your kids
to County Emergency. Up we go.

174
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,930
- Meet us there.
- Do you have family or friends...

175
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,229
- that can drive you?
- What if he comes back?

176
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,635
- The police are here.
- No, we gotta stay together.

177
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,173
- Sorry, it's against policy.
- My children need me.

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,604
- Let her in.
- What?

179
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,075
- Let her in. Hey, Pam?
- What?

180
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,770
Will you take the brother?

181
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,245
This way your sister won't
be alone, okay? Thanks.

182
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,409
You're just supposed to be
along for the ride, remember?

183
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,153
- You feeling that at all?
- Mm-mm.

184
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,250
So no John Hancocks?

185
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,589
Hm?

186
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,027
Your cast. Nobody signed it.

187
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,632
Oh. Well...

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,292
I could have asked
the night nurse, I guess.

189
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,329
You know, I haven't
left the house in weeks.

190
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,703
The only reason why I'm here is
because I decided to hitch a ride...

191
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,639
with my dad's
transport ambulance.

192
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,975
He's got pneumonia
again. For the third time.

193
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,208
And phlebitis and a UTI.

194
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,678
Admitted him this morning.

195
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,486
You could have just called
me. I could have picked you up.

196
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:57,556
I think it's gonna be a while
before I get into a car with you again.

197
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,861
Don't forget your range-of-motion
exercises to build up your gastroc.

198
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,737
You ever think about him?

199
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,840
Who?

200
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,500
Elgin.

201
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,540
A 5-year-old,
displaced tibia fracture...

202
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,517
after falling from a third-story window
attempting to escape an abusive father.

203
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,988
- GCS 15, vitals stable after six of MS.
- Distal neurovascular status?

204
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,353
- Intact.
- The mom?

205
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,826
Yes, big red taxi thanks to Abby.
Brother and sister in the next rig.

206
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,363
We're gonna do everything
we can for them. I promise.

207
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,559
Tenderness at the olecranon
and distal radius. Multiple fractures.

208
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,863
Her name's Kali, after
the Hindu goddess.

209
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,877
- Any LOC?
- Not according to bystanders.

210
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,873
- Switching teams on us now, Lockhart?
- It's pretty, you know?

211
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,772
CBC, lytes, type
and cross for two.

212
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,743
Lateral C-spine, chest, pelvis,
left elbow, wrist and femur.

213
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,577
Put CT on hold for head and abdomen.
- Very good, Howard.

214
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,777
- But it means "destruction."
- Dumar, go.

215
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,855
He only used to hurt me.

216
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,857
Why'd he have to hurt my babies?

217
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,428
We need Social Services here right
away. Let's get Mom to the family room.

218
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,225
Sure. Ma'am, you want to
come with me, please? It's okay.

219
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,563
Good breath sounds, good
sats. I'll check on number two.

220
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,898
- They catch the bastard that did this yet?
- No.

221
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,802
Okay, we're out of here. Old
man found down, Lincoln Park.

222
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,239
Tracheal midline, no JVD.

223
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,605
- I'm scared.
- I know.

224
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,804
- Abby, come on.
- I'm right here. Don't worry.

225
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,950
I'm gonna catch you on the next run.
- Set up for that neck film.

226
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,552
You don't have 12 hours,
you're not gonna get credit.

227
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,245
- Right or left side?
- No hemotympanum.

228
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,915
Little sister's stable for now.
TKO saline after 500 cc's.

229
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,290
- Are you coming or not?
- Someone get me a lead apron.

230
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,235
There was no next of kin.

231
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:50,002
And you know that because the hospital's
policy of due diligence was exercised?

232
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,544
The organ had to be procured quickly
for the operation to be successful.

233
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,013
There wasn't time for
a 24-hour family search.

234
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,746
Was the rest of the surgical team aware
they were performing an illegal procedure?

235
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,619
I'm sure they assumed that consent
and UNOS approval were in place.

236
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,954
Did they know both
patients were HIV-positive?

237
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:15,090
Universal precautions are taken in surgery
regardless of a patient's HIV status.

238
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,065
Look, this was a unique
situation requiring decisive action.

239
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,073
That now exposes us
to huge civil liabilities.

240
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,507
Only if negligence or malice are
proven, which is clearly not the case.

241
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,080
- The recipient is thriving.
- It's against the law, Elizabeth.

242
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,116
At the moment, yes.

243
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:36,188
But the bill changing all of that is
sitting on the governor's desk as we speak.

244
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,584
Unsigned.

245
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,584
So a liver that would
have been destroyed...

246
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,958
was transplanted into a man who
wouldn't have qualified for one...

247
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,328
a day or two earlier than the law
allows. Where's the harm in that?

248
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,400
- I saved a patient's life.
- Actually, our patient died.

249
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,433
This other fellow just
happened to benefit from it.

250
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,173
You breached hospital
policy, state and federal law.

251
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,878
Any of which is grounds for
dismissal, and/or loss of your license...

252
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,853
should we report
this to the state board.

253
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,783
Sorry.

254
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,524
Got stuck in a hemorrhagic
Meckel's diverticulectomy.

255
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,162
Why is he here?

256
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,460
He's on the Medical
Ethics Committee.

257
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,230
If you had followed protocol and
presented to them, you would know that.

258
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,346
What's the next step, then?

259
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:43,587
We'll make a decision. You'll be
notified as soon as we reach one.

260
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,552
Right.

261
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,167
Damn, these veins are tiny.

262
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,204
You're gonna have to settle
down or it's gonna hurt even more.

263
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,772
- Mama...
- C-spine is clear.

264
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,568
Sats, 97. Need some help?
- I've done it before.

265
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:07,510
- Yeah. Bet you were pretty good at it too.
- Parietal abrasion. No step off.

266
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,115
- What do we have? RAY: I
thought they paged Dubenko.

267
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,717
- Well, you got me.
- Mama...

268
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,080
Four-year-old with chest
contusion. Rib fractures.

269
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,449
Eight, nine, 10 on the
left, but the lung is up.

270
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,090
Sisters, right? - Yeah.

271
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,022
- Let's check for tamponade.
- As soon as Sam sticks the kid.

272
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,356
Sorry. I got a
flash but no return.

273
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,555
- Try the other side.
- We need another nurse?

274
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,092
No. TAMIRA: Where's my mama?

275
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,396
Hey, Tamira, do
you like the Wiggles?

276
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,806
Which one is your
favorite, huh? Anthony?

277
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,443
Murray. He plays guitar.

278
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,743
DTRs two plus and
equal. Good answer.

279
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,514
I like Jeff because
he's always sleeping.

280
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,452
Got it.

281
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,291
- Thanks.
- Good bowel sounds. No guarding.

282
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,624
- How do you know about the Wiggles?
- I try to keep up with kids' TV.

283
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,823
Gives you something
to talk to them about.

284
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,467
- You're kidding me, right?
- Okay, she's stable for CT.

285
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,399
I hate the bloody Wiggles.

286
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,403
Kali, you have big beautiful brown
eyes, and they are both equal and reactive.

287
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,441
No murmur, rub or gallop.

288
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,137
- How's it going in here?
- Pretty severe pelvic fracture.

289
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,147
- Call Ortho?
- Yes. In the meantime, use sheet traction.

290
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,842
Pocket Doppler to Dr. Corday.
How'd it go upstairs?

291
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,284
I'm not sure. I'll know in a
couple of hours. Thanks for asking.

292
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,790
I can't imagine they'll give you
anything more than a slap on the wrist.

293
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,527
- Good pedal pulses.
- Foley's in.

294
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,561
Dip it for blood.

295
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,496
Angel?

296
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,496
Angel?

297
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,502
Uh, Abby, I think
she's talking to you.

298
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,005
Oh, hi.

299
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,169
- You're still here, right?
- Yeah. We're all still here.

300
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,042
- She'll need a second IV.
- I can start a central line.

301
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,683
- Dr. Pratt?
- What?

302
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,944
We have the chest
x-rays for Mr. Hayslip.

303
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,644
- Who? MAN: The
guy with the bumps.

304
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,647
He has a huge left hilar mass.

305
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,285
- Okay, go. I got Abby.
- Yeah, but she's playing paramedic.

306
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,157
Yeah. Well, I got Howard too.

307
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,459
Howie.

308
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,902
- How's the urine?
- Negative.

309
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,731
But I should try with a reagent
strip from another bottle.

310
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,364
- I only dipped it twice.
- Why? Once is sufficient.

311
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,338
Dr. Corday, we need you in here.

312
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,539
- What happened?
- Sats dropped to 79.

313
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,913
Probably a pulmonary contusion.
Tamira? Tamira, can you hear me?

314
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,020
- She's barely moving air.
- Get an ambu-bag and intubation tray.

315
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,750
- Should we get the mom in here?
- I'm not planning on her dying, are you?

316
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,759
Is the universe punishing
me for being a bad mom?

317
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,387
There are charts here that
haven't been picked up in six hours.

318
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,828
Good help is hard to find.

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,697
Like if you order a no-foam
latte, there should be no foam.

320
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,600
Yeah, Neela burned
my bagel earlier.

321
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,740
- You finish those QA reports?
- Not yet.

322
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,672
Yeah, I thought you'd be a
little rusty. Where's Dr. Corday?

323
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,106
- In Trauma.
- Okay.

324
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,713
Tell her to find me when
she's out. It's important.

325
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:58,010
Oh, and St. Joe's is closing its
ER next week for renovations.

326
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:02,087
- Plan on doubling your intake down here.
- Congratulations on your promotion.

327
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,918
- What's this?
- That is my time-off request...

328
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,083
demand for a
5-percent pay increase...

329
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,424
and my letter of resignation
if neither condition is met.

330
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,588
Welcome to management.

331
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,235
- How are you doing, Kali?
- I'm not hungry.

332
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,598
- Tachy at 130.
- Okay, we got a big pelvic bleed.

333
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,798
Let's hang some O-neg. Let's
get a pressure bag on that saline.

334
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,035
- Where are they?
- No, I don't want to.

335
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,875
- Okay, Kali, you need to relax.
- No, tell me what's happening to my kids.

336
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,780
- We're doing everything we can for them.
- Mommy, no.

337
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,114
You're hurting her! What
are you doing to her?

338
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,449
- No, no, Nichelle.
- Abby.

339
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,090
Oh, my God! What are they doing?

340
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,137
- Come on, Abby.
- Listen to me, okay?

341
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,458
Why aren't they helping? Why
aren't they helping my kids?

342
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:48,067
They are. They are. Okay?

343
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,566
Okay, come on. Let's go. Let's
let the doctors do their work, okay?

344
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,639
Okay. Okay.

345
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,503
- It's non-productive.
- Any hemoptysis?

346
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,302
Cough's chronic,
but getting worse.

347
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,912
Yeah, after two packs a
day for 25 years, no kidding.

348
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,605
Should I cancel
the derm consult?

349
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:06,241
The guy's got stage-four lung cancer
with 100 skin mets. What do you think?

350
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,321
- You have a primary-care doctor?
- No.

351
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:13,289
- Mr. Hayslip.
- Let me guess. More tests?

352
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,019
- Actually, that won't be necessary.
- Good.

353
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,027
Give me a nice little cream
for my rash, and I'm out of here.

354
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,666
It's not a rash. Look, I
don't know how to say this...

355
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,996
so I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

356
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,537
- You've got advanced lung cancer.
- What?

357
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,374
Which has
metastasized to your skin.

358
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,845
These are little cancers?

359
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,545
You need to see Oncology. They'll
have the results of your biopsy...

360
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,686
and can recommend a
course of chemotherapy.

361
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,485
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,058
Stay with the patient. He'll
need somebody to hold his hand.

363
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,461
- Heart pressure's up. Repeat the bolus.
- All right, I'll take that.

364
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,694
You, chart. Chuny, hang the blood.
- On it.

365
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,202
- You running this trauma now?
- Guy's sweating bullets.

366
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,705
All right, first
hematocrit is 34.

367
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,509
- Dr. Corday?
- One room over.

368
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,235
- Circumferential traction.
- Yeah.

369
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,006
Pelvic and femur fracture
with retroperitoneal bleeding.

370
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,378
TPOD's better. You should get it
from Central. And mobilize angio.

371
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,549
- Didn't know we stocked the TPOD.
- That must be new.

372
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,986
Let's give her 10
liters O2 by mask.

373
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,855
- I'll call Central.
- Yeah, you do that.

374
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,188
Is my sister gonna die?

375
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,062
Saige, right?

376
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,300
Well, we're doing everything that we
can to make sure that that doesn't happen.

377
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,936
Wanna up the FiO2.

378
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,439
Howard, can you
please take him out?

379
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,111
- That's a social worker's job.
- They're not here right now.

380
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,944
- Type-specific's ready?
- So get a nurse to talk to him.

381
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,451
I'm a little busy right now.

382
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,887
- I'd rather talk to him.
- Who, him?

383
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,127
Go.

384
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,789
I asked for blood. I
wanna repeat the crit...

385
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,196
I want a unit of FFP. I wanna know
where the damn social worker is.

386
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,530
Covering two hospitals
by herself till midnight.

387
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,697
That's my excuse for being late.
What's yours for being an ass?

388
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,272
- Where's the HemoCue?
- Foot of the bed.

389
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,142
- Fourteen centimeters at the lip.
- Can you see well enough?

390
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,612
Most time we can't get
one surgeon down here...

391
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,082
- how did we manage two?
- Getting harder to bag.

392
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,221
Yeah. Rib sliced up the spleen.

393
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,483
The large amount of fluid in the
sub-diaphragmatic space is obvious.

394
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,456
Consent for an ex-lap
and a splenectomy.

395
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,553
- Sats are dropping.
- Tachy at 140.

396
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,892
No breath sounds. She
has a tension pneumo.

397
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,433
The first chest x-ray was clear. Okay,
open a 20 French and a Thora-Seal.

398
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,594
Toss in an 18-gauge angiocath.
- Dr. Corday?

399
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,832
Sometimes endotracheal intubation
with positive airway pressure...

400
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,476
exacerbates an
imperceptible pneumo.

401
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,912
Okay, sats are up.

402
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,318
I was about to perform
a needle thoracostomy.

403
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,857
You can place the chest tube.
O.R. can take her as soon as that's in.

404
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,826
Who should I put
down as the Attending?

405
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,659
- Dubenko.
- Corday.

406
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
It might help to talk...

407
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,830
- about what happened.
- No.

408
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,801
I can't.

409
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,640
Is there anyone
we can call for you?

410
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,008
I just need to pray
for my children to live.

411
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,674
Pray for some peace in
my heart and my mind.

412
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,613
Pray for him to die.

413
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,647
He's an evil man.

414
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,521
Oh, he's an evil man.

415
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,659
But he gave me my children.

416
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,842
Now he's gonna take them away.

417
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,882
Need me to answer
some questions for you?

418
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,084
You wanna watch some TV?

419
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,592
Is my mom gonna be okay?

420
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,731
Well, it's pretty hard
for her right now.

421
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,231
She's worried and upset.
I'm sure you are too.

422
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,734
But hopefully your
sisters'll get better real soon.

423
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,737
They'll be back at home
getting on your nerves in no time.

424
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,899
Hey, you see those
guys right there?

425
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:28,571
They're gonna do everything that they can
to keep your family safe from your father.

426
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,578
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,882
Oh, man.

428
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:39,617
- Scrubs are in the first supply closet.
- Thanks. Come on.

429
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,091
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

430
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,423
How's it going?

431
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,996
Not so good. We
can't find this guy.

432
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,098
There's some indication he
left the state a year or so ago.

433
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,637
- If he came back, no one saw.
- Neighbors didn't help?

434
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,469
Woman next door was passed
out drunk, never heard a thing.

435
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,770
People on the other
side, they weren't home.

436
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,709
Well, she's still very
upset and a little scattered.

437
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,544
Yeah, I would be too if I
saw my kid fall three floors.

438
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,209
But I would want to catch
the guy who did it to them.

439
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:12,316
- Hi. Wendall Meade, Social Services.
- Detective Maskins.

440
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,126
Ma'am...

441
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,457
let me say how sorry I
am that this happened.

442
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,963
- Who are you?
- Nichelle...

443
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,102
this detective needs to
ask you about your husband.

444
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,261
Do you have any idea
where he's staying?

445
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,030
Where he might go?

446
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,467
The time. What's the time?

447
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,578
Uh, 12:15.

448
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,676
He likes to drink. Get drunk
soon as he could every day.

449
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,317
Did he have a favorite bar?

450
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,453
She's a survivor, this one.
- Let's hope.

451
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,322
Look, I've been wanting
to congratulate you...

452
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,294
on the transplant work you
did with the HIV patients.

453
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,830
Groundbreaking stuff.

454
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,991
- I wasn't trying to break any ground.
- Right.

455
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,002
Well, in a more perfect world,
you'd be given an award for it.

456
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,640
Weaver is waiting on
you. She says it's important.

457
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,834
Anyways, I think
what you did was great.

458
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,876
Dr. Dubenko, TPOD's
ready in Trauma One.

459
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,014
I'll send another surgeon down.

460
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,673
The sheet traction method
you use is a little archaic.

461
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,684
This gives a better hug around
the hips and upper thighs.

462
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,515
Sorry.

463
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,194
- What about Weaver?
- Tell her to wait.

464
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:29,496
Excuse me. She's asking for you.

465
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,298
- What's going on? CORDAY:
Slowly pull the handle...

466
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,908
straight out. ABBY: Kali?

467
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,544
- I wasn't a bad girl. ABBY:
No, of course you weren't.

468
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,478
- How's her pressure?
- Down to 65.

469
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,641
Crit's dropping, even
with the transfusion.

470
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,719
So much for Dubenko
and his contraptions.

471
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,720
- I don't wanna go there.
- Barely has a pulse.

472
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,084
I wanna go to heaven.

473
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,919
Just hang on, okay, Kali?

474
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:57,688
"Secure the compression by wrapping
the strings around the protruding hooks."

475
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,197
- Tachy at 150. No radial pulse.
- Intubation and central line kit.

476
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,432
No room for a
femoral with the TPOD.

477
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,229
- Go subclavian.
- On a 5-year-old?

478
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:09,204
We're gonna put a tube down
your throat so you can breathe.

479
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,003
You won't be able
to talk anymore.

480
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,701
Prep the upper chest. Let's go.

481
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,176
Kali?

482
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,882
I want to go with you, angel.

483
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,747
Five-and-a-half ET tube.
Get the crash cart in here.

484
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,052
BP's down to 56 systolic.

485
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,457
- Howard?
- Come on, come on.

486
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,224
Show me the subclavian.

487
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,597
- I'm trying. I can't get it in there.
- Damn it. I can't see anything.

488
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,260
Howard, you think you can move?

489
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,497
- Howard, swing it around.
- Two, and squeeze.

490
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,766
Check your urine output.
Where's that blood?

491
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,341
Two units, crossed and matched.

492
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,172
- Abby, you ready?
- Right there, John.

493
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,142
- Yes.
- Hold it steady.

494
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,873
One, two, three, squeeze.
One, two, three, squeeze.

495
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,480
- Got a flash. Guide wire.
- Okay.

496
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,589
Kali Richardson, medical
record number 331928.

497
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,816
Transfer another 20
per kilo, round of 400.

498
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,087
A-positive unit
number KB-579111?

499
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,992
- Good to go.
- Cordis introducer.

500
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,427
Hang it.

501
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,432
Three bolus of 400, 1200 total.

502
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,327
Okay.

503
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,131
- I'm in.
- One, two, three, squeeze.

504
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,672
- Pressure's dropping, 50.
- One, two, three, squeeze.

505
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,003
- Mix some dopamine.
- Okay, 200 into 250...

506
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,373
Will you please shut up?!

507
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,538
Squeeze. One,
two, three, squeeze.

508
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,307
One, two, three, squeeze.

509
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,313
<i>The youngest one made it
to surgery without arresting.</i>

510
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:31,685
They've started the ex-lap. Still
working on her sister in Trauma 1.

511
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,187
You okay?

512
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,057
I just called Alex. It took
everything I had not to cry.

513
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,028
He accused me of
being on my period.

514
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,633
Then maybe I am too.

515
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,996
I almost called him myself.

516
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,735
You two decide yet?

517
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,463
- About moving in?
- Don't.

518
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,541
You'll kill the romance.
They're on their best behavior...

519
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,372
and before you know it,
they're farting in the kitchen.

520
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,877
We talked about it.

521
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,243
We probably need to
talk about it some more.

522
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,213
Just so you know...

523
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,822
I'm not jealous, I'm not crazy, and I
won't be farting in the kitchen, okay?

524
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,352
Can't get her pressure above 60.

525
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,395
Must be a posterior bleed.

526
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,862
Third unit's in.

527
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,032
- Check the fourth unit.
- Howard, help Abby.

528
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,330
Give FFP after the fourth.
Up the dopamine to 10.

529
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:22,566
Okay. Kali Richardson, 331928.

530
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,539
- Nine-two-eight or 938?
- Two-eight.

531
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,235
- Show me.
- Nine-two-eight.

532
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,936
Oh, okay, good.

533
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,673
- Bradying down. Give me atropine.
- Get the ultrasound.

534
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,114
Make sure we don't miss
an intra-abdominal bleed.

535
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,584
- T as in Tom?
- T as in Tom. Next.

536
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,416
Start compressions.

537
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,956
Once more, slowly. You may
have transposed something.

538
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,254
- Hang the damn blood.
- Okay. It matches. It matches.

539
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,260
- We're in V-fib.
- Charge to 15.

540
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,559
I just didn't want her to have a reaction.
- And clear.

541
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,603
All right, young man.

542
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,969
Now, if you have to go
again, just let me know, okay?

543
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,404
- Okay.
- Feel better?

544
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,273
- Yeah.
- All right, now let's go find your mom.

545
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,609
You coming?

546
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,615
I was scared.

547
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,113
Of course you were.

548
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,287
I should've done
something to stop it.

549
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,798
Look, you're just a kid.

550
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,794
I'm the oldest.

551
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,035
You're 9.

552
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,076
Your father, he's a grown man.

553
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,645
There's only so
much you could do.

554
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,476
He was never there.

555
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,752
Who?

556
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,485
My father.

557
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,155
Clear.

558
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,687
- Still fib.
- Should have rechecked the blood.

559
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,919
Second bolus...

560
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,121
- of lidocaine's on board.
- Seventy again.

561
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,597
Should we send hemolysis labs in
case it was a transfusion reaction?

562
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,168
- That the mother?
- Yeah.

563
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,071
Clear.

564
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,973
- Seventh unit's in.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

565
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,980
Nichelle, you need
to open your eyes.

566
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,342
You need to be with
your daughter now.

567
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,486
Another round of epi.

568
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,686
Let's go 70 again.

569
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,323
Oh, God.

570
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,320
Clear.

571
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,360
- Asystole.
- Could be fine, V-fib.

572
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,528
- Kali?
- Again.

573
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,399
- Baby.
- Be careful. Don't get shocked.

574
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,318
It's all right.

575
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,715
Go ahead.

576
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,252
Kali...

577
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,400
Baby?

578
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,401
My baby...

579
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,034
No!

580
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,510
No, no, no!

581
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:29,418
Kali! Kali! Kal...

582
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,646
I was hoping to
have seen you earlier.

583
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,215
Yeah, I got caught
up in that trauma.

584
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,217
So I have good news.

585
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:58,585
Though certain members of the
committee lobbied for your dismissal...

586
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:03,923
I was able to craft a proposal
that I think will benefit all of us.

587
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,825
Really?

588
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,327
How would you feel about
accepting a non-tenure-track position...

589
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,700
as clinical instructor
here at County?

590
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,108
So after giving seven years
of my service to this hospital...

591
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,941
I lose my tenure
over a single patient.

592
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,317
Elizabeth, you broke the law.

593
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,510
What did you think
was gonna happen?

594
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,650
I don't know.

595
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,658
That, um, I might be
appreciated for saving a life.

596
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,318
That, uh...

597
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,466
- That friends might have fought for me.
- I did fight for you.

598
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,157
I had to beg,
borrow and steal...

599
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,793
just to keep them from giving
your name to the state board.

600
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,666
What the hell.

601
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,775
Let them pull my license.
Let them make it ugly.

602
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,502
I'll go public. I'll tell
anyone who cares to listen...

603
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,874
this hospital was
willing to let a man die...

604
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,279
because a bloody bill was signed
on a Tuesday rather than a Monday.

605
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,886
We did something
extraordinary here, Kerry.

606
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,618
You're right.

607
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,553
We did.

608
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,289
But that's not our purpose.

609
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,528
We can barely service the
community's basic medical needs as it is.

610
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,133
And that's it?

611
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,668
Just stay open, get
through each day?

612
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,570
Isn't that enough?

613
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,717
Howard.

614
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,512
You shouldn't have stopped me.

615
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,047
Howard, you need help.

616
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,353
There are medications
for this, therapies.

617
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,083
I'm fine.

618
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,556
I don't think you're fine.

619
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,095
I saw you double-check and triple-check
every lab form and blood unit...

620
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,893
- that went into that.
- Probably AB/O incompatibility.

621
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,935
No, listen to me. The
transfusion was fine.

622
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,571
Nobody did anything wrong.

623
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,730
Howard, we didn't
kill her. Her father did.

624
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,877
- You're not gonna get better...
- I'll go into Derm or Radiology...

625
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,570
- You're not being rational.
- I'm being thorough!

626
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,739
Why is that such a
problem for you people?

627
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,745
- Uh, what was that all about?
- Howard has OCD.

628
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,256
Please don't tell me
I just lost a doctor.

629
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,277
She would have started
kindergarten this year.

630
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,415
You all right?

631
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,850
I'm hanging in there.

632
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,557
How about you?

633
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,192
Personally or professionally?

634
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:52,329
First-year resident.

635
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,763
It's probably one and
the same at this point.

636
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,001
Today was hard.

637
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,211
I can't imagine what it
must feel like to lose a child.

638
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,079
Yeah.

639
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,614
Yeah.

640
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,818
Hey.

641
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,517
Big brother just told me he
hadn't seen Dad in a while.

642
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,720
It might be because
he died a year ago.

643
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,163
Any candidates that did
match for an internship?

644
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,329
- He seemed reasonable to me.
- Only four in the entire country?

645
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,408
A friend is taking a year off
after school to live with wolves.

646
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,704
- I can see if she's still in town.
- I'm sure if you talked to him...

647
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,849
- he would change his mind.
- And one in the Dominican Republic.

648
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,849
Can I do a phone interview? I did
talk to Howard in the parking lot...

649
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,919
but he kept locking
and unlocking his doors.

650
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,589
There's a doc in Neurology.
Says he's looking to start over.

651
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,989
- In Milwaukee? Can I get an interview?
- He's close to 60, but he's still spry.

652
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:59,859
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

653
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,364
- Did you hear?
- What?

654
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,003
Tamira died in the O.R.

655
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,240
Police went to Dad's favorite bar
and confirmed he died last year.

656
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,907
Shot to death in some holdup.

657
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,554
After that, kid says she
couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.

658
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,021
After years of abuse, she probably
didn't know what to do with herself.

659
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,456
- Any psychiatric history?
- No, but records show...

660
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,357
that her clinic had her on
Valium three times a day.

661
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,590
- On it 6 months till she ran out of money.
- How long ago was that?

662
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,894
- Last week.
- So she was hooked.

663
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,527
- We're talking benzo withdrawal.
- If she quit cold turkey...

664
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:44,938
could be psychosis, delusional
thinking, hallucinations.

665
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,369
Did the oldest kid say
what really went on?

666
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:51,107
No, and you can forget
about him talking to the cops.

667
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,252
Hey, Lockhart, EMS
coordinator called for you.

668
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,888
Sounded pretty pissed
about your ride-along.

669
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,114
Sorry.

670
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,589
- Hey, Chuny, how's she doing?
- Better.

671
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,424
- I gave her 10 of Valium, PO.
- Psychosis should start resolving.

672
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,226
Maybe now she can tell
us what really happened.

673
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,558
Only if she knows.

674
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,831
<i>Hola.</i> Dr. Guzman. <i>Sí,
buenas noches</i> to you too.

675
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,133
<i>Habla inglés?</i>

676
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,640
No? Wonderful.

677
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,781
<i>Estoy</i> Dr. Susan Lewis at
the County Hospital in Chicago.

678
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,075
How do you say "we have
an opening" in Spanish?

679
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,585
No clue, but I think that resident
you wanted to interview is here.

680
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,422
Hi, how are you?

681
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,414
Hi.

682
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,621
Nichelle, do you think you
can tell us what happened?

683
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,492
No.

684
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,328
I don't know.

685
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,329
Can you tell us where
your husband is?

686
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,167
Raymond?

687
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,948
He's dead.

688
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,457
Can you tell us how he died?

689
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,557
In a robbery.

690
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,540
You said he was trying to
break into your apartment.

691
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,306
You remember telling us that?

692
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,311
- Mama, what's wrong?
<i>- You said...</i>

693
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,889
<i>- he was trying to kill you.</i>
- No, God, the door!

694
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,923
He shot the door!

695
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,561
- Mama, let go!
- Get up!

696
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,528
We... Come on.
We just gotta leave!

697
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,929
Mama, stop it, please!

698
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,728
Go away!

699
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,098
Mama, what's wrong?

700
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,806
But he wasn't there, Nichelle.

701
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,219
What happened
to Kali and Tamira?

702
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,289
<i>We just gotta...</i>

703
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,555
<i>- We just gotta leave!
- Mama, stop it!</i>

704
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,598
- Please.
- No, we just gotta find...

705
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,861
Find a place where
he can't find you!

706
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,232
Where you'll be safe!

707
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,244
How did they get
over to that window?

708
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,722
It's the... It's the
only way! Hurry!

709
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,326
- Hurry!
- Mama, don't, please!

710
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,554
- You'll be safe!
- Mama, don't!

711
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,592
- Stop it, please!
- Saige! Saige!

712
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,403
How did they fall?

713
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,406
- Mama!
- Saige!

714
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,239
- Mama!
- You'll be safe!

715
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,176
- Go! No, go!
- No!

716
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,906
- Go! Saige, come on!
- Mama!

717
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,575
Go! Go! Go!

718
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,153
Mama, stop! Just quit it!

719
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,585
Saige!

720
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,419
Go! Go!

721
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:22,822
Saige!

722
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,519
Mama, stop!

723
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,494
<i>Saige!</i>

724
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,764
<i>Saige!</i>

725
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,331
I made them go out the...

726
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,013
I'm sorry.

727
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,679
I'm sorry, Dr. Carter...

728
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,348
Dr. Corday was looking for
you. Says she got her answer.

729
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,796
Sir, I'm afraid that's the
only cheese we have.

730
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,632
This isn't cheese.
It's orange crap.

731
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,333
- Are you almost off?
- Five, 50 and 5 make 10. Thank you.

732
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,501
Can we go get a drink
or something to eat...?

733
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,306
I still have another hour yet.

734
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,508
I work longer days than I did when I
was an intern. I did learn something new.

735
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:23,416
How to clean the hot-dog machine. Now,
there's a skill I can take wherever I go.

736
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,717
One large coffee and a
first-year resident, please.

737
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,154
- Sorry?
- Howard quit.

738
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,522
- He did? LEWIS:
Yeah, are you interested?

739
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:31,890
Neela's going through...

740
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:36,831
this delayed adolescent
rebellion/premature-midlife-crisis thing.

741
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,438
Look, I've called the NRMP. I have
scraped the bottom of the barrel.

742
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,268
I have seen or spoken with
more freaks than Dr. Phil.

743
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:48,105
I am desperate, no offense, for anyone
even remotely competent and/or sane.

744
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,381
I don't know. I mean,
I'm working now so...

745
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,220
You're right. You just keep ringing
up those pork rinds and making Icees.

746
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,082
Hey, who labeled
these jalapeños?

747
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,855
They say "mild" but I'm
burning my damn tongue off!

748
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,720
Dr. Lewis?

749
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,021
When do you need me to start?

750
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,033
Elizabeth?

751
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,904
Hi, John.

752
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,210
So did you talk to Weaver?

753
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,576
- Yes.
- What did she say?

754
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:29,210
Well, she said that there
was a place for me here.

755
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:32,824
A lesser place, but
a place nonetheless.

756
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,592
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

757
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,287
I didn't take it. I've
decided to leave.

758
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,626
There's not enough
of a future for me here.

759
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,097
Let me talk to Weaver again.

760
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,635
- We can go to the courts.
- No, it's all right. It's all right.

761
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,004
This whole
transplant situation...

762
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,939
the new staff, my
4-year-old daughter...

763
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,081
it's all helped me see
things more clearly.

764
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,483
Mark's gone.

765
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,681
So many of my friends are gone.

766
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,589
There's... There's
no reason to stay.

767
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,093
Not for me.

768
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,094
Not for Ella.

769
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,965
I suppose I've known that
for a long time now, but it's...

770
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,970
It's just...

771
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,133
hard to move on, isn't it?

772
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,806
Yeah.

773
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,082
It's hard to close that chapter.

774
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,454
Several.

775
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,365
Where are you gonna go?

776
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,464
- Home, I think, for a bit.
- Back to England?

777
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,880
Would you apologize
to everyone for me?

778
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,990
Aren't you gonna come by and
see everybody before you go?

779
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,820
I'm not much for goodbyes.

780
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,693
They make me cry, truth be told.

781
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,408
If you want me to tell
anybody anything...

782
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,175
Tell them...

783
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,574
it's been lovely.
