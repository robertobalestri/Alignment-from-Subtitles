1
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,933
Who do I gotta screw to get
some health care around here?

2
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,807
Well, honey?

3
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:19,105
Try an intern. They're
always hard up.

4
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,544
- Come on, Jeremy. I'll take you back.
- Where?

5
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,240
To see the doctor.

6
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,977
- My dad here yet?
- No. He's on his way.

7
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,951
Did I give my ticket to you?

8
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,919
Just a little longer, sir.

9
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,423
Don't make me late. My
baggage went through.

10
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,994
Right. Come on, Jeremy.

11
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,165
Eleven-year-old
boy with multiple lacs.

12
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,800
Hey, how you doing, little man?

13
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,732
TV fell on him. Kids
were home alone.

14
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,496
Okay. We'll get
to him real soon.

15
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,800
- Standard of care is primary...
- Standard of care is for rookies.

16
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,911
Get him started, Jane.
Dr. Pratt will be right there.

17
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,343
And I got a real winner for you:

18
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,482
Belly pain with
combustible breath.

19
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,619
- That creepy homeless guy?
- I don't think he's homeless.

20
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,114
How about we wait till he sobers
up? I'll be home in bed by then.

21
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,020
- He needs to be examined, Pratt.
- I'll take care of it.

22
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,821
- How long has he been here?
- Oh, about two hours.

23
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,691
He thinks he's in an airport.

24
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,296
He's altered? - A little.

25
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,991
You ask me, we need one
line for legitimate patients...

26
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,500
- another for the rest.
- Good thing nobody asked.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,004
UTI, dislocated shoulder, and rapid
hair loss all need to be signed out.

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,109
I haven't been this starved
since the last Burning Man festival.

29
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,677
- Who wants some 'za?
- You just had a burger.

30
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,041
- Fast metabolism.
- Pratt.

31
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,274
Wheezing guy was
driving insomnia lady crazy.

32
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,975
- So I moved him into Exam 3.
- Okay, beautiful.

33
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,883
Okay. Who's the lucky bastard
that gets to take my blood?

34
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,854
- I need CBC, LFTs and amylase.
- I'll do it.

35
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,722
- Is this about your needle stick?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,123
Well, you gotta do what
you gotta do, right? Heh.

37
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,054
This is Dr. Barnett from County.

38
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,058
I'll take six... No,
make that seven.

39
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:51,171
Two pepperoni, two sausage and pepper,
two Hawaiian and one with the works.

40
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,831
It's, let's see, 11:23 right now,
so we'll get that at 12:03, right?

41
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,237
All right, man. Cool.

42
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,207
Seven pies? What was that about?

43
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,212
Guaranteed delivery within
40 minutes or there's no charge.

44
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:05,182
What the guy doesn't know is Wacker's
closed and The Loop is a parking lot.

45
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,587
There is such a
thing as a free lunch.

46
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,848
Luka, belly-pain
guy's going down.

47
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,425
Somebody bring a gurney.

48
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,258
Sir? Open your eyes, sir.

49
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,094
Hey, doctor. No way.
Uh-uh. I was here before him.

50
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,100
Vitals were normal
when I triaged him.

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,761
That nurse told me I was next!

52
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,735
Diaphoretic. Carotid's
weak and thready.

53
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,933
- Seventy systolic.
- Is that what it takes?

54
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,374
Flopping around on
the floor like I'm dying?

55
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,514
Yeah, don't push me! Watch me!

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,445
- Hey! Watch! Okay, here we go!
- Get him on O2 right away.

57
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,448
Hey! Look at me!

58
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,610
- Look! See me?
- My bag.

59
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,619
My bag. I want my bag.
- I got it!

60
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,781
Start the EKG in
case he's having an MI.

61
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,220
What about me, huh?

62
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,759
I might have an MI too!

63
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,721
- Any history of hepatitis?
- Huh?

64
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,364
Abby, can you give us a hand?

65
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,796
- What about my blood draw?
- I'll write you a note.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,094
- What are you doing?
- Get a 12-lead going.

67
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,794
- Where am I?
- Sam, got the IV?

68
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,370
- What are you doing?
- Okay.

69
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,873
- Hey, Pratt, can you spare Jane?
- Definitely.

70
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,042
Document everything
we do and the time.

71
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,114
- Isn't that usually a nurse's job?
- There's a nurses' shortage.

72
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,512
- Haven't you heard?
- What are you doing? Stop!

73
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,911
I may not know what to write.
- I'll tell you.

74
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,555
Start with two
liters of O2 at 11:25.

75
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,816
- Pulse ox, 98.
- Ow.

76
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,324
That's my bag. Give
me my bag back.

77
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,793
- I'll give you your bag back...
- Get your hands off of me!

78
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,489
- Calm down.
- Knock it off!

79
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,497
Okay? We're here to help you.

80
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,102
We can try the nice way
or we can try other options.

81
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,133
- This is how you help?
- Yeah, that's right, sir.

82
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,400
JVD is 10 centimeters.

83
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,407
The EEG is printing.

84
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,808
- Chart it.
- Eleven twenty-six.

85
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,642
Got your line. What
do you want sent?

86
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,343
- Abby?
- CBC, Chem-20, PT/PTT...

87
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,783
troponin, type and hold.

88
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,320
And add a serum ammonia.

89
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,481
EKG looks good. There's
no ischemic changes.

90
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,286
- Mm-hm.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

91
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,053
Hey. Hey!

92
00:04:55,595 --> 00:05:00,192
Hey. My name is
Charlie Metcalf, okay?

93
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,203
- Okay?
- Okay.

94
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,369
- Okay?
- Okay.

95
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,309
Ouch! Don't! PRATT: Okay.

96
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,970
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

97
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,207
- Dr. Kovac.
- Okay, let's get him gowned.

98
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:20,479
We need you to work with us,
Mr. Metcalf. This will be much easier.

99
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,655
- What's the trouble?
- Possible extensive tendon lac.

100
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,591
Okay. Can you move
your toes up and down?

101
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,497
- How did that happen?
- My sister pulled the television down.

102
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,295
It was an accident.

103
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,959
I guess it's true then, huh?

104
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,163
TV really is bad for kids.

105
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,132
- Where were your parents?
- My dad was at work.

106
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,642
- Babysitter?
- We can't afford one.

107
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,074
I watch after Steffie.

108
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,238
Can't afford a babysitter
but they got a TV.

109
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,543
Luka? KOVAC:
Somebody call the dad?

110
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,345
The neighbor who brought him in.

111
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,250
Get him cleaned up
and send for x-rays.

112
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,754
We have three TVs.

113
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,855
- That IV making you feel better?
- Yeah. Yeah, look.

114
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,553
Before... I'm sorry.

115
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,450
- I just was getting a little...
- Shh, shh.

116
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,726
Eleven twenty-seven,
300 cc bolus is in.

117
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,096
Pulse down to 110.

118
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,567
No murmur, rubs or gallops.

119
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,002
Multiple spider angiomas
on the chest wall.

120
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,402
Watch my stomach. Watch...

121
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,210
- Have you seen a doctor lately?
- Um, it's been a couple of years.

122
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,713
- Do you have a primary-care physician?
- No. Not at the present time.

123
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,283
- I need a 5-0 nylon.
- Oh.

124
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,851
Over there.

125
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,222
Who were you seeing
a couple of years ago?

126
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,552
I don't remember the guy's
name. Some doctor in Taylorville.

127
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,254
Taylorville?

128
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,191
- You live there?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,093
- There's a prison there, right?
- Yeah.

130
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,894
It's a correctional facility.
What's the big deal?

131
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,162
I knew somebody who spent time there.
- Yeah, small world.

132
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,733
Positive fluid
wave. Liver is small.

133
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,933
- Ascites?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,304
What's that?

135
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,673
It means you have
fluid in your belly.

136
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,981
So, what were you in for?
- A mistake.

137
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,650
What you mean?
You weren't framed?

138
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,080
Spleen's enlarged.

139
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:03,981
Chart a BP, 100/70 at 11:28.
KOVAC: Caput medusae.

140
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,182
What kind of mistake?

141
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,988
I killed a guy.

142
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,627
Palmar erythema
and muscle atrophy.

143
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,827
- Oh, yeah? For what?
- For asking too many damn questions.

144
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,493
HemoCue is 7.2. KOVAC: Yeah.

145
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,831
- My dad here yet?
- No, not yet.

146
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,010
- Hey, kid.
- Don't look at him. Just look this way.

147
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,140
- Hey, pally.
- Don't worry about him.

148
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,646
- Mr. Metcalf.
- What?

149
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:33,412
Mr. Metcalf, you're very anemic and
you could be losing blood from an ulcer.

150
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,815
You a drinker?

151
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,354
Yeah.

152
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,185
- Drinking in jail?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,156
Not gonna rat me
to my parole board?

154
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,353
Important we know
what you've been taking.

155
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,799
Pruno. Breakfast of felons.

156
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,368
Now I drink wine, beer, I don't
know, anything I can get my hands on.

157
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,101
- Pruno?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,637
It's fruit...

159
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,500
Fruit and bread
from the cafeteria.

160
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,873
You put it in a garbage bag with
toilet water and then you let it ferment.

161
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,240
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

162
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,382
- Ferment where?
- Under the bed.

163
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,542
You strain it through your
socks and then you're ready to go.

164
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,880
If you're desperate,
it tastes like a martini.

165
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,317
Oh, yeah?

166
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,981
Yeah. You don't know
what it's like to need a drink.

167
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,058
I can imagine. METCALF: Yeah.

168
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,355
To check for blood loss, we're
gonna have to do a rectal exam.

169
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,396
A what? No, no, no.

170
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,229
I spent the last nine
years avoiding rectals. No.

171
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,303
It's the only way
for me to know...

172
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,030
You gonna stick
your finger up my ass?

173
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,574
- My gloved and lubricated finger, yeah.
- No. No.

174
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,575
It's smaller than your
bowel movements.

175
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,339
Listen, boss. Exit
only, you understand?

176
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,911
Exit only.

177
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,712
If you're bleeding internally,
it could be life-threatening.

178
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,220
Okay, fine.

179
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,919
Can I...? Maybe we can
cover me up or something? Ow!

180
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,394
- I don't want it!
- Hey, would I hurt you?

181
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,055
No! I don't want it!

182
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,724
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

183
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,597
I want my dad. - Don't worry.

184
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,363
- Where's my dad?
- Look at me. I'm not gonna hurt you.

185
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,098
I want my dad!

186
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,243
- I don't wanna get a shot. PRATT:
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

187
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,039
Pally?

188
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,314
- What's your name?
- Jeremy.

189
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,788
Jeremy, you know, the way
I see it, doctors are mean.

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,725
They wanna make us
cry. But you know what?

191
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,731
If you don't, I won't.
What do you say?

192
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,728
Let's show them.
Let's both not cry.

193
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,703
Okay, kid?

194
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,609
Okay, Jeremy.

195
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,642
It's okay. It's okay.

196
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,839
It's all right. See?

197
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,317
That's it. Don't worry.

198
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,285
It's okay. There it is.

199
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,788
Good job. That's it.

200
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,119
See? Hey, that
wasn't bad, was it?

201
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,893
We have to put a
tube down your nose...

202
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,000
into your stomach to figure
out what's causing the bleeding.

203
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,433
No, the docs in the joint gave
me one of those for my pancreatitis.

204
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,630
We're gonna numb it
up so it won't be so bad.

205
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,833
We won't keep the tube in any
longer than necessary, okay?

206
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,671
Sit him up.

207
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,512
Ohh.

208
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,673
- You know I used to be an artist?
- Open.

209
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,152
Pressure's up to 110/76.

210
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,348
- What kind of artist?
- I did some painting.

211
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,392
A mural for my wife's church.

212
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,597
You know, mostly I earned
my living as a contractor...

213
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,030
a carpenter, that sort of
thing. Fixing old places up.

214
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,295
Y'all could use my
help around here.

215
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,167
If you swallow it while we
pass it, it will go down easier.

216
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,968
All right, all right, all right.

217
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,208
Okay.

218
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,811
It's going down.

219
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,179
Keep swallowing. It's
going down. That's good.

220
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,911
Very good.

221
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,652
All set. Relax.

222
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,487
Okay. Hook it up to low suction.

223
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,061
I was mixed up before.

224
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,891
I get confused in my head.

225
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,192
But I'm better now.

226
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,700
Like you think
you're going on a trip?

227
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,670
In the waiting room, you kept
asking me what time your flight was.

228
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,672
Sometimes it's a train or a bus.

229
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,674
Sometimes it's a boat.

230
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,678
One time I was getting
ready to parachute.

231
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,679
Is that what the
suitcase is all about?

232
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,249
No, I always have that.

233
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,249
You leave anything at the flop, it
won't be there when you get back.

234
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,921
Those scumbags steal it.

235
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,957
NG output is one liter at 11:32.

236
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,828
Looks too dark for an ulcer.

237
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,892
- Varices?
- What's that?

238
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,557
That's when the elevated
pressure in your liver backs up.

239
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,266
The veins of the esophagus
become engorged...

240
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,701
and can bleed a lot.
Sometimes uncontrollably.

241
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,541
Emesis basin.

242
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,607
You made me worse.

243
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,977
- Get it out of me.
- No, no.

244
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,958
- That has to stay in.
- Get it out of me!

245
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,457
Okay, soft restraints!

246
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,789
- Get the tube out.
- Pressure's dropping, 82/66.

247
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,397
- Tachy at 130.
- Two units of type-specific.

248
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,966
- And call GI down here now!
- He needs a room.

249
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,466
No, no, no. Don't, don't.

250
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:17,899
Trauma 1 is open.

251
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,597
Okay, Mr. Metcalf, is there
anyone we can call for you?

252
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,469
- You mentioned you had a wife.
- No.

253
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,134
- Children? Siblings or anyone?
- Nobody that will come.

254
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,473
Let's get him to X-ray.
You stay with him, okay?

255
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,582
- I'll see you in an hour.
- Pratt, with us.

256
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,479
Make it four
units, type-specific.

257
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,916
Take too long. Get
O-neg out of the cooler.

258
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,819
Get these off me. Don't tie me
down. You can't keep tying me down!

259
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,652
Let's go. Prime
the rapid infuser.

260
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,906
Subclavian on the right?
- Prep the chest.

261
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,990
Let's go. Prime the rapid infuser.
- Subclavian on the right?

262
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,157
- Okay, prepping the chest.
- O-neg here.

263
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,270
Squeeze in the first unit.
Sam, second on the infuser.

264
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,429
- Pratt...
- Push the octreotide.

265
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,075
- Been paying attention, huh?
- Need me to do something?

266
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,074
Yes. Cycle the
dynamap when it's ready.

267
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,180
A little Sandostatin's not gonna
make his chances any better.

268
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,010
- It will diminish blood flow.
- But what's the point?

269
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,018
- The odds of him making it are what?
- Another 200 cc's out the NG tube.

270
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,247
He's that sick even
though he was just lucid?

271
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,415
He's on the edge.
All he needs is a push.

272
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,618
You know what? We
got a lot of hands in here.

273
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,672
- You don't wanna help...
- You're an Attending now?

274
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:19,097
No one wants to be a nurse anymore?
- Pratt, come on.

275
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,961
- Prick.
- That's enough!

276
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,636
- Heart rate's up to 140.
- Is he taking any meds?

277
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,136
Check his bag. He said
all his stuff was in there.

278
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,571
- First unit's up.
- Eleven thirty-five.

279
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:33,372
- Pushing 50 mics of octreotide.
- All right.

280
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,538
Guide wire's passing.

281
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,308
Yo, hair of the dog.

282
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,078
- A hundred and fifty-one proof.
- This guy's a class act.

283
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,813
- Ready with your extension tubing.
- What's your problem?

284
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,925
We're killing ourselves for
a non-compliant, alcoholic...

285
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,756
- ex-con with end-stage liver failure.
- You wanna get out? Get out.

286
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,725
You know what? It's Friday.

287
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,337
I don't do lost causes on
Friday. It's a religious thing.

288
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,497
Second unit's going in.

289
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,007
Anything else in that bag
we need to know about?

290
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,647
No, but there's a picture. It looks
like him and his wife and a kid.

291
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,784
Here's a bunch
of letters, a journal.

292
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,743
Pressure's 98/62 at 11:37.

293
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,287
And I don't know,
some kind of painting.

294
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,448
- Where's my passport?
- Where's your what?

295
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,990
Give me my passport.

296
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,095
- I can't go without my shoes.
- Go where, Mr...? Ho, ho. ho.

297
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,928
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Okay.

298
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,862
- Head up to 20 degrees.
- Let me go.

299
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,195
- And check on GI again.
- Let me go. Thank you.

300
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,634
- I'll be right back.
- Get them off. Get them off.

301
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,865
Do you have a problem with me?

302
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,809
- No.
- With Sam?

303
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:44,109
- I was out of line.
- Okay. Let's go.

304
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:48,948
The guy's a waste, dying from
something that he's doing to himself.

305
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,318
Last time I checked,
alcoholism was a disease.

306
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,859
So was suicide. He should
catch that and save us the trouble.

307
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,989
- We get ones like this every day.
- Then maybe I need a day off.

308
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,834
- It's personal?
- I guess.

309
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,666
Good. Then we don't
have to talk about it.

310
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,668
- You like riding me?
- I don't think I do.

311
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,813
No. Ever since I was an
intern, you've been on my back.

312
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,539
- Maybe a couple of times.
- Why?

313
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,912
You're good, Pratt. But I
think you could be better.

314
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,057
There's a number
you wrote with a name.

315
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,196
Bobby? Should we
call him, Charlie?

316
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:34,391
No. No. Don't call him, please.
I don't want anybody to call him.

317
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,433
- Okay.
- Okay? You understand? No calling.

318
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,867
- I don't want to see him.
- GI's on their way.

319
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,772
Mr. Metcalf, the veins at the end of
your esophagus are bleeding a lot.

320
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,538
This is a result
of your cirrhosis.

321
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:52,515
That also means you have less
than a 50-percent chance of surviving.

322
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,225
Less than surviving for
how long? A few months?

323
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,919
"Months" months? What...? What?

324
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,563
Not that long.

325
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,531
What we need to know is, if you
stop breathing or your heart gives out...

326
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,535
do you want us to
use heroic measures?

327
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,702
Do heroic what?

328
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,972
Do you want us to do
CPR, shock your heart...

329
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,208
- or put you on a breathing machine?
- Wait, wait, wait.

330
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,716
You're saying now?

331
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:30,152
You're... You're saying
now? You mean, like, today?

332
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,260
No, no, no. Look, no. I have
a lot of things that I have to do.

333
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,489
- Okay.
- I'm just not ready. I'm not ready.

334
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,759
- I'm...
- Okay. Okay. The man wants it all.

335
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,365
Okay.

336
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,174
I'm Adler from GI. How bad? Hmm?

337
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,410
About two and a
half liters of output.

338
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,675
Pre-load the scope with
a Saeed Six-Shooter.

339
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,113
What? What's a Six-Shooter?

340
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,311
We're going to look
down your esophagus...

341
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,082
and try to bend the
veins to stop the bleeding.

342
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,522
- What's the deal with your suction?
- Turn it up.

343
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,923
- I did. SAM:
Nothing's coming out.

344
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,375
- Great. KOVAC:
Check in 2, Abby.

345
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,499
Jane, get on the
phone about a portable.

346
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,100
- You guys have suction in here?
- Last time I checked.

347
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,930
- What time is it?
- Eleven forty. Why?

348
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,969
They got 23 minutes
or we eat for free.

349
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,972
- Hey, is your patient stable?
- Smoke inhalation with wheezing.

350
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,474
- Okay. We need the room.
- You into pepperoni, Abby?

351
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,614
- You have ADD? Come on, let's go.
- Give us two minutes to finish.

352
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,807
- We need it now. We're good here.
- The guy just needs to be tubed.

353
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,112
- This guy might need to be pronounced.
- Hope you're not a veggie...

354
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,779
- because I got meat on everything.
- See you later.

355
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,819
- Cetacaine and bite block.
- Little more numbing spray, Charlie?

356
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,520
Okay, push two of Versed.

357
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,961
All right, Charlie.

358
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,796
Once we're ready to start
you're gonna have to keep this...

359
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:53,235
between your teeth. It stops you
from biting the fiber-optic scope.

360
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,374
- Check the monitor.
- Is this Bobby?

361
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,876
- Charlie? Is that your son?
- Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,471
- And your wife?
- Uh-huh. Evelyn.

363
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,015
Pretty. You want me to call her?

364
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,819
No. No. She's gone.
It's been a long time.

365
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,515
Well, what about Bobby? He
must be all grown-up by now.

366
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,254
Yeah. He's 19. He's gonna be
20 next month. He's in college.

367
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,363
Well, let's try to
reach him, okay?

368
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,895
Heh. I haven't talked to
him since he was little.

369
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:25,436
His aunt gave me that number
when I got out of prison, but I...

370
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,268
Well, that's all the more
reason to use it now.

371
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,045
Let's pull the NG.

372
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,977
Okay, Charlie. Here we go.

373
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,292
- How's pressure?
- 108/58.

374
00:18:55,501 --> 00:19:00,201
Okay, ready to go. SAM: Hi.
I'm looking for Bobby Metcalf.

375
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,938
Okay. Yeah. You know what? Can
you actually wake him up for me?

376
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,652
Hi, Bobby? My name
is Samantha Taggart.

377
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,948
I'm a nurse at the County
General in Chicago.

378
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,319
- Grade-two varices?
- Grade three.

379
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,393
Yeah. We have
your father here and...

380
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,120
Yeah. And he's pretty sick.

381
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,889
Four columns, two hemorrhagic.

382
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:29,593
Two bands at each bleeding
site, one at the others.

383
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,297
No... He's out. Well,
he's out of jail, yeah...

384
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:37,842
I don't know. For a while, I think.
- Systolic's down to 90.

385
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,343
Is there any way you can
come here and be with him?

386
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:44,039
Probably the Versed.
Five-hundred cc saline bolus.

387
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,684
No. You know what? He can't talk
right now because he's in a procedure.

388
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,480
Sucking the varix into the cap.

389
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,759
Wait... Okay, hold on.

390
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,757
He wants to talk to you.

391
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,127
Sorry, that needs to stay in.

392
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,468
And...

393
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,001
firing.

394
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:13,936
Mm. Okay, let's talk.

395
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,843
Okay, guys. I'm gonna put Mr. Metcalf's
son on the phone for a minute, okay?

396
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,131
Bobby?

397
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:38,127
<i>- Dad? Is it you?</i>
- Yeah.

398
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,636
- It's me.
<i>- So you're sick, huh? You dying?</i>

399
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,245
- No, no, no.
<i>- Nurse, is he dying?</i>

400
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,644
He's very sick.

401
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,609
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

402
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,248
<i>Huh, Dad?</i>

403
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,720
<i>It's been a long time.
So many things I...</i>

404
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:05,194
- Yeah.
<i>- I don't know. I...</i>

405
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,369
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>
- Yeah?

406
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,604
<i>Nice knowing you.</i>

407
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,161
I told you, you
shouldn't call him.

408
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,302
Firing. Good.
Turn up my suction.

409
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,637
- Can you band it?
- Not if I can't see it.

410
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,069
Mr. Metcalf?

411
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,908
- BP 68/32.
- Mr. Metcalf?

412
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,050
I can't even feel a pulse.
- Bobby.

413
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,781
Bobby.

414
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,815
- Bobby! PRATT:
He's bleeding out.

415
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,551
Okay, turn him over.

416
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,889
Another two units on
the infuser. Ambu-bag.

417
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,390
Come on in. The water's warm.

418
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,901
Try the femoral. ABBY:
Get another four units here.

419
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,266
FFP after these two.

420
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,073
Hey. Hey, you
dumb son of a bitch.

421
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,904
Hey, you dumb son of a bitch.

422
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,391
Thought we lost you
there for a second.

423
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:46,290
- Bobby?
- We had him on the phone.

424
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,696
Is he coming?

425
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,704
No. No, he's not coming, man.

426
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,403
BP's 86/42 at 11:44.

427
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,736
Want the FFP?

428
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,606
Yeah. Another
unit of packed cells.

429
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,041
Dr. Kovac.

430
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,619
How long have you been out
of touch with him? Your son?

431
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,955
A long time. Since
I went to prison.

432
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,566
Well, even in prison,
he's still your kid.

433
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,364
Blood's here.

434
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,738
You don't know what it's like.

435
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,637
If I had a kid, I'd do everything
I could to stay with him.

436
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,573
Need a Linton tube, a
Kelly, and a 60-cc syringe.

437
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,980
You think you
know, but you don't.

438
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,845
How it could all switch on you.

439
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,125
Life could turn on a dime.

440
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,653
Gets broke and you can't...

441
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,957
You can't see a way to fix it.

442
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:57,934
Mr. Metcalf, the specialist thinks we
can't control the bleeding with the scope.

443
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,766
So you want a Linton tube?
- What?

444
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,399
We pass a large
balloon into your stomach.

445
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,808
So it helps us keep
pressure on your veins.

446
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,173
All right. What's there to lose?

447
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,016
I'll test the balloon.

448
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:20,826
It was April 10th, 1992.

449
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,525
When Bobby was turning 8.

450
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,096
My wife asked me to go
get some stuff for the party.

451
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:36,598
But I stayed so I could finish
putting together this robot for him.

452
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,209
You know, so I made her go.

453
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,810
From the street I hear a thud.

454
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,210
This scream.

455
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,054
And I go to the
window to look out.

456
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:56,953
And she's lying there like
she's asleep on the street.

457
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,030
And ice-cream cake...

458
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,396
Ice-cream cake was all
around her on the pavement.

459
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,230
Five syringes.

460
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:10,068
So there I am. There I am
with this little boy to raise.

461
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,370
And what do I do?

462
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,680
I start drinking.

463
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,076
I get high.

464
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,749
I can't keep it together.

465
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,753
I can't keep it together.

466
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,095
Then I stab some guy at a bar.

467
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:37,168
Just for... Just for nothing.

468
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,273
For nothing. Because
he looked at me wrong.

469
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,937
This one's good.

470
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,273
We can go up to
750 for hemostasis.

471
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,681
Okay. Ready, Mr. Metcalf?

472
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,615
Uh...

473
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:16,098
Oh, oh. KOVAC: Where
was your son after that?

474
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,868
With my wife's folks.

475
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,137
Listen for bowel sounds.

476
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,649
At first they would bring
him by on visiting days...

477
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,554
but after a while that stopped.

478
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,815
Then the letters started
coming back unopened.

479
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:35,893
You know what? I don't feel
good. Something's wrong.

480
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,461
Something's wrong.

481
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,996
BUN, 74. Creatinine, 8.2.

482
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,634
Okay. Call Renal
and throw in a Foley.

483
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,667
Hey. We should think about TIPS.

484
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,805
What's that?

485
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,431
TIPS stands for Transjugular
Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt.

486
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,578
It... Uh...

487
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,838
We put a catheter from
your neck to your belly.

488
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:59,576
By bridging the two vessels, we bypass
the liver and slow down the bleeding.

489
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,846
- How much time would that give me?
- It's hard to say.

490
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,051
- No urine output. ABBY:
Hepatorenal syndrome.

491
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,355
- Your kidneys are not working.
- He needs dialysis.

492
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,590
I'll make the call.

493
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,860
Okay. GSW to the belly.
- Not here, Chuny.

494
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,469
There's nowhere else. - Okay.

495
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,833
Move him over and keep
traction on the Linton.

496
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,872
Hold on. Okay, go ahead.

497
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,203
Okay, let's transfer
him. One, two, three.

498
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,212
No meds, no allergies,
no past history.

499
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,282
NG, Foley, and a portable chest.

500
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,545
- Bastard shot me for stealing my spliff.
- I need another nurse.

501
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,383
Said it was his, but it was
mine. Rolled it this morning.

502
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,785
- What's going on?
- They need to stabilize him.

503
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,553
I want my own damn room!
Get the hell out of here, man.

504
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,857
- Screw you, jerk-off. KOVAC:
Okay. Doctors only talking now.

505
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,192
Damn, that's hard.

506
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:51,963
Even a gunshot in the belly
don't buy a man some privacy. Ow!

507
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,073
Okay. Two grams of
cefoxitin, IV piggyback.

508
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,176
It's a house we
rented one summer.

509
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,908
There's a lake nearby. I
took Bobby fishing there.

510
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,310
Periumbilical GSW
with intestinal prolapse.

511
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:08,147
- What about the on-deck batter?
- We're waiting for a TIPS and IR.

512
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,653
That sounds bad. Let's
get him up for an ex-lap.

513
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,085
Portable monitor. Let's go.

514
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,249
- What about x-rays?
- Get them upstairs.

515
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,486
T minus 11 minutes
on those pizzas.

516
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:22,259
IR's already on the
floor. Renal's on the way.

517
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,994
Luka, he's getting tremulous.

518
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,870
I haven't had a
drink since last night.

519
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,010
- It's alcohol withdrawal.
- Dr. Pratt?

520
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,645
- Yeah, that would be me.
- Hey. Ramirez, Nephrology.

521
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,611
- Who's this guy? RAMIREZ:
We'll need central access.

522
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,614
He's got a subclavian. - Great.

523
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,118
- Let's consent him and start the run.
- What? What is he talking about?

524
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,552
He's here for the
dialysis that we discussed.

525
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,954
I never discussed it.

526
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,061
You discussed it. I
never discussed it.

527
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,063
- Alfonso, how are you?
- Is this a TIPS patient?

528
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,666
Yeah. And we should go first.

529
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,295
- What are you talking about?
- That's what's gonna prolong his life.

530
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,304
Without the dialysis he'll bleed
out the minute you spike his liver.

531
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,806
What? What...? Spike my liver?

532
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,878
Will his pressure even tolerate
dialysis if the varices bleed?

533
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,742
- I don't understand. What...?
- I can support his pressure.

534
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,816
The Linton is
supporting his pressure.

535
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,919
- What are you talking about?
- Dr. Kovac?

536
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,317
Well, he's gonna need
dialysis three times a week.

537
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,253
- Oh, yeah. For the rest of his life.
- TIPS is not a cure.

538
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,656
- It's a bridge to a liver transplant.
- We know that's not gonna happen.

539
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:26,196
Hey, hey, hey. I'm right here.

540
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,431
- Yeah.
- Talk to me.

541
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,297
Sorry.

542
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,600
Now, you can't fix my kidneys?

543
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,342
You're gonna need
dialysis three times a week.

544
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,445
And what about my liver
problem and the bleeding?

545
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,850
- The TIPS is a temporary measure.
- Your best hope is for a liver transplant.

546
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:53,959
I don't understand.
What are the odds of that?

547
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,622
Based on your history
of drinking, not good.

548
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,127
Is there any chance that I'm
gonna be walking out of here?

549
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,035
With the dialysis
and the TIPS...

550
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,264
I mean, today.

551
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,376
What are the chances that I'm
gonna walk out of here today?

552
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,670
None.

553
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,786
I don't want it.

554
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,825
I don't want anything, then.

555
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:34,025
If you don't have the TIPS
procedure, we can't control the bleeding.

556
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,498
- You'll die.
- Yeah, I get it. I get it.

557
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,298
Just stop everything.

558
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,688
- No blood transfusions? No breathing...?
- No, it's over.

559
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,072
No CPR? METCALF: No.

560
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,144
I need it to be
very clear, Charlie.

561
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:52,148
If we don't continue with the treatment,
do you understand what could happen?

562
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,082
Yeah.

563
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,415
Yeah.

564
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,798
Okay. Mr. Metcalf is a DNR.

565
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,172
Eleven fifty-seven.

566
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,170
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

567
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,108
Hey, hey, he's not
competent. Come on.

568
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,214
That's what he wants, Pratt.

569
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,317
Can you...?

570
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,318
Can you do something for this?

571
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,447
Hey, could we put
him on an alcohol drip?

572
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,089
- You're gonna get me drunk?
- Just enough to stop tremors, Charlie.

573
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,026
Charlie, let us do the procedure.
You don't have to do this.

574
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,627
Call...

575
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,093
Try Bobby again.

576
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,372
Try my boy. Get
him on the phone.

577
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:50,206
If he knows it's
really over, he'll come.

578
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,707
Okay? He'll come.

579
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,140
Okay.

580
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,186
Hey, Bobby Metcalf?

581
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,327
Oh, yeah. It's the
hospital calling again.

582
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,998
Yeah. Do you think
you could do that?

583
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,192
Okay. Thank you.

584
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,835
- What happened?
- He went to class.

585
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,998
His roommate's gonna
see if he can find him.

586
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,277
Can you take this
out? It's uncomfortable.

587
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,677
- The tube's keeping you alive.
- It's uncomfortable. Please.

588
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,516
Okay.

589
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,452
Is there...? Is there a window?

590
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,682
Can you open a window and get
some fresh air in here? Please?

591
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,688
Sam. METCALF: Please.

592
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,698
All right. Here we go.

593
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,486
- What is that? Lincoln Street?
- Harrison.

594
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,723
I've worked here over a year.
Never thought about what was outside.

595
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,733
I worked here for six.

596
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,931
Uh... Oh.

597
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,900
It's from the tube. I'll take care of it.
Ten percent ethanol at 100 cc's an hour.

598
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,345
You know, your booze works fast.

599
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,109
Mad Dog IV, just for you.

600
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,752
All this stuff, you know...

601
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,122
it's just blinders.

602
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,086
It's just a screen.

603
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,486
I don't want anything separating
me from what's happening.

604
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,197
I'm not gonna run
and hide from this.

605
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,169
Pulse ox and
dynamap can come off.

606
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,738
Last sats, 92.

607
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:12,050
My brother Lou died
when we were kids.

608
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,393
My mom, she said...

609
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,530
Ohh...

610
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:38,273
She said, "Charlie, Lou's
gone away on a long trip."

611
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,148
Don't you just leave me here.

612
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:49,482
I wanna see a doctor now.

613
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,826
<i>Last sats, 92.</i>

614
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,432
When is my turn, huh?

615
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,826
When is it going
to be my turn, huh?

616
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,997
People? When is it?

617
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,839
When is my turn?

618
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,945
<i>Pulse, 104.</i>

619
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,183
<i>Resps, 18.</i>

620
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,951
<i>Temp, 98.2.</i>

621
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,548
<i>Ninety-two.</i>

622
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,514
<i>91/60.</i>

623
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,953
<i>One-oh-four.</i>

624
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,461
One-seventy. Ninety-one.

625
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,225
- What are you saying?
- It's your vitals.

626
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,203
- Is it starting?
- What, Charlie?

627
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,376
Am I going?

628
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,744
It's starting.

629
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,713
Don't you people have a system?

630
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,978
Isn't there any method at all?

631
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,585
Don't worry. You won't be alone.

632
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,887
Good. That's good.

633
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,887
Someone will stay with you.

634
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,728
Sam, you get this?

635
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,809
Could you touch me?

636
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,675
Sorry?

637
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,147
My face?

638
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,945
Please?

639
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,345
Uh...

640
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,822
Maybe we should anchor.

641
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,827
- What?
- Do you think we should keep going?

642
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,988
I don't know, Charlie.

643
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,632
Well, what about him?

644
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,791
What do you think he wants?

645
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,166
I don't know. I
don't think he knows.

646
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,734
Is it too late?

647
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,340
Not if you don't
want it to be, Charlie.

648
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,511
Watch it!

649
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,327
Oh, no. Oh, no.

650
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,456
Oh, no.

651
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,602
I feel drunk again.

652
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,172
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

653
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,373
Sure.

654
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,535
Okay, Mr. Metcalf. We're
gonna keep a heart monitor on...

655
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:03,546
- and the alcohol drip for comfort.
- Okay.

656
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,684
I wanna take you off
the octreotide now...

657
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,183
which is the last
support measure.

658
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,981
Okay.

659
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,586
- Shouldn't be long now.
- Okay.

660
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,194
I never believed in God.

661
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,369
That might bite me
in the ass now, huh?

662
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,703
God will get over it.

663
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,910
Do you need this?

664
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,911
- Can I take it?
- Take it.

665
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,572
Take it.

666
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,287
What?

667
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:22,118
- What can I take?
- No, never mind. Never mind.

668
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,094
What's it gonna be like there?

669
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,994
Peaceful.

670
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,442
<i>No.</i>

671
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,783
- Come back.
- Charlie.

672
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,353
Charlie.

673
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,092
Get all my stuff?

674
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,956
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

675
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,596
Make sure he gets it.

676
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,231
I will.

677
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,639
And give this to him.

678
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,345
You never knew your dad.

679
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,050
No.

680
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,994
That's too bad.

681
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,893
I don't let it bother me.

682
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,205
I bet it bothers him.

683
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,375
Bobby.

684
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,247
Let me in.

685
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,196
<i>Open up.</i>

686
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,126
Open up.

687
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,734
Let me in.

688
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,437
<i>Charlie, can you hear me?</i>

689
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,589
Charlie, can you hear me?

690
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,761
Hey, pally.

691
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,466
You made it.

692
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,102
How do I look?

693
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,366
You look okay.

694
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:29,612
I'm so sorry.

695
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,386
I'm so sorry.

696
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,065
Don't think about that.

697
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,859
Okay?

698
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,900
Just take it easy.

699
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:59,133
It's okay, son.

700
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,143
It's...

701
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,020
Um...

702
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,991
Twelve-oh-four.

703
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,199
I'll take that.

704
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:10,882
Can someone just tell me that?

705
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,812
How much longer?

706
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,783
Ma'am, you need to
wait in the room. Let's go.

707
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:19,048
It's about time. Been with the
same patient for almost 45 minutes.

708
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,556
Whatever happened to
"treat them and street them"?

709
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,160
Do as I say, not as I do.

710
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,330
All right. The TV
kid's back from X-ray.

711
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,727
He's in Triage with
his dad and his sister.

712
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,800
Things go south?

713
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,100
He was a nice guy.

714
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,262
Just a drunk.

715
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,498
There's pizzas over
here if you get hungry.

716
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,870
Got you one with anchovies.

717
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,907
Oh, and the delivery guy got here
at 12:04. You know what that means?

718
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,673
It means he didn't
make it on time.

719
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,613
Means lunch is on
the house, my friend.

720
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,186
Hey, Jeremy, little man.

721
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:57,259
Back so soon?

722
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:02,023
Hello, I'm Dr. Pratt.

723
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,760
I'm the one who
treated your son.
