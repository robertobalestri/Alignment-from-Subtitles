1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,402
I'm being deployed to Iraq.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,641
So how long have you
got? On your tour of duty?

4
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,446
Year at least.

5
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,159
You heard from Gallant?

6
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,028
We exchanged some e-mails
but he was having some trouble...

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,432
- with the Internet at his CASH unit.
- He okay?

8
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,936
You know Michael.
He's not one to complain.

9
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,507
- Tell him we're thinking about him.
- Sure.

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,345
Another bad guy saved, huh?

11
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,852
Now he'll have to survive
the hospital in Karbala.

12
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,120
Need me to redress that?

13
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,392
Thanks, I'll get it.

14
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,465
- Dude.
- I'm sorry.

15
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:16,135
- Hey, Dr. Neela.
- Hey, Bret.

16
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,074
- Girlfriend kick you out again?
- Ooh. Good one.

17
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,147
No, we broke up.

18
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,216
I burnt this mix for you. You
said you didn't know the blues...

19
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,751
- and that's, like, a crime.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,056
It's all yours, man.

21
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,793
Check it out. It's cool.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,459
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,602
I'm used to finding random
rockers passed out in our living room.

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,067
Bret's cool, okay?
He's a good guy.

25
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,332
- You should get to know him a little.
- No, thanks.

26
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:51,000
- Well, you might like him.
- Does he have a job?

27
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,103
Well, I think he likes you.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,943
And I know how hard it is to
meet new people in the city.

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,415
Especially during
the winterti...

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,016
I guess I'm gonna shut up now.

31
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,187
<i>Dear Michael, it's been
months since I've heard from you.</i>

32
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,763
<i>I've been reading the paper...</i>

33
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,958
<i>watching the news.
It's hard not to worry.</i>

34
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,763
<i>But I'm sure you're
taking care of yourself.</i>

35
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,166
<i>Sorry I've been so out of touch.</i>

36
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,707
<i>They keep me pretty busy
here, what with all the parties.</i>

37
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,409
<i>Everyone asks after you
and I think about you often.</i>

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,774
<i>Even at odd moments: At the
market, picking something up...</i>

39
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,278
<i>or just waiting for my coffee.</i>

40
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,654
<i>I wonder how you're doing.</i>

41
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,426
<i>You guys probably don't
even remember me by now.</i>

42
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:44,961
<i>I'm the tall, good-looking black guy
with the best bedside manner in the place.</i>

43
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,923
<i>Tell Pratt I said that.</i>

44
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:51,361
<i>And tell everybody I'm still
here, still doing the doctor thing.</i>

45
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,441
Neela, Medevac's on its
way in. Double amputation.

46
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,402
<i>I try to imagine what
your days are like...</i>

47
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,342
<i>how different your life must be.</i>

48
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,817
<i>The days go by...</i>

49
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,382
<i>some slower than others.</i>

50
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,748
<i>But I'm doing fine.</i>

51
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,253
Incoming. Dump
patrol got ambushed.

52
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,220
<i>I do miss County.</i>

53
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,358
<i>All you guys.</i>

54
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:22,168
<i>Sometimes in the middle of everything,
I kind of wonder if what I'm doing here...</i>

55
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,533
<i>Is maybe the same as
what you're doing over there.</i>

56
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,976
<i>It's good to believe it is.</i>

57
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,477
<i>Makes me feel you're not
really as far away as it seems.</i>

58
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,115
<i>And maybe it won't be
so hard to get through this.</i>

59
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,611
<i>And that sometime soon...</i>

60
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,984
<i>we'll see each other again.</i>

61
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,903
Estimated blood loss?

62
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,877
<i>As for work, well, some things
continue to be a challenge for me.</i>

63
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,247
<i>I know I'm good at some of it.</i>

64
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,775
- Crush injury?
- Looks clean.

65
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:48,355
<i>But I have some deficiencies,
a certain ambivalence.</i>

66
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,282
You can put them back on, right?

67
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,786
You're gonna be
just fine, ma'am.

68
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,058
What's your name?

69
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,100
Private Thomas Perry,
sir, first of the 12th.

70
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,171
RPG explosion, shrapnel
injuries on the right side...

71
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,568
couple of AK-47
rounds in the thigh.

72
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,142
Hold it! Hold it!

73
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,139
- What happened out there?
- They ambushed my patrols.

74
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,284
I had three buddies with
me. Did they make it?

75
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,354
<i>I thank God for two years at
County. It prepared me for this.</i>

76
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,922
They didn't make it, did they?

77
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,915
<i>As much as anyone
can be prepared.</i>

78
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,785
Radial artery hasn't
clamped down.

79
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,124
- Direct pressure for now.
- How you doing, Doris?

80
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:35,099
I thought I could get in, un-jam
it, and get out in a few seconds.

81
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,362
- Un-jam it?
- The saddle stitcher.

82
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,099
- You got to do 10 bound books a minute.
- You were inside a binding machine?

83
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,802
Somebody must have turned it back
on, without realizing I was still in there.

84
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,608
Well, the cuts are clean, so the
chances for reattachment are excellent.

85
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,213
Dr. Lewis, I left the registrar
forms at the front desk.

86
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,717
Okay, good. Gown up.

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,719
Rosales, this is Neela.
Neela, your new med student.

88
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,518
<i>I'm not even confident in my
own decisions half the time.</i>

89
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,491
<i>Now I'm supposed
to orient students.</i>

90
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,186
Neela's our resident brainiac.

91
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,626
Talk about pain management.

92
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,165
<i>The irony is, people think
I know all the answers.</i>

93
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,563
We could titrate morphine?

94
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,794
<i>Even when I don't.</i>

95
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,330
Let's do bilateral
brachial plexus blocks.

96
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,305
Twenty cc's of 1
percent with epi?

97
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,306
- To Dr. Pratt and me.
- I'm familiar.

98
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,705
- Seen it performed?
- Well...

99
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,244
See it before you do it.

100
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,644
BP cuffs as a tourniquet on both
biceps, keep inflated over 140.

101
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,411
<i>Still, I feel after all this
time, people I work with...</i>

102
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,315
<i>should have more
confidence in me.</i>

103
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,922
<i>But how can they if I don't?</i>

104
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,650
Neela, adduct the arm like this.

105
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,258
<i>Ever since med school, it's
like I've been sleepwalking.</i>

106
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,699
This is gonna be
interesting, huh?

107
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,403
Pressure's down.

108
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,032
The abdomen's tender, multiple
shrapnel injuries, right flank and pelvis.

109
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,679
Two wounds, right thigh,
gross deformity of the femur.

110
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,542
Hanging first unit
of type-specific.

111
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,377
<i>I have a lot of responsibility
here. And I gotta admit...</i>

112
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,609
Oww!

113
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,686
<i>- I don't mind it.</i>
- Where you from?

114
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:01,913
Burlington, Vermont.

115
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,353
Only one exit wound.
Give another 5 of morphine.

116
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,084
Vermont? It must
be freezing there.

117
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,527
- Thank God you're not there, huh?
- God or Don Rumsfeld?

118
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,190
Go with the Sec Def we got,
not the one we wish we had.

119
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,199
Systolic's down to 88.

120
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,430
Throw me a cordis. I'll put in the
subclavian before he goes to O.R.

121
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,904
I need surgery?

122
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,703
They'll stop any bleeding
and stabilize your fracture.

123
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,038
I'll keep the leg, right?

124
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,874
<i>- The responsibility cuts both ways.</i>
- Sats dropping.

125
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,210
Get him on the nonrebreather.
Set up an airway.

126
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,783
Forget it. We'll do it in O.R.

127
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,251
Nineteen-year-old, 11
Bravo, AK-47 times two to...

128
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,549
I heard. O.R.'s ready.
I'll take him from here.

129
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:40,626
This is Captain Whitley, 62 Alpha,
fresh out of Doha. Show her the ropes.

130
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,558
Andy, you're with me.

131
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,627
<i>It's strange, after just eight
months, to feel like a veteran.</i>

132
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,727
Michael Gallant.

133
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,567
Welcome to the 57th CASH.

134
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,073
- How long you been here?
- Came over last spring.

135
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,733
How long to get used to it?

136
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,403
- I'll let you know when I do.
- I mean, the ER's rough.

137
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,572
Lately my mind's
somewhere else, you know?

138
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,615
- Is it?
- Yeah, my wife just had a baby.

139
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,946
January 21st. Celia.

140
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,588
She's 7 pounds, 2 ounces.

141
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,348
- How old are you?
- Twenty-four.

142
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,753
- You?
- Twenty-seven.

143
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,918
We want to have three
by the time we're 30.

144
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,027
We both grew up in big families.

145
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,498
- How about yourself?
- I grew up in a medium family.

146
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,000
No. I mean, married, kids?

147
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,298
I have a lot of
catching up to do.

148
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,609
It must be hard balancing an
ER residency and a social life.

149
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,340
Yeah.

150
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,347
- This your double amputee?
- Arms are here.

151
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,780
They'll take it from here.
Your husband's on his way.

152
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,391
- Thank you. DUBENKO:
Dr. Rasgotra...

153
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,555
- come with me. NEELA:
I'll be late for rounds.

154
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,485
That's okay. They'll
manage without you.

155
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,284
While Dr. Lieberman
gets consent...

156
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,689
we'll make sure we have
something to work with.

157
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,491
Dr. Lieberman? I'm Roberto
Rosales. I'm a third-year.

158
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,223
Lieberman's our Plastics guy.

159
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,337
World expert on burn management.
Untoothed forceps and a Kelly.

160
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,372
- Shall I get you a nurse?
- No. You'll do just fine.

161
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,568
Oh, wow.

162
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,577
<i>I find myself both proud
and jealous at times, Michael.</i>

163
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,181
Supple, resilient limbs.

164
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,981
Clean, straight amputations.

165
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:17,154
I'm saying, if you had to have your arms
cut off, this would be the dream scenario.

166
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,490
Yeah, Lieberman's
a brilliant guy.

167
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,720
Worked a while in
Germany with the military...

168
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,558
training combat
surgeons in burn care.

169
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,166
<i>You have a purpose
and a role to fill.</i>

170
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,735
<i>- Most days I don't feel like that at all.</i>
- Flexor digitorum superficialis.

171
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,334
Okay. Hold compressions.

172
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,504
- Back in sinus.
- Get me a chest tube.

173
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,169
<i>Some days are bad. Some
days every victory feels too small.</i>

174
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,508
- He's got a pulse.
- Hoo-ya!

175
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,182
Wow. That was... Wow.

176
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,050
It won't last. He needs the O.R.

177
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,089
Tape the tube in,
hook him up to suction.

178
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,591
I'll find Kilner. You're
with me. Let's go.

179
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,891
Where did you learn that?

180
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,465
I worked three years at a
county ER back in Chicago.

181
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,432
Ah. Who do you have
back there? Wife? Girlfriend?

182
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,596
- Nope, not really.
- Not really?

183
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,464
Okay.

184
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,041
Don't ask, don't tell.

185
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,249
<i>I know what a lot of
people think about this war.</i>

186
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:22,549
<i>But when you're here, you have to believe
that we're fighting for something real...</i>

187
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,951
<i>something that matters.</i>

188
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,956
Thought we could save it.

189
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,791
Shattered femur. Femoral
artery was a tattered mess.

190
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,591
He was bleeding
out, headed for DIC.

191
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,323
<i>That our guys we can't save...</i>

192
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,991
<i>and the ones we
patch together...</i>

193
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,999
<i>are heroes, not victims.</i>

194
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,469
Sir, we got a hypotensive
Iraqi GSW with exposed bowel.

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,405
- Good Iraqi or bad Iraqi?
- He's on our side, sir.

196
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,068
Send him here in 10 minutes.

197
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,144
So 20 minutes if
he's a bad Iraqi?

198
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,786
You have to be careful
about human bombs getting in.

199
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,123
A unit in Kirkuk lost some people when
a patient blew himself up on the table.

200
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,927
<i>It's crazy what your
daily concerns become.</i>

201
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,329
<i>You end up missing
the littlest things.</i>

202
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,339
<i>The stuff most of
us take for granted.</i>

203
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,994
Hey.

204
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,187
Hey, you get that lady
up to Lieberman yet?

205
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,494
- The replantation should be underway.
- Good, I gotta get back inside.

206
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,832
Greg, do you miss him?

207
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,964
Michael? You were good friends.

208
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,506
We still are.

209
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:49,973
I keep...

210
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,873
I don't know,
thinking about him.

211
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,474
Nothing wrong with that.

212
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,511
Oh, I'm writing him a letter.
Anything you want to say?

213
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,815
- You writing a letter? Sending an e-mail?
- An actual letter on paper.

214
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,094
Well, um, tell him to hurry up and
get his ass back here in one piece.

215
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,355
I'm tired of waiting
for my rematch.

216
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,830
Now, let's get back
inside. We got things to do.

217
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,304
<i>Pratt says he misses you.</i>

218
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,142
<i>Lots of my time is
spent babysitting.</i>

219
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:30,113
<i>Even here there's all the small stuff
right next to the stuff that rips you up.</i>

220
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,053
- Are you feeling better, soldier?
- Getting there.

221
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,122
We've had a virus
blasting through camp.

222
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,225
Knocks you on your
ass for about 48 hours.

223
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:42,055
- Whole kitchen staff came down with it.
- Ah.

224
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,322
That explains why the
food suddenly improved.

225
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,466
You want to go back
to the days of MREs?

226
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,965
Oof.

227
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,529
We started on rations
when we were setting up.

228
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,672
Now it's hot chow
three times a day.

229
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,239
Yeah, you're welcome.

230
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,536
When fluid's in, we'll check
orthostatics, send you to the border.

231
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,372
Border?

232
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,875
It's just for a day or two.

233
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,881
We don't want her
infecting the whole DFAC.

234
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,481
- Is there anything I can get you, soldier?
- The hell out of here.

235
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,758
They're sending a Medevac.
Shouldn't be too long.

236
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,327
<i>It's tough, enlisted kids who go
back with less than they came with.</i>

237
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,158
<i>There are reservists
and guardsmen...</i>

238
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,323
<i>who never expected
to be here at all.</i>

239
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,492
<i>They bit the bullet and
showed up for duty...</i>

240
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,195
<i>only to get their tours
extended as reward.</i>

241
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,602
<i>Now they're here
with no end in sight.</i>

242
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,834
<i>- "Weekend a month," my ass.</i>
- You got small?

243
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,272
- Large.
- Did you get 18s too?

244
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,845
Hey, Chicago,
for you, I got it all.

245
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,413
Hoo-ha! Name a tent after you.

246
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,413
Hey, cap!

247
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,084
Special pickup for you.

248
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,381
Cubans, illegal in Kuwait.

249
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,854
- What's the word on our Bulls?
- Flirting with 500.

250
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,425
You think Jordan's got
one more comeback?

251
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,922
- You smoke those?
- No.

252
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,724
Pregnant lady came here
wounded from a building collapse.

253
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,925
- I delivered the baby.
- Hey. Scorpion sting. Got a minute?

254
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,367
- Scorpion sting?
- Yeah, it's pretty common. No big deal.

255
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,104
Hey, I need some help!

256
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,266
- You gonna help me?
- Is it always like this?

257
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:07,073
Multiply the usual busload of colds and
coughs times 10 because it's February.

258
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:11,445
Add seasonal complaints, frostbite, sled
accidents, tongues frozen to metal poles.

259
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,076
Double the car crashes, add your
baseline chest pains, strokes, and GSWs.

260
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,281
And this is what you
get: Hell frozen over.

261
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,926
- Suzannah Harris.
- Mm-hm.

262
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,790
Rash. Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

263
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,455
Yeah, I've got these
red spots all over me...

264
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,294
and I have never itched so bad.

265
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,328
Looks like, uh, insect bites.

266
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,772
- Fleas, maybe?
- No, I don't have fleas.

267
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,570
- Have you ever had scabies?
- Scabies?

268
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,646
They're tiny insects that can
cause severe skin reactions.

269
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,339
Oh, God.

270
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,007
Benadryl, Elimite and home.

271
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,811
<i>I know I shouldn't
complain to you.</i>

272
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,583
<i>My troubles must
seem pretty minor.</i>

273
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,423
Hey, Gus. How are you doing?

274
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,256
- I haven't thrown up in an hour.
- How about the other end?

275
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,428
- Slowing down.
- That's what I like to hear.

276
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,970
After the liter's in, PO challenge
him, re-check orthostatics.

277
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,767
<i>But I spend 99 percent of the
time waiting for the 1 percent...</i>

278
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,670
<i>where it feels I
make a difference.</i>

279
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,937
Neela, waiting time for
a bed is up to 18 hours.

280
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,014
Lewis wants to see about
dispo-ing the deadbeats out of Chairs.

281
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,845
- We're on that.
- Scorpion must've crawled up my arm.

282
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,213
Never even felt it.

283
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,981
Okay, IV, 500 cc NS bolus.

284
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,786
Oh, hey. Uh, Sergeant Varga's
mom sent him a box of Lucky Charms.

285
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,222
Can he eat the crescent moons?

286
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,661
Long as he's here, he's NPO. At
Landstuhl he can eat what he wants.

287
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,631
- So no green clovers either?
- What is that, a monitor?

288
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,532
Larabee.

289
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,507
- Jackson picked it up in Kuwait.
- You can't use that.

290
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,200
You want to borrow it sometime,
make calls back home...

291
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,642
Will it call Florida? My
old lady's in Sarasota.

292
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,749
It's a security risk. The signal
can be picked up by an enemy.

293
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,909
Sir, you really think these
insurgents have homing technology?

294
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,083
Get a 12-lead, keep
him on the monitor.

295
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,861
He's 112 degrees.

296
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,553
Fahrenheit.

297
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,254
I got 98.

298
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,922
With all due respect, ma'am...

299
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,001
if your boy had a temp
of 112, he'd be dead.

300
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,099
Exactly.

301
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,835
Here, show me.

302
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,911
- Excuse me.
- We're not up to you.

303
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,309
- Check with the triage nurse.
- I hurt my back.

304
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,012
I was just tying a shoe.

305
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,376
Here, let me take a look.

306
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,668
- Oh!
- This where it hurts?

307
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,989
Yeah, right there.

308
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,184
- Any meds, medical problems?
- Mm. No.

309
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,194
- You have a lumbar muscle spasm.
- Oh, no.

310
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,264
A backache.

311
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,402
I probably should
stay for a full exam.

312
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,867
Listen, you could go
home, take some ibuprofen...

313
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,063
have a glass of merlot,
and get some rest.

314
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,937
Or you could sit here and
wait to be seen for 20 hours.

315
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,149
Home sounds good. Thanks.

316
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,649
Uh, these yours?

317
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,988
Oh, yeah.

318
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,461
- Neela, did you just send that guy home?
- Simple backache.

319
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,003
He still needs a chart.

320
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,970
- Quick exam, pain was musculoskeletal.
- EMTALA violation.

321
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,134
- He left on his own.
- Dr. Lewis, MI in two is ready to move.

322
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:29,305
- I thought you wanted me to dispo...
- I do. But I don't want to get us sued.

323
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,348
Please, we need help. My
brother's in the car. He's very sick.

324
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,352
You do triage
outside the perimeter?

325
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,781
If they're losing
life, limb or eyesight,

326
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:41,256
or are wounded as a
result of U.S. action...

327
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,969
we can bring them in.

328
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,598
Otherwise, it's off
to a civilian hospital.

329
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,126
If we treated every
civilian that showed up...

330
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,600
we'd run out of beds
and supplies in half a day.

331
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,467
- No interpreter?
- I'm fluent in Arabic.

332
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,701
I was at the Pentagon
on September 11th.

333
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,539
On September 12th, I
started studying the language.

334
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,842
Over here, hurry.
He's really sick.

335
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,854
They went to the clinic.
They couldn't help her.

336
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,958
Pulse is weak.
Barely moving air.

337
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,164
They gave her this note.
- Please help him.

338
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,529
"To County General doctor, rule out
meningitis. Please evaluate." What?

339
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,067
Come on.

340
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,032
- She can't keep anything down.
- That hurt?

341
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,314
Bolus her up and
send her off to Balad?

342
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,375
Yeah, she's only about 5 percent
dehydrated. Not sick enough for us.

343
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,817
Balad. You have to go to a hospital
in Balad. You know where it is?

344
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,529
Hold on. Hold on.

345
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,693
Hey, this will help.

346
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,736
One cup every hour.

347
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,112
It's good stuff,
okay? You drink it.

348
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,983
How is the hospital in Balad?

349
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,350
That infrastructure's been
neglected for a decade.

350
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,930
Should be able to
handle a saline bolus.

351
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,898
It's so tough, turning them
away when they're right here.

352
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,094
Even in the States,
they wouldn't admit her.

353
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,262
Certainly can't justify
treating her at CASH.

354
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,768
Any requests from the big city?

355
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,468
Hey, Jackson. You think you
could score me some citrus?

356
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:43,241
- I have a craving for some mangos.
- I don't think mango's a citrus fruit.

357
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,942
- How about some oranges then?
- You've got it, Chicago.

358
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,781
See if I can hunt us
down some Red Hots too.

359
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,589
- You better get going.
- Okay, Rollins, let's go.

360
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,306
Get down! Get down! Stay
here! There might be more!

361
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,649
Get them out of the truck!
Get them out of the truck!

362
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,980
I need two nurses
and a Pedes mask!

363
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,486
Set up for intubation.

364
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,354
Bolus 500 of normal saline, and
we'll need 400 of rectal acetaminophen.

365
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,789
This kid's burning up.

366
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,214
Supply driver's hurt pretty bad.

367
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,785
Get the CASH on the horn! Tell
them we got a MASCAL at the gate!

368
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,162
- Oh, my God.
- Board and C-spine now. Right now!

369
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,849
- Gross deformity of the right clavicle.
- Oh, God!

370
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,419
- Doctor, what antibiotics do you want?
- Clinda and Levaquin.

371
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,023
- Pharmacy's out of Levaquin.
- Amp and gent then.

372
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,251
- Blood in the canal.
- Okay, 10 of morphine.

373
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,395
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Got it!

374
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,030
Captain, we need you here.

375
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,533
CBC, type and cross, get a second
IV, call X-ray for chest, abdomen...

376
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,034
and right shoulder.

377
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,574
Only 87 percent
on nonrebreather.

378
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,609
Okay. She's stridor on
carbonaceous sputum.

379
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,372
Okay. Six-O on a mac two.

380
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,039
Okay, the inside of
her airway is burned.

381
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,583
We need to get a tube down
there before it swells shut.

382
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,991
Six of etomidate, 20 of Roc.

383
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,555
It's a medicine
to help her sleep.

384
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,575
Etomidate's in.
Pushing the rock.

385
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,172
- Tube.
- Talk to me.

386
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,847
Sats up to 92 on a
30 per kilo fluid bolus.

387
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,246
CBC, lytes and blood cultures
sent. Chest film's on its way. Suction.

388
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,614
He still needs a
cath, UA and an LP.

389
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,018
Dopamine's at 10 mics
and ceftriaxone's infusing.

390
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,489
- How long has he been sick like this?
- Two days. Fever. Also vomiting.

391
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,737
I can't get through this.
- Give it to me.

392
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,127
No. Let's try five and a half.

393
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,265
<i>There are times
when all my worries...</i>

394
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,924
<i>all the crazy thoughts
in my head go away.</i>

395
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,697
<i>All that matters is what I'm
doing now: Securing an airway.</i>

396
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,305
Got it. Bag him.

397
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,965
<i>That's when I know
what I'm doing, who I am.</i>

398
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,934
You got a pulmonary contusion.

399
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,277
Some bleeding and
bruising in the lungs.

400
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,342
We'll get you stabilized. You'll be
headed off to Landstuhl on your way home.

401
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,780
Home?

402
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,049
It'll take weeks for your
lungs and the fractures to heal.

403
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,955
Your family will
be glad to see you.

404
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,295
I don't wanna
ship out like this.

405
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,800
Tech just dropped this off.
Repeat chest on Gopher there.

406
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,232
Okay, let me go take a look
at your films. Take it easy.

407
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,300
Contusions look worse.
- How are his sats?

408
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,473
Holding, barely.

409
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,548
Okay, they'll come back.

410
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,484
Keep a bag mask at the bedside.

411
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,434
Urine dip is positive for
leukocytes and nitrates.

412
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,039
Bingo. Found the source.

413
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,834
- That's my sterile field.
- You can re-prep.

414
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,035
You can be this sick
from a bladder infection?

415
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,908
If there's hydronephrosis.
Probably septic from pyelo.

416
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,550
We still need to rule out meningitis.
- It's unlikely.

417
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,709
Kid's vaccinated for
H-Flu and pneumococcus.

418
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,048
- Pratt, MI in 4 is crashing.
- Okay.

419
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,850
Add five of PEEP, start
gentamicin, and lean on the PICU.

420
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,686
Let me know about the LP.

421
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,088
What if PEEP doesn't work?

422
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,526
In the NICU, we used a
high-frequency oscillator.

423
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,428
- I'm not sure if he's too old for that.
- Should I call RT?

424
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,192
Let's wait and see
what Pratt wants.

425
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,562
Sir, there are no facilities in Iraq
with the resources or the training...

426
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,731
- to take care of this girl.
- True.

427
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,137
But you're telling me to
stabilize and discharge her, sir.

428
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,543
I'm telling you we've done
what we can, captain. Move on.

429
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,579
They cannot take care
of her in a local hospital.

430
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,424
Sometimes we have to
accept our limitations here.

431
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,061
Sounds like a fancy way
of saying you don't care, sir.

432
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,562
You've been here what, a year?

433
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,766
I've been doing this for 20...

434
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,803
so don't lecture me on
who cares and who doesn't.

435
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,071
Yes, sir.

436
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,082
Maybe we could check
a facility in Kuwait, sir.

437
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,810
See about transferring her
to Landstuhl for her recovery.

438
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,112
Captain, Landstuhl's
for U.S. servicemen.

439
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,757
Maybe some hospital in
Egypt or Jordan could take her.

440
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,326
C-130's on the way for Perry and
Jackson. We could get her on the flight.

441
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:32,693
You need approval to bring
that girl into the United States.

442
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,791
I know that, sir.

443
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,501
All right. See what you can do.

444
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,608
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

445
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,941
Will he sleep in
the hospital tonight?

446
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,213
In the pediatric ICU, but we'll
keep him here until the bed's ready.

447
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,983
- Hey, check this out.
- What's that?

448
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,559
- It's a high-frequency...
- High-frequency oscillator.

449
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,323
I had a talk with the PICU attending.
He suggested we give this thing a trial.

450
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,467
- It uses high-frequency waves...
- To carry oxygen to the alveoli.

451
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,660
Right. Well, you're the
expert. Tell us what he needs.

452
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,363
100 percent at six
hertz. Inspiratory time, 33.

453
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,007
Amplitude, 40. Mean
airway pressure, 18.

454
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,478
That's what the
PICU doc said too.

455
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,646
I'll get you set up. - Cool.

456
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,646
Hey, way to stay on
top of his pressure.

457
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,978
One of us should call
the state medical board.

458
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,211
- What for?
- To report the clinic doc.

459
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,515
You don't know what
the kid looked like.

460
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,715
Bad enough the doctor
advised to come here...

461
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,826
with a note to
rule out meningitis.

462
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:42,167
Listen, clinic docs provide essential
care in places where there's nothing else.

463
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,496
I'm not sure bad care
is preferable to none.

464
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,198
The kid's vaccines are up to date.
Amoxicillin's better than no meds at all.

465
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,571
You shut a guy like this down,
you're not doing anybody favors...

466
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,211
including this family.

467
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,907
What?

468
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:58,715
No, no, no. It needs
to be immediately.

469
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,076
Because this girl can't wait.

470
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,149
Okay. Can I speak
to someone else then?

471
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,192
What? No, don't...

472
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,731
You okay?

473
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,439
Two places in Kuwait said no...

474
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:27,068
and the administrator at
Landstuhl practically laughed at me.

475
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,378
It's real sweet,
what you're doing.

476
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,051
Yeah. What I'm trying to do.

477
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,455
What's up?

478
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,620
She's tachy with a
widened pulse pressure.

479
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,591
The Gram's stain was negative.

480
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,596
Still on triples but we'll be
out of Flagyl in the morning.

481
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,428
It won't matter if they don't
get her skin grafted soon.

482
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,069
That's not gonna happen here.

483
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,604
Urine output's only half
a cc per kilo per hour.

484
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,743
"God keep you for
what you are doing."

485
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,081
It's not gonna be so easy.

486
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,750
You want me to tell her that?

487
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,923
No.

488
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:16,494
You send us an unstable patient again,
we'll report you to the medical board.

489
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:19,029
And trust me, Dr. Lima,
you'll lose your license.

490
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,665
Yeah, goodbye to you too!

491
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,592
Did you get it all out? - What?

492
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,760
Whatever's been
bothering you all shift.

493
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,803
One minute I'm
God's gift to medicine...

494
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,770
the next you're humiliating me.

495
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,809
- Humiliating you?
- If you trust me, give me some room.

496
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,309
If you don't, just say so.

497
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,174
- I don't.
- What?

498
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,714
Neela, you could be
the best doctor here.

499
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,443
Hell, everybody knows
that you're five times smarter.

500
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,850
But most of the time
you're in your head.

501
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,850
You're right. I am.

502
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,987
I blow things out of
proportion. I obsess.

503
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,395
- So stop.
- Well, it's just...

504
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:59,268
I come here, do my
shift. I go home, I sleep.

505
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,398
I can't believe this is my life.

506
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,805
See? Now, that's the problem.
This cannot be your life.

507
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,505
You need to go out, have fun. When
is the last time you were on a date?

508
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,081
Why does everybody seem
to think I need to get laid?

509
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,718
Trust me on this.
Sometimes it helps.

510
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,192
Colonel Kilner.

511
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,490
This marine woke up with
someone's arm draped across his body.

512
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,432
Took out his dagger
and started stabbing it.

513
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,998
It was his own arm.

514
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,369
It had fallen asleep and
he took it for the enemy.

515
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,273
Sir, I've run into some
interference getting things set up.

516
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,610
- Maybe you could extend Jamila's stay.
- Captain.

517
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,944
Just for a few days.
It'll give me more time...

518
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,112
We don't have beds to give away.

519
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,688
I want her out of the
unit by the morning.

520
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,137
Hey, Larabee. Hold up.

521
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,537
What did I do now?

522
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,607
ER. Yeah.

523
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,873
Neela, telephone.

524
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,216
Hello.

525
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,781
Is it that clinic idiot again?

526
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,223
Hello?

527
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,991
Hello?

528
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,622
Michael.

529
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,500
That's too bad.
Yeah, okay. I'll try.

530
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,662
- What's going on?
- She's talking to Gallant.

531
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,352
- Really?
- When is he coming home?

532
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,807
- Sounds like he needs help.
- Don't forget to spread the love.

533
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,674
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, they're yakking like teenagers.

534
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,907
What do you suppose a long-distance
call from Iraq would run you?

535
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,019
More important, what
will it run the Army?

536
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,452
It's we the taxpayers who are
underwriting this little rendezvous.

537
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,250
Yeah, okay. You too.

538
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,750
- You just hang up?
- He couldn't talk. He said hello.

539
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,090
- Can we call him back?
- It was a one-time thing.

540
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,357
- He got access to a phone. I gotta go.
- Where?

541
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,023
I'll be back. He sounded okay.

542
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,979
How you feeling?

543
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,181
You were right. Time to go home.

544
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,815
Yeah, it'll just be a few days.

545
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,960
Your family will meet
you at Walter Reed.

546
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,652
You told them I'd be all right?

547
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,326
Yeah. Somebody
contacted them, yeah.

548
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,728
You see that?

549
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,365
Picked it up in Mosul...

550
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,641
for Laura, my little one.

551
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,743
She's gonna love it.

552
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,483
I wonder how
cold it is in Joliet.

553
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,980
My wife hates the winter.

554
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,198
Now you make
it quick, all right?

555
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,394
Because if you get
caught, I never knew you.

556
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,864
Looks like you caught them both.

557
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,409
- Is that Lieberman with Dubenko?
- They're looking at the lady you brought.

558
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,206
- Doris.
- She's doing well.

559
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,110
- Good.
- I'll tell them you're waiting.

560
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,611
That's all right.

561
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,913
Hello, Doris.

562
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,851
- Dr. Lieberman, may I have a moment?
- Bit busy here.

563
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,048
I'm sorry. This can't wait.

564
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,201
Wind's kicked up all
through the Arabian Sea.

565
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,135
Your flight out should be in tomorrow
at the latest, maybe even tonight.

566
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,612
It sucks, but it could be worse.

567
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,643
Mail.

568
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,512
I raided chow supplies
for you, Burlington.

569
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,220
Maple syrup?

570
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,424
You can take the
boy out of Vermont...

571
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,759
Thanks.

572
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,234
Who wrote you, sir?

573
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,601
Uh, my folks. And a friend.

574
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,911
That stuff's like gold, huh?

575
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,612
Yes, it is.

576
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,115
Have a minute, captain?

577
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,417
Take it easy, soldier.

578
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,448
Congratulations. A
Dr. Lieberman in Chicago...

579
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,526
has agreed to
underwrite Jamila's care.

580
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,790
It came through.
That's great, sir.

581
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,695
County General? My guess is
that's where you used to work.

582
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,202
So how did you
plan to get her there?

583
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,069
Piggyback her on the
transport to Andrews, sir.

584
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,470
And who was gonna
get that approved?

585
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:11,277
It's lucky for you that the State
Department and the Army okayed it.

586
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,113
C-130 on the airstrip in
Baghdad. We'll helo them over...

587
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,880
as soon as we get a chopper.

588
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,818
Don't say I never
did anything for you.

589
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,633
Yes.

590
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,498
Good news?

591
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,835
Yes.

592
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,052
I've got, um, two
Heinekens under my bed.

593
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:56,422
They've been sitting there for weeks
waiting for something to celebrate.

594
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,257
We're here, you know?

595
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,866
Gotta hold on to the
good stuff while you can.

596
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,270
Yeah. Sure.

597
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,207
Dr. Gallant! Sergeant
Jackson's crashing!

598
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,028
Hello?

599
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,230
Hello?

600
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,934
Oh, hey.

601
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:47,102
Um, hot water's out at my
place. Sorry. Ray said it was okay.

602
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,584
You want?

603
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,621
No.

604
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,718
Yeah, sure.

605
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,754
Haven't listened to this CD yet?

606
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,767
You familiar with this
guy, Robert Johnson?

607
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,196
Not really.

608
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,901
Eric Clapton? Jimmy
Page? Keith Richards?

609
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,268
- Well, yes. Of course.
- Okay.

610
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,109
There's a direct line
between Robert Johnson...

611
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,941
and every dude who's
ever picked up a Gibson.

612
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,283
Robert Johnson
is American music.

613
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,119
Is that so?

614
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,985
Yeah, that's so.

615
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,291
His sats were trending
down. Had to tube him.

616
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,199
- Getting hard to bag.
- He's bleeding into his lungs.

617
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,704
- Hold compressions.
- Still bradycardic, 48.

618
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,138
Another epi. Let's go.
Maybe occult pneumothorax.

619
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,143
- Pericardial effusion.
- No. He's moving air. No carotid?

620
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,975
- Holding compressions.
- Rate, 27. No pulse.

621
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,946
His heart's not
getting any oxygen.

622
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,317
You know, they say he
sold his soul to the devil.

623
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,817
Really? Why?

624
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,657
Well, he wanted to be
the best. And he was.

625
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,990
So that makes it worth it?

626
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,493
Kind of depends on
your opinion of the devil.

627
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,529
I think it's a made-up story.

628
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,004
Of course it is.
That's the best kind.

629
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,672
But this guy... I mean, listen to
this. He's actually making a guitar talk.

630
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,146
Ohh...

631
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,911
To play like that, I would
give almost anything.

632
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,713
Wouldn't you?

633
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,548
It's good you feel that
way about what you do.

634
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,817
What way?

635
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,063
I don't know. Passionate?

636
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,792
Don't you?

637
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,164
I mean, what Ray and
you do, that's pretty amaz...

638
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,934
- I'm, like, in awe of you guys...
- I wasn't talking about me.

639
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,873
All I meant was...

640
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,382
you seem pretty
passionate to me.

641
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,577
Damn it. Pace at a faster rate.

642
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,375
Not capturing. Atropine.

643
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,916
- Epi drip. Wide open.
- Hold compressions.

644
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:43,983
<i>Asystole.</i>

645
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,955
We haven't been going that long.

646
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,423
You can't reverse this.

647
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,929
Another atropine.
Come on. Come on!

648
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:16,611
He's had three rounds of
meds. Hold compressions.

649
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,156
<i>Dr. Gallant.</i>

650
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,126
Dr. Gallant.

651
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,271
Wait. Hold on a minute.

652
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:02,891
<i>I think you're great but...</i>

653
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,161
- I...
- Are you laughing?

654
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,670
I'm... I'm sorry. You're...
You're great, really.

655
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,674
But, um... I'm just not into it.

656
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,206
Well, you seemed
into it a minute ago.

657
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,381
I need to go to bed now,
because if I don't go to bed now...

658
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,711
I'm gonna stay
out here with you.

659
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,012
And what would be
so bad about that?

660
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,051
- Um, you know...
- Ooh.

661
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:32,322
When you have a
cut or some injury...

662
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:36,195
but all you have in the house
is one of those tiny Band-Aids...

663
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,529
- that don't even stay on...
- Uh-huh.

664
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:42,196
That don't really help
the problem at all...

665
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,773
This would be
very nice, I'm sure.

666
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:50,210
It already was. Can
you see what I mean?

667
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,916
Um...

668
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,609
I'm a tiny Band-Aid?

669
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,088
I'm in a weird place...

670
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,788
and I don't want to do
something just because I'm lonely.

671
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:10,626
Isn't the cure for loneliness
to be with someone?

672
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,137
That is so totally reasonable.

673
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,921
Good night.

674
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,275
She's not stable, sir.

675
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,469
Just get to the C-130.
They'll take it from there.

676
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,972
She's hypotensive and septic.

677
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,078
- You can go up on the pressors.
- She'll blow a pneumo at altitude.

678
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,449
- Fly low and bag her.
- Sir, you're not the one...

679
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,682
who'll be coding
her at 5000 feet.

680
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,486
She could die without
the proper burn care.

681
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,855
She can't get that here.

682
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,862
She could die during transport.
I'm not taking responsibility.

683
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,159
Would you take
her if a doctor went?

684
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,004
You got 72 hours,
son. Get her there.

685
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,703
Thank you, sir.

686
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:03,474
<i>I try to be positive, Neela,
but the truth is, it gets to you.</i>

687
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,182
<i>Even if no one sees that,
even if you never admit it.</i>

688
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,986
<i>Sometimes I wish I
could just get out...</i>

689
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:14,353
<i>wear civvies, drink beer
and clear my head for a while.</i>

690
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,191
<i>Then I'd come back...</i>

691
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:20,058
<i>and finish the job I started.</i>

692
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,369
<i>There are things I can't say
to anyone except in a letter...</i>

693
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,367
<i>except to you.</i>

694
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,538
<i>Be safe, Michael.</i>

695
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,672
<i>I know I worry a
lot about everything.</i>

696
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:42,210
<i>But most of all I worry
about how long it will be...</i>

697
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:44,719
<i>before I see you again.</i>
