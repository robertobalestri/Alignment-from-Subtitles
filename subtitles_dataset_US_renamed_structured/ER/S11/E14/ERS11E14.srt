1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,071
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,766
- Who's that?
- Med student.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,171
Why didn't you say anything?

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,173
No one listens to me. No one
even remembers I was in the room.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,409
I'm a Resident. I've been ordering
scans since I've been here. What's that?

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:21,112
- It's about me making the rules.
- Oh, come on. That's stupid.

7
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,314
Congratulations, Jake.

8
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,292
Your ER rotation
is officially over.

9
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:08,167
Good evening. Can I help you?

10
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,887
- Room 415?
- End of the hall.

11
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,223
Helen?

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,961
Helen, it's Kerry.

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,736
I don't wanna
leave it like this.

14
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,710
The things that we said.

15
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,976
Is this how you wanna
leave it? If it is, tell me...

16
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,710
and I'll go away like
we never even met.

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,742
I heard it was supposed to
be sunny and warmer today.

18
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,880
I heard partly cloudy
and chance of rain.

19
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,743
Ugh, winter.

20
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,811
Do you know that most snowflakes
are less than half an inch?

21
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,707
- I didn't know...
- Know why they're white?

22
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,587
The complex structure of snow crystals
results in countless tiny surfaces...

23
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,160
from which visible light
is efficiently reflected.

24
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,161
The little sunlight that's
absorbed, is absorbed uniformly...

25
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,426
over visible wavelengths, thus
giving snow its white appearance.

26
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,069
- What's wrong with you?
- Ha-ha-ha.

27
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,237
Alex had a school report.
Luka and I got kind of into it.

28
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,809
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Excuse me.

29
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,074
Do you know how much
longer I'll have to wait?

30
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,582
- Ooh. That's nasty.
- Another skater ripped into me.

31
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,516
- This morning?
- Skating club.

32
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,816
- We only get the ice from 5:30 to 7:00.
- We'll get you checked in...

33
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,788
- in a couple minutes, okay?
- Thanks.

34
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,919
Ugh, winter.

35
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,189
So it's already an
every night kind of thing?

36
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,799
Since he started his surgical
rotation. Dubenko's working him hard...

37
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,769
- and my place is closer to the hospital.
- So sleeping over is a convenience.

38
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,874
No, we do like each other.

39
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,636
And do you know his real
name isn't Jake? It's George.

40
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,474
It's actually kind of a funny story.
It's not "funny" funny. But... Sorry.

41
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,106
Tibial plateau fracture. Ortho's taking
him to the O.R. Make sure he's NPO.

42
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,310
- Got it.
- Cellulitis following cat bite.

43
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,955
- Admit to Medicine.
- Already did.

44
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,818
- Antibiotics?
- Three grams of Unasyn.

45
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,017
DKA on an insulin drip.
Going up to the ICU.

46
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,821
- Last glucose?
- Five-thirty-four.

47
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,658
And they just brought
back a 60-year-old lady.

48
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,494
Pick's disease with agitation.
I'm officially out of here.

49
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,659
- Thank you, Luka.
<i>- Hasta la vista</i>, suckers.

50
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,238
Ray, when you get home, take the
back stairs. The front ones are frozen.

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,874
You didn't shovel?

52
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,738
You're kidding, right? Oh,
and the kitchen window...

53
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,379
- I couldn't get it to close all the way.
- Meaning?

54
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,142
Meaning there's snow in
the kitchen. Bit of a buildup.

55
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,945
Might wanna turn the oven
on and keep the door open.

56
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,686
- So it'll melt.
- It's just a suggestion.

57
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,085
She used to be my roommate.

58
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,818
Let's get back to medicine.
Atypical chest pain...

59
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,429
waiting on a second troponin.
- I'll take it.

60
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,689
How come Weaver's on?

61
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,333
- How come Weaver's on?
- She does two shifts a month...

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,527
to keep up her skills and stay in
touch with the department's needs.

63
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,332
- Our lucky day.
- Ice skater bleeding in the waiting area.

64
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,065
Frank, let's get
her a wheelchair.

65
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,177
Okay. Someone might wanna
grab the trauma at the back door.

66
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,575
Carter, take Neela with
you on that chest pain.

67
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,546
Susan, fifty-something
woman, dyspnea, Curtain 4.

68
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,185
Abby, Jane, you're with me.

69
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,520
It must be awkward for Dr. Lewis
being chief while having Dr. Weaver back.

70
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,922
Are you kidding? Weaver comes
in, takes charge, runs all the cases.

71
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,255
Lewis loves it. It's
like having a day off.

72
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,897
Not so, however,
for the rest of us.

73
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,364
Altercation at someone's all-night
turned-out-badly birthday party.

74
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,064
Good morning, Dr. Pratt.

75
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,296
Half inch of snow,
traffic grinds to a halt.

76
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,406
Multiple stabs to the
back with a screwdriver.

77
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,066
- You think he dropped a lung?
- Probably not. Sats are 100.

78
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,974
Abby and I got this. There's
a woman with Pick's disease.

79
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:50,140
Why don't you grab that? And take
Jane with you. It's a good teaching case.

80
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,079
I'm sure Jane has
seen her share...

81
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:56,485
- of combative patients with dementia.
- Not with you as her teacher, right?

82
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,058
Start by reviewing the key elements
of the history, physical, genetics...

83
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,095
- differences from Alzheimer's.
- Okay, okay. We're on it.

84
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,064
If it's any consolation, I'm a blank
slate when it comes to Pick's disease.

85
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,170
I know we studied
it maybe first year.

86
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,133
No, I think it was second year.

87
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:16,106
No, it was first year. What
did she say about Alzheimer's?

88
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,768
Man, talk about your
short-term memory loss.

89
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,947
- Lousy son of a... You stupid fat piece...
- Nice language.

90
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,846
- Equal breath sounds.
- Pulse ox, 98.

91
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,179
- First HemoCue?
- Thirteen-point-eight.

92
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,583
Okay. Let's roll him.

93
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,020
We're gonna roll you
onto your side, sir.

94
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,625
No head injury.

95
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,454
Guess he's sleeping it off.

96
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,620
- Regular or Phillips head?
- What?

97
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,957
- Stabbed with a screwdriver, right?
- Yes. At least 20 wounds. All superficial.

98
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,296
I'd say regular.

99
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,803
- SonoSite.
- Mr. Scanlon, what is Hamman's sign?

100
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,200
A crunching sound heard with
pneumomediastinum. Listen for it.

101
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,776
- X-ray's back.
- What's the normal intrapleural pressure?

102
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,006
It's negative...

103
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,943
Negative 10 to 12
millimeters of mercury.

104
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,708
And what's
intra-alveolar pressure?

105
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,519
- Fluctuates.
- Minus three with inspiration...

106
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:04,147
plus three with expiration. How does
this guy end up with a pneumothorax?

107
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:08,789
Penetrating trauma allows air to enter
the pleural space, raising the pressure...

108
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,330
- collapsing the alveoli.
- Well done, Mr. Scanlon.

109
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,960
- Fantastic.
- BP, 124/82.

110
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,195
- Let's get him a floor bed.
- He needs the ICU.

111
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,135
- He's stable.
- He's Swiss cheese, needs observation.

112
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,538
- He'll never get an ICU bed.
- He doesn't need one.

113
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,510
No pneumo, crit and vitals are stable,
no blood in the pericardium or Morrison's.

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,013
Could be an occult
solid-organ injury, or delayed...

115
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,174
You gonna bludgeon
us with the differential?

116
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,480
- Occasionally I can be thorough.
- How about a Tele admit?

117
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,680
- Maybe after four hours.
- Four hours?

118
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,155
Kerry, that lady with dyspnea...

119
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,261
Sharon Williams,
she's asking for you.

120
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,592
- Says you were her doc.
- Okay. This Swiss cheese is stable.

121
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,892
Let's get him admitted
to a med-surg bed.

122
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,697
And don't listen to any of
Dr. Dubenko's suggestions.

123
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,032
- So, uh, Dr. Lewis...
- Don't start.

124
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,766
Oh, okay. No problem. We
humble surgical servants...

125
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,879
shall leave this in your capable
hands. Jake, do not move...

126
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,107
Mr. Screwdriver without a
Foley, an NG, three crits...

127
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,343
- and a four-hour chest film.
- All right.

128
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,714
Okay. Oh, and
suture all the lacs.

129
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,216
- All 20 of them?
- Oh, yeah.

130
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,060
Sharon Williams, BP,
124/70. Pulse ox, 90.

131
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,891
No history of asthma
or emphysema.

132
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,726
Thanks, Haleh. Sharon Williams?

133
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,267
You're Dr. Weaver? Oh, I'm
sorry. Of course you're Dr. Weaver.

134
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,132
- You were in months before?
- Yes.

135
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,901
- And when was that?
- Oh, God, let me think. I don't know.

136
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,568
I can't quite remember. You know,
I'm actually feeling much better now.

137
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,580
- I probably didn't need to come in.
- Well, as long as you did.

138
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,248
I don't... This whole thing is silly.
I don't know what I was thinking.

139
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,183
I'm much better.
I'm breathing fine.

140
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,322
Why don't you let me examine
you and we'll make sure of that?

141
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,983
Okay. You said you
experienced shortness of breath?

142
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,253
- Yes.
- Any cough or fever?

143
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,658
No.

144
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,427
Have you had any prolonged periods of
immobilization, like a plane or a car trip?

145
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,070
No.

146
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,235
Lungs sound good.
Oxygen level is fine.

147
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,569
We'll check a few tests
and see what's going on.

148
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,401
Haleh, EKG, PA and
lateral chest, D-dimer.

149
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,273
- Sure.
- And I'll be back to check on you later.

150
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,283
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah?

151
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,952
Is there something you need?

152
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:20,287
No, no... Well, yes.
It's not really important.

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,122
What's not important?

154
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,421
Well, I was wondering.

155
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,466
The doc... Daughter of a friend of
mine is thinking about medical school.

156
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,160
Do you like what you do?

157
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,306
- Very much.
- Did you always wanna be a doctor?

158
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,298
From when I was a little girl.

159
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,974
So you were lucky then, weren't
you? Getting the opportunity to do it.

160
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,479
Miss Williams, is
everything all right?

161
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,986
Oh, I'm fine, Kerry,
really. Thank you.

162
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,951
I don't wanna take up
any more of your time.

163
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,784
Okay, then.

164
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:58,462
Sharon Williams. Let's pull up her
records from the last time she was in.

165
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,065
Sure.

166
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,333
Can you wiggle your fingers?

167
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,475
Can you wiggle your fingers? Ha.

168
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,678
- Why don't you just give it a try for me?
- Why don't you just give it a try for me?

169
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,648
Charlotte, the dinner party. The dinner
party. They're gonna be here early.

170
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,251
- It's okay, Mom.
- What will we do?

171
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,785
It's okay. Mom, it's okay.

172
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,151
This morning, I hear her
crashing around in the kitchen.

173
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,849
You got a bathroom around here?

174
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,585
- Chuny?
- Mrs. Devon, you can come with me.

175
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,058
You can come with me.

176
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,892
You can come with me.

177
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,192
There is no dinner party.

178
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,996
She was in the kitchen.
Thought she was cutting chicken.

179
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,002
She was cutting her own hand.

180
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,702
We'll take care of that.
When did her symptoms start?

181
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,346
Two years ago. She was only 58.

182
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,511
We've been able to keep her at
home. But now I've got three kids.

183
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,050
What am I supposed to do?

184
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,215
- Labs back yet on that syncope?
- No. Still waiting.

185
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,122
Call them again and ask nicely.

186
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,023
Nicely? We're never "nicely."

187
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,687
Pratt, Pick's disease?

188
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,227
Jane?

189
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,234
Similarities with Alzheimer's but earlier
age of onset and faster progression...

190
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,896
of symptoms. Mainly causes damage
to the frontal lobes of the brain...

191
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,541
resulting in disinhibition.

192
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,576
The patient can be extremely
rude, which we've seen.

193
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:22,045
And then can become extremely
loving, which we have not seen.

194
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,775
Often has a tendency to repeat
statements spoken to them.

195
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:29,218
- I'd actually say it's more than often...
- Thank you, Jane. Good job. Good job.

196
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,855
Yes, and let me see, was that Dr. Pratt's
extremely efficient teaching? Or was it...

197
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,654
- eMedicine?
- She learned about it, didn't she?

198
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:43,101
She learned the facts, not necessarily
how to handle the patients or the family.

199
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,067
She will. The woman's
got lacerations.

200
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,730
- We'll suture once the Ativan kicks in.
- Dr. Pratt...

201
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,775
- And the family?
- Daughter's lining up a nursing facility.

202
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,846
- You should help with that.
- Isn't that a social worker thing?

203
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,278
Just dive in, see
what you can do.

204
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,647
Hey, Sam, did that screwdriver-stabbing
guy get sent upstairs yet?

205
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,948
Uh, Dr. Dubenko wanted a
few things taken care of first.

206
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,626
In what possible universe would
I say the words, "Let's polka"?

207
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,356
In your sleep, two nights
ago. I'm not making this up.

208
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,297
- You don't think I was surprised?
- I don't talk in my sleep.

209
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,097
- How do you know?
- Even if I did, I wouldn't say "polka."

210
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,206
I wouldn't even say
"dance." I don't dance.

211
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,375
Maybe once when I
was a kid I did the limbo.

212
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,101
Yeah, maybe it was the limbo.

213
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,769
Ah, see, and you
were making it up.

214
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,446
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,553
Dr. Lockhart. Mr. Scanlon.

216
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,313
- Dr. Weaver.
- Kerry.

217
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,121
I'm mixing up some Ancef.

218
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,557
I'm just, uh, gathering
up supplies...

219
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,027
I thought you were
gathering up a med-surg bed...

220
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,837
for the guy with the
holes in his back.

221
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,633
I'd like very much to do that.

222
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,736
Dr. Weaver, that
patient, Sharon Williams...

223
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,448
there's no record of
her being here before.

224
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,567
I asked her about it and she got
pretty nervous. Wants to leave AMA.

225
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,574
- Now?
- Yeah.

226
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,849
- Gathering supplies?
- Yeah, I know. Okay? I know.

227
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,155
Excuse me. That woman who
was here, did you see her leave?

228
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,525
Yeah, just now. Kind of bolted.

229
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,331
Do you want me
to try and catch her?

230
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,267
Miss Williams, please wait.
Your test results aren't back yet.

231
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,570
- I don't need them.
- Shouldn't be much longer.

232
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,078
- I don't need them.
- You could have a blood clot...

233
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,218
- in the lung or fluid around your heart...
- Stop, please.

234
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,711
I don't have any of those things.
There's nothing wrong with me.

235
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,356
I don't understand.

236
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,731
I've never been to this hospital
before. My name's not Sharon Williams.

237
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,367
It's Helen Kingsley.

238
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,398
I'm your mother.

239
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,473
- Did you say Kovac?
- His wanting Saturday off is a problem.

240
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,273
Well, however you
want to handle it.

241
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,110
Kerry, they can take Sharon
Williams for a chest x-ray now.

242
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,809
That won't be necessary.
You can cancel her labs too.

243
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,248
- Cancel all of it?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,913
- Kerry, about earlier...
- Could you follow up this migraine in 2?

245
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,219
I know the screwdriver
guy should be upstairs...

246
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,953
- Don't worry about it.
- Dubenko wanted serial crits.

247
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,169
- UA showed 10 red cells.
- We need to work that up?

248
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,824
- Probably just from the Foley.
- So he doesn't need a CT?

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,992
- Frank, I'm gonna take a break.
- What?

250
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,730
Break?

251
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:44,645
They say it isn't good for your arteries.
But I guess you'd know about that.

252
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,481
- But I like it anyway.
- How did you find me?

253
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,953
The letter you sent.

254
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,151
Well, that was four years
ago. Why all the pretense?

255
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,820
- Why didn't you just write back?
- I wanted to see you first.

256
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,858
That poor little
ice-skater girl.

257
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,970
- Her leg looked awful.
- She's young. She'll heal.

258
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,634
What you do is so important.

259
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,303
I guess I was scared.

260
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,005
I'm here in Chicago
for a week, so...

261
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,514
- You're still in Indiana?
- Terre Haute.

262
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,051
That's next door. You could have
come to Chicago a hundred times.

263
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,513
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,054
I looked for you. I
hired an investigator.

265
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,161
I finally found
the right address.

266
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,661
You knew where I was
and still you waited so long?

267
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,662
I can't explain it. I
know it wasn't fair.

268
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,704
- I'm truly, truly sorry.
- Oh, please... Please, don't go yet.

269
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,578
So, um, have you
always lived in Indiana?

270
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:59,522
South Carolina, originally. I'm
here in Chicago with my choir.

271
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,887
Your choir?

272
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:05,187
There's a Christ Crusade and we were
chosen to sing in the Festival Chorus.

273
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,057
That... That sounds
like quite an honor.

274
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,697
When's the concert?

275
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,566
Tomorrow afternoon,
Community Baptist on Dearborn.

276
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,105
Ooh, as a matter of fact,
they're gonna be looking for me.

277
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,267
I got a rehearsal. Um...

278
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,374
I'd like to talk to
you again, Kerry...

279
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,608
- if you want to, that is.
- Yeah, I would.

280
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,510
- So I can call you after I'm done?
- You have the number of the hospital?

281
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,782
- No.
- Just wait one second.

282
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,086
There's a separate
number for the ER.

283
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,864
Here you go. There you are.

284
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,263
- So you'll call?
- A couple hours.

285
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,908
Great.

286
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,412
- Pressure's only 72 palp.
- Left pupil is 6 mm and sluggish.

287
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,449
- Hang 80 of mannitol.
- Multiple rib fractures with sub-q air.

288
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,338
- Glove up for a chest tube.
- Our drunk versus screwdriver...

289
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,114
is having some more trouble?

290
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,453
- Uh, this isn't the screwdriver guy.
- I heard he was still down here...

291
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,824
so naturally I assumed there
was some emergent situation.

292
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,089
No. This would be
motorcycle versus tree guy.

293
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,133
- Blunt head, chest.
- Looks like a fractured spleen.

294
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,295
Mr. Scanlon, your patient's bleeding
in the head and belly. What's your plan?

295
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:23,170
Uh... Quick head CT before
going to the O.R. for an ex-lap.

296
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,312
Good call, if you want him
to bleed out in the scanner.

297
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,940
Betadine and Steri-Drape.

298
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,981
What's Monroe-Kellie hypothesis?

299
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,815
- Uh... I don't know.
- Abby?

300
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:37,980
I don't know.

301
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,820
CPP equals M.A.P. minus ICP.

302
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,473
Cerebral perfusion
pressure equals...

303
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,325
mean arterial pressure
minus intracranial pressure.

304
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,957
- Spleen's a bigger threat to the M.A.P.
- Two units is on the infuser.

305
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,328
- Guide wire's ready.
- Stop what you're doing.

306
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,939
Have you even read
about this procedure?

307
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,876
I supervised Jake putting
in a chest tube last week.

308
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,206
Good. I'm sure you told him you
always insert a finger and feel...

309
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,178
lung tissue before...

310
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,546
Before inserting the tube.
Why is that, Mr. Scanlon?

311
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,846
Uh...

312
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,555
First, break up any adhesions.

313
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,055
Second, if there's a
diaphragmatic injury...

314
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,824
you could be in the
abdominal cavity.

315
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,985
Chest tubes don't work
well in the stomach.

316
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,154
Line is primed.

317
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,366
Kerry, I think we can
take this from here.

318
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,905
Uh... Yes, I'm sure you can.

319
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,874
That was fun.

320
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,180
Would you like to tell me why
she's so pissed off at the two of you?

321
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,548
Man, and I thought
I knew how to pimp.

322
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,055
When did your neck pain start?

323
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,922
Came from Cleveland yesterday to help
my brother move. I was lifting a chair.

324
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,496
She had a MRI last year.
Three slipped discs in her neck.

325
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,827
- Any neural findings?
- Motor and sensory intact.

326
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,163
The pain goes down
into her arm, don't forget.

327
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,376
- Some morphine?
- Makes me sick to my stomach.

328
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,406
Demerol's the only thing that
works when she gets like this.

329
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,408
We could try Toradol.

330
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,739
- Allergic.
- Demerol.

331
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,144
Okay. We will be right back.

332
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,081
Neck pain with radiculopathy
consistent with herniated disc syndrome.

333
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,516
Allergic to Toradol?

334
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,386
- May as well say she's a Demerol addict.
- There's no objective test for pain.

335
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,790
- Shouldn't we believe her?
- Give her the Demerol and get her out.

336
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,256
See what I mean?
She's on every case.

337
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,367
Looks good. Did Dr. Pratt
show the two-layer repair?

338
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,705
Where is Dr. Pratt?

339
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,736
I think he's
looking for supplies.

340
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,901
Looking for supplies. Didn't
she have her daughter with her?

341
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,041
That's where he is. He's,
uh... He's with the daughter.

342
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,275
He's helping her locate
a skilled nursing facility.

343
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,448
CVP is 10, M.A.P. is 80, and we're
transfusing to an SCV O2 of 70.

344
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,391
- Once the crit is 30, consider dopamine.
- Dr. Pratt, is there a good reason why...

345
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,656
- you left your student unsupervised?
- Other patients.

346
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,925
I've got a 75-year-old
man with urosepsis...

347
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,728
a woman in pulmonary edema...

348
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,633
and a kid with anaphylaxis
from a peanut allergy.

349
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,138
And my student should
be supervised by an intern.

350
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,299
Except that I
asked you to do it.

351
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,514
- You gotta stay on these Residents.
- Dr. Pratt isn't the problem.

352
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,446
You know that break you took?
You may wanna take another one.

353
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,949
- Frank, have I gotten any calls?
- Nope.

354
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,752
- You've been here the whole time?
- Yep.

355
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:31,094
I'm going out. Carter, would you
take over this bowel obstruction in 4...

356
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:36,327
retinoschisis in 2, Mr. Langstaff with
pyelo, waiting on an admit to Medicine...

357
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:41,634
a 72-year-old female with nausea.
And I need an LP on the fever in 6.

358
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,003
You're signing in a spinal tap?

359
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,778
So much for every case.

360
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,467
Oh, thank you.

361
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,335
Thanks.

362
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,568
Bye.

363
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,049
Has it already been two hours?

364
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,052
I just thought I'd catch some of
the rehearsal. It was beautiful.

365
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,559
It stopped snowing.

366
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,961
I gotta get my coat.

367
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,565
A lot of people
brought their families.

368
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,105
I have two children.

369
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,765
Two other children.

370
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,501
Carl's 26.

371
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,512
He does something with the county
court system that I don't understand.

372
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:06,777
And Laurie's a year out of
college, free spirit bouncing around.

373
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,246
And I'm divorced.

374
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,520
I always had this image
of you living somewhere...

375
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,092
with this
happily-ever-after family.

376
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,457
Ending the marriage was
more difficult than I imagined.

377
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,636
The Church saved me,
gave me back my life.

378
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,129
Except for the part of my life
that's taken up with my business.

379
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,138
I own an auto-parts store.

380
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,938
- Ha. That's unusual.
- I know, nobody can quite believe it...

381
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,809
but it was part of the
divorce settlement.

382
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,643
Oh...

383
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,812
Thank you.

384
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,648
- Why do you need it?
- You don't know?

385
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,986
Congenital hip dysplasia.

386
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,560
In common parlance,
it's a birth defect.

387
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,163
- Birth defect?
- Yes.

388
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:56,666
- Something I gave you?
- Well, there's really no way to know.

389
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,669
It's not that clear-cut. Helen?

390
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,043
I was thinking about
what you said...

391
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,346
about how I could have been in
Chicago a hundred times, why this time?

392
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,488
I think it's because I just recently
got the news that your daddy died.

393
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,551
Oh, no, my father
died years ago.

394
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,252
That's not who I
mean. Your other father.

395
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,900
His name was Cody Boone.

396
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:35,701
He should have been a character
in some old western TV show.

397
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,208
We were 15... Well,
I was almost 15.

398
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,410
And that was in South Carolina?

399
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,379
Myrtle Beach.

400
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,384
My daddy had a
miniature-golf course.

401
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,048
Cody worked there after school.

402
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,686
So, what happened?

403
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,555
Nothing fancy.

404
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,059
I got pregnant.

405
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,129
All the parents pitched a fit.

406
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,560
Rightfully so.

407
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:04,465
- And abortion wasn't legal.
- Oh, I never would have done that.

408
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,572
Back then they had these
homes for girls in my condition.

409
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,902
There was one up in
Indiana where my aunt lived...

410
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,703
so they sent me up there.

411
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,106
That's where you were born.

412
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,039
Did you ever want to keep me?

413
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,642
Oh, of course.

414
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,082
Cody and I had a whole plan.

415
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,087
He was gonna quit
school, get work.

416
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:28,626
There was a room over his
parents' garage where we could live.

417
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:35,062
But in the end, you're
14, 15, you got no money...

418
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,933
so I came to believe...

419
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,665
that the best thing for you
would be to be with people...

420
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,835
who could care for you
and do things for you.

421
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:50,810
- It was true, right?
- I don't know.

422
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,815
- What I mean is...
- I know what you mean.

423
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,784
I had two loving parents.

424
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,786
I was happy.

425
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:02,486
But even with that, it somehow
always felt like rejection.

426
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,159
Does that make sense?

427
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,363
They took you so fast.

428
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,132
I never held you.

429
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,867
Never even saw you.

430
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,971
And nobody ever told me
anything about the birth defect.

431
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:27,844
When I was a little girl, I used to
wonder if that's why I was given away.

432
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,952
Not quite perfect.

433
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,853
All Jesus' children are perfect.

434
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:40,655
And my father, Cody,
he didn't go with you?

435
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,999
- I never saw him again.
- Ever?

436
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,469
But when you heard he died...?

437
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,074
Kind of pushed a button, huh?

438
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,072
I guess I'd always thought
about him over the years...

439
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,708
although not as much
as I thought about you.

440
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,714
Oh.

441
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,513
That would be work.

442
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,188
She's concerned. So am I.

443
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,657
I understand, Mr. Bulowski.

444
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,353
- The pain is still in her neck.
- And still in my arm.

445
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,398
- I understand that too.
- I thought that you were going to help.

446
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,058
- Dr. Rasgotra.
- Excuse me.

447
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,171
She complained that
she was still in pain.

448
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,458
You explained to her that
she already had her Demerol?

449
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,873
- So she suckered you for a second shot.
- One could look at it that way.

450
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,877
- Jerry, I'm back.
- I didn't even know you'd been gone.

451
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,880
Don't take this the wrong way,
when I said to take a break...

452
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,244
I didn't mean literally.

453
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,216
- I didn't think I'd be gone long.
- We're getting slammed.

454
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,551
Morris is out sick. We're
boarding 10 ICU patients.

455
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:42,058
We've got charts in the rack for
four hours, 12 patients on the board...

456
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,389
- and we're 50 behind in triage.
- You're back?

457
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,088
- Yes.
- Are you going out again?

458
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,528
- Yes.
- Yes?

459
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,759
I irrigated the
obnoxious bald guy.

460
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,268
- Got him moved into Trauma 2.
- I can take that.

461
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,770
Okay, thank you.

462
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,482
- Kerry.
- I was looking for some obnoxious guy...

463
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,620
- who needs suturing?
- He was here, but...

464
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,414
Yeah, we put him next door.

465
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,625
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey. Do you work here?

466
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,093
My head is throbbing,
throbbing, throbbing.

467
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,097
No one will even give me an
answer. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

468
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,670
Mr. Screwdriver, so
nice to see you again.

469
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,168
- Okay, Kerry.
- Uh...

470
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,105
I take full responsibility for
this patient still being in the ER.

471
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:36,107
You don't think Dr. Dubenko
deserves just a soupçon of that?

472
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:41,413
He ordered an NG, a Foley, three
serial crits and a four-hour chest film.

473
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,614
- I hear everything, Mr. Scanlon.
- She pretty much does.

474
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,784
So do we have some hope that
this gentleman will be sent upstairs...

475
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,090
in, let's say, our lifetime?

476
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,690
- Ten minutes.
- Thank you.

477
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,028
When you're done with
him, do the guy next door.

478
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,506
Does she have
multiple personalities?

479
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,846
- You're not on, bro.
- No, Dr. Morris has failed to be on...

480
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,677
and I was unceremoniously
told to bring my ass back in here.

481
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,819
- Have you seen Neela or Carter?
- No.

482
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,978
Dr. Barnett, got
your first case.

483
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,124
The well-fed, well-drugged
Bulowskis in Curtain 2.

484
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,523
Review the chart and
kick their asses out of here.

485
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:30,564
They're both good facilities. Locked
doors so patients can't wander...

486
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,501
and the nursing staffs are trained
in handling dementia patients.

487
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,039
- Thank you so much.
- Jane.

488
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,144
Uh, Mrs. Devon's
daughter, the Pick disease.

489
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,431
I was just going over some
of the facilities with her.

490
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,074
And Dr. Pratt, is he even remotely
involved with this patient anymore?

491
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,151
Yeah. We're swamped, you know?

492
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:51,814
One of the docs is out so he's
been busy, but he's involved, sort of.

493
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,482
Wow. Wound edges
are everted nicely.

494
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,026
Excellent approximation.

495
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,526
Jane does good work.

496
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,330
- You waiting on a Unasyn piggyback?
- Yeah, thanks.

497
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,332
Don't worry, I got this.

498
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,406
Okay. Okay, I
get it, Mrs. Devon.

499
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,845
Please, do not play with
the Kleenex box, all right?

500
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,993
All right. You know what? Ha.

501
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,470
4:30 and it's already dark.

502
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,372
Winter.

503
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,380
You really are
leaving, aren't you?

504
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,711
You know that patient
who was here this morning?

505
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,323
Sharon Williams. Uh...

506
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,151
She wasn't really a patient.

507
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,954
Yeah?

508
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,031
Do you remember when I
was looking for my birth mother?

509
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:13,906
- Oh, my God, you found her?
- She found me.

510
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,839
Kerry, I'm so happy
for you! Is it weird?

511
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,503
It's a lot to take in, I mean...

512
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,411
there are certain things
that she's told me...

513
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,817
and there are a lot of
things I still have to tell her.

514
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:34,790
Ha-ha. I gotta go. I'm
gonna go home and change...

515
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,097
and I'm gonna go
have some dinner.

516
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,489
Don't worry about
this place. We'll be fine.

517
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,861
I'll try to stop by later.

518
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,298
Susan, thanks.

519
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,634
So you said you had
pictures of some relatives?

520
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,439
I want to hear about Africa.

521
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,844
Okay. We lived
there when I was little.

522
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,883
The adoption people said
the family... Your family.

523
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,644
Were involved in the Church.

524
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,552
- Were they actually missionaries?
- More like wannabe missionaries.

525
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:09,217
My mom worked to set up new
schools and my dad was a civil engineer.

526
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,796
He taught me how to build a canal,
not that I've had much use for that.

527
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,627
Ha-ha. Well, did you
like living over there?

528
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,734
I was different
simply for being white.

529
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,839
No one seemed to
even notice the crutch.

530
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:25,207
And then, my parents were
older, their health wasn't so great...

531
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:28,006
so we moved back to
Minneapolis when I was 12.

532
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,844
And they both passed
away when I was in college.

533
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,145
So they never got to
see you become a doctor?

534
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,480
- Mm-mm.
- Oh.

535
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,520
They would have
been so proud of you.

536
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,749
I'm proud of you.

537
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,385
My biggest regret is that they
never got to meet their grandson.

538
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,997
You have a family?

539
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,030
Uh, my son.

540
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,535
Henry. He's named after my dad.

541
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,940
There he is.

542
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:59,572
Oh, my heavens!
What a little doll.

543
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,680
- He's 13 months.
- Oh. That's a handful.

544
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:07,182
Between him and a full-time
job, no wonder you need a nanny.

545
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,079
Is your husband a doctor too?

546
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,623
I'm alone now. There
was an accident.

547
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,732
Oh, my God, Kerry. I'm so sorry.

548
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,302
- Was it recent?
- Last year.

549
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,398
Oh, Kerry. My dear Kerry.

550
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,571
We are tested.

551
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,371
But the Lord gives us strength.

552
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,442
I can only imagine how
difficult this has been.

553
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,946
But you have to have faith.

554
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,280
Paul wrote in Romans 8:

555
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,947
I am convinced that
neither death nor life...

556
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:50,494
nor angels nor rulers nor things
present nor things to come...

557
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:55,690
can separate us from the love
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

558
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,777
- Are you waiting?
- What?

559
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,422
Oh, no. Go ahead.

560
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,292
This is my Uncle Jackson.

561
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,701
Loved stealing cars.

562
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,336
Just had a real passion for it.

563
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,096
Do you have any
pictures of my father?

564
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,433
Just one.

565
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:41,312
When I was away in Indiana,
Cody drove all the way up to see me.

566
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,107
Didn't even have a license yet.

567
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,415
For the life of me, I don't know what
we thought we had to smile about.

568
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,823
This is my family, Helen.

569
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,623
This woman's name
is Sandy Lopez...

570
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,421
and she's not my nanny.

571
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,497
- She was my partner.
- Your partner?

572
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,994
My lover, my wife,
the mother of my child.

573
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,962
She was a firefighter
and she died last year.

574
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,236
You're gay?

575
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:15,814
Yes.

576
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,852
I wanted to tell you
earlier but I was afraid.

577
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,021
My mom and dad died
before I came to accept it...

578
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,852
so I never got a
chance to tell them.

579
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:33,021
So they never knew
you made this choice?

580
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:37,328
It's not a choice. It's who
I am, who I was born as.

581
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,705
- Will you pray with me?
- No.

582
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,967
No. I am not gonna do this.

583
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,203
Kerry, please. Kerry!

584
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,644
<i>I didn't mean to offend you.</i>

585
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:53,712
- I was so glad to find you.
- And my being gay changes that?

586
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,081
- This is who I am.
- It's wrong, Kerry.

587
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,257
- I knew this was a mistake.
- It's not what God created.

588
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,825
Why are people like you
always saying things like that?

589
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,895
Why are people like you so
dismissive of people of faith?

590
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:08,363
Because you have no faith that
God knew what he was doing...

591
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,229
that God created me too.

592
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,564
God did create you
and he loves you.

593
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:16,174
What is it about us that is
so much more threatening...

594
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,833
than all the really terrible
things in the world?

595
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,741
- Don't dismiss me so easily.
- I mean, people are starving...

596
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,077
people are being shot at, men
are flying planes into buildings...

597
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,243
yet the faithful are saying,
"Watch out for those lesbians.

598
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,616
They're gonna destroy
our God-gifted lives."

599
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,223
Well, the world isn't
perfect. It's what we make it.

600
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,758
You just finished telling
me how perfect it was.

601
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,419
That neither life, nor
death, angels nor rulers...

602
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:42,226
can separate us from the love
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

603
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,631
I know the words, I
was raised in the Church.

604
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,566
Then you know
its healing mission.

605
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,435
Except that the welcome
sign's not out for everyone, is it?

606
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,538
- Do you hate all faith?
- No.

607
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,739
No, of course not. I hate that
my own faith now excludes me...

608
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,885
tries to tell me I'm a sinner
because of the people I love.

609
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,919
It's the people
you've chosen to love.

610
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:08,759
I have made a choice, to
stop living a lie about who I am.

611
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,487
I was alone in my soul.

612
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,256
Do you know
what that feels like?

613
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,568
My hotel is nearby.
I think I'll walk.

614
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,577
They won't budge. I
called Cleveland Memorial...

615
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,585
she goes there twice a
week. She's in their turkey files.

616
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,780
We're not gonna
cure her habit today.

617
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,187
Just kick her out.
Weaver's gonna be pissed.

618
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,986
Watch and learn.
Mrs. Bulowski...

619
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,130
I understand you're
experiencing pain.

620
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,959
It's better, but I think one
more shot would really do it.

621
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,465
- You've already had two.
- Hey.

622
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:53,162
Well, the problem is that
when you use it regularly...

623
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,418
as I think that you do,
it doesn't work as well...

624
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,008
and you can grow
dependent on it.

625
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,838
Are you saying that my
wife is some drug addict?

626
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,004
- You don't know what real pain is.
- I'm not sure that's fair.

627
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,040
- What do you know?
- Mr. Bulowski.

628
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,515
You think it's fair that my
wife has this kind of pain?

629
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,813
You said you would
bring her another shot.

630
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,480
- I'm not talking to you!
- Jerry, call Security.

631
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,286
- You like stringing people along? That it?
- You need to calm...

632
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,691
Will you get the hell
away from me?! Oh!

633
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,563
Come on! BETH: Aah!

634
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,063
Get him off of me. Beth!

635
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,862
Come on! Where the hell are you?

636
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,164
Beth! Beth! Get
them off of me, Beth!

637
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,499
Ow!

638
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,370
- Beth! Beth get...
- Oh. Ah...

639
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,137
What the hell am I doing?

640
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,542
I got her.

641
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:38,808
Who's winning?

642
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,179
Neela was about to deck
somebody with a bedpan.

643
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,911
I've always wanted to see that.

644
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,352
Hard to let go of a
dream, isn't it, Jerry?

645
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,083
- So are we under control?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

646
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,229
- Thought you were gone for the day.
- Yeah, me too.

647
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,694
Charlotte? Charlotte?

648
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,891
It's okay. She's gonna
be back, Mrs. Devon.

649
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,730
- Hey, where's her daughter?
- She had to pick up her kids.

650
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,872
- What's she doing?
- Is the roast...?

651
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,201
Is the roast going to be ready?

652
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,400
Don't worry. The roast
is gonna be just fine.

653
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,913
She's folding napkins
for her dinner party.

654
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,744
The literature says that you shouldn't
play into this delusional thinking...

655
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,853
but I don't really get the
point in this case, do you?

656
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,856
- You got this?
- I think so.

657
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,250
- Dr. Weaver.
- What's going on with Pick's disease?

658
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,397
Found a bed for her tonight. Her
daughter managed a placement...

659
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,555
but they won't take
her until tomorrow.

660
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,759
Hey, I just wanted
you to know that, um...

661
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,268
I'm willing to have Jane
assigned to me anytime.

662
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,031
- I bet. She's good.
- Heh.

663
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,538
Yeah, no kidding.

664
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,769
Hey, so did you hear? They're
bringing in a fisherman versus horse.

665
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,242
- Versus horse?
- Yeah, I know.

666
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,313
You'd think it'd
be versus fish...

667
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,540
- but, you know, who am I...?
- Go.

668
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,579
- Hey, Kerry.
- Hey. Aren't you in a little early?

669
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,726
An hour. With Sam on
days and me on nights...

670
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,623
just trying to steal a
moment when I can.

671
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,790
- Good night.
- Thanks.

672
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,834
Good evening. Can I help you?

673
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,014
Helen?

674
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,513
Helen.

675
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:06,397
They tell you the coffee's free, you
just got to pay for the room, that's all.

676
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,031
You think about a day
like this for a long time.

677
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,501
You play out every
scenario in your head.

678
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,870
Except for this one.

679
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,575
- Is it because I gave you up?
- No.

680
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,876
No, of course not.

681
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,146
Is it because I didn't come
looking for you for so many years?

682
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,852
You don't get to paint the
whole picture yourself, Helen.

683
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,319
Feel guilty because you gave up a
child and then get all warm and fuzzy...

684
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,331
because it turned out all right, she
had a good family, became a doctor.

685
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,031
If you're disappointed, it should
be with the limits of your faith...

686
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,230
not in the way that
I've lived my life.

687
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,068
I gave birth to a child
who I abandoned...

688
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,270
for all the right
reasons, they told me.

689
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,579
But I thought about you.

690
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,752
And I came to realize
that by giving you up...

691
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,415
I'd broken my own heart.

692
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:11,586
Faith is the only thing
that gave me hope...

693
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,164
gave me courage.

694
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,902
I can't abandon it too.

695
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,771
Can you accept me for who I am?

696
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:27,440
I can love you, whoever you are.

697
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,940
I don't want love
without acceptance.

698
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,821
It was so good to
finally meet you.
