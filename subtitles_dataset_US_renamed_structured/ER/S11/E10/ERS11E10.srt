1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,866
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,368
You look like an
old-fashioned doctor.

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,740
Well, I am an
old-fashioned doctor.

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,714
Give yourself at least a
week to be better than us.

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,979
You're doing great. I
just wanted to tell you...

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,988
that there are still many, many,
many problems for you to work on.

7
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:28,219
And if there's one word I can't
emphasize enough, Susan, it's "leadership."

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,523
That's it. Carry on.

9
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,536
Right. Down from last
year, I can see that.

10
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,574
Patient satisfaction scores?

11
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,146
Yes. Rush had a higher average.
They also have a bigger budget.

12
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,646
How'd we do?

13
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,148
All right, fine. I'm on it.

14
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,344
- Weaver?
- Yup.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,354
Otherwise known as the
four-letter word beginning with a "C."

16
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,752
Crab?

17
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:01,726
Seventy-three percent of respondents
would not recommend this ER to others.

18
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,832
Our patients hate us. More precisely,
they hate Residents for not listening...

19
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,902
not spending enough time. Ray,
Morris, Pratt, all scored 2.5 or lower.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,006
- Ah, it could be worse.
- The best being a five.

21
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,733
- Oops.
- Last in the class, Neela, at 2.12.

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,107
- How about Abby?
- Not bad, 4.15, but she has other issues.

23
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,544
They don't make
interns like they used to.

24
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,918
They're focused on
the science at first.

25
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:28,715
Once convinced they've mastered it,
they're free to focus on humanistic skills.

26
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,290
They're works in progress.
They have to be taught.

27
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,256
But you can't teach empathy.

28
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,759
Or common sense.

29
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,692
- Ray?
- Yeah?

30
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,731
People want to see a
doctor, not a rock star.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,699
Put on some scrubs. We do
have a dress code here, people.

32
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,636
No stains, no tattered clothes,
no leather, no piercings. Got it?

33
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,242
You mean visible
piercings, right?

34
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,740
And if your shift starts at
7:00 and you come in at 7:02...

35
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,280
that's two minutes off
another Resident's life...

36
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,577
which is wrong and
salary-reducible.

37
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,413
You say something?

38
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:04,146
You think it's the tone of a woman's
voice that makes it easier to ignore?

39
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,952
Sorry?

40
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:12,332
I got a call from a renal Attending about
a dialysis order you finagled last week.

41
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,059
- "Finagled"?
- And in order to appease them...

42
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,228
I agreed to review three
months' worth of your charts.

43
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,670
- Wait a minute...
- There were concerns.

44
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,242
You started a central line
with no procedure notes.

45
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,402
Well, wait. You
reviewed all of my cases?

46
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,641
You admitted unstable angina patient
into telemetry before troponin was back.

47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,944
Yes. Well, the bed was
ready, the lab was slow.

48
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,678
And here we have:

49
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,757
"Patient presents with rash. Discussed
with Dr. Cohen, agrees with the plan."

50
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:42,089
The problem is no one in Derm, including
Dr. Cohen, ever heard of this patient.

51
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,096
Abby, these are legal
documents. In a court, these...

52
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,760
He had Lyme Disease. I didn't call Derm,
I called Cohen in ID. And who are you?

53
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,598
- What?
- MVA, ETA two minutes.

54
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,940
You get promoted, everyone's a
slouch and I'm falsifying legal documents?

55
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,941
- Look, I'm...
- Forget it. I'm on break.

56
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,445
- Residents don't get breaks.
- I'm waiting for the MVA, then.

57
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,908
Help, my brother's
bleeding. You a doctor?

58
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,635
- What happened?
- They shot him!

59
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,371
- Where'd he get hit?
- You gotta help. I think he's dying.

60
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,312
Hey!

61
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,314
Hey! What...?

62
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,782
- Go!
- What are you doing?

63
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,086
- Go, man, come on.
- Hey!

64
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,204
Get off me. What are...?

65
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,045
Stop this car. What
are you doing?

66
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,743
Help!

67
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,457
Help!

68
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,424
Loose. Loose!

69
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,627
Stop, hey. Help!

70
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,959
Shut up.

71
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,564
- He's in the back.
- What?

72
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,729
Get in the back of the car!

73
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,070
Got me from behind,
came out the front.

74
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,078
- Oh, my God.
- Fix him!

75
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,916
He needs to go to the hospital.

76
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,526
Fix my brother, bitch,
before I blow your head off!

77
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,994
Try to stay calm, all right?

78
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,133
- Trying.
- How long have you been short of breath?

79
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,600
Day or so. My regular
doctor's on vacation.

80
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,365
- I'm pretty particular about who I see.
- Smart lady.

81
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,371
Dr. Barnett will be
with you right away.

82
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,602
SeÃ±ora, you need to settle down.

83
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,613
Ma'am, the splinter is out. It
can't possibly still hurt, okay?

84
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,681
Neosporin and
wound-care instructions?

85
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,788
- Yeah, you got it.
- So, uh, was she faking or what?

86
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:59,051
No. That's what's affectionately
known in the ER as "Hispanic panic."

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,694
Okay. Let's see, we've got
cough and dyspnea on exertion.

88
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,028
How are we feeling,
Miss, um... Mitchell?

89
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,231
Ms. So-so, I guess.

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,861
Okay. "Ms." it is.

91
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,566
We're gonna run a few tests, get back,
and examine you as soon as possible.

92
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,211
- ICON, CBC, and chest x-ray.
- EKG too?

93
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,710
You the man.

94
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,475
I thought "Ms."
went out in the '80s.

95
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,641
Here you go, for the urinalysis.

96
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,087
Um... Is there any chance
that I could see another doctor?

97
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,489
He's lost a lot of blood. I don't
think there's anything I can do.

98
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,097
All right, um, let me
try to stop the bleeding.

99
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,706
Do you have a napkin,
or a towel, or anything?

100
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,673
No. All he's got is CD's and crap.
CJ, you got any towels in your ride?

101
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,335
Use whatever you got
until we get some supplies.

102
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,505
Listen to me. You need more
than supplies, you need surgery.

103
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,173
No.

104
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,616
- Just patch me up, I'm good.
- You need to go to a hospital.

105
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,188
Make a list of everything
I'm gonna need.

106
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,191
Get her some paper.

107
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,237
- If she moves, shoot.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

108
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,706
I can't just patch you up. I can't.
Even if I could, it wouldn't help.

109
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,573
You have internal injuries,
okay? You could bleed to death.

110
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,307
Bullet went clean through. You
use a needle and thread if you got to.

111
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:33,283
And get us some antibiotics or
whatever. You got a medicine pad, right?

112
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,212
Start writing.

113
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,549
Cause of ulcerative
colitis is not known.

114
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,889
Probably some combination of
external agents and host factors.

115
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,088
- More common in women or men?
- Women.

116
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,564
Right. And peak incidence is
bi-modal. Who can tell me the age range?

117
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,259
- Excuse me. Miss?
- Yes?

118
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:54,465
I know you're not my doctor, but
melanoma, when spreading, how long?

119
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,408
It's impossible to say, sir. It depends
on the number of metastatic sites...

120
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,979
location of the
primary lesion...

121
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,140
a number of factors.

122
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,690
I'll make sure your
doctor comes to see you.

123
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,761
That was tough.

124
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,766
Yes. But there are some biological
explanations for excessive emotionality.

125
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,099
Who can tell me the
differential diagnosis of crying?

126
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,445
Starting with the obvious. Limbic-system
lesion, temporal lobe meds would do it.

127
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,605
It could also be a thyroid
dysfunction. Other ideas?

128
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,547
A sense of doom has been
associated with acute MI.

129
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,210
Right. Inappropriate weeping
can also be produced by...

130
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,856
Neela.

131
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,192
That man's just been
told his cancer has spread.

132
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,225
Don't you think he
has a reason to cry?

133
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,461
Well, yes, of course he does.

134
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,533
But there are also other organic causes
of crying which warrant consideration.

135
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,964
Excuse me.

136
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,571
This man's looking for
anyone who worked on Monday.

137
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,197
- I did. Can I help you?
- Um, my wife died here.

138
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,241
Uh, Jenna Putnam.

139
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:08,746
I was hoping to talk to anybody
that might remember her.

140
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,975
I don't believe she
was my patient.

141
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,717
Oh.

142
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm sorry. Maybe you can
ask at the nurses' station.

143
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,221
Someone there should
be able to help you.

144
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,255
Dr. Carter? This gentleman's
wife died here last week.

145
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,892
Oh.

146
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,332
I'm very sorry for your loss.

147
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,070
Thank you. Um...

148
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,834
I was up in Maine, and then
by the time I got back, uh...

149
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,905
You know, she was by herself.

150
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,679
You know.

151
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,079
And, well, I was just wondering
if maybe she said anything...

152
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,277
or, uh, you know,
if she was scared?

153
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,347
- What was her name?
- Jenna Putnam.

154
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,685
I'll look into it, I'm a social
worker. It might take me a while.

155
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,023
Do you want me to
call you at home, or...?

156
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,031
Oh. Uh... Could I wait
here? Is that okay?

157
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,896
All right. Uh...

158
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,472
Is there any way to know
what room she was in?

159
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,810
Not really. No.

160
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,971
All right, thank you.

161
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,218
- Sad.
- Yeah.

162
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,878
- It's nice of you, by the way.
- It's my job.

163
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,324
- Um...
- Yes?

164
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,791
It's forward of me, but I
was wondering if you'd...

165
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,988
It's bad enough I got saddled
with the shifts Chen dumped on me.

166
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,632
Now I got Residents bailing
too. Have you seen Abby?

167
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,063
No. Why?

168
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,431
She went to wait on a
rig, she's been MIA since.

169
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,095
- We can talk later.
- Okay.

170
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,501
When was this?

171
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,438
Hey, I got a couple more
GSWs en route. ETAs five.

172
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,944
- Okay. Half an hour ago, 40 minutes.
- She went out to meet a rig?

173
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,345
I called her on some stuff, she got
bent out of shape and stormed off.

174
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,487
I guess I hurt her feelings and
she declared herself "on break."

175
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:58,489
You know what? Malik, text message
Abby and tell her to get back on the job.

176
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,764
You don't got a cell phone?

177
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,997
Not with me.

178
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,597
My brother's got one.

179
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,037
Plays this funny little
song when somebody calls.

180
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,937
He's like the captain
of the ship, you know?

181
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,513
- What's his name?
- CJ.

182
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,041
What's yours?

183
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,287
Mostly they call me Little C.

184
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,956
Why?

185
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,825
Because CJ's really, really sick.
And I know your friend thinks...

186
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,898
Loose? He's our cousin.

187
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,364
Well...

188
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,402
I know he thinks CJ can be
helped this way, but he can't.

189
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,900
Okay?

190
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,406
You need to listen to me.
Listen to me. I'm a doctor.

191
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,637
Your brother's gonna die
unless he gets an operation.

192
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,407
So we have to take
him to the hospital.

193
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,913
Here's your stuff.

194
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,147
Get busy!

195
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,332
Another? Some kind
of gang war going on?

196
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,990
This one's got multiple GSWs
to the abdomen and legs.

197
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,831
- I ain't in no gang...
- Spontaneous resps, tachy at 121.

198
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,336
BP's holding, 106/64.

199
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,703
- I'm Dr. Lewis. What's your name?
- I was just waiting on the bus.

200
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,868
Second GSW's coming in on
another rig. This one's the youngest.

201
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,378
She looks 13. Jerry, did
you get hold of Abby yet?

202
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,540
Paging her now.

203
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,552
I need some light back
here. I can't see anything.

204
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,853
- What you gotta do first?
- Put his intestines back in.

205
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,189
- Is that hurting him?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,030
I have to keep pressure on this
to stop him from losing more blood.

207
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,294
Just do what you gotta do.

208
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,529
I can't do anything
while we're moving.

209
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,104
I think I hit something.

210
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,380
Oh, man, it's
a little kitty cat.

211
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,384
Hey, I think it's still alive.

212
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,561
Give me the gun.

213
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,363
Here.

214
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,094
I need you to help
me lift his head up.

215
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,604
Come on.

216
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,106
All right, CJ.

217
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,102
I need you to
swallow this, okay?

218
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,049
Oop... Okay.

219
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,620
CJ.

220
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,619
Come on, dog.

221
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,956
Good, man. Drink it all down.

222
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,125
That's good.

223
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,742
Don't be stupid, all
right? Pay attention.

224
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,754
- Come on. Sew me up.
- Not yet.

225
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,989
Give the codeine
a little time to work.

226
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:05,504
- One exit wound, right flank.
- My dad usually drives me.

227
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,505
- The other bullets must be in the belly.
- Through left thigh.

228
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,234
- Distal pulse is good.
- It was for his birthday.

229
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,279
Hang in there, Tisha. Ray,
call the O.R., we're on our way.

230
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,948
- Me?
- There's blood in the Foley.

231
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,913
Page Urology, the
bladder's been hit.

232
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,021
- Want me to call in a dinner order too?
- Roll on my count. One, two, three...

233
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,850
I was just going to the mall.

234
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,889
- Sats only 84.
- She needs an airway.

235
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,186
- Neela, go.
- Pratt, go.

236
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,122
- Pratt.
- Twenty of etomidate and 100 of sux.

237
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,699
- Set me up with a 75.
- Tachy at 133. BP's 82/50.

238
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,530
Central line kit, sterile gloves
and a gram of cefotetan.

239
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,263
- Can I do the femoral?
- Last resort in abdominal trauma.

240
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,069
Could pour blood and
fluids into a severed vessel.

241
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,975
How about a subclavian, then?

242
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,308
No. Call the blood bank. Tell them
to send type-specific to the O.R.

243
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,076
- Systolic's dropping, 78.
- Okay, another liter, mix up dopamine.

244
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,913
- Bag her.
- Urology knows.

245
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,319
- Good. Now call for an X-ray and a vent.
- Are you serious?

246
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,617
Second GSW coming in.
Can you spare a Resident?

247
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,091
- Yes, she can.
- Take Pratt too. We can handle this.

248
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,923
BP's 82/59. How much dopamine?

249
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,794
None. Aim for a relative hypotension
in a young person with internal bleeding.

250
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,232
If you jack up the BP,
she'll just bleed more.

251
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,735
Like this, she can tolerate.

252
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:15,068
Fine. Pretty controversial
approach. But, hey, I just work here.

253
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,074
Saline flush and 0 silk.

254
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,509
Hey, Malik. Can you
waste this ketamine for me?

255
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,240
- Done deal.
- Thanks.

256
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,951
Excuse me, sir?

257
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:33,354
I can feel her presence.
It's very strong here.

258
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,262
- Uh, sorry?
- Um...

259
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,662
I'm pretty sure this
is where my wife died.

260
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,669
She was in a car
accident this week.

261
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,863
Do you remember her?

262
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,771
Uh, I'm not quite sure that
I was working on that day.

263
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,310
Well, she has red hair. Uh...

264
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,380
Well, she had.

265
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,946
Flaming.

266
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,848
What was her name?

267
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,379
Jenna.

268
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,115
Hazel eyes.

269
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,024
Ringing any bells?

270
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:23,136
- This is stupid.
This is stupid. CJ: No.

271
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,203
- No. I'm feeling better.
- No. It's a needle and thread.

272
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,814
- It's not gonna work.
- He said he was feeling better.

273
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,008
You're gonna bleed to death.
Sewing you up like this is pointless.

274
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,914
- You need surgery.
- Do it.

275
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,988
- I can barely see what I'm doing.
- You heard him.

276
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,825
This should
numb it a little bit.

277
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,265
All right, it's good.

278
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,928
It's good!

279
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,869
All right.

280
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,774
Okay.

281
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,406
Listen...

282
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,347
brace yourself.

283
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,694
Aah! What you
doing to me, woman?

284
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,799
- It's just an IV, dude.
- What you call me?

285
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,698
We'll give you something for
the pain when we get this in.

286
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,703
- Ray, secondary survey, let's go.
- Yeah. You're okay, homey.

287
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,637
- Bullet grazed the scalp.
- You buy a book to talk like that?

288
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,711
He's saying you're lucky the
bullet didn't cause more damage.

289
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,244
You the lucky one. You free!

290
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,644
Wound's superficial,
chest clear, pelvis stable.

291
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:40,583
- Distal pulse is good.
- I bet you like hip-hop too. Mr. Cool Guy.

292
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,781
Send for a CBC, trauma panel, PT,
PTT, type and screen, and five of morphine.

293
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,892
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Shut up.

294
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,122
- Bolus is in.
- TKO. What else?

295
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,732
That's it. Entrance and exit sites,
left arm. Small laceration, right arm.

296
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,129
- Dr. Barnett, that lady's asking for you.
- Thanks.

297
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,667
Whoa, you didn't roll him yet.

298
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,236
- Pratt's got him.
- Excuse me?

299
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,270
- He's got a better connection.
- What?

300
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,670
He's not comfortable with
me, what do you want?

301
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,971
Ray, we're in the middle of a
trauma. Nobody gets to be comfortable.

302
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,841
I got a patient who needs me.

303
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,911
- How's he doing?
- He's gonna die...

304
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,714
- if he doesn't get to a hospital.
- Pssh.

305
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,989
Listen.

306
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,320
Can I ask what's the plan here?

307
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,656
To stay out of sight
until the cops are gone.

308
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,764
Then we can get him home.

309
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,963
To get something to eat.

310
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,664
I need to talk about your
patient satisfaction scores.

311
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,775
- Problem?
- They sucked. Abby, you there?

312
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,935
Abby, you can't be serious.
Come on, walking off a shift?

313
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,104
If you're there, pick up.

314
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,773
Fine. All right, call me
if you get this message.

315
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,442
- Wow, was she really that pissed off?
- Abby left?

316
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,988
Yeah. Now I'm pissed. Here,
Neela. Go satisfy a patient.

317
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,353
Weeping pregnant
teenager in Curtain 3.

318
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,224
Make eye contact, introduce yourself,
stay in the room more than two minutes.

319
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,889
- I'm about to go and do a digital block.
- I'm not really asking.

320
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,695
Dr. Lewis?

321
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,201
Uh, that patient of Ray's
is still waiting to see you.

322
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,170
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. What'd she say?
- Uh...

323
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,868
- Fatigue and shortness of breath.
- No, about Ray.

324
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,481
- Oh. I don't know. She didn't say.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Lewis. What's the problem?

325
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,346
- Just a little winded mostly.
- Any fever? Coughing up any junk?

326
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,850
No.

327
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,416
- A little effusion here.
- What's that mean?

328
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:29,688
Uh, just some fluid around your lungs.
But heart looks good. No pneumonia.

329
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,529
- Does that hurt?
- No. I just...

330
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,830
I didn't tell the
other doctor that...

331
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,573
Sam, could you go
check on her labs?

332
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,177
Sure.

333
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,743
- Why is Lewis seeing my patient?
- Uh, the patient...

334
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,578
The labs got back a second ago.
What the hell does she want from me?

335
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,085
Ms. Mitchell, I'm so
sorry to keep you waiting.

336
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,122
I think I can explain to you
why you've been so tired lately.

337
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,856
You're pregnant.
Congratulations.

338
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,689
I think I got this.

339
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,388
No, you don't.

340
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,456
Come again?

341
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,199
Excuse us.

342
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,305
I still need to work up the effusion.
But I don't need a chaperone for...

343
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,034
She requested another doctor.

344
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,202
Why would she do that?

345
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,645
Maybe because she's a he and
didn't feel comfortable telling you...

346
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,375
that she's a pre-op transsexual.

347
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,654
But it was a positive
pregnancy test.

348
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:36,218
Yeah. Which in a man,
means only one thing.

349
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,065
Eleven fifty-two, please.

350
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,767
- Busy night, huh?
- A little.

351
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,983
Three cheeseburgers,
three fries.

352
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,588
Three sodas.

353
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,929
One bottled water, one Frosty.

354
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,434
Anything else?

355
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,057
- Have a nice night.
- Thanks. You too.

356
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,800
So...

357
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:57,068
snowboarding, you and I,
overnight at Telluride next Friday?

358
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,973
Ah. Oh...

359
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,306
What? Don't tell
me you're a skier.

360
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,004
That, and, uh...

361
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,673
I have other plans.

362
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,243
Oh.

363
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,649
Dr. Carter, I think my
6-year-old knee pain has skiffy.

364
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,051
A little young for that.
Go ahead, order the films.

365
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,424
Look, I, uh...

366
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,588
I realize this might
sound a bit weird.

367
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,757
Me and Abby have been
roommates for a while.

368
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,563
But you've known her for a lot longer.
I was wondering if I should be worried.

369
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,034
- She's not back yet?
- No.

370
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,766
I can't imagine her just
walking off her shift, can you?

371
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,275
Uh, no. But that doesn't
mean that she wouldn't.

372
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,924
Hello?

373
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,794
Hey.

374
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,899
- What?
- I need to use the bathroom.

375
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,368
Please.

376
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,038
You just drove right
past the gas station.

377
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,377
You just drove
past the gas station.

378
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,293
Where are you going?

379
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,069
Excuse me. Where are you going?

380
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,406
You know what? It's okay.

381
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,073
It's okay. Never mind.

382
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,929
- Look, I really don't... Okay.
- Get out. I said get out.

383
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,439
- Let's move.
- Okay.

384
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,306
You said you had to go.

385
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,951
Go.

386
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,286
But you ain't going alone.

387
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,160
- Right here?
- Drop them and go.

388
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,232
Come on.

389
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,338
Scared of big black men, huh?

390
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,672
No. I'm scared
of big black guns.

391
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,354
- Yeah. Soon, hopefully.
- CJ?

392
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,615
- I don't know exactly.
- CJ, how are you doing?

393
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,019
I'm not sure.

394
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,584
Whew. Yeah. Okay, I guess.

395
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,558
See that?

396
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,231
Now look here.

397
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,961
Just got mine a few weeks ago.

398
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,771
- Healed nice.
- What's it mean?

399
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,873
- It's getting cold though.
- I don't know exactly.

400
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,938
He don't wanna tell me.

401
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,274
Told me not to get one.

402
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,611
- Whatever. Find out soon enough.
- Yeah. All right, dog.

403
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,377
Yeah, peace.

404
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,622
Cops been all over the 'hood.

405
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,694
Boo said he'll call when they're
gone. We'll take him home then.

406
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,992
Yo, give me those, man.

407
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,225
What? My comics? For real?

408
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,838
- I need them for the fire.
- Dog, I'm right in the middle of a story.

409
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,306
I'll tell you a story.

410
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,470
So there's this punk
and his girl, right?

411
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,972
They was parked out
in the middle of nowhere.

412
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,517
Know what I'm saying? Kind
of like this. They was in the car.

413
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,352
Working it.

414
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,923
Getting things all hot and
sweaty. You know what I'm saying?

415
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,090
But on the radio...

416
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,288
Can I have one of those?

417
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,105
Gives you cancer.

418
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,837
She has been under
a lot of pressure.

419
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,272
It's still not like her.

420
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,379
- She can also be very emotional.
- Easily hurt, stubborn.

421
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,216
Then again, she might
just be going out for a walk.

422
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,443
Probably just blowing
off smoke someplace.

423
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,009
- Steam.
- Hmm?

424
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,122
Did you two finish
your QA reports?

425
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,054
- Uh, no. Not quite exactly, no.
- When were those due again?

426
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,227
This sucks.

427
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,624
- Susan.
- You know why?

428
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,321
- It sets a tone.
- What tone?

429
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,400
If my Attendings don't take me
seriously, why should the staff?

430
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,036
You're taken seriously.

431
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,229
All right, what do I
have to do, pull rank?

432
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:30,001
I'm the chief of this department. If I
set a deadline, it needs to be honored.

433
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,905
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- No, forget sorry.

434
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,637
Just do what I
ask when I ask it.

435
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,711
Dr. Carter, that
gang kid's crashing.

436
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,685
I guess the fire helped.

437
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,085
He ain't shivering no more.

438
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,195
CJ?

439
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,393
CJ? He's apneic.
Get him on his back.

440
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,397
- What's apneic?
- He's not breathing.

441
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,661
No, no. He's warm right now.

442
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,036
- He doesn't have a pulse.
- What are you doing?

443
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,336
- Trying to get his heart started.
- What happened?

444
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,442
He was just fine
five minutes ago.

445
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,602
- Sats down to 79.
- What did the CT show?

446
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,678
Keeps getting bumped
for more acute cases.

447
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,440
More acute than this?

448
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,276
- Seizure stopped.
- The wound was superficial.

449
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,546
- The guy had a GCS of 15.
- Tangential GSWs...

450
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,520
can cause intracranial bleeding.
- You saw him.

451
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,921
- He was lucid and talking.
- Bilateral papilledema.

452
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,753
- Fifty of mannitol.
- He's not moving air.

453
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,455
Intubate, and this time run
him through the scanner.

454
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:27,832
Eight-oh on a mac two.

455
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,639
- He needs a hospital.
- He ain't gonna let us do that.

456
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:39,278
He's unconscious. He can't
tell you what to do anymore.

457
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,705
CJ, can you hear me?

458
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,874
- Can you hear me, CJ?
- He can't hear you.

459
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,985
- Just do something.
- I am.

460
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,450
Watch your back.

461
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,147
- Sedation's wearing off.
- Dose him again when we get inside.

462
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,292
The movement
will jack up his ICP.

463
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,720
What did CT say?

464
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,056
Diffused hemorrhagic
contusions with edema.

465
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,291
- Ventricles are collapsed.
- He's bradying down.

466
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,431
Blown pupil. Neurosurg
ready for him?

467
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,332
They said the bleed
was inoperative.

468
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:08,133
If we don't decompress the
brain, he'll herniate and die.

469
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,468
Sam, page Neurosurg again.

470
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,803
They're stuck in the
O.R. with a shunt revision.

471
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,971
- We'll do a ventriculostomy here.
- Cool.

472
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,082
- Sam, let's get Neela up for this.
- What?

473
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:21,084
- I've only gotten to do it once before.
- Yeah. And she's never done it at all.

474
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,914
Somebody needs
to help me do this.

475
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,286
- Do what?
- The breathing part.

476
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:33,092
One breath after
I count to five.

477
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,034
I can't do it myself anymore.

478
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,604
You.

479
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:50,506
Okay, fine. You do the compressions,
I'll do the breathing. Get in here.

480
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,612
Here. Put your hands like this.

481
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,651
Here, you press
down hard five times.

482
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,950
One, two, three, four, five.

483
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,353
I'll give a breath.

484
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:07,729
Ready? One, two,
three, four, five.

485
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,196
- Go. Go.
- Come on. Do it.

486
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,865
- Go ahead.
- One, two, three...

487
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,474
- I need a flush.
- Sorry, it took a while to find her.

488
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,974
Checked Jumbo Mart.
Abby's not there. What's this?

489
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,339
A ventriculostomy.

490
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,504
- I've made the skin incision.
- What?

491
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:25,150
- Three-oh silk.
- Getting your flash, Pratt.

492
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:29,482
Separate the attachments of the
temporal muscle from the bone.

493
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,548
- Is it normal to have this much bleeding?
- Yes.

494
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,818
Sterile gauze and retractor.

495
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:42,560
- I can't see.
- More gauze, Sam.

496
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,329
Frontal bones exposed.

497
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:49,066
Nice. You'll use the twist drill
to penetrate the outer cranium.

498
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:54,040
Hold it perpendicular to the skull
toward the ipsilateral medial canthus.

499
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,010
Like this?

500
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,277
Perfect.

501
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,578
You can do this, okay?

502
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,223
- Hey. Oh, sorry.
- What is it?

503
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,120
I just need Neela
when she has a sec.

504
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,090
Is this about my
pregnant teenager?

505
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,028
No. A guy whose wife died last week.
He's been hanging around the hospital.

506
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,463
Wants to talk to the
doctor who handled her.

507
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,227
That'd be you.

508
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,695
One, two...

509
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,933
- three, four, five.
- Where are we?

510
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,777
- One, two, three...
- I don't know.

511
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,383
- Four, five.
- He really needs help.

512
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,816
Can't... Can't do it no more.

513
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,648
Can't do it no more.

514
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,415
I got it.

515
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,382
One, two, three...

516
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,155
four, five.

517
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:55,135
One, two, three, four, five.

518
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,509
Hey.

519
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,110
Hi.

520
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:03,507
Dr. Lewis was pulled onto a critical
case and won't be available for a while.

521
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:06,982
Now, I'm sure you'd
prefer her to do this.

522
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,677
But we don't have a lot of time.

523
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:12,347
And, unfortunately, I'm going
to have to be the one to tell you.

524
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,753
We think you have
testicular cancer.

525
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,294
What?

526
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,022
Yeah, your urine was positive...

527
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,167
for a hormone called Beta HCG.

528
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,327
Now, in women that
hormone means pregnancy.

529
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,440
In men it means
testicular cancer.

530
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,702
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. We ran a number of blood tests...

531
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,939
that support the diagnosis. We
will do a testicular ultrasound.

532
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,174
But, yeah, I'm sure.

533
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,348
But listen, it's treatable.

534
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,785
Even if it spreads...

535
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,949
- your chances are great, okay?
- That's funny.

536
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:52,795
- What?
- I was getting rid of the equipment.

537
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,098
Ms. Mitchell...

538
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,699
you mind if I ask you why
you wanted another doctor?

539
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,374
It's like you put
on a show here...

540
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,514
like you're not comfortable
in your own skin.

541
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,611
I don't trust that kind of
energy. I know it too well.

542
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,024
Three, four, five.

543
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,726
He dying?

544
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,996
Two, three...

545
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,261
four, five.

546
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,870
He ain't dying, bitch.

547
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,199
You hear me?

548
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:38,833
- Don't you let him die!
- Three, four, five.

549
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,774
Come on!

550
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,577
One, two, three.

551
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,556
- Come on.
- No, wait.

552
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,958
- Wait. Please.
- I said, let's go.

553
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,662
Got no shovel here.
We'll do it somewhere else.

554
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,965
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.

555
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,874
Lay down.

556
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,902
Let's go.

557
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,841
I said, lay down.

558
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,313
- Transducer's reading on the portable.
- Bring a dose of Ativan.

559
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,425
- Pratt, walk him up to ICU.
- Me?

560
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,823
Yeah, just to be safe.

561
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,054
Thank you. That was incredible.

562
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,863
You're gifted
technically, Neela.

563
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,594
That's what makes you feel
best. Now all you have to do:

564
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,739
Take the confidence you have
when you do a procedure like that...

565
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,932
and put it in the other
half of your game.

566
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,374
- Not sure I know what you mean.
- Here's her chart.

567
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,911
Jenna Putnam, multiple
injuries sustained in MVC.

568
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,413
- Your signature.
- I still can't believe it.

569
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,020
You handle what, 20, 30 cases a
day? Easy to see how you could forget.

570
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,451
But it was just Monday.

571
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,183
- I don't know what to tell him.
- Yes, you do.

572
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,355
Dr. Kovac, I have no
memory of that man's wife.

573
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,862
- Are you telling me to lie?
- No. I'm telling you...

574
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,863
to trust yourself
enough to comfort.

575
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,204
Mr. Putnam?

576
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,641
Yes?

577
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,372
I'm sorry I didn't recognize
your wife's name earlier.

578
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,541
Oh, no. That's okay.

579
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,619
But you do remember
her now, though?

580
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,886
She was lovely.

581
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,659
She talked about how
much you meant to her.

582
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,057
How much she loved you.

583
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,495
And I don't think
she was scared.

584
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,143
Hey.

585
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,080
Changed my plans.

586
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,738
- I'm sorry?
- Telluride. I'm in.

587
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,407
If the offer's still open.

588
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,849
Yeah. Yeah.

589
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,921
- What?
- Nothing.

590
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,250
Oh, it's something. I can tell.

591
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,120
I just...

592
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,497
Are you all right moving...

593
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,758
forward with...

594
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,129
- this?
- Yeah.

595
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,895
Are you?

596
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah. Yeah.

597
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,534
- Good.
- Okay.

598
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,069
She wasn't even in the room?

599
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,612
- Nope.
- He pulled her from somewhere else?

600
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,442
Hey, Carter, I
need your opinion.

601
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,049
- Talk to you later?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,152
- What's up?
- Neurosurg called...

603
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,221
to find out why Kovac did a
ventriculostomy in the ER...

604
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,323
which is difficult
enough to explain.

605
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,188
Factor in the idea that he
actually let Neela perform it.

606
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,229
- And so...?
- A, it's a very difficult procedure.

607
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,195
B, in a delicate
situation like that...

608
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,632
it's customary to let the senior
Resident have first crack at it...

609
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:34,830
- and Pratt was right there.
- Hey, I told her it was no big deal.

610
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,168
Well, I'm gonna talk
to Kovac about it.

611
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:39,140
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

612
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,508
- You don't think that's an overreaction?
- Thanks for your support.

613
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,377
Susan, I understand you
want to define yourself as chief.

614
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,984
- I do, we all do.
- But?

615
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,019
Are you sure that this is
the way you want to do it?

616
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,260
Stop crying, man. It
won't bring him back.

617
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,735
It's almost 10:00. They'll be
getting up around the block.

618
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,532
Listen.

619
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,275
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

620
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,111
Okay, I really won't.

621
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,214
I just wanna go home.

622
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,190
Hiding out, are you?

623
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,060
Uh... Maybe.

624
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:38,533
Sometimes I'd use
the utility closet instead.

625
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:41,298
Worse lighting,
but more privacy.

626
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,365
- So how's it going?
- Good.

627
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,145
Actually, it blows. Every time I
turn around, I'm offending someone...

628
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:54,286
or hurting someone's
feelings or acting like a total...

629
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,417
- crab.
- Tell me about it.

630
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,754
It sucks to be in charge.

631
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,724
So, what do you do?

632
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,324
Get used to not being liked.

633
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,900
That's it? That's your advice?

634
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:19,570
Look, it's what we as women
have the hardest time with.

635
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,804
We want to be liked,
care what people think.

636
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,747
The fact is, when you're in a position
of authority, you'll piss people off...

637
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,579
and you're gonna lose friends.

638
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,086
Thanks.

639
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,923
Hope it helps.

640
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,269
<i>Hi, this is Abby.
Leave a message.</i>

641
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,605
Hey, it's Susan. You're
probably not there.

642
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:58,841
Don't know, maybe you're at the movies
or down by the river having a smoke.

643
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:03,478
If that's the case, I should be
pissed. If it's not, I'm worried.

644
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,147
Uh... Hopefully I'll see you
before you get this message.

645
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,958
Sorry about today.

646
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,145
This is it.

647
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:46,398
Let's go. We got
business to take care of.

648
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,424
Get out.

649
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:20,395
Thanks anyway.
