1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,440
- You won't tell me how you feel.
- It's fine.

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,579
See a couples therapist. Can't
do that, work separate shifts.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,044
This is our niece, Shelley.

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,876
I just found out they were here.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,450
We're waiting on Social
Services to come down here.

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,882
It was my father's.

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,113
I want you to have it.

9
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,052
It suits you.

10
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,270
Surveying your kingdom?

11
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,513
I was just wondering, what
do they do with all the dirt?

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,112
When is it supposed to open?

13
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,748
A year from September.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,119
Hey, congratulations,
by the way.

15
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,985
Tenure.

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,457
Thank you.

17
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,289
What? That's not a good thing?

18
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,987
No, it's good.

19
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,689
It's great.

20
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,301
So you got about two weeks
left on your internship, huh?

21
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,201
You ready to be an R2?

22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,205
Do I have a choice?

23
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,638
Can't believe it went so fast.

24
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,574
- I don't hear many interns say that.
- Hmm.

25
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,246
Who's Joshua?

26
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:29,288
- Family member.
- Yes, I got that from the "Carter" part.

27
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,222
Joshua's what Kem and I
were gonna name the baby.

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,661
It's a good thing
you're doing here, John.

29
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,802
If Surgery's mad some guy went
up without a central line, they scream.

30
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,201
GI's pissed some ulcerative
colitis went home without follow-up...

31
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,777
- who do they yell at?
- Me.

32
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,072
You got it.

33
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,340
You also have office hours for
the med students and Residents...

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,349
to stop by if they have
any problems or questions.

35
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,374
I get an office?

36
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:02,546
Well, other chiefs
haven't really used it.

37
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,952
Where is it?

38
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,525
Morris, "office hours" is
just a figure of speech.

39
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,423
Just make yourself
available at Admit.

40
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,086
You're the new head cheerleader.

41
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:14,200
Organize parties, treats for Residents
working holidays, host happy hours.

42
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,202
- Do I get a budget for that?
- Yeah. It's called your ATM card.

43
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,106
Next year's Resident contracts.

44
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:23,039
Sign them and have them in
my box by the end of the week.

45
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,702
Dr. Barnett, we need to
find time to talk about yours.

46
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,878
- So you two work together?
- Yeah. In the ER at County.

47
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,350
I'm a nurse.

48
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,112
Luka's a doctor.

49
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,881
Must be challenging.

50
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,650
Can be.

51
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,385
Place is an insane asylum.

52
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,721
How long have you been together?

53
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,293
About a year, on
and off. Mostly on.

54
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,867
Have you sought therapy before?

55
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,432
No.

56
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,145
So, what brings you to me today?

57
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,748
I don't think Luka and
I should be together.

58
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,811
Another four of MS
along with two of Versed?

59
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,609
Was that a statement
or a question?

60
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,718
- Four of MS, two of Versed!
- Want Ativan?

61
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,125
Oh, God! It hurts! NEELA: No.

62
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,983
It has too long a half-life
for pre-op assessment.

63
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,887
- Calm down.
- What's all the ruckus?

64
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,654
Mr. Lillion was checking radiator
leaks while his engine was running.

65
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,560
- I caught my hair in the damn belt!
- Avulsed his whole scalp.

66
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,635
- Okay.
- Then he tried to pull his hair...

67
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,170
- out of the moving fan with his hands.
- Ouch.

68
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,399
Open fracture of third
and fourth metacarpals.

69
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,839
- And extensor-tendon lacs.
- You want antibiotics?

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,411
- A gram of Ancef IV piggyback.
- Anything else?

71
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,912
A hundred of
gentamicin. Why gent?

72
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,751
Because open fractures are
susceptible to Gram-negative organisms.

73
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,551
Pratt. Some guy out front
says he's a friend of yours.

74
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,853
- What's his complaint?
- Nothing he'll tell me.

75
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,519
Says he knows you from high school.
- Go. I got this.

76
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,857
Aargh!

77
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,336
- Darnell.
- Greg, how are you doing?

78
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,565
- What's up, man?
- My boy.

79
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,242
- Remember K.J., right?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,174
- What's up, little man?
- Get up and say hello to Dr. Pratt.

81
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,711
- Where's the love at?
- Right?

82
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,348
- Getting big.
- Tell me about it.

83
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,108
- What's up?
- Somewhere we can talk?

84
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,412
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right. Be right back.

85
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,420
- I'm happy.
- No, you're not.

86
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,689
- I'm not.
- Nobody is happy all the time.

87
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,224
He's like a sphinx. I never
know what he's thinking.

88
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,026
We talk.

89
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,195
We don't talk. I talk.

90
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,893
You sit there and smile.

91
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,403
Occasionally, you nod.

92
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,941
And then I get mad. I'm
always the one getting angry.

93
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,601
- I'm always the one yelling.
- You want me to get angry?

94
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,940
Yeah. That would be nice.

95
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,777
Could you break a dish or scream
at the top of your lungs? Something.

96
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,285
That's what I'm talking about.

97
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,786
What are you feeling, Luka?

98
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,265
Tsk.

99
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,626
I'm happy.

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,132
I'm happy and Sam's not.

101
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:14,273
I don't know why. We're healthy.
We enjoy each other, our work.

102
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,205
We have a good life.

103
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,078
How does that
make you feel, Sam?

104
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,946
Like hitting him over
the head with a hammer.

105
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,017
Was there a particular
event or series of events...

106
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,658
that led to your decision
to come here today?

107
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,661
Uh... Yeah. I thought
that I might be pregnant.

108
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,629
- And are you?
- No. Thank God.

109
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,169
That's a pretty
unequivocal answer.

110
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,770
Yeah.

111
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,170
It's how I feel about it.

112
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,673
Is that how you
feel about it, Luka?

113
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,109
What is that?

114
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,381
Hey! What the hell is that?

115
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,851
What's what, Billy?

116
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:06,392
That up there coming out of the
damn ceiling. It smells like crap.

117
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,159
- It is crap.
- Okay.

118
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,527
Bad enough I'm stuck in here, you
gotta let the building crap on me?

119
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,998
I think it's just your DTs
kicking in, Mr. Seiger.

120
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,366
Hey! Hey! Unless they're
passing out ponchos...

121
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,565
better get him back in the
ambulance and over to Mercy, pronto!

122
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,539
- Jake's in Philadelphia?
- Tulane.

123
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,838
- He was in San Francisco.
- Couple weeks ago.

124
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,210
Something disgusting is leaking
out of the ceiling. Call Maintenance.

125
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,873
That or a HAZMAT unit.

126
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,647
So Carter gets tenure
and Dr. Lewis doesn't?

127
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,221
- Yeah.
- How do you explain that?

128
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,187
Lewis has more
seniority. She runs ER.

129
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,259
Bada-bing. Show me the green.

130
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,725
Hey, anybody seen Carter?

131
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,364
He's got African love on
the overseas line again.

132
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,090
He took the avulsed scalp.

133
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,700
Sorry, Kem. Can
I take a message?

134
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,838
So you get tenure based on
how much money you have?

135
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,442
He's building a wing for the hospital.
She's pushing paper and banana bags.

136
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,373
Highly-qualified woman,
well-liked man. Who do you think?

137
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,411
Oh, put your bra back
on, Gloria Steinem.

138
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,946
Carter's been here 10 years.

139
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,777
Lewis split and then came back.

140
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,351
It's a level playing field
now. Haven't you heard?

141
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,784
Ix-nay on the Lewis-nay.

142
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,947
Dr. Barnett, do you
have a minute for me?

143
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,093
Sure.

144
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,553
Oooh.

145
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,389
- So he interested in medicine?
- No.

146
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,627
But he's got to do his
community-service hours somewhere.

147
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,737
- What did he get busted for?
- Tagging.

148
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,928
Had some weed on him too.

149
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,099
Hey, we did a lot worse,
just never got caught.

150
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,471
Yeah, speak for yourself.

151
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,478
- Heh. It ain't my fault I ran faster.
- Heh.

152
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,376
All right, look, on the real...

153
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,077
I'm just a hired hand around here.
It's not really my decision to make.

154
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,452
But you'll ask?

155
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,586
- Yeah, man.
- My man.

156
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,455
- I'll ask.
- My man, 50 grand.

157
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,990
Because I don't think
it would be fair to Alex.

158
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,464
Alex is...?

159
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,432
My son.

160
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,805
He doesn't have enough problems without
feeling he's getting elbowed by a baby.

161
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,500
I think Alex would like a
brother or a sister. A family.

162
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,736
- He has a family.
- Okay, hang on.

163
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,244
Hang on. Time-out.

164
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,578
Luka, issues revolving
around having children...

165
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,312
can be complicated when one person
in the relationship already has a child.

166
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,184
God, Luka. I didn't wanna
have a kid the first time.

167
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,888
Alex was unplanned?

168
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,125
Yeah, you could say that.

169
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,957
- I was 15.
- Well, you're not 15 anymore.

170
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,292
After what happened
to your wife and kids...

171
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,028
you really want to bring
another baby into this world?

172
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,470
You had a family before?

173
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,645
He says he's happy, and
he can't even talk about it.

174
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,709
I had two children and a wife.
They were killed years ago.

175
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,545
How does it help us for me
to talk about these things?

176
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,688
It's a huge part of who you
are, and you won't let me in.

177
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:57,728
How come every kid named Destiny,
Miracle or Faith ends up with leukemia?

178
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,999
Hmm. Alkalinize her fluids
and give Oncology a heads-up.

179
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,693
That scalp guy went to the O.R.

180
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,704
Oh, you got another call
from your Kenyan love nest.

181
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,308
It's the Congo, Frank.

182
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,809
And I know that you
know it's the Congo.

183
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,312
Kenya, Congo. It's all mosquitoes
the size of flying toasters to me.

184
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,348
She sounded kind of upset.

185
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,179
You're all set.

186
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,852
Gonna leave that bucket
in the middle of the floor?

187
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,855
Shut off the toilet in O.R.
Soon as it drains, we'll snake it.

188
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,220
So how long we gonna have
raw sewage seeping out?

189
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,225
Another hour or two at the most.

190
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,261
Okay, great. So
when the bucket's full...

191
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,059
just toss it into the street
like we do chamber pots.

192
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,396
Kem Likasu, please.
Is this Charles?

193
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,368
Hey, Charles. It's John Carter.
Good, good. Is she around?

194
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,772
I found the Chief Resident's office,
but there's boxes I need you to move.

195
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,037
- She what?
- I look like Beakins to you?

196
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,181
Get a couple of your
interns, lean on them.

197
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,113
- See, but they're busy and you're not.
- What happened?

198
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,913
Ray, honestly, what
are you doing here?

199
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,419
This is a great program.

200
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,250
You were lucky to get into it.

201
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,621
- And you're just taking up space.
- You don't think I'm a good doctor?

202
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,026
I think you could be a very
good doctor, but you know what?

203
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,258
You watch the clock all
day just waiting to punch out.

204
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,427
You have two weeks
left on your internship.

205
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,233
Take your degree and go work at
a doc-in-a-box or do air transport.

206
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,734
If you're doing this to make a
living, you don't need a specialty.

207
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,279
You make more than enough
money right now to support your music.

208
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:27,281
Don't sign this contract unless you
are sure this is what you want to do.

209
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,025
Did something happen to Kem?

210
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,422
No. It's her mother.
She's in the hospital.

211
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,999
- In Africa?
- No. Her mother lives in Paris.

212
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,432
- Did she say what happened?
- Didn't talk to her.

213
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,299
She'd already
left for the airport.

214
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,134
Hey, Frank. I don't
know where Susan is.

215
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,937
- Would you please tell her I had to go?
- Go where?

216
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,670
Just tell her that I'll call
her from O'Hare, okay?

217
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,085
Gotta go by the bank on
the way back if that's okay.

218
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,147
Do you need anything
from Home Depot?

219
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,586
- I thought I'd swing by before work.
- Home Depot?

220
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,319
Yeah. I need to get some anchors
to fix that towel bar Alex pulled down.

221
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,759
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone, Luka.

222
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,830
Are you gonna walk?
It's gotta be five miles.

223
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,136
Towel bars?

224
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,066
Sam!

225
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,463
<i>- What's he doing in Paris?
- Kem's mother is sick.</i>

226
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,973
Meningitis. She's immunosuppressed
from chemotherapy.

227
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,600
So with Carter AWOL, you
and me pick up the slack.

228
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,270
Five night shifts in a row?

229
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,915
- What?
- The new schedule. Morris?

230
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,210
If that's what it says.

231
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,621
A swing shift and a
day shift back-to-back?

232
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,619
And Ray gets every weekend off.
- What?

233
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,781
- Cubbies-Braves, right?
- Got you covered.

234
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,086
All right. ABBY: Oh, I see.

235
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,254
- So he bribed you for a good schedule.
- Of course not. That would be unethical.

236
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,463
Oh, I hear U2 tickets are hard to
get. It's a shame. I really wanted to go.

237
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,067
- Heh.
- Dr. Lewis...?

238
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,729
He is the chief.

239
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,738
Any way we can make
Abby Chief Resident?

240
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,242
Morris isn't the sharpest shovel in
the shed. But he's a paperwork hound.

241
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:36,076
Besides, keeps him from seeing
patients. Think of it as community service.

242
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,445
- CT call on Werntz yet?
- I'll call them again.

243
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,622
- Flowers usually work.
- Hey, Jerry, I want you to meet K.J.

244
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,923
- He's our new volunteer.
- Volunteen, welcome.

245
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,963
Jerry will be telling
you what to do.

246
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,931
Jerry, just have him run
specimens up to the lab or whatever.

247
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,367
- Specimens?
- Yeah. Blood, urine...

248
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,836
- Piss?
- Heh.

249
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,203
Nasal swabs, wound cultures,
stool samples, the whole enchilada.

250
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,778
Hey, Pratt, 47's pulling
in with a septic newborn.

251
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,142
Hey, you don't like
it, the door's that way.

252
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,885
Stool sample is
what I think it is?

253
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,189
Mm-hm.

254
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,487
- Septic newborn?
- So they say.

255
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,528
Hey, study your
antibiotics last night?

256
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,292
The gentamicin for the open fracture.
You should know this stuff cold by now.

257
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,027
Gonna be an R2 in a couple
weeks supervising new interns.

258
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,401
- Gotta start stepping it up.
- Eight-day-old female, febrile to 104.

259
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,905
Grunting, severe retractions.
Can't get a pulse ox.

260
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,237
- Tachy to 192. Resps, 80.
- Started this morning.

261
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,970
- I thought it was a cold.
- Access?

262
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,911
I had a 23 gauge in
the hand but it blew.

263
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,795
- No.
- No?

264
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,266
Fabienne Elmont?

265
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,643
John?

266
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,416
Hey.

267
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,322
What are you doing here?

268
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,990
I got your message
about your mom.

269
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,356
You should have told
me you were coming.

270
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,863
Well, I called your cell.

271
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,004
- No. It doesn't work in Paris.
- Oh.

272
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,601
How's she doing?

273
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,607
I can't tell what antibiotics
they're giving her from the IV.

274
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,506
Oh, she's not on antibiotics.

275
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,505
They're not giving her
antibiotics for meningitis?

276
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,944
Viral meningitis?

277
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,641
Oh.

278
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,548
- Who told you she had meningitis?
- I called the clinic.

279
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,282
Charles said you flew to Paris. With
all the chemo, I just assumed that...

280
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:10,452
- So she's okay?
- She had a fever, the doctor got worried.

281
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,654
So he admitted her.

282
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,697
- But she's much better now.
- Good.

283
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:16,859
Oh.

284
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:24,535
John, this is an old friend
of mine, Michel Timbaud.

285
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,043
- BP's 58/29.
- She needs volume.

286
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,346
You're hurting her!

287
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,682
Can't help unless we
give her fluids, medicine.

288
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,052
I'm in. Portable x-ray.
Call RT for a vent.

289
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,318
- Good chest rise.
- All right.

290
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,760
Airway and access.
Neela, what's your plan?

291
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,332
Normal saline, CBC, blood
culture, amp and cefotax.

292
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,991
- Good.
- Hodgkin guy's pressure...

293
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,168
- dropped after antibiotics.
- Run a liter.

294
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,501
- He's trying to pull out his broviac.
- Give the bolus. I'll be back.

295
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,906
- Hundred cc's MS through the IO.
- Please tell me what's going on.

296
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,275
We suspect your daughter has
an infection. Giving her antibiotics.

297
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,383
Fluids elevate her blood pressure.
Tube is helping her breathe.

298
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,076
- IO's infiltrated. Won't flush.
- How old is she again?

299
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,415
- Eight days. NEELA:
Umbilical stump is still attached.

300
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,785
- Is that bad?
- No. That's... That's good.

301
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,417
Umbilical-line kit. Five French.
Sterile sixes and 10 blade.

302
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,097
Hey, Jerry, Hodgkin's
guy needs a Med bed.

303
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,927
Let NICU know
they got a customer.

304
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,036
Your volunteen kid doesn't
seem very interested.

305
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,729
- Yeah. Well, he's not.
- So why has he volunteered?

306
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,705
- He has to work off his probation.
- What did he do?

307
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,411
- Second-degree murder, I think.
- Really?

308
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,207
He got caught
tagging a police car.

309
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,579
- He tried to spray-paint a cop car?
- Yeah. With the cop still in it.

310
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:42,153
- Ho-ho. The kid's got guts.
- Either that or he's an idiot.

311
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:45,381
Small-bowel obstruction
secondary to a popcorn overdose.

312
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,392
A 6-year-old ate a huge
tub of popcorn all by himself.

313
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,396
- Yeah, and...?
- Call Surgery, get a CT.

314
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,070
Think they'll be ready to
supervise interns in two weeks?

315
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,674
Not a chance.

316
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,176
John.

317
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,853
That was awkward.

318
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,014
Where are you going?

319
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,249
Back to the airport, I guess.

320
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,486
You just got here.

321
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,130
Well, you were right.

322
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,629
I should have called first.

323
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,096
Michel and I went
to school together.

324
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,601
And he's fond of my mother.

325
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,032
- You two a couple?
- We were.

326
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,038
Does he know about
the past-tense part?

327
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,278
Are you jealous?

328
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,445
- Yeah.
- Heh.

329
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,353
Hey, don't do that.
Don't laugh at me.

330
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,786
Okay. Okay.

331
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,283
Are you sleeping together?

332
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,486
No. Do not answer that.

333
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,995
Well, you haven't been dating?

334
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,403
Is there someplace around here
I can catch a taxi to the airport?

335
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,539
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Okay, look. I'm sorry.

336
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,231
Okay? I'm tired.

337
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,139
And I shouldn't have just barged in
on you. And I feel completely ridiculous.

338
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,837
Actually, it was very sweet.

339
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,175
Yeah.

340
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:23,213
Okay. Look, I'm really
glad that your mom's okay.

341
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,717
Why don't you call
me when you get home.

342
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,824
John.

343
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,696
Just stay. Just for the night.

344
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,426
- Flushes easily.
- Hook up the transducer.

345
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,165
- Sats, 93. Systolic's up to 78.
- Good. That's good.

346
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,004
How we doing in here?

347
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,947
- What are you doing?
- Umbilical lines.

348
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,276
- You what?
- Umbilical lines.

349
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,042
I heard you. Why?

350
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,520
- IO infiltrated. We needed access.
- Why not just put in another IO?

351
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:03,720
She still has an umbilical stump. UAC
and UVC allow for frequent blood draws.

352
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,387
Gases...

353
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,563
Did she do something wrong?

354
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,375
Hotel La Pavillon.

355
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,109
I'll come by in the morning.
We'll have some breakfast.

356
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,548
Michel coming too?

357
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,088
- He has to work.
- Those his real teeth?

358
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,455
- They're a little too straight.
- Get some sleep.

359
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,894
- I'm gonna come and pick you up early.
- Yeah. You get some sleep too.

360
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,912
You can't be placing
umbilical lines by yourself.

361
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,014
Do you know the things
could've gone wrong?

362
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,481
Thromboembolism, vascular
injuries, arrhythmias...

363
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,984
- I thought arterial monitoring...
- You're an intern.

364
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,679
You can't play neonatologist
whenever you feel like it.

365
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,415
I did a bunch of these...

366
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,493
- when we rotated through the...
- Really? When, two years ago?

367
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,653
Have you done one,
even seen one since then?

368
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,095
- You told me to take more initiative.
- Initiative?

369
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,927
What about common sense, Neela?

370
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,932
What's next,
neurosurgery in the lounge?

371
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,264
You need to know
when to ask for help.

372
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:23,068
Wha...? W-what the hell is
this? What, you're gonna cry now?

373
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:27,872
All right, look, you got lucky
this time. She's stabilizing.

374
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,777
But you have to
start using your head.

375
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,548
Now go on. Get out of here. Go.

376
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,120
I'll deal with the NICU guy.

377
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,505
<i>Bonjour</i>... Hello?

378
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,042
I'm sleeping.

379
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,544
It's dark outside.

380
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,385
All right, I'm up.

381
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,113
All right, I'm up,
I'm up, I'm up.

382
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,031
How's Michel gonna get
to work if we have his car?

383
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,430
Who said it's his car?

384
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,367
- Come on. I wanna show you something.
- Does it involve coffee?

385
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,407
Heh-heh-heh. Everything
in Paris involves coffee.

386
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,040
Hurry. We're gonna
miss it. Ha-ha.

387
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,780
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere. We're here.

388
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,685
You got me up at 5 in
the morning to ride a train?

389
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,916
Will you be patient
for once in your life?

390
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,253
<i>Bonjour.</i>

391
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:59,169
She spent the night at her
dying husband's bedside.

392
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,067
He was a member
of the Resistance...

393
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,232
fought bravely against
the Occupation...

394
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,436
while she smuggled
messages for the Free French...

395
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,945
through Nazi lines
on her bicycle.

396
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,385
He still loves her.

397
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,716
She's not so sure
after all these years.

398
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,448
He is an accountant.

399
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,617
She is a waitress,
longed to be a singer.

400
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,390
She had a mad, secret,
tempestuous affair...

401
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,999
with her sister's fiancé.

402
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,129
What about them?

403
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,965
It's a sad story.

404
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,140
She only has a few
months to live. Cancer.

405
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:45,207
They love each other desperately,
spend every moment together.

406
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,214
What about us?

407
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,525
You have a story for us?

408
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,161
Quick. Close your eyes.

409
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,825
Quickly, quickly,
quickly. Come on.

410
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,494
Close your eyes.

411
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,800
Wait, wait, wait.

412
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,505
Now.

413
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,080
What are you doing out here?

414
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,720
Deciding if I'm
sick. Pratt's on.

415
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,413
Ah.

416
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,489
- Hey, Neela.
- Hey.

417
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,152
Got you a bear claw. They
don't have the apple fritters.

418
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,326
- What are we doing?
- Neela's trying to decide...

419
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,196
- if she should go to work.
- We get to decide?

420
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,372
She put in umbilical lines
in a newborn yesterday.

421
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,563
Really? Cool.

422
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,834
Unsupervised. Pratt
became unglued.

423
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,446
Wow. I miss all the good stuff.

424
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,581
Well, gotta go.
I'm gonna be late.

425
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,512
Gotta get back on that horse.

426
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,124
Nothing fancy. Just
primer and a couple coats.

427
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,302
- The lichen...
- I'm not painting your office.

428
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:47,304
- Hospital does it. Need a purchase order.
- Yeah, that comes out of my ER budget.

429
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:51,103
Hey, Pratt. Stabbing victim in
Trauma 1. Back up the interns, please.

430
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,610
Paramedics are two minutes
out with an MVA, a 9-year-old kid.

431
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,443
Okay. Luka, can you get that?
I've got an extubation in C2.

432
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,642
- We don't have to do the trim.
- No, Morris.

433
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,787
MVA coming in.

434
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,021
Trauma panel. Type
and cross for four.

435
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,312
Pulse ox to 78. RAY:
Taking down neck dressing.

436
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,521
- Shouldn't we tube her first?
- Be my guest.

437
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,529
Maybe there's
something we can tie off.

438
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,361
Etomidate and sux.

439
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,504
- Got the jugular, spared the carotid.
- Can't breathe.

440
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,002
You're just going to sleep.

441
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,641
We breathe for you. Prep
for subclavian on the right.

442
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,477
- 8.0 ET tube.
- Is this the penetrating neck?

443
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,738
Single stab wound.
Hypotensive, no sub-Q air.

444
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,711
- Two of O-neg on peripheral IV.
- Pressure's up to 90 palp.

445
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,375
- I'm in. Bag her.
- Got a flash.

446
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,714
We'll have a central
line for the next 2 units.

447
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,484
Good breath sounds.

448
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,558
Excellent. Maybe there's
hope for you two after all.

449
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,420
Professor Carter.

450
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,565
It's associate
professor, actually.

451
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,758
Heh. Well, I'm proud of you.

452
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,062
Susan didn't get tenure.
- Susan Lewis? Really?

453
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,537
She's pretty pissed about it
too. She's not talking to me.

454
00:27:55,707 --> 00:28:00,077
Now, this is what I really miss
in Africa. Baked goods. Heh.

455
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,514
What?

456
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:12,023
- You have a lot of jam on your face.
- Well, help me.

457
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,865
Hello.

458
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,546
<i>Au revoir.</i> WOMAN: <i>Au revoir.</i>

459
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:48,116
- Hey, hey, got a minute?
- Not really. What's up?

460
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,159
I gotta finish my
rankings for my match.

461
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,298
- I could use a little advice.
- Excuse me?

462
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,456
There's something
leaking from the ceiling.

463
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,033
Oh.

464
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:00,730
Okay. We're gonna move you...

465
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,239
right over here.

466
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,803
And Christian's gonna
take care of you. Thank you.

467
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,144
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yup.

468
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,753
Susan, code brown dripping
from the ceiling again.

469
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,651
Damn it, that is it.
Jerry, call the AOD.

470
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,657
Tell them we are closed to
trauma until someone comes down...

471
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:23,625
and deals with the raw
sewage leaking from the ceiling.

472
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,354
Is this the
respiratory distress?

473
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,965
- Jerry, what's open?
- There's a bed in Curtain 3.

474
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,999
Arnold Brixton,
65, short of breath.

475
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,535
Sats, 83 on room air,
91 on a non-rebreather.

476
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:37,642
Tachy at 115, afebrile, good BP.
On theophylline for emphysema.

477
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,005
- Don't say it.
- Say what?

478
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,012
I stopped smoking
five years ago.

479
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,613
- Good for you.
- Come on.

480
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,352
So I was thinking I might
rank County as my first choice.

481
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,552
You want to stay in Chicago?

482
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,718
Yeah. I mean, my friends
are here, all my family.

483
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,389
He needs a monitor and continuous
albuterol with 500 of Atrovent.

484
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,862
What about San Francisco?

485
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,801
UCSF has a great program,
but County has a lot to offer too.

486
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,339
Those sisters are back.

487
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,210
Okay, 60 of pred
and a portable chest.

488
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,870
- And do you wanna talk about this later?
- Sure.

489
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,713
- Rebecca? Birdy? You okay?
- You know them?

490
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,650
They've been in a
couple times before.

491
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,723
Circumferential ecchymosis.
Neela wants to get a telemetry bed.

492
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,854
What happened?

493
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,155
Rebecca almost got
strangled to death.

494
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,398
I tried to tell you guys it's too dangerous
for you to be out there on the streets.

495
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,162
I'd be dead if Birdy
hadn't stabbed her.

496
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,606
You stabbed the attacker?

497
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,074
Well, I had to.

498
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,078
Is she gonna be all right?

499
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,579
Yeah. I mean, she
seems stable for now.

500
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,513
- We might have to...
- No. Not Rebecca.

501
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,744
Shelley. Our niece.

502
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,785
They're working on her
in that room over there.

503
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,255
I grew up playing here, when we
weren't in Kinshasa with my dad.

504
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:08,264
My mom would save the old bread so I
could feed the ducks on the weekends.

505
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,232
There was thousands
of them in the summer.

506
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,103
Sounds idyllic.

507
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,265
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

508
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,604
So why did you leave?

509
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,779
It was different
when I was little.

510
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,110
We were a novelty then.

511
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:31,280
My very white mother, my black
father, with their little brown girl. Heh.

512
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,618
It wasn't easy for them.

513
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,822
You know that Joshua
would be a year old now?

514
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,440
I'm gonna head back to the
hospital, see my mother, okay?

515
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,710
What are we doing?

516
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,253
What are we doing?

517
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,818
I still love you, and I
know you still love me.

518
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,293
We talk to each other every day.
We talk for hours on the phone.

519
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,430
We tell each other absolutely
everything about our lives.

520
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,431
I make you happy.
I make you laugh.

521
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,728
I tried living in Chicago
and it wasn't for me.

522
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,838
- We don't have to live in Chicago.
- You have your life there...

523
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:24,465
- your career, everything.
- I would give it up for you.

524
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,509
I don't want you to.

525
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,047
Kem, we had a baby and he died.

526
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,054
It's a tragedy that happens to
people and it happened to us.

527
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,517
But that doesn't
have to define us.

528
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,796
It doesn't. We're stronger
than that. Aren't we?

529
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,525
- I can't...
- We can have another baby.

530
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,694
Stop this. Stop doing this.

531
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,840
I'm sorry.

532
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,075
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,880
Are you gonna come
to the hospital? Hmm?

534
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,214
Because Fabienne's
gonna want to say goodbye.

535
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,538
Tidal volume's 700.
AC 14 on 100 percent.

536
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:30,073
- Units three and four on board.
- Did you follow up with Social Services...

537
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,541
- on home visit for the
Chadwicks? RAY: I'm... Who?

538
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,078
The two old ladies that
panhandle on the south.

539
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,909
You sent them
home with their niece.

540
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:38,744
From a few weeks ago? - Yeah.

541
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,157
- Down 60 systolic.
- Check for tracheal shift.

542
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,313
Get four of type specific.

543
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,286
This is the niece, Shelley.
Birdy stabbed Shelley.

544
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,585
- She was trying to strangle Rebecca.
- She what?

545
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,957
You sent them home with Shelley.
Did you forget about the follow-up...

546
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,928
- or not want to deal with it?
- I called. But what do I do?

547
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,068
- Make sure they do their job?
- People...

548
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,102
- can we focus on the patient?
- V-fib. Starting compressions.

549
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,103
- Ambu-bag.
- Charge at 200.

550
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,935
- Cardiac history?
- I don't know, Ray.

551
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,441
You're the only one
that's met her. Clear.

552
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,221
Oh, we're being rude.

553
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,958
No.

554
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,992
I'm hungry. Will you get
me something, <i>mon ange?</i>

555
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,645
Thank you for the
beautiful flowers.

556
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,654
He's a very handsome young man.

557
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,887
- Who?
- Michel.

558
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,995
Well, yeah, I guess.

559
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,690
Also something of a fool.

560
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,199
- When are you going home?
- There's a flight tonight at 9.

561
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,397
You're giving up
awfully easily, aren't you?

562
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:15,870
I was rather firmly discouraged
from continuing to try.

563
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,321
You know what life is?

564
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,489
Joy and grief, hand in hand.

565
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:36,699
You can't know real happiness until
you've had sorrow to contrast it with.

566
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,334
Hmm.

567
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,865
She hasn't learned that yet.

568
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,400
Leave him alone, Mother.

569
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,735
We were just catching up.

570
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,309
- Rib spreader.
- Abby, get the suction.

571
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,842
I don't get it.
Stab is in the neck.

572
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,922
Yeah. The knife must have
angled down, bagged the subclavian.

573
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,388
Stand back. This is
gonna be pretty bloody.

574
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,091
- Dry as a bone.
- Starting internal compressions.

575
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,107
We put in six units.
Where's it all going?

576
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:09,234
Whoa. Hold compressions.

577
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,735
- Fine V-fib. Internal paddles.
- Oh, man. Son of a bitch.

578
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,738
All right, stop bagging.
Eighteen-gauge needle.

579
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,441
Coronary artery's full of air.
- An air embolus?

580
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,420
All right. That's
it. We're done.

581
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:32,580
Time of death, 11:47.

582
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,090
How did she get that
much air in her heart?

583
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,092
I don't know. She had
an open neck wound.

584
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,561
The negative pressure
sucked air into her jugular.

585
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,929
I don't see how that's possible.
She has an occlusive dressing.

586
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:48,736
I... I took it down
to explore the neck.

587
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,140
Was it before or
after the intubation?

588
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,643
This was before.

589
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:01,280
You took down a patient's
dressing before she was intubated?

590
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,254
Excuse me. Dr. Lockhart?

591
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,855
Your emphysema guy is coding.

592
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,993
But it was only for a
few breaths. I didn't...

593
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,366
Damn right, we're gonna stay
closed as long as I've got crap...

594
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,662
I don't mean figuratively.
- -literal crap pouring out of my ceiling.

595
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:22,797
I came to check his neb. He was down.
- Mr. Brixton? Mr. Brixton?

596
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,500
- PVCs.
- All right, a mac-two and an 8.0.

597
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,669
You should have got
me if he was tiring out.

598
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,213
- No, no. He was holding his own.
- Systolic's 77.

599
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,817
- Okay. NS, wide open. Start second line.
- Run of six.

600
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,147
- All right. What now?
- Acute emphysema flare.

601
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,880
He went apneic
on continuous nebs.

602
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,490
- V-tach.
- No pulse.

603
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,489
Start compressions
and mark the time.

604
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,560
Let's get an ABG and
a capnograph now.

605
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,026
- How's she doing?
- Good sats, no stridor.

606
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,692
Got a repeat EKG and neck films.

607
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,937
You're doing good, Rebecca.

608
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,500
I didn't mean to hurt her.

609
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,337
I just wanted her to
leave Rebecca alone.

610
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,580
Did she suffer?

611
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:14,982
No. We put her to sleep to work
on her. She didn't suffer any pain.

612
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,654
I didn't mean to kill her.

613
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,189
We loved her.

614
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,035
Two hundred. Clear.

615
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:31,439
- Back in sinus. Got a pulse.
- Okay. What do you got?

616
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,078
Emphysema flare. Abby had
him on continuous albuterol.

617
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,214
He was wheezing.
Given the acute setting...

618
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:39,408
Chuny, correlate the capnograph
to the ABG. Set the rate at 40.

619
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:42,247
- Abby, what's the end tidal CO2?
- Ninety-six.

620
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,854
Can you tell me why?

621
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,048
He was apneic. LEWIS: Why?

622
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,989
- He wasn't ventilating?
- That's not an answer.

623
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,754
- He has emphysema?
- Wrong.

624
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,193
- Tired out.
- No.

625
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,595
- Basic respiratory physiology.
- He was hypoxic.

626
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,498
- ABG's back, pH 7.1.
- Think about it.

627
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,433
Emphysemics
chronically retain CO2.

628
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,939
- They rely on relative hypoxia...
- To trigger their respiratory drive.

629
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:10,579
I put him on nebs, oxygen, and
took away his impulse to breathe.

630
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,013
Leading to hypercapnia, acidosis, V-tach.
- Yeah.

631
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,544
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize to us.

632
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,587
He'll be okay once
you blow off some CO2.

633
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,749
It's a classic intern mistake.
You won't make it again.

634
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,923
Get up.

635
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,527
Get up.

636
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:45,442
- What? What's going on?
- Tell them.

637
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,549
That poor woman in there thinks
she murdered her own niece.

638
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,120
Now, Ray.

639
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,797
Hey.

640
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:48,677
If it's any consolation, that was
a great teaching case for me.

641
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,975
I'm glad my public humiliation
can further your educational goals.

642
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,345
The guy is fine, Abby.

643
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:57,216
It's not your fault he smoked
two packs a day for decades.

644
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:02,024
So I was thinking...

645
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:07,894
that I might rank County as
my first choice for internship.

646
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,867
What about UCSF?

647
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:17,634
I don't want to go to UCSF.
I want to stay right here.

648
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,712
Don't do that for me.

649
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:34,287
Whew. Now, this was
a seriously crappy day.

650
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:38,396
Who wants to get drunk and pick a
bar fight with a bunch of law clerks, huh?

651
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,093
I still have an hour of charting to
do. How are Birdy and Rebecca?

652
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,031
- They're gonna be fine.
- Did you find out what happened?

653
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,802
Turns out the niece had them
panhandling to support her crack habit...

654
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,104
hit them when they
didn't bring home enough.

655
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,407
Well, well. If it isn't
the three amigos.

656
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:01,417
Let me see. Failure to recall
basic respiratory principles...

657
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:04,078
unsupervised umbilical
lines in an infant, eesh...

658
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,780
and a fatal air embolus.

659
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,152
Wow. Hey, when do
the new interns start?

660
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,726
A week from Monday.

661
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,762
Man, oh, man. God help
your patients. Ha-ha-ha.

662
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,592
Wait up, dude.

663
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,592
I don't know about you,
but I feel really inspired now.

664
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,568
So I think I'll go and
throw myself under a train.

665
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:23,805
Don't go away mad, Jake.

666
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,435
But do go away.

667
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,194
I'm moving back to Africa.

668
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,832
And we can start over.

669
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,436
We can do everything
that we didn't do before.

670
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:02,438
You take as much time as you
need. Take a month. Take a year.

671
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:04,735
You can take 10
years. I don't care.

672
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:08,311
And I'm not leaving without
you, and I'm not living without you.

673
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,378
I love you.

674
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:17,115
I love you.
