1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,869
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,531
I understand you want
to define yourself as chief.

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,749
Are you sure that this is
the way you want to do it?

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,140
I suck.

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,976
No, you don't suck.
You're still learning.

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,480
So how are you doing?

7
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,764
I processed my feelings of anger, shame and
guilt in an emotionally safe environment.

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,518
I've addressed the
urge to use alcohol.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,489
And I've consulted both a
shaman and a guru, so I'm all good.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,324
I must've really made an impression on you.
You didn't notice I was gone for a week.

11
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,898
Are you high?

12
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,268
Alex, hurry up! The
bus is gonna be here!

13
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,503
- What time do you start?
- Noon.

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,705
- Is Neela on today?
- Hmm?

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,511
- Is Neela on?
- I don't know. I think she is.

16
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,245
It's funny how that
keeps working out.

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,553
- What?
- Nothing.

18
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:01,491
Come on. She's young, single,
lonely. She's got a crush on you.

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,987
I'm her teacher. She's
just trying to learn.

20
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,826
Yeah, bet she is.

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,161
- Ah, come on.
- What? Everyone can see it.

22
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,533
- Who's everyone?
- Uh, Pratt, Frank...

23
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,675
Jerry, Morris, Chuny, Haleh.

24
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,207
Even Murray.

25
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,706
- Murray?
- That guy who works at the roach coach.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,872
It's not funny, Luka. You're
doing everything to encourage it.

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,348
Mm.

28
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,545
- That's not true.
- Yeah? Well, it better not be.

29
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,385
Or else I might have to get into
some nasty chick fight with Neela.

30
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,686
In the mud? Just don't hurt her.

31
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:40,530
The only person who's going to get
hurt around here is you. You got it?

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,935
Yeah, I think it was April.

33
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,506
But the fact that I need a calendar
to figure it out is not a good sign.

34
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,371
- Did I meet him?
- No.

35
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,877
He drove a motorcycle.

36
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,206
- That was his defining characteristic?
- I'm afraid so.

37
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,284
- What about you?
- Third year.

38
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,388
My gross anatomy instructor.

39
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,047
He was very skilled at
prosecting the brachial plexus.

40
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,715
You slept with your instructor?

41
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,529
Dr. Gibson had a very
tender way with cadavers.

42
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,392
And you called him Dr. Gibson?

43
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,193
Only in bed.

44
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,765
So basically, neither one of us has
gotten any in a ridiculously long time.

45
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,769
Well, at least we have
work to keep our minds off...

46
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,071
men, romance, sex.

47
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,113
Yeah, at least we have that.
- Morning.

48
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,712
Hello, Luka. NEELA: Dr. Kovac.

49
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,720
Uh, multiple MVA
on their way in.

50
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:40,327
Patient-satisfaction scores were
up 0.6 points from two weeks ago.

51
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,089
- Is that good?
- Yeah, it's good. Very good.

52
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,631
I'm gonna post it. Um,
Carter, I wanna thank you.

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,770
I know that my taking over
as chief has been stressful.

54
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,495
It's been a little
weird for you...

55
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,109
but you've made the transition
a lot easier, and I appreciate it.

56
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,439
Susan, I can't think of anybody
I'd rather have as a boss than you.

57
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,449
Sixteen-year-old driver
backed into a utility pole.

58
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,176
Okay, hop to it. And don't
call me Susan at work.

59
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,853
What happened?

60
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,787
- Dad was teaching her to parallel park.
- She just got her learner's permit.

61
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,688
I got a little bit dizzy, and
maybe I got the pedals mixed up.

62
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,294
Uh-huh.

63
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,995
New scores?

64
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,966
Yep, we don't suck as bad as we used
to. Maybe by next week, we'll suck less.

65
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,628
- Must be your motivational speeches.
- We're pairing Attendings with interns.

66
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,968
- Abby, you got me. Neela, you got Kovac.
- What?

67
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,973
Big Croatian guy.
You can't miss him.

68
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,807
We've got a double MVC rolling
in. Abby, he's all yours today.

69
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,676
Who? STUDENT: Hey.

70
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,784
You guys know each other, right?

71
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,783
Hi.

72
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,950
You know how to clear
a C-spine clinically?

73
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,028
Uh, you mean, if
it's not, uh, tender?

74
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:52,223
That's a no. Check the NEXUS
criteria. Get back to me tomorrow.

75
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,628
I give you Rodney
Dixon and Amanda Field.

76
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,032
Rear-ended by a truck
while having sex in his car.

77
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,695
Good vitals on both. - I'd say.

78
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:02,331
- Are they stuck together with super-glue?
- We tried to disengage them, but...

79
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,479
- Oh, it's killing me, man.
- Broken pelvis plus lust equals...

80
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,841
Oh, God!

81
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,400
Chest is clear, belly's benign.
- Back seat of a car, huh?

82
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,403
'66 Mustang fastback.
I hope it's not totaled.

83
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:09,065
- Fastback? That's a pretty tight squeeze.
- I do Pilates.

84
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,269
It's got a 389-1 rear
gear with a 31 spline axle.

85
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,914
- Nice.
- You were screwing in an old Ford?

86
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,243
What were we supposed to
do? My husband was home.

87
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,046
- Oh, God.
- Probably a small crack in the pelvis.

88
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,660
- Aah!
- You've got this, right?

89
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,618
Oh, I'm all over it.

90
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,123
We'll give you morphine and
wait for your Viagra to wear off.

91
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,063
Dr. Lewis told me to
present to you today.

92
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,734
- She did?
- Something about interns...

93
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,300
having a primary Attending.

94
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,771
- Okay.
- I hope you'll show me...

95
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,465
that combat procedure
you mentioned last shift.

96
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,269
The femoral tear.

97
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,639
Oh, it depends on, uh,
whether we get a patient...

98
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,112
- who needs emergent central access.
- Well, whenever we do.

99
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,082
- Uh...
- Sorry.

100
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,319
Uh...

101
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:59,248
- Infected anal fissure in the hallway.
- Okay.

102
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,933
- Pupils, four millimeters and reactive.
- Ten centimeters JVD.

103
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,965
My wife is not gonna be happy.

104
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,966
It's okay, Dad. It was my idea.

105
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,264
I take it Mom wasn't
aware of the lessons.

106
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,931
Uh, if she had it her way, I
would never be allowed out.

107
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,374
We're kind of separated for now.
Uh, Katie was with me this week.

108
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,877
Does she take any medications?

109
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,983
Prednisone, tacrolimus...

110
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,847
- The anti-rejection drug?
- She had a kidney transplant.

111
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,852
I have polycystic
kidney disease.

112
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,856
We were on the UNOS list for
seven years waiting for a donor.

113
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,789
Yeah, I'm a big fan of dialysis.

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,326
She's got blood type O...

115
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,021
with an 80 percent
reactive antibody panel.

116
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,167
- Tough match.
- Yeah, well...

117
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,064
finally got big enough that I
could give her one of mine.

118
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,499
Your kidney?

119
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,537
What a dad, huh?

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,339
Any other meds?

121
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,842
Uh, yeah, she's on an
anti-seizure drug too.

122
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,674
The PKD gave her an aneurysm.

123
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,213
Mom's on the way, sweetie.

124
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,351
Thanks.

125
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,510
Okay. A few
crackles at the base.

126
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,055
Bradycardic at 48.

127
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,692
Whoa. Peak T waves, widened QRS.

128
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,190
All right, amp of bicarb,
10 cc's of calcium gluconate.

129
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,833
What do you think is going on?
- Um...

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,994
Well, low heart rate,
dizziness and EKG changes.

131
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,867
Could be hyperkalemia.

132
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,235
What?

133
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,737
No, no, that can't be.
- Hey, John.

134
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,243
Since the transplant,
her kidney has been fine.

135
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,245
Why don't we see what
the blood tests show...

136
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,180
then we'll take it from there.
Excuse me for one second.

137
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,911
- Do you have an intern on this?
- I got Ray.

138
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,112
Uh...

139
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,384
- What do you think about taking Neela?
- Why? Is there a problem?

140
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,193
Just do me a favor, okay?

141
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,921
All right, send the Punjabi
Powerhouse my way.

142
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,766
Painless jaundice in 3
and ulnar styloid fracture.

143
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,561
I'll take those.

144
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,569
Uh, there was a change.
You're with Carter today.

145
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,365
- I thought I was with you.
- No, he needs you in Trauma 1.

146
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,441
Isolated pubic ramus fracture.

147
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,549
Will I be, you know, all right?

148
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,050
No cast, no surgery.
Just rest and pain meds.

149
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,656
But you're gonna have to be careful
for a couple of weeks until it heals.

150
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,918
- Careful?
- Yes, as in abstinent.

151
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,554
The safest sex of all.

152
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,936
- Abstinent? Are you serious?
- Can't put any pressure on your pelvis...

153
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,933
or you'll end up back
here. Not what we want.

154
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,927
- It's the pelvis we should worry about?
- That's right.

155
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,733
But other positions?

156
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,999
Yeah, sure.

157
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,701
Get yourself a six-pack, the
Kamasutra, and shoot out the lights.

158
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,177
Did we do something
to offend her?

159
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,249
Pulse is up to 61. BP's stable.

160
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,682
Looks like the QRS
complexes are narrowing.

161
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,116
- That's good.
- That is good.

162
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,779
The chemistry machine is
down. Should be up in an hour.

163
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,655
- You can't say if it's a kidney problem?
- The urine dip shows four-plus protein.

164
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,355
- We won't know till the labs come back.
- I told them to hurry.

165
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,023
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.

166
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,930
- Sweetie...
- It was nothing.

167
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,094
I told you it was too
soon for her to drive.

168
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,672
- What were you thinking?
- She's 16. She wants a permit.

169
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,138
You never know when to stop.

170
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,919
- Let's not do this here.
- Please.

171
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,811
I need more of Katie's family
history. Could we step outside...

172
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,142
and give Katie a chance to rest?

173
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,145
I'll be back, okay, sweetie?

174
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:21,224
I've been sick for so long, it
just got to be too much for them.

175
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,023
She was on, uh,
Dilantin for a long time...

176
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,993
but, uh, she didn't like it. It
changed the way she looked.

177
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,830
- She was still having these seizures...
- It was manageable.

178
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,303
No, honey. She had them
at school, in the movies.

179
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,671
- She hated it.
- So you switched her medication?

180
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,375
- Three months ago we put her on Zarictal.
- It was not my choice.

181
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,175
- Zarictal?
- It's new.

182
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,147
And we can't afford it.
Medicare does not cover it.

183
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,379
I took a second job working night
security at the Mallers Building.

184
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,184
- We lost our apartment.
- She's been doing great.

185
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,690
Katie has been
seizure-free for three months.

186
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,389
- No infections?
- No.

187
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:58,031
No febrile illnesses?

188
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,724
Have they switched her
dosage of, uh, Zarictal?

189
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,699
- Everything's been steady.
- But she was doing fine before.

190
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,362
- I don't know why...
- She wanted to drive.

191
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,269
Like other kids.

192
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,427
With seizures, she
couldn't get a license.

193
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,502
We almost lost her...

194
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,512
and you're worried about
her being able to drive?

195
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:22,019
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look,
I don't want to fight, okay?

196
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,750
I think it's time that we accept the
fact she will never be totally healthy...

197
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,188
- Why?
- That's reality!

198
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,522
Not for me.

199
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,089
I...

200
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,398
You have a neurologist?

201
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,465
- Yeah, he's been great.
- Good. Why don't we give him a call.

202
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,633
I'd like to talk to him
about the medications.

203
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,746
- Sounds like a hard situation.
- Look up this new drug for me.

204
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,284
I had a patient on that last year
during my internal medicine rotation.

205
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,978
Really? Never
heard of it before.

206
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,250
It's pretty new. Expensive, but
very effective for seizure control.

207
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,757
You kids and your
fancy book learning.

208
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,726
- Yeah, well, I try to keep up.
- Do a PDR and check a Medline.

209
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,594
See if there's renal dysfunction
associated with the drug.

210
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,166
Okay.

211
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,070
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,771
This is George Guidry.

213
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,741
He's got a skin breakdown
around the shaft of his penis.

214
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,676
- No, he doesn't.
- I think I do.

215
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,274
- Any discharge?
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

216
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,477
- I'm not talking about that. JAKE:
No discharge, no fever, no blisters.

217
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,350
Do you use a condom?

218
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,753
Not since my girlfriend
broke up with me.

219
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,326
No vesicles, no chancre,
no lymphadenopathy.

220
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,463
Okay.

221
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,621
- Let's take a gander.
- Yeah.

222
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,464
You know, I just thought of something.
Could this be from too much...?

223
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,097
You know...

224
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,108
Too much what?

225
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:55,013
Since Lily left, I've
been lonely, you know?

226
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,649
Really...

227
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,842
really lonely.

228
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,982
How lonely?

229
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,616
Uh, six, sometimes
seven times a day.

230
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,466
I found a report in the
Western Journal of Medicine.

231
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:18,196
It suggests a correlation
between renal failure and Zarictal.

232
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,502
- Hmm. Well, that ain't much.
- No, but these might be.

233
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,237
From the adverse drug coordinator
from the Department of Health Services.

234
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,677
Three possible cases
they've forwarded to the FDA.

235
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,874
Four? That could be a pattern.

236
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,578
The Physician Relations number
at Keating-Ward Pharmaceuticals.

237
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,588
They make Zarictal. Might as
well see what they can tell us.

238
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,858
- Yes. WOMAN:
<i>Keating-Ward Pharmaceuticals.</i>

239
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,055
This is John Carter. I'm a physician
at County General in Chicago.

240
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,497
<i>- How are you today, doctor?</i>
- Very well. I have a 16-year-old girl.

241
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:52,070
Status: post-renal transplant who's
been on Zarictal for three months.

242
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,536
<i>You say that's three months?</i>

243
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,438
Could I talk to somebody about
the incidence of renal failure?

244
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,045
<i>- Hold.</i>
- Yes, I will hold.

245
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,183
Does anybody even listen
to that music? It's terrible.

246
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,444
Carter, QRS is
widening on our PKD girl.

247
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,054
- Lots of ectopy.
- I'll hold.

248
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:16,060
- Multifocal PVCs, runs of six.
- Push 80 of lidocaine, and mix up a drip.

249
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,892
- What's going on?
- It's possible the elevated potassium...

250
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,363
is irritating Katie's heart.

251
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,901
BUN, 98. Creatinine,
12.3. Potassium, 7.2.

252
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,062
Most likely she might
be in kidney failure.

253
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,730
V-fib. Starting compressions.

254
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,273
Charge the paddles to 200.

255
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,434
It's going to be
okay. It's okay.

256
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,921
Everybody clear. - Clear.

257
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,652
- Procainamide's onboard.
- And clear.

258
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,098
- Sinus.
- There we go.

259
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,921
Set up for a femoral Quinton.
Call Dialysis for renal orders.

260
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,526
Katie, honey? Katie, honey?

261
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,253
- That's it. CARTER:
Yeah, she's responding.

262
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,093
- O2 on 15 liters.
- Are you sure she needs dialysis?

263
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,202
Uh, it's the best way to remove the
excess potassium from her system.

264
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:00,636
- She has to have another transplant?
- That's a distinct possibility, yes.

265
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,605
- Oh, no.
- Betadine the area.

266
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,710
They said they'd be
in contact in a week.

267
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,972
- And one percent lido. A week?
- That's the standard procedure.

268
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,187
- What's that?
- We telephoned the company...

269
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,774
that makes Katie's medication.

270
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,182
So is it the drug? Is that
why this is happening?

271
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,882
The timing of the med switch makes
me think that is a possibility, yes.

272
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,788
But her kidney is being
damaged by the Zarictal, is that...?

273
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,953
Gabriel, Hannah, I
came as soon as I heard.

274
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,996
- Was she in status?
- No, it's her kidney.

275
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,327
This is Katie's
neurologist, George Henry.

276
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,368
Dr. Carter, um, I don't
know if you remember me...

277
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,007
Yeah, how are you, Henry?
What has it been, six years?

278
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,642
Give or take.

279
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,802
Can you take them to the family
room? I'll be right in to see you.

280
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,813
Oh, okay. Yeah, that's fine.
I think I remember the way.

281
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,974
Come on. It's all right.

282
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,917
I gave pleasure boy some Neosporin, a
therapist's number, and sent him packing.

283
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,185
- Well done.
- How about you? Is everything all right?

284
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,589
Um...

285
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,321
Yes, I'm fine. Busy. Why?

286
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,058
Well, last week when I ran
into you on the El platform...

287
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,328
I didn't realize your situation.

288
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,505
My situation?

289
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,799
It's just that I...

290
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,340
I heard what you went through. I
didn't want you to think I was insensitive.

291
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:15,380
Um, no, I was happy not to
have to talk about it actually.

292
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,215
Okay. Guess I'm
blowing that now.

293
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,514
I just...

294
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,255
I wanna make sure that there
isn't anything that I can, uh, do.

295
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,859
Um, well, that's... That's nice.

296
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,352
It is. Thank you. It's, um...

297
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,022
I... Here's an H & P,
and get back to me.

298
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,599
Right.

299
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,894
Why did you put
me with this guy?

300
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,936
When did everyone
become schedule divas?

301
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,702
I don't need a med student. I don't
like them, and I'm better flying solo.

302
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,210
- Is there something wrong with him?
- No, he's excellent. He's very good.

303
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,645
- He's excellent. I just...
- Oh, no. You like him?

304
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,978
- You know what, forget it.
- Yes, you do! You do! You're blushing.

305
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,053
We never had this conversation.

306
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,123
Hey, haven't you had
enough of doctors?

307
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,789
Put a message on the neurology and renal
newsgroups, see if there's anything...

308
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,160
- on the drug's renal toxicity.
- That could cause a bit of a stir.

309
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,766
Yeah. Uh, all right...

310
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,463
just ask for any information that
might help us best determine treatment.

311
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,233
- You heard what he said.
- I don't believe it's the drug.

312
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:19,243
- I think that there are other options.
- We have a dialysis tech coming down.

313
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,007
I called UNOS. They're
gonna put Katie on the list.

314
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,777
John, that may be premature.
Why don't we do a biopsy.

315
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:30,151
This may be a case of rejection, not
failure, and a biopsy would show us that.

316
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,985
What's the difference?

317
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,526
Well, a drug-induced failure
would require a transplant.

318
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,396
But, uh...

319
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,759
rejection...

320
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,901
Rejection could be reversed
with immunosuppressive agents.

321
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,267
Well, let's do the biopsy.

322
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,102
Okay, I'll put that in motion.

323
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,181
Dr. Henry, can I have a
word with you outside, please?

324
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,407
Excuse me one second.

325
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,910
Um...

326
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,451
My intern's been doing
research. She's found four cases...

327
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,653
- of renal failure in patients on Zarictal.
- Well, that doesn't prove causation.

328
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,294
It gets you going that way.

329
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,957
Keating-Ward sponsored a
series of phase-three clinical trials.

330
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,036
If there was any real risk, the FDA
would never have approved the drug.

331
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,078
What, you never heard
of Vioxx or Rezulin?

332
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,209
This is a successful
anti-seizure medicine.

333
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,039
It has improved Katie's
quality of life dramatically.

334
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,646
Dr. Carter, dialysis is here.

335
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,805
Uh, page Dubenko to
come down for the biopsy?

336
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,679
Sure. These need your signature.

337
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,814
- Well, I hope you're right.
- Let's be certain.

338
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,548
I was really surprised to
find you still working here.

339
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,659
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

340
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,058
I just guess I thought you
would've moved on by now.

341
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,699
I guess I'm just a
masochist that way.

342
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,598
How about you? I thought you
wanted to go do, uh, bench research.

343
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,706
- Yeah, well, I got tired of it.
- You were good at it.

344
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,707
Well, I've got a wife and
two small children now.

345
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,038
It changes one's priorities.

346
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,679
You mean, money?

347
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,909
My practice does offer me three
times the salary of an academic position.

348
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,450
Well, what about you, huh?

349
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,056
Married? Children?

350
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,521
Not yet.

351
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,284
Thanks.

352
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,366
I'll find you when the
surgeon comes down.

353
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,408
Are you moonlighting
as a word processor?

354
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,546
Our PKD girl's on a new drug
we're trying to get information on.

355
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,306
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Dr. Lewis.

356
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:39,576
- Morning.
- Hi. Has anyone seen...?

357
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,279
Is that your coffee?

358
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,215
Sorry.

359
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,458
It's a schedule, not
a cocktail napkin.

360
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,891
GCS, 12. BP, 60
palp. Brady at 52.

361
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,139
- Fell from the roof?
- Taking down lights.

362
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,325
He's gonna need central access.
- Need help?

363
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,262
- Come on down.
- Carter doesn't need you?

364
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,096
Not at the moment, no.

365
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,801
Okay, prime the rapid infuser.

366
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,271
- Can't find a vein.
- Pressure's only 50.

367
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,433
- Heart rate's 42.
- Blood in the belly.

368
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,408
He needs access.
He's about to arrest.

369
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,913
- Set up for a saphenous cutdown.
- Wouldn't a femoral be easier to find?

370
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,744
And faster.

371
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,819
Probably the same difference.
But, okay, femoral tear.

372
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,478
Cool, I've never done one.

373
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,648
You'll do the next
one. Scalpel to Neela.

374
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,486
What? She's along for the ride.

375
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,686
- I promised her.
- You promised her?

376
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,628
Ten centimeters, vertical flash.

377
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,335
- Starting here?
- Deep into the sub-Q.

378
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,767
Level one is primed.

379
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,207
Okay, and now you tear...

380
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,708
- Whoa.
- Got any sterile surgical markers?

381
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,369
There's the femoral vein.

382
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,946
Cannulate it with the 9 French.

383
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,352
- Let me try.
- No, I'll get it.

384
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,149
Just reach under.

385
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,456
Neela, focus on the field.

386
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,462
Seldinger technique.
You know what to do.

387
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,191
Two units ready to go.

388
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,699
Sam, can you ask Dubenko
to come here when he's done?

389
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,631
Yes, sir, Dr. Kovac.

390
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,370
That's the lower lobe
of the kidney there.

391
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,243
- Mark the depth.
- Purple okay?

392
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,509
That's my favorite color.
- Ah, me too.

393
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,313
- Three centimeters.
- They need you next door.

394
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,716
What is this gonna do?

395
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,381
It'll tell us if your body is
rejecting the kidney. Lidocaine.

396
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,324
That's a good thing, honey.
- All right, hold still.

397
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,691
Little pinprick here.

398
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,526
There you go.

399
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,029
It's going to be, like, 20-something
before I can get another one.

400
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,605
- No, that's not going to happen.
- Um, biopsy gun.

401
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:44,710
You just need to tell your immune
system to stop being so picky.

402
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,675
Firing.

403
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,251
Dr. Carter.

404
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,679
Dr. Weaver's on the phone.

405
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,722
- She sounds kind of...
- Kind of what?

406
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,618
- Weaver-like.
- Um, I'll call her back.

407
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,231
Purple, huh? I've always
been partial to azure myself.

408
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,167
- What's azure?
- Like your eyes.

409
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,168
Send that off for light
microscopy, EM and IF staining.

410
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,471
Pack the wound
with a moist gauze.

411
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,407
- What do we have here?
- Belly bleed needs a post-op head CT.

412
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,741
- We have FFP thawing.
- Send it upstairs.

413
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:26,408
Pressure's up to 100
systolic. Heart rate's 90.

414
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,688
Dr. Kovac, I, uh...

415
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,390
I never knew it was
possible to transfuse that fast.

416
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,156
Well, that's the beauty of
the central venous cutdown.

417
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,265
Now you know how to do it.

418
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,300
- What made you recommend Zarictal?
- A luncheon at Northwestern.

419
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,737
I heard a neurologist
present on its efficacies.

420
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,400
A neurologist who's a paid
consultant of Keating-Ward.

421
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,569
- So what? It stopped...
- George? Dr. Carter?

422
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,215
- Is everything all right?
- Um...

423
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,245
If the biopsy doesn't
give us what we want...

424
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,614
if she needs another kidney...

425
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,155
could I give her my other one?

426
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,518
That would require you being
on dialysis for the rest of your life.

427
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,925
- No, I understand that. CARTER:
I don't know it's even ethical...

428
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,430
for someone to donate
their only remaining kidney.

429
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,334
So it's not possible.

430
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,598
I don't know of any responsible
doctor that would agree to do it.

431
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:25,036
Gabe, listen. I... I
know that you're scared.

432
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,679
But let's just take
this one step at a time.

433
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,105
- Okay?
- Okay.

434
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,808
Go in there and be with Katie.
- Carter.

435
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,386
Some neurologist in
Skokie sent this fax for you.

436
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,113
Thanks.

437
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,625
Whew.

438
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,657
It's a "Dear doctor" letter from
the pharmaceutical company.

439
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,957
It says there have been isolated
cases of renal failure on Zarictal.

440
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,727
Yes, I know. It recommends
monthly monitoring of renal function...

441
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,566
which I've been doing
with Katie. BUN, creatinine.

442
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,536
- You got one of these?
- Yes, so did you.

443
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,167
Letters were sent to every physician
in the country. They're a caution.

444
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,644
- So you knew about this.
- Private practitioners...

445
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,682
get letters like that all the time.
I followed its recommendations.

446
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,684
But you know what the biopsy's
gonna show, says so right here.

447
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,290
- Well, I'm hoping that's not the case.
- Dr. Carter, do you have a moment?

448
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,023
- Problem?
- No, Kerry just...

449
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:18,153
You posted a warning about
Zarictal on an Internet message board?

450
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,494
I posted a request
for information.

451
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,068
I'm getting a lot of phone
calls. I hate phone calls.

452
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,729
Neurologists, our head of nephrology,
the director from KW Pharmaceuticals...

453
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,569
Just wanted to
be better informed.

454
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,075
By jumping to conclusions
based on skimpy evidence?

455
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,907
Tell it to the Milners, their
daughter needs a new kidney.

456
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,676
You have one sick girl, that's unfortunate.
The drug companies have access...

457
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,411
to thousands of patients
before they release a drug...

458
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,453
They didn't use any
renal patients when...

459
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:48,458
They can't document every side effect.
You're working beyond your responsibility.

460
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,357
You telling me how to do my job?

461
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,590
I'm telling you the FDA has an
Adverse Drug Event division...

462
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,203
Which is run by political appointees
funded by the drug companies.

463
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,601
The number one lobbyist in the
country is the pharmaceutical industry.

464
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,765
Come here. Come on.

465
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,743
- Pick up a bottle.
- Kerry...

466
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,210
Do it.

467
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,078
Pravastatin.

468
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,550
Saves millions from
heart attacks and strokes.

469
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,712
- Enoxaparin. Know what this is?
- Yes, I do.

470
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,758
It offers better PE prophylaxis and
allows DVT patients to be treated at home.

471
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,226
Linezolid. Fights off strains
of MRSA that used to be fatal.

472
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,887
- I think he gets it.
- Does he?

473
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,591
- Yeah, he does.
- These drugs save lives.

474
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:33,102
The companies that make them donate
$20 million to our academic programs.

475
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:37,073
Without that, we have no hospital.
We'd be standing in a mini-mall.

476
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:41,111
- That makes it okay to suppress results?
- Who says that's what they're doing?

477
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,341
Putting these drugs out here,
seeing how they work is how we learn.

478
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,918
- It's how medicine advances.
- And that's not naive?

479
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:53,025
Your job is to take care of
your patients, not start a crusade.

480
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,395
Susan, you're the boss. Tell
him to keep his eye on the ball.

481
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,601
No more computer access for you.

482
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,872
It's like I forgot where I was.

483
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:14,707
I was just looking at
him like he was a huge...

484
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,276
- cupcake. CASHIER:
You want one?

485
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,782
Ah, it's just a
metaphor. Thanks.

486
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:24,515
So you have a crush on Luka.

487
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,950
That's kind of weird.

488
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,617
It's just a crush.

489
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:31,923
Crushes are by nature
idealized, unrealistic.

490
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,963
What about Dr. Gibson?
That sounded real.

491
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,659
Gross, but real.

492
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,571
My God, you're
right. It's a pattern.

493
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,436
- I'm a slut for authority.
- Stop it.

494
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,601
- Well, what about you?
- What about me?

495
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,146
- I heard you punched your med student?
- So?

496
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,640
He was bugging me.

497
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,284
- So you're hung up on a subordinate.
- No, I'm not.

498
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:59,289
- I have a thing for a supervisor.
- So, what, I'm like the yin to your yang?

499
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,324
What are we gonna do?

500
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,690
Ignore it, hope it goes away.

501
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,322
- Right. No need to discuss it.
- No, denial works.

502
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,663
- Sam, dog bite in 3. I wrote for Unasyn.
- I'll get to it.

503
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,106
- You check on my biopsy results yet?
- Yeah, Dubenko is on his way.

504
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:21,645
- What about my patient in Exam 2?
- I'm waiting on a repeat CBC. Sam?

505
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:25,478
Done and sent.
Nice seeing you all.

506
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,617
Isometric vacuolization
of the renal tubular cells...

507
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,159
- consistent with drug toxicity.
- No chance that this is rejection?

508
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,230
No tubulitis, no
edema, no inflammation.

509
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,890
- The girl needs a new kidney.
- And it's from the drug?

510
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,535
I'd say so...

511
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,228
- but I don't want to encourage you.
- Encourage me?

512
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,179
Some of my colleagues
were suggesting

513
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:50,342
you've been all over
the Internet with this.

514
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,876
- I was trying to be thorough.
- Word of advice?

515
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,378
Don't piss off the money people.

516
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,145
Hi, everybody.

517
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,084
This is Katie's biopsy results.

518
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,222
And unfortunately, they are
not what we had hoped for.

519
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,061
So it's not rejection?

520
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,828
No.

521
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,829
No, it's irreversibly damaged.

522
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,730
And is this, um, ahem...
Is this from the Zarictal?

523
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,536
No, it could be from the
tacrolimus she's been on.

524
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,646
I doubt that. Her levels have
been therapeutic for two years.

525
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:35,847
Wow. So this, uh, drug I've
been working two jobs to pay for...

526
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,047
just to make her life better...

527
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,683
has ruined her donated kidney?

528
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,188
I'm afraid so.

529
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,426
You told me... You
told us it was working.

530
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,230
Sometimes drug interaction
can only become apparent...

531
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,635
after the first year
or two of release.

532
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,935
This couldn't have
been anticipated.

533
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,875
So we're back to waiting?

534
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,447
Well, UNOS will prioritize
her for a new kidney.

535
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,948
That will take three,
four years, if we're lucky?

536
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:09,316
In the meantime, I'm gonna
recommend we get a surgeon down here...

537
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,822
to see about creating a forearm
shunt to facilitate dialysis access.

538
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,926
I can take care of that. - Okay.

539
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,228
- We're back to where we started.
- She'll be on that machine...

540
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,559
all through high
school? Through college?

541
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,065
Just because it took a
while to get the kidney...

542
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,330
No, it didn't take a
while, there wasn't one.

543
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,804
I gave her mine.

544
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,819
We have given up a lot.

545
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,988
Made a lot of sacrifices.

546
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,436
You told me this
drug was worth it.

547
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,455
Okay, uh, show me your incision.

548
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,564
Fifth ICS, anterior
axillary line.

549
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,198
Go for it.

550
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,301
Pulse ox is 92 on five liters.

551
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,976
Push that in just
superior to the rib.

552
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,082
Okay, spread the clamp.

553
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,082
Sats are coming up.

554
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,483
And slip your finger
into the pleural space.

555
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:57,094
- Ah, I lost the tract.
- That's okay. Keep your finger in there.

556
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,356
Just guide the tube.

557
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,558
Uh, I'm above the
rib, but it won't pass.

558
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,070
There you go.

559
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,505
Okay.

560
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,335
That is where you want to go.

561
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,446
- All right, I got it.
- Okay.

562
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,940
Keep advancing.

563
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:21,382
A little bit deeper, because you
want all the ports in the pleural space.

564
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,084
Thora-Seal's
ready, so is suction.

565
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,427
That's very good.

566
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,462
Hello?

567
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,766
Uh, okay, sew it in.

568
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,441
Somebody put something
in the water today?

569
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,204
Call it "pulseless electrical
activity following trauma."

570
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,941
- Right. KOVAC: Change
"blade" into "scalpel."

571
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:55,076
Don't say "torn," say "dissected."
Call it the "field of exposure."

572
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,279
Uh, you left out the
size of the cordis.

573
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,721
- 9 French.
- Okay, write it down.

574
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:03,123
And, uh, not "blood."
"Packed red cells."

575
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,329
Okay, good job.

576
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,092
- Just make the changes, and I'll co-sign.
- Okay.

577
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,734
Hey, Neela.

578
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,630
I hope I didn't give you
the wrong impression.

579
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,244
You're a Resident and I'm an
Attending, and I want to help you learn...

580
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,812
Yeah, I got it. I
understand. I'm sorry.

581
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,313
No, it's just... I wouldn't
want anything to get...

582
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,475
I got it, I got it.
I got it, thanks.

583
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,801
Vitals are stable.

584
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,597
- I need to grab an amp of bicarb.
- Okay.

585
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,874
Katie's T waves
are back to normal...

586
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:53,842
which means her potassium
has come down. That's good.

587
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,547
He went to work.

588
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,713
- Mr. Milner?
- Mm-hm.

589
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,781
He took a second job...

590
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,723
as a security guard over
at the jewelry center...

591
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:13,729
just to try to help pay
for everything, you know?

592
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,898
Nothing means more to
him than Katie getting well.

593
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,866
Nothing.

594
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,637
Her illness just changed him.

595
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,079
Ruined our marriage.

596
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,078
It's important to
stay optimistic.

597
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,178
A lot of good things could
still happen, Mrs. Milner.

598
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:42,327
MVC with passenger-space
intrusion. ETA, 7.

599
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,463
- Okay, we'll take it.
- What's MVC?

600
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,155
Motor vehicle collision,
another new protocol.

601
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,530
- No such thing as an accident.
- Ah, I liked MVA.

602
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,467
- I like walks in the springtime.
- John, a minute, please?

603
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,800
- I'll catch up to you.
- Um...

604
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,500
I was aware of the
potential for toxicity.

605
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:01,340
But it was only one case
report in an obscure journal.

606
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,540
Well, you could have found out
more doing a simple Medline search.

607
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:08,209
I can't do a Medline search every
time I put a patient on a new drug.

608
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,286
I've got 20
patients on Zarictal.

609
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,980
- Twenty?
- They're all doing well.

610
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,149
What, are you on the
Keating-Ward payroll?

611
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,522
Listen, as part of
an ongoing study...

612
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,961
I send in a monthly update
on each patient's progress.

613
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,463
And they compensate you?

614
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,693
A small stipend for my time.

615
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,404
- Hope your malpractice premiums are paid.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

616
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,374
I am reimbursed for helping monitor a
drug by doing thorough patient evaluations.

617
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,912
That the company only pays attention
to if it says what they want it to.

618
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,482
Her seizures stopped.
She was very happy.

619
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,983
- The father was thrilled.
- He's real thrilled now.

620
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,917
Listen, I am trying to be
a cutting-edge clinician.

621
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,733
That's what the patients want.
- Guys.

622
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,488
I have to offer the most
efficacious meds on the market.

623
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,838
Well, the problem is that
last part, isn't it? The market.

624
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,160
Yo.

625
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,559
What?

626
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,963
Mr. Milner?

627
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,899
- Hey.
- Hey.

628
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,668
Uh, ahem...

629
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,369
I was, uh...

630
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,742
I was going to work,
and I thought, "Why?"

631
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,345
What is the point now?

632
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,184
- Um...
- Gabe, put the gun away.

633
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:25,227
I put everything in your hands.

634
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,367
Everything. And
you let her down.

635
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:33,068
Listen, Katie can still live a
long, productive life on dialysis.

636
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,931
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

637
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,543
Come on, why shouldn't I?
- Please.

638
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,703
You know what we should do?
Let's go inside and see your family.

639
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,748
Come on, let's go inside and
we'll see your family right now.

640
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:54,086
I want to give my kidney to her.

641
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,056
Okay.

642
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,756
Hey, maybe I was wrong about
that. Maybe you can be the donor.

643
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,259
You're lying. I
know you're lying.

644
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,636
I...

645
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,674
- Fix her, okay?
- Yeah.

646
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,141
- For me.
- Yeah, we're gonna fix her.

647
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,012
- Sats down to 88.
- Can you see the cords?

648
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,486
Lots of blood.

649
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,353
All right, somebody go find his wife.
- Okay, tube.

650
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,822
And get that girl out of here.
Come on, move her to another room.

651
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,194
Gray matter covers the occiput.

652
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,200
- Why the hell would he do this?
- He was distraught.

653
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,962
Pupils fixed and dilated.

654
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,129
Pressure's only 80/60.

655
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,969
Start dopamine at 10 mics.
- No gag when I tubed him.

656
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,542
No. No corneal reflex.

657
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,373
- Can he regain any function?
- No, he's as brain-dead as they come.

658
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,848
- I'll go talk to her.
- No. No, no, no, wait. Let me.

659
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,681
I'm her family's doctor.

660
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,388
Transplant coordinator's down.

661
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,666
Technically, there's nobody
else who can give consent.

662
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,933
The girl has a very
rare tissue type, Amparo.

663
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,044
- The father is a match.
- I've made that clear to UNOS.

664
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,771
Look, I'm trying to get
them to allow us to proceed.

665
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,745
For now, keep
him on Fi02 of 100.

666
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,579
Make sure the girl's NPO in
the hope she goes to the O.R.

667
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,449
- Just do everything that you can, okay?
- I will.

668
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,592
- Go back under your rock.
- I'm from the <i>Trib</i>. It's a good paper.

669
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,420
Yeah, right. You
guys endorsed Bush.

670
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,563
Man, a guy shoots himself.
What's next, a plague of frogs?

671
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,757
There's a gang of press outside.
Someone has to go talk to them...

672
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,267
- get them the hell out of here.
- Obviously, the guy was depressed.

673
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:49,636
All we know is he's in critical
condition. We can't go into any details.

674
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:55,036
"Heartfelt sympathy to the family.
We're doing everything we can." Good?

675
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:59,278
- You want me to talk to them?
- You treated these people.

676
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,717
Just play up the fact we're
respecting the family's privacy, okay?

677
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:06,053
M.A.P. is only 90. Can
we go up on the dopamine?

678
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,456
We're maxed out. I got
a p.r.n. for Levophed.

679
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,220
Sounds good.

680
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,529
Maybe we need to talk?

681
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,928
No, we really don't.

682
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,441
It's just he helped me to
adjust coming back to work here.

683
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,543
He made things a lot
easier, and I guess...

684
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,105
I don't know, I got confused.

685
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,342
I get confused every
time I look at him.

686
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,948
Did you work on this family?

687
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,257
His daughter, yeah.

688
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,320
I'm sorry.

689
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,158
Levophed's going at two mics.

690
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:53,134
Does Gabriel Milner have a
daughter being treated in ER?

691
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,830
- Ahem. Yes, he does.
- Now, is it true...

692
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,704
- she's suffering from kidney failure?
- Uh, I can't say.

693
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,540
Didn't you indicate that
earlier on a medical website?

694
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,182
General queries... Abby.

695
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,678
Hi. JAKE: Hey.

696
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,949
Do you want to go
get something to eat?

697
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,686
I know this, uh, awesome
little Ethiopian place.

698
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,524
They, um... They make
you eat with your hands...

699
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,895
but I got sterile gloves
in my bag, so it's okay.

700
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,527
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

701
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,203
No.

702
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,375
But don't take it personally.

703
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,638
Okay. Uh...

704
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,409
I'm not really a subtle guy.

705
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:42,417
But I was under the impression that
there's sort of a thing happening here.

706
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,101
Maybe not a big
thing, but still, a thing.

707
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,125
A thing?

708
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,323
Um...

709
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,156
Yeah. Yeah, maybe
there's a thing...

710
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,855
but you know what,
nothing's gonna happen.

711
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,158
- Why is that?
- Well, a lot of reasons...

712
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,067
which I won't mention because I don't
feel like sharing my checkered past.

713
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,834
- Why?
- Or my various neuroses.

714
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,069
Uh, but there's one really big
reason that's a deal breaker for me.

715
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,875
You miss the beard?

716
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,581
No.

717
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,248
You're my student.

718
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,585
Ah...

719
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,381
I'm grading you.

720
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,249
Uh-huh.

721
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,424
Well, I think that that
is not appropriate.

722
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,054
Uh-huh.

723
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,261
And have a good night.

724
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:33,767
You know, um, what if I was
willing to take an F right now?

725
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,108
Yeah, I forgot to mention to you
that I'm dropping out of med school.

726
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:43,311
Yeah. Who wants to
be a doctor anyway?

727
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,029
<i>It's incumbent upon you
to share the information...</i>

728
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,251
<i>if you have possible fatal side
effects of a popular new drug?</i>

729
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,296
<i>Katie Milner was on
Zarictal for three months...</i>

730
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,629
<i>and, yes, I believe the
drug ruined her kidney.</i>

731
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,566
"Out of respect for the family,
that's all I can say." Is that so hard?

732
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,831
- They knew it all already.
- No, they didn't.

733
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,975
You're alleging
potential slander that

734
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,307
could cost the hospital
millions in support.

735
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,641
What are you worried about, free
pens, coffee cups and drug samples?

736
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:20,444
I'm worried about research grants, a thing
HIPAA calls "patient confidentiality."

737
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,645
- I didn't want to talk to them!
- "Out of respect for the family."

738
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,484
You wanna talk to them, then
you do it. It's your damn ER.

739
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,786
- You're right, I will.
- Dr. Lewis, Dr. Weaver.

740
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,328
Oh, I wonder what she
wants to talk to me about?

741
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,159
It's true, right?

742
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,496
You did a good thing.

743
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,661
You say that like it matters.

744
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,173
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

745
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,645
UNOS gave us the go ahead.
We're gonna do the transplant.

746
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,845
- Oh, thank God. NEELA:
They're bringing Mr. Milner up.

747
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,480
She doesn't know where the kidney's
coming from. I haven't told her yet.

748
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,652
That can wait. Let's go inside
and talk with the anesthesiologist.

749
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,861
You a medical student?

750
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,007
First-year Resident.

751
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,306
How's that going?

752
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:24,881
Some days are better than
others. I like it well enough.

753
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,385
What do you think
they'll tell Katie?

754
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:34,014
They'll tell her that
her father loved her.

755
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,928
Maybe too much.

756
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,560
Transplant surgery's underway.

757
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:54,702
I can't take responsibility
for how the system works...

758
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,371
but I can try to
do my job better.

759
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,251
That's all any of us can do.

760
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,945
I don't know why I was
surprised to find you here.

761
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:05,913
Of course you're still here.

762
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,961
Hope we see each other again,
under more favorable circumstances.

763
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,929
You were always good to
me when I was a student.

764
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,399
I remember that.

765
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,542
Anspaugh wants to see us and
Weaver in his office tomorrow morning.

766
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,883
- Suture removal in Curtain 3.
- Hey...

767
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,852
if any of this rolls back
onto you, I'm sorry.

768
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,791
- Mr. Klossey?
- Hi, doc.

769
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,460
How are you today? What
are we looking at here?

770
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:58,838
I did this skiing on Michigan Avenue,
cross-country, during the last big snow.

771
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,502
- Mm-hm.
- Little fall, gashed my arm.

772
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,639
But I hadn't done it in 10
years, so even that felt good.

773
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,649
- Why did you stop?
- Arthritis. I had it bad.

774
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:12,985
Couldn't bowl, couldn't sit
in those seats at Wrigley...

775
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,921
take my niece for a walk.

776
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:18,122
So, what happened?

777
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:21,596
I saw an ad on TV for Renuvium.

778
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,201
A doc at the clinic
gave me a prescription.

779
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,394
Fixed me right up.

780
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,169
- Renuvium?
- Yeah, a little red pill...

781
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,174
once in the morning, let
me do all those things...

782
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,812
I thought I had
given up forever.

783
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,847
- That's something, huh?
- Yeah.

784
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,016
Okay, this might
hurt just a little bit.

785
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:45,685
Damn miracle of
medicine, that's what it is.
