1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,101
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,366
Got it!

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,010
They warned me about this
place. They weren't kidding.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,840
This is the second time you've
been wrong about my patients today.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,311
And you know
what? It's the last.

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,493
I wanna know where
the damn social worker is.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,577
Covering two hospitals
by herself till midnight.

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,232
That's my excuse for being late.
What's yours for being an ass?

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,913
Dr. Lewis?

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,490
When do you need me to start?

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,961
Shock, shock...

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:36,433
epi, shock, lido, shock,
consider mag two grams, shock...

13
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,801
procainamide, shock,
consider bicarb, shock...

14
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,034
shock, epi, shock,
lido, shock...

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,145
consider mag two grams, shock...

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,510
lido, shock, consider
mag two grams, shock...

17
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,780
procainamide, shock,
consider bicarb, shock.

18
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,594
Shit.

19
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,921
- You going?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,861
I'm sorry. Rounds start at 7.

21
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,334
It's barely even light out.

22
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,360
Yeah, well, welcome to my life.

23
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,001
Nice meeting you.

24
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,837
I'm killing my plants, ignoring
my bills. I have to get it together.

25
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,609
- What's a loading dose of amiodarone?
- Neela, stop.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,014
And remind me to buy
toilet paper on the way home.

27
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,485
This is weird. Don't
you think this is weird?

28
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,716
Am I destined to spend my youth
in a fetid, windowless hospital?

29
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,224
You needed a job and now
you're here. Quit whining.

30
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,435
I'm not sure if this
is really what I want.

31
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:10,193
Well, fake it.

32
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,526
Does everyone know I
had a meltdown and quit?

33
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,634
Hey, Dr. Jumbo
Mart. How you feeling?

34
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,869
Need a doctor over here.

35
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,899
Fifteen-year-old,
multiple GSW to the chest.

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,012
Tachy with shallow resps,
18 gauge in the right antecube.

37
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,206
- Hey, man. What's your name?
- He's apneic. Throw me that bag.

38
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,851
Sam, we need a trauma room.

39
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,180
Nothing's open. We got
them lining the hallways.

40
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,482
- Get an Attending. SAM:
Lewis is doing a subclavian.

41
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,989
He's lost his pulse.

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,127
Starting compressions.
- Eight-0.

43
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,561
Mg of epi. Atropine ready to go.
- Got it.

44
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,928
- Tube.
- Neela, could you open his shirt, please?

45
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:50,070
I'm in. Neela,
listen to the chest.

46
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,604
Neela, come on!

47
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,935
- IV's infiltrated.
- I'll give it endotrachially.

48
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,775
No breath sounds on the right.

49
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,772
- Okay. He needs a chest tube.
- Open a chest-tube tray.

50
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,109
- You carry a scalpel? RAY:
Yeah. Bone saw's too bulky.

51
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,753
Could you take
over for me, please?

52
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,058
- No carotid.
- Atropine and another epi.

53
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,459
Forty French on
a Kelly, right here.

54
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,428
A huge hemothorax. ABBY: Oh.

55
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,904
How come nobody told
me you were such a badass?

56
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,270
Got a pulse.

57
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,737
That's what I like to
see, interns with initiative.

58
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,077
Come on. Trauma 2's open.
Someone call Housekeeping.

59
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,778
Next?

60
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,301
And finally, in Curtain 3, we
have 3-year-old GB here with RW.

61
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,000
- RW?
- She's going crazy...

62
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,375
- with this patient-privacy thing.
- What's RW stand for?

63
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,641
- Really whiny?
- Refusal to walk.

64
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,217
"Refusal to walk" has
its own abbreviation?

65
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,717
Neela, what's your differential?

66
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,356
- Septic hip.
- Intra-articular infection...

67
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,961
toxic synovitis, osteo, sickle
crisis and avascular necrosis.

68
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,824
- What about the workup?
- CBC, sed rate, cultures, x-ray...

69
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,829
and arthrocentesis
if there's an effusion.

70
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,298
Wow, first day back and
she's showing up you bums.

71
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,666
Dr. Pratt, what's the most common
pathogen found in septic arthritis?

72
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,069
Dr. Barnett, septic arthritis?

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,674
Um... Med students...

74
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,141
for a new dishwasher and
a lifetime supply of Ensure:

75
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,542
What is the most common
bug in septic arthritis?

76
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,046
- Staph aureus.
- Followed by strep and hemophilus.

77
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,185
I gotta go. Chuck's
waiting in the car.

78
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,020
- I guess the dream team is reunited.
- Ha, ha. Cool.

79
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,713
Yeah.

80
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,226
Good morning, Urbanus.

81
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,558
Guess I'm with you again?

82
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,758
Over 60 in Triage. Some of them
were here when I left last night.

83
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,598
Okay, Pratt, run the board.
Let's move some patients, huh?

84
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,502
Okay, people,
come on, listen up.

85
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,337
For the past month, we've
been cutting you a lot of slack.

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,672
- You have?
- Today the training wheels come off.

87
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,247
You're doctors. It's time to
stop thinking like students...

88
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,179
and take on a real patient load.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,685
I want you to discharge
25 patients this shift each.

90
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,181
- Twenty-five?
- It's just two an hour.

91
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,451
Med students, present
your patients to interns.

92
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,791
Interns, run your cases by me or an
Attending before ordering labs or scans.

93
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,693
All right, here we go.

94
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,301
Ray, asthmatic in two.
Abby, PPD reading.

95
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,901
Neela, teenager with a cough.

96
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,800
Something nice and
easy to get you started.

97
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,133
Twenty-five each.
And I'm counting.

98
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,536
Only ones left. I guess
that makes us a team.

99
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,742
Oh. Jane Figler,
fourth-year medical student.

100
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,712
- It was quite a flash entrance you made.
- Thanks.

101
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,719
With rumors about how you
freaked out, it's great how you...

102
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,221
- came in and set everyone straight...
- Excuse me.

103
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,793
- Can you sign my procedure log?
- Mm.

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,725
Chest tube in your first five
minutes. Trying to impress me?

105
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,298
Just so you know, I don't
want you to go easy on me.

106
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,833
Believe me, I won't. If
you need help, just ask.

107
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,504
Dude, I forgot. Kuharczuk
in Curtain 4 needs a pelvic.

108
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,572
You're signing out a
pelvic? That's weak.

109
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,073
I gotta get out of here,
man. I'm back in 11 hours.

110
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,266
She's yours.

111
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,244
And by the way, nice move starting
late. Makes internship shorter.

112
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,076
Okay, so I gotta ask.

113
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,185
Why did they kick you out of Michigan?
- Chocolate?

114
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,750
Okay. History of two ICU admissions
and prior intubation a few months ago.

115
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,291
We gotta be aggressive with
this guy. Chuny, chocolate?

116
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,157
- Uh, no, thanks. I'm trying to watch it.
- You? You can eat whatever you want.

117
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,663
Okay. What do you need, Ray?

118
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,427
Could you please hit our
wheezer in 3 with 60 of pred?

119
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,934
- You got it.
- All right.

120
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,699
Lesson number one: Feed the nurses.
It'll make the jobs 50 percent easier.

121
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:21,933
Hi. Chocolate?

122
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,686
Too early. We like
bagels in the morning.

123
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,975
- No, no. Come on, take one for later.
- Ooh, hazelnut.

124
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,945
- Where do we keep peak-flow meters?
- Uh, in drug lockup...

125
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,177
- and, yes, I will get it for you, Ray.
- You're the best, Sam.

126
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,451
The result is borderline
but your steroid use...

127
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,524
and your incarceration
put you at risk.

128
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,160
- For what?
- TB.

129
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,728
- So I do have it?
- Not necessarily.

130
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,957
- Okay, can I see a doctor?
- Sir, I am the doctor.

131
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,795
We're gonna get you a chest
x-ray and a couple more tests.

132
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,870
Do we call it positive
and treat with INH?

133
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,164
See what the x-ray says.

134
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,242
Does a positive PPD involve type
three or type four hypersensitivity?

135
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,641
Sorry. Obscure question,
just trying to impress you.

136
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,748
Community-acquired
pneumonia, mycoplasma...

137
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,248
viral pneumonitis, reactive
airways, pulmonary edema...

138
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,648
- tracheal foreign body...
- Stop.

139
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,682
His chest is clear. It's a cold.
Fluids, ibuprofen and home.

140
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,759
I've got a guy with an equivocal
PPD and a load of risk factors.

141
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,226
- Does he have to take INH?
- Call ID, check it out.

142
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,332
- Okay. Let's look it up.
- No, no. Ha. He'll go look it up.

143
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,092
It doesn't take
two to open a book.

144
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,203
Delegate to your student
and find a new patient.

145
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,498
See, look at Ray. He's discharged
his second patient already.

146
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,234
Come on, pick it up, ladies.
He's making you look bad.

147
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,778
- Need a doc over here!
- Hey, go.

148
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,941
Dropped right in front of us.
Transient, LOC. Never even signed in.

149
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,586
Hello, my name is Dr. Rasgotra.

150
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,280
- Can you tell me your name?
- Juan Enriquez.

151
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,288
I forgot to eat
breakfast, that's all.

152
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,222
- Let's get him up.
- Oh, he's bleeding.

153
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,919
- Pulse is racing.
- I'm... I'm okay.

154
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,723
- Chuny, what's open?
- Exam 2.

155
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,731
- I just gotta go... Gotta go home.
- Just a second.

156
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,397
What are the bruises from?

157
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,028
I noticed them last night on my
legs, but I really didn't think much of it.

158
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,706
When I woke up this morning,
it was... It was much worse.

159
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,244
- Okay, let's go.
- Seven-year-old with a lead level of 59.

160
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,975
The city notified the family
three weeks ago to come in.

161
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,312
Three weeks ago? Okay,
what does that tell us?

162
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,321
- He's got bad parents?
- It tells us his lead exposure is chronic.

163
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,927
If he was poisoned, he'd have symptoms
and there's no way they would wait.

164
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,824
- Does this case belong in the ER?
- No.

165
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,898
They wouldn't wait here unless
they didn't have someplace else.

166
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,932
System's broken.
Can't blame the victims.

167
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,231
Good morning, Mr. Lucas.

168
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,603
I'm Dr. Barnett. Heard
you have a lead problem.

169
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,405
- Am I getting a shot?
- No, man. We wouldn't do that to you.

170
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,572
They, uh, tested him at school.
I don't know how he got it.

171
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,583
The city will send somebody to
your house to look for sources.

172
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,244
He's always been
sick. Born early.

173
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,447
But look at you now, tough guy.

174
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,649
- You a pro football player?
- No.

175
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,022
He had breathing problems
when he was a baby.

176
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,321
How about basketball?

177
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,762
- Aren't you the point guard for the Bulls?
- No, I'm in first grade.

178
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,370
Lucas, dude, you're playing it
cool but I know you're famous.

179
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,301
So I'm gonna have to ask
for your autograph. Okay?

180
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,738
Do a quick head-to-toe. Okay.

181
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,814
- Hey, lead clinic, please.
<i>- Just a minute.</i>

182
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,813
He had a seizure
once when he was 2...

183
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,543
- when he was sick.
- Febrile seizure. It's very common.

184
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,381
Hey, it's Dr. Barnett in the ER.

185
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,390
Yeah, I have a 7-year-old with an
elevated lead who needs chelation.

186
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,357
Okay. Thank you very much.

187
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:34,132
Okay, you're all set. A nurse
will walk you over to the lead clinic.

188
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,132
- Okay. Thanks, doc.
- Punch it.

189
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,170
I'm gonna sell your autograph
on eBay for a million dollars.

190
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,638
- A billion dollars.
- All right.

191
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,037
Let's go.

192
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:47,905
Five-minute discharge,
boys. Watch and learn.

193
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,913
Are troponins useful in ruling out
coronary aneurysms in Kawasaki's?

194
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,990
Aren't enough
good studies on kids.

195
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,491
Do ex-preemies have a
problem with lead metabolism?

196
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,755
No. Patients will tell you
all kinds of irrelevant crap.

197
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,422
- They don't know what's important.
- You're so patient.

198
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,001
The key is to look like you're listening
while you're doing your charting.

199
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,229
Multitask.

200
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,739
Guys, it is the key to survival
in the ER. There you go.

201
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,013
Is that really the best
advice you can come up with?

202
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,777
- Second best. First was feed the nurses.
- Well, they're students.

203
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:28,012
They should focus on taking a
history and learn efficiency later.

204
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,022
Med school teaches them to
practice medicine in fantasyland.

205
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,457
Never gonna clear that room if it
takes us two hours working up a case.

206
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,119
No such thing as a slam-dunk
case, not as an intern.

207
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,458
Suit up. We got a
trauma coming in.

208
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,126
Jet ski crash. Injuries
to head and neck.

209
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,864
Tachy and hypotensive, 78 palp.
GCS one, one, one in the field.

210
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,201
Check out the asthmatic.
This may take a while.

211
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,242
- On my count. One, two, three.
- Okay, on my count.

212
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,810
Got a 911 page. Looks
like I'm in the right place.

213
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,541
Yeah, jet ski accident.
Okay, Abby, your patient.

214
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,195
- Too much trauma...
- Poor aeration.

215
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,085
We're gonna need a crike.

216
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,119
Weak carotid. Crike tray to me.

217
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,656
- Can I hear vitals?
- Access?

218
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,554
- One peripheral.
- Start another one.

219
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,287
- Hang a liter of LR.
- Do we have a pressure yet?

220
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,932
- His wife is here.
- Get this?

221
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:18,068
Why don't we give the doctors room to
work and I'll explain everything to you.

222
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,900
Why don't you call
the blood bank?

223
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,907
- Full trauma panel, type and cross for 6.
- Sats only 84.

224
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,307
We need a portable chest
and respiratory down here.

225
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,810
Get him a blanket. He's cold.

226
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,075
<i>- Blood bank.</i>
- Hi, I need four units of O-neg in the ER.

227
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,742
- What happened? That was yours.
- No, it's a trauma.

228
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,753
- No medical-record number yet. Thanks.
- Don't say thank you...

229
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,949
- and don't let the boys bully you.
- I wasn't letting the boys...

230
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,803
You play with your hair
when you're nervous.

231
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,090
I can't get a vein.

232
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,027
Get back in there. Your
patient needs a central line.

233
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,129
Chest x-ray's clear.
CT's negative...

234
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:52,432
- BP's better after 2 liters.
- What does that mean? Huh? Is it bad?

235
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,700
- It's too soon to make any diagnosis.
- Just hang in there.

236
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,638
It sounds like the
fluids helped you.

237
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,609
You ordered a CT, films and
labs without talking to me first?

238
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,874
- You were busy.
- So where's your student?

239
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,383
- She's in Sutures taking out stitches.
- You know, I really don't get it.

240
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,384
I mean, you're proactive,
you're delegating...

241
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,114
and yet you're
still in last place.

242
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,956
Here. Med refill, five minutes. Go.
Ray and Abby are stuck in Trauma.

243
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,562
This is your chance to catch up.

244
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,059
- Femoral's in.
- Sats down to 78.

245
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,497
Neck's too mangled.
Anatomy's distorted.

246
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,727
Feel the landmarks.

247
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,870
Jet skis account for 20 percent of boats
but are involved in 44 percent of injuries.

248
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,840
- Know why that is, Dr. Lockhart?
- No. Three-0 nylon.

249
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,673
No is right. No throttle,
no steering, no way to stop.

250
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,457
- Still can't find...
- You're fine.

251
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,747
Make your cut.
Extend with the clamp.

252
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,649
Good. Perfect. Insert the tube.

253
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,853
So if this poor guy hit a pylon
driving his jet ski 30 miles an hour...

254
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,223
what was the equivalent G-force?

255
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,262
- Got it. Give me the bag.
- Seven G's.

256
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:56,266
This guy's head was subjected to 7
G's of force. That's equivalent to...?

257
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,268
- We're doctors, not physicists.
- Uh, pressure's dropping.

258
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,775
- V-tach. Lost the pulse. Take the airway.
- Starting compressions.

259
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,878
The impact of 999 pounds
dropped on his head.

260
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,606
- That's what you're up against.
- Not all I'm up against.

261
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,081
- You're gonna shock him?
- Charging to 200.

262
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,829
- Watch yourself.
- I'm not near the bed.

263
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,877
Exactly.

264
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,934
You want me to grab the
paddles out of his hand?

265
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,015
Mg of epi, have lido on deck.

266
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,602
- You did it again.
- Did what?

267
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,992
The hair.

268
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,034
I mean, eight years of school. Most
people would just suck it up, you know?

269
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,866
- Diarrhea times eleven months?
- What did your parents say?

270
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,737
- My dad would have ripped my head off.
- Why don't you start the history?

271
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,269
All right, guys, talk to me.

272
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,177
Homeless guy with gnarly feet.
Clotrimazole, new socks, home.

273
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,511
Seven-year-old with lice.
Permethrin shampoo, repeat in a week.

274
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,781
Good work, guys.
Keep them coming.

275
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,291
Still in the lead with 11,
Abby seven, Neela four.

276
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,853
Ray gets credit for those? He's in
Trauma, he didn't even see them.

277
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,123
- The students are part of his team.
- That's not fair. He's got two.

278
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,990
Can you handle two students?

279
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,462
You better go in with me. There's
a patient crouched in the corner.

280
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,539
Every time I go near her, she
starts, like, yelling in Chinese.

281
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,740
That galea. He's
basically scalped.

282
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,472
- Just tamponade the bleeding.
- He's maxed out on dopa.

283
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,810
- His pressure still sucks.
- Of course. Why?

284
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,977
- Spinal shock. DUBENKO:
Yep. No sympathetic tone.

285
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,645
- What do you want to do?
- Epi drip.

286
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,256
Get the BP up, increase
the cerebral oxygen delivery.

287
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,017
Right. Ready for
the cruel twist?

288
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,557
Systolic's 58. Come on, guys.

289
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,663
- Epi drip, one mic per kilo per minute.
- Didn't I just say that?

290
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,608
Ischemic brain needs
oxygen, but oxygen

291
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,665
also forms free
radicals after brain injury.

292
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,770
Mother Nature is such a bitch.
- V-tach.

293
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,164
- No pulse.
- Paddles to Lockhart.

294
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,510
Charge to 360. Clear.

295
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,271
Free radicals cause
secondary-cell death. You following?

296
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,675
Clear.

297
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,840
Can we take a break
from chemistry class?

298
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,851
Difference between a physician and a
witch doctor is appreciation of science.

299
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,183
These trauma algorithms should
be automatic for you by now.

300
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,953
- Oh, God.
- Barnett, take over compressions.

301
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,256
Look at his face.

302
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,364
His brain is gravely injured.

303
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,036
The brain is starting to
compromise his heart.

304
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,432
I didn't see it happen.

305
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,265
I told him not
to rent that thing.

306
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,806
I'm sorry, his body
is shutting down.

307
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,208
- Going again.
- You know, I was running this.

308
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,644
Really? I hadn't noticed. Clear.

309
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,476
Procainamide.

310
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,675
What?

311
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,615
Fine. It's all yours.

312
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,385
Clear.

313
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,892
So, wait, why did you
decide to come back, then?

314
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,332
- It's not like anything has changed.
- I don't know.

315
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,029
Neela, knee
sprain won't leave...

316
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,573
until she gets a prescription for
some memory pill she saw on TV.

317
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,075
- Positive tox on the kindergarten teacher.
- Thanks.

318
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,646
Get knee lady out of here
and meet me in Curtain 2.

319
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:58,410
- What do you want me to tell her?
- She can ask her primary doc.

320
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,813
Pratt, fix this order.

321
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,081
Teach your interns the difference
between micrograms and milligrams.

322
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,418
I can't be with them every minute.
- Excuse me.

323
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,062
If I've made a mistake on an order,
I'd appreciate it if you'd confront me.

324
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,821
I'd like to be
treated the same...

325
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:15,128
- and subjected to the same scrutiny.
- Neela, we weren't talking about you.

326
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,898
Oh.

327
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,667
Pupils fixed and dilated.

328
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,001
No gag, no corneals.

329
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,573
- Here. Sit down.
- Thank you.

330
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,545
So, what now?

331
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,878
- We wait.
- At least he's in sinus.

332
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,454
That means that the brain is no
longer capable of telling the body to die.

333
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,888
- Kovac needs some help.
- I got it.

334
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,222
Elena Flemming, 32,
poly-pharmacy overdose.

335
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,027
Paramedics
couldn't get the line.

336
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,897
Let me give it a try.
Elena, what did you take?

337
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,869
- The stuff that was in my cabinet.
- What was in your cabinet?

338
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,401
Usual stuff. I don't remember.

339
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,978
Urbanus, catch the paramedics, see
if they got any meds from the home.

340
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:04,315
- What's your plan?
- CBC, lytes, serum and urine tox...

341
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,078
Tylenol and salicylate
levels, activated charcoal...

342
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,950
- and KUB to check for iron fragments.
- Good.

343
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,990
And call, uh, Psych
and Social Services.

344
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,661
Elena, were you
trying to kill yourself?

345
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,194
I don't know.

346
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,666
- Looks pretty rough in there.
- Guy is brain-dead.

347
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,570
- They have kids?
- Three.

348
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,211
- Coming?
- No, they're too young.

349
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,580
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's part of the job.

350
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,149
Bruised guy's
CBC is finally back.

351
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,354
It's full of blasts.

352
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,650
You ever told anyone
they had leukemia before?

353
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,024
Part of the job.

354
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,522
ICU can't find a bed
for our jet ski trauma.

355
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,998
- They're not expecting to find one.
- He's gonna be with us for a while.

356
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,002
Why don't you call Social
Services for the wife.

357
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,035
What are you guys
still doing here?

358
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,039
Can't send them out until the
chart's signed by an Attending.

359
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,347
Okay, a 7-year-old was sent
by the city with a lead level of 59.

360
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,041
Asymptomatic, dispo'd
to lead clinic for chelation.

361
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,545
- Did you get a repeat level?
- Figured they'd get it there.

362
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,255
- Uh, come on.
- Tell me...

363
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,487
- Is that cool?
- No, Ray, that's not cool.

364
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,298
You've been a
doctor for a month.

365
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,400
You know you can't sign off
before you run it past an Attending.

366
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,833
So why don't you get a repeat
level and then I'll sign the chart.

367
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,548
- Where are you going?
- I... I need to go to church.

368
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,741
You're too sick to go
anywhere right now.

369
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,012
I need to talk to you about
the results of your blood test.

370
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,519
Juan?

371
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,593
I got one in my eye now. Look.

372
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,589
Your platelet count is very low.
That's why you're bleeding so easily.

373
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,296
Juan, your blood smear showed
some abnormal white cells.

374
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,869
The abnormal cells are crowding out
the healthy ones in your bone marrow.

375
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,674
Juan, please listen.
We can help you.

376
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,952
You can't... You can't
help me. Okay, nobody can.

377
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,954
Yesterday I hit a man with
my car. It was an accident.

378
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,354
But today I wake up like this.

379
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,563
Your blood pressure's still a
bit low. You need to be in bed.

380
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,065
I want to review your smear
and check on more labs.

381
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,363
And then I'll be back to go
over everything with you, okay?

382
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,347
Why didn't you tell
him he has leukemia?

383
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,812
Overdose only had antacids and a
bottle of Benadryl in the medicine cabinet.

384
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,221
She'll sleep off the
antihistamine and be good.

385
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,054
What the hell is going on here?

386
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:05,392
I've been here for four hours
and there's nothing wrong with me.

387
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,827
Sir, we honestly don't know.

388
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,298
You could have TB even
though you don't feel sick.

389
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,437
We are going to
recommend treatment.

390
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,336
You want me to take medicine for a
disease you don't even know I've got?

391
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,739
People tolerate the
medicine. There are risks.

392
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,674
You people are really something.

393
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,815
- Mr. Decoyte...
- I want a better doctor!

394
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,450
Whoa. I'm Dr. Pratt.
Can I help you?

395
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,781
I've been here all day
for a stupid skin test.

396
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,355
And no one here seems
to know if I've got TB or not.

397
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,619
The safest thing for us to do is
to treat it as if you do have TB.

398
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,286
If I were in your position,
I would do the same thing.

399
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:42,100
- Fine. Then get me out of here.
- Please, have a seat in the waiting area.

400
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,170
We'll get your discharge
paperwork and your prescription.

401
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:50,273
A good doctor knows how to make
"I don't know" sound reassuring.

402
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,619
Lymphoblastic leukemia has a
remission rate of over 80 percent.

403
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,187
- How did he take it?
- I should know the treatment...

404
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,347
before I tell him. Can
you page Oncology?

405
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,119
Okay, halftime score.
Ray fourteen, Neela seven.

406
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,957
The nurses were tied up in
traumas. It slowed things down.

407
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,895
So you're gonna blame the
nurses while you're on your ass?

408
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,059
Ray's using the same nurses and
discharged twice as many patients.

409
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,467
- My man.
- No more than 10 minutes in the room.

410
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,734
At seven, you start saying goodbye. You
better start wrapping things up in five.

411
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,538
There's a jammed
finger in Sutures.

412
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,181
- Go check it out.
- Ray, how is it that you get lice...

413
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,580
and I get new-onset leukemia
and a referral from Kazakhstan?

414
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,080
Wow. You got some cool cases.

415
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:38,088
Our boy in 4. I think it
could be intussusception.

416
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,419
You get jammed finger,
I get intussusception.

417
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:44,257
Are you accusing me of
cherry-picking charts, Neela? That hurts.

418
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,058
Evans Syndrome with varicella,
unexplained vision loss...

419
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,601
idiopathic proteinuria, LOC
NOS, cystic fibrosis with SBO.

420
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,204
Oh. And drug-seeking heroin
addict with a butt abscess...

421
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,274
who threw an emesis basin at
my head. Yeah, she was a winner.

422
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,704
Fine. I'm just slow then.

423
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:02,247
You're not slow. You're
just differently abled.

424
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,781
Ha. Don't let Pratt get
to you. Abby's slower.

425
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,782
Not that he'd ever
call her out on it.

426
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,285
But Attendings love
her, nurses protect her.

427
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,980
- Must be nice to be the teacher's pet.
- Screw you, Ray.

428
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,488
Oh, hi. Uh, good,
you're all here.

429
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,188
We didn't finish talking
about my research...

430
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,492
with free radicals and
superoxide dismutase.

431
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,561
It's good stuff. Hold up, hold up.
Come on, you might learn something.

432
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:29,564
Step into my office.
Right over here.

433
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:36,973
Free radicals are the link to so many
disease processes in the human body.

434
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,984
- Ischemia, cancer, aging.
- I think that's permanent marker.

435
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,816
They form after tissue
is deprived of oxygen.

436
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,247
Why are they bad?

437
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,884
Lockhart, we went
over this in the trauma.

438
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,084
We did?

439
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,561
Okay, what happens
when the radical...

440
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,532
encounters mitochondria
of a healthy cell? Lockhart?

441
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,334
Why don't you let me
do some research...

442
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,532
- and I'll present to you?
- I just told you the answer.

443
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,745
Okay, let's try this.
Draw an oxygen atom.

444
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,816
I'm not trying to trick you. This is
easy. Just draw an oxygen atom.

445
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,755
Look, you guys...

446
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,325
everything that
we do in the ER...

447
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:28,465
every intervention
ultimately operates...

448
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,865
at a molecular level.

449
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:35,773
I don't understand how any
of you expects to manipulate...

450
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:40,072
the complicated machinery of the
body if you don't understand the basics.

451
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,809
Okay.

452
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,219
There. I've done
the hard part for you.

453
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,321
That's an oxygen atom.

454
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,795
Now, all you have to
do is add the electrons.

455
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,236
I have patients to see.

456
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,006
You couldn't tell, really.
You didn't even seem upset.

457
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,547
I know how to draw
a damn oxygen atom.

458
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,844
That guy just gives
me the creeps.

459
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,847
Okay, that's truly disgusting.

460
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,421
Look, don't knock it. It's
fast, high in protein and free.

461
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:30,791
Sutures is à la casa,
Exam 4 splint and home...

462
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,023
and fever is just
waiting on a chest film.

463
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,600
Okay. That would be 17,
Neela 12. That brings you to 21.

464
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,432
- It's only 4:00.
- When I hit 25, can I go home early?

465
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:43,770
- Dr. Lockhart, what have you got?
- Diverticulitis versus biliary colic in 2.

466
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:48,209
In 4, MI versus reflux, and in
3, sepsis versus viral syndrome.

467
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,441
In Admit, Abby versus Ray.
Neela, you're getting your ass kicked.

468
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,779
Start making decisions
and move those patients.

469
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,945
Ray's logged 21 discharges
with three hours left.

470
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,057
- I guess 25 was too easy.
- Yeah, right.

471
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,625
- I better up the target to 30.
- Thirty?

472
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,626
Double your speed,
you might make it.

473
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,732
Pratt, your lacrosse player's
sedated. Come do his lid lac.

474
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,095
What? It wasn't
like it was my idea.

475
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,727
Dr. Barnett? Wendall
Meade, Social Services.

476
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,670
- Uh, yes. I paged you like four times.
- Yeah, in like 15 minutes.

477
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,173
If I don't answer you right
away, there's a reason.

478
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:22,439
Okay. I need you to talk to
Trauma 1's wife. He's brain-dead.

479
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:27,780
- Interesting name, "Trauma 1."
- Ben Coleman. Wife's name is Stacy.

480
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,316
- He's an intern.
- Ah. I see.

481
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:35,154
So referring to a patient by name
instead of room is a second-year skill.

482
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,491
- Did you go through the care pathway?
- The what?

483
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,962
The checklist that
systematically covers...

484
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,329
all postmortem issues
with the patient's family.

485
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:47,132
You need a list to check off
questions you'd ask anyway?

486
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,135
I'll see her when you're done.

487
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,506
- Contact dermatitis versus candida.
- Call it dermatitis.

488
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:01,313
Topical steroids and send her
home. It resolves, we were right.

489
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,115
- If it doesn't?
- She'll come back.

490
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,517
The overdose is waking up.

491
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,784
And here's the UA on
your tarantula dealer.

492
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,956
Ah, UTI versus kidney
failure. If I'm right,

493
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,726
she takes antibiotics
and gets better.

494
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,024
If I'm wrong, she becomes
hyperkalemic and dies.

495
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,167
I'm trying to
embrace uncertainty.

496
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,630
Oh.

497
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,166
- How am I doing?
- Not so good.

498
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:30,211
You know, you haven't had
anything to eat or drink all shift.

499
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,330
Go to Oncology and get a
copy of the chemo protocols.

500
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,729
- Isn't that Oncology's job?
- They said it might be a couple of hours.

501
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:52,429
I wanna be prepared to cover all the
bases for when we go back in there.

502
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,072
Uh, I'm on an ER rotation.

503
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,902
Shouldn't I be cracking chests
instead of making copies?

504
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,408
I got a 15-year-old
skateboarder versus firetruck.

505
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,912
The ladder clipped his leg.
Looks like an angulated tib-fib.

506
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,709
Leave him. We'll
find him a hallway.

507
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,003
- I've got it.
- I'll get it.

508
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,383
- My med student is driving me mad.
- Wanna trade?

509
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,217
- Were we that annoying?
- I wasn't.

510
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,416
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Does your arm hurt?

511
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,754
You got hit by a firetruck
and just broke a leg?

512
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,260
Lucky guy.

513
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,625
Hey, hello in there. We're your
doctors. We'll try to keep this brief.

514
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,735
My sister is coming.

515
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,739
How am I gonna tell our kids?

516
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:41,444
Well, the social worker will be here to
see you. She can help you with all that.

517
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,785
Would you like to speak with
clergy? Any denomination?

518
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,617
Okay.

519
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,261
I'm sorry to bring this up so soon, but
we only have a limited amount of time...

520
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,404
- to make this decision.
- Is it okay if I don't tell them yet?

521
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,805
Have you thought about
donating your husband's organs?

522
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:05,775
- I think it's okay.
- Okay.

523
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,676
Let them have one last night
before their lives change forever.

524
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,463
- Well, you're looking better.
- Ha-ha-ha.

525
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:28,260
Just don't make me drink
any more of that mud.

526
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,665
Well, the good news is your
tox screen came back negative...

527
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:35,137
and your EKG was normal. So from
a medical standpoint, you're clear.

528
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,007
Good. Can I get out of here?

529
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:44,180
- I wasn't trying to commit suicide.
- What were you trying to do?

530
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,777
Abby? Is the baby
in 3 a real ALTE...

531
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,354
- or just a choking episode?
- I don't know. I haven't presented him.

532
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,684
The parents are refusing
blood draws and x-rays.

533
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,987
Okay, I'll go find
them when I'm done.

534
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,829
I need Psychiatry to see you
before I can send you home.

535
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,695
I'm not crazy, just stupid.

536
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,031
Abby, is IV contrast
contraindicated...

537
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,682
in someone with wheat
and peanut allergies?

538
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,368
- I don't think so.
- Can you find out?

539
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,840
- CT's calling for your MVA.
- Okay, um...

540
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,536
Hold them off
and I'll look into it.

541
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:19,917
Um, I'm gonna page Psych for
you and get you an ETA, okay?

542
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,489
The condom broke.

543
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,723
- Abby.
- What?

544
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,861
Your abdominal pain is gonna
leave AMA if he's not sent up soon.

545
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,155
I tried to admit as
acalculous cholecystitis...

546
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,356
but they think it's a
retrocecal appendix.

547
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,057
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

548
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,169
- I'm waiting for Surgery to see him.
- Keep it moving.

549
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,772
- Three an hour now.
- Thank you for your concern.

550
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,402
So the condom broke?

551
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,449
I'm a temp at a
commodities firm...

552
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,251
and I slept with one
of the traders last night.

553
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,283
He left a note on my bed:

554
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,857
- "I got HIV. See a doctor."
- Oh.

555
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,054
Five years of needles and
I managed to stay negative.

556
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,425
I cleaned myself up,
turned everything around...

557
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,262
and because of one stupid
night, now I'm gonna get AIDS?

558
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:15,271
I can't get sick. I have a kid.

559
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,946
Just because you've been exposed
doesn't mean you're infected.

560
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:38,459
The incidence of transmission from
one exposure is actually relatively low.

561
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,497
You know, it might be better if I
told him he has leukemia alone.

562
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,307
I wouldn't wanna
cramp your style.

563
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,812
- Seen Juan Enriquez anywhere?
- That leukemia guy?

564
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,816
- He was out here a while ago.
- He's gone.

565
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,319
- He'll be back.
- There's a patient in his bed.

566
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,150
Nobody would
have discharged him.

567
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,155
- Damn it. He's gone.
- Doughnut?

568
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,956
- Who?
- My leukemia patient. I'm such an idiot.

569
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,190
I hadn't even told him,
but I think he knew.

570
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,426
You're not making a
lot of sense right now.

571
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,467
He thinks he's being
punished by God.

572
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,697
I should have realized
he was a flight risk.

573
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,841
No, there's nothing
you could have done.

574
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,103
I could have told him it was
treatable. He has a shot at remission.

575
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,838
There isn't enough time to
help the people who want help.

576
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,040
Don't beat yourself up
over people who don't.

577
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,981
He was distraught, and I left him
alone so I could go and do research.

578
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,681
- Dude, where did you go?
- Jane's gonna hang with us, okay?

579
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,523
You seem stressed out.

580
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:44,861
It's about time for the nurses'
nighttime feeding. Better go.

581
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,064
Beastie Boys.

582
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,860
He's out.

583
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,673
Have you ever
heard of prescribing...

584
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:59,710
prophylactic triple cocktail
after a known HIV exposure?

585
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:03,713
Sure. The hospital gives it to health
workers all the time for needle sticks.

586
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,680
I'm not talking about
a health worker.

587
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:09,310
One of my patients had unprotected
sex with an HIV-positive guy last night.

588
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,253
Uh, it's really only available
for occupational exposures.

589
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,858
Too expensive.

590
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,860
Okay, on my count pull the
distal segment out and down...

591
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,188
while I give counter traction.

592
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,400
One, two, three.

593
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,897
Only health-care workers
are worthy of HIV prophylaxis?

594
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,668
We can't give preventive
meds to every one-night stand...

595
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,176
when we still can't afford to treat
people who are actually infected.

596
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,748
I'm talking about one patient who's
here now and she's asking for my help.

597
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:41,546
And what about the patient who
walks in tomorrow and the next day?

598
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,850
Put him in a long leg splint and
stay with him until he wakes up.

599
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,056
The guy's been here for eight
hours and hadn't been told?

600
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,425
What were you waiting for?

601
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,568
Oncology couldn't get here. I
was figuring out what to tell him.

602
00:33:56,735 --> 00:34:00,433
- He wasn't gonna hear anything.
- It was important I get my facts straight.

603
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:04,269
- Why didn't you call a social worker?
- I thought it was better for him...

604
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,537
No, it's not about him, it's about
you and your need to be perfect.

605
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,238
Stop being a slow A-plus
and start becoming a fast B...

606
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,815
or you're not gonna make it.

607
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,476
Now, find him before he
bleeds out and he dies.

608
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,991
Yes. I'm looking for funding for HIV
medication for an uninsured ER patient.

609
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,321
If anyone ever actually
checks this machine...

610
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,987
please call
Dr. Lockhart in the ER.

611
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,291
What?

612
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,627
I look at you and Ray,
you're so confident in...

613
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,236
It's your first day. Give
yourself at least a week...

614
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,966
- to be better than the rest of us.
- I don't even know why I'm here.

615
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,810
Listen. Every shift
at about this time...

616
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,412
I start fantasizing about
working in a tollbooth.

617
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,106
Neela, what's going on
with that football player in 3?

618
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,741
Uh, knee pain times two days. No
drawer sign, no AP or lateral laxity.

619
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,821
- Point tenderness?
- When he's bearing down weight.

620
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:56,023
- Rest, ice and Ace wrap, right?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

621
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:03,124
No, you can't! No, no, no!
There's nothing wrong with him...

622
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,872
- Looking good today, Dori. Doughnut?
- I am not helping with the disimpaction.

623
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,159
Doughnut? SEVERA: Babinka?

624
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,641
Don't act immune to my charms just
because you brought your own sweets.

625
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,645
- He does that every day?
- Twice. Start of each nursing shift.

626
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,305
- It actually works?
- Apparently.

627
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,782
- Abby, you're lagging.
- Well, I have more patients on the board.

628
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,978
Which is meaningless
if you can't dispo them.

629
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,020
You're taking up
room, jamming the flow.

630
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,126
Yesterday, I got a hot MI
to the lab in 15 minutes...

631
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,161
reduced a perilunate
dislocation and a case of malaria.

632
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,662
Today, I'm in some
kind of bizarre vortex.

633
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,028
Okay, okay. Cough
times two days. In and out.

634
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:40,366
Doubt it. Probably turn into myocarditis
versus tracheoesophageal fistula.

635
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,201
All of my patients need three
consults and a huge workup...

636
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,742
and even then, there's
no definitive diagnosis.

637
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,139
I guess you're gonna have...

638
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,804
No, I'm not gonna pretend
things are cut and dry!

639
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,713
I just want one patient today that
has a clear problem that I can help.

640
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,749
- Okay.
- Okay.

641
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,391
Sam, how come Brandon
still hasn't gone to the scanner?

642
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:08,055
- Because CT's been backed up for hours.
- Charlie's the CT tech from 3 to 11.

643
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:11,601
He loves bear claws. The rest of the
doughnuts go to the nurses' station.

644
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,740
- Should I make sure someone sees me?
- Yeah.

645
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,735
You don't find all this wheeling
and dealing a bit slimy?

646
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,242
Yeah, but you gotta play
games to get stuff done.

647
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,381
Excuse me. Let's
review the standings.

648
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,381
Ray, still in the lead with 25.
- Got 26.

649
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,749
Ah. Abby at 19, Neela
brings up the rear with 16.

650
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,220
File this under Neela.

651
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,019
- And why would you do that?
- Because you'll owe me.

652
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,857
Hey, there's a patient with an ER
wristband who's upstairs in the chapel.

653
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,592
- Been up there a couple of hours.
- Where are you going? You're only at 16.

654
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,136
- Uh, Employee Health.
<i>- Can I help you?</i>

655
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:50,037
This is Abby Lockhart in the
ER. I've been stuck by a needle.

656
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,738
Let's roll. Curtain 2 needs a thumb spica
and we need to take off a toenail in 4.

657
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,281
- Dr. Barnett, did you fill this out?
- What?

658
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,614
This is the postmortem checklist
for the jet-ski guy in Trauma 1.

659
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:02,810
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

660
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:07,117
Did you actually talk to Stacy Coleman,
or did you just fill this out to save time?

661
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,419
What?

662
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,497
Well, you checked off that she wanted
to have her husband's organs donated.

663
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,792
She said she never
consented to that.

664
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,128
No, no, no. I asked
her all the questions.

665
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,461
While the transplant surgeon
was prepping to harvest...

666
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,164
she thought her husband
was getting better, so...

667
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,901
Okay. Can we talk about
this someplace else, please?

668
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,644
UNOS has been on the phone with a
kid who thought she was getting a heart.

669
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,978
Are you worried
about getting yelled at?

670
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:37,088
- The lady said she was fine with it.
- No, Ray, she did not!

671
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,089
- Did you make sure she was...?
- I asked her all the questions.

672
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,022
Did you take time
to explain it to her?

673
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,163
- How am I supposed to...?
- Nobody said this job was easy.

674
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:49,632
When you take shortcuts and
you drop details, people get hurt.

675
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,301
We'll send this in for
hep B, hep C and HIV.

676
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,106
You can call
tomorrow for results.

677
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,517
And never stick your hand
in a full sharps container.

678
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,819
Stupid.

679
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,553
AZT and 3TC in a combined pill.

680
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:17,560
The other is your protease
inhibitor, BID, on an empty stomach.

681
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,992
Two quarts of water a day.

682
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:22,328
And we'll see you in two
weeks to check your LFTs.

683
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,966
Juan.

684
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,472
We've been looking for you.

685
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,813
Have you been down
here the whole time?

686
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,354
Juan, you have leukemia.

687
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:48,016
Leukemia is very treatable and you
have an excellent chance of a cure.

688
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,727
I know...

689
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,707
it feels like something bigger
than you is making this happen...

690
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,376
but something also led you here.

691
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,540
We will help you
get through this.

692
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,578
There's a reason why you
came to this hospital today.

693
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,122
- Hey.
- Hi.

694
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,928
I heard you got a needle
stick. Are you okay?

695
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,230
Oh, yeah. Yeah, fine.

696
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,532
- You wanna go home early?
- No.

697
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,541
I'm fine, really. Excuse me.

698
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,644
- Hey, Wendall?
- Yeah?

699
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,908
- Did you get to see my overdose?
- Uh, yeah. I left a note in the chart.

700
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,212
I'm comfortable discharging
with outpatient follow-up.

701
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,617
- Great.
- Listen, I heard about your needle stick.

702
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,120
- Are you all right?
- I am.

703
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,725
- Page me if you wanna talk.
- I will.

704
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,623
You're back.

705
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,488
Can I do anything?

706
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,222
- Do you feel okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

707
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,800
A little woozy from all the
blood they took, though.

708
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,163
- I'll get you water.
- Great.

709
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,396
How about an iced tea
from across the street?

710
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,837
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thanks.

711
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,742
Hey, Sam, did the radial
fracture get Ancef yet?

712
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,815
Uh... Yeah. Just a minute. I gotta
give this message to Mrs. Coleman.

713
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,450
I'll do it.

714
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,621
Mrs. Coleman.

715
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,994
They took him to the morgue.

716
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,491
Your sister called.

717
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,503
She took your kids to
your house for the night.

718
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,513
Hey, I guess we had some kind
of misunderstanding back there...

719
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,012
and I'm not even
sure what it was about.

720
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,686
If there's anything
I can do, uh...

721
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,051
Can I call you a
cab or something?

722
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,462
I'm sorry for your loss.

723
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,011
- Just the man I was looking for.
- Do you know how often I hear that?

724
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,840
- Are you okay in there?
- Yeah, it's...

725
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,573
It was just a little mix-up.
What do you got there?

726
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,774
Um...

727
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,711
I need a favor.

728
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,557
I'm into favors.

729
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,056
These are for my
patient in Exam 3...

730
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,424
but as you can see, they
have my name on them.

731
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,362
- HIV meds.
- Yeah.

732
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,739
Do you have any friends in the
pharmacy that could doctor those labels?

733
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,435
Yeah. I think
I'm falling in love.

734
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,851
- How was your first day?
- Hard.

735
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,686
- You gonna come back tomorrow?
- Yep.

736
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,351
Juan Enriquez's priest
called. Still no word from him?

737
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,692
He's on the Oncology Ward starting
chemo. I found him in the chapel.

738
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,697
Oh. Great.

739
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,463
- Hey, thanks for your help today.
- Sure.

740
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,129
- You off?
- Yeah.

741
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,936
Yeah, me too. If you
wait for a second...

742
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,773
- I'll walk out with you.
- Okay.

743
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,814
I, uh, think I hear
rounds starting.

744
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,612
Make sure you drink at least
two quarts of water a day...

745
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:38,279
and see your doctor in two weeks
and get your liver function tested.

746
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,584
I don't know what to say.

747
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,953
- Thank you.
- Sure.

748
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,721
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Okay. Bye-bye.

749
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,989
Bye.

750
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,333
- You have dinner plans tonight?
- No.

751
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,628
Maybe that was too subtle.

752
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:55,103
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

753
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,300
- It wasn't too subtle, Urbanus. I got it.
- Answer still no?

754
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,501
Yeah.

755
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,478
Okay.

756
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:04,905
Good morning.

757
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,419
You buy your t-shirt like
that or you rip it yourself?

758
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,613
- Hey, I met my discharge quota today.
- So did I.

759
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:15,021
Uh, not quite, Dr. Barnett.
Twenty-nine, you're one short, buddy.

760
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,594
- After work cocktail?
- That's totally gross.

761
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,322
- Good. Let's go get a real drink then.
- Mm, not a chance.

762
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,490
- I'm exhausted.
- Come on, guys.

763
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,659
Lewis is handing out
the paychecks today.

764
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,362
How can he still have
energy after a day like this?

765
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:31,168
Work is easy when you have the entire
staff literally eating out of your hand.

766
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,278
I don't know how he can finish
his work at the end of his shift.

767
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,880
- I still have an hour's worth of charting.
- Two hours.

768
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,142
Hello, Abby, Neela. Survive?

769
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:42,048
Okay, let's round so the
day crew can get out of here.

770
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,681
In 2, we have DZ with V and HA.

771
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,554
- Finishing a liter, PO challenge and home.
- All right.

772
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,525
Who can tell me what the
criteria is for scanning headaches?

773
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:54,860
- Worst case...
- Thunderclap onset.
