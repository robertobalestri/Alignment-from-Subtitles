1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,106
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,768
- How's your dad doing?
- Okay. Got a nurse for him 16 hours a day.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,777
Then from 11 to 7 it's just me.

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,525
What happened there,
doctor? That was your patient.

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,451
No, it's a trauma. No medical
record number yet. Thanks.

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,130
Don't say thank you to the blood
bank and don't let the boys bully you.

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,933
- I... I wasn't letting the boys...
- You play with your hair when nervous.

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,858
Wanna get some dinner?

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,660
Thanks, I have plans
already. Not with anyone...

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,441
- if that's what you're wondering.
- Not a problem.

11
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,764
- You abandoned that kid.
- My shift was over.

12
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,960
- He was counting on you.
- I had a gig.

13
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,571
Screw your gig,
medicine isn't a day job!

14
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,642
Jing-Mei.

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,414
Jing-Mei.

16
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,096
- Come when I call you.
- Why do you do this?

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,716
Please.

18
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,852
Papa, I can't.

19
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,034
Jing-Mei.

20
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,380
Okay. Okay.

21
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,873
I promise.

22
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,912
Why's your brother here?
Your parents live in Winnetka.

23
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,887
Ben's in the Peace Corps and
they bug him to get a real job.

24
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,185
That sounds familiar.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,091
- If I get this sofa bed...
- They're checking the stock.

26
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,924
All right, thanks.

27
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,058
- You the youngest?
- Oldest. Ben and my little sister, Tess.

28
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,227
She's a junior partner
in my dad's firm.

29
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,339
- I wonder who the favorite is.
- Hmm.

30
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,499
- You have siblings?
- My brother died when I was 11.

31
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,271
- I'm sorry.
- We have the sofa bed in stock...

32
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,914
but only in moss
green, not black.

33
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,279
- Green's fine. Can you deliver it today?
- On Christmas Eve?

34
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,509
Mm.

35
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,054
- Could tie it to the roof of the car.
- You think?

36
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,193
Pfft. That's why you brought
me along, isn't it? A little brawn?

37
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,254
- We'll take it. I'll go pay.
- I'll go find some rope.

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,127
- Meet you at the checkout.
- All right, thanks.

39
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,000
Can you say
anything? Can you talk?

40
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,542
Okay, you're choking. So I'm
gonna do this really hard, okay?

41
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,916
Mom!

42
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,651
Oh, no. It's okay. I was actually helping
her. She was choking on a piece of...

43
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,256
He grabbed my daughter.

44
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,617
I'm a doc... I think we
should get out of here.

45
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,059
- What happened?
- I saved that little girl's life.

46
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,562
- What's he saying?
- Uh, "thanks"?

47
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,876
We did it when I was a kid.

48
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,683
No way. Gifts get opened
on Christmas morning.

49
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,191
- Tell Dr. Lewis we'll be back for more.
- Where are you taking them?

50
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,228
Washington Library on State Street.
- The library?

51
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,264
They keep opening up public
buildings until everybody's in.

52
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,059
If Alex opens a gift tonight...

53
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,397
It's cheating to open
a gift the night before.

54
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,698
Then he won't be so
desperate to get up...

55
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,401
which means he'll sleep in,
which means we get to sleep in.

56
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,068
- Oh, okay.
- Plus, it's just fun.

57
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,341
Is that a trick so you
can open your gift tonight?

58
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,076
Robert Sanders, 42.
Syncopal episode at home.

59
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,711
- Hit his head on a chair on the way.
- Mr. Sanders, I'm Dr. Kovac.

60
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,087
190/100, 110 and
30. Glucose, 125.

61
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,285
- I can't get a sat.
- It's too cold to read.

62
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,395
- Do you guys need some help?
- So it seems.

63
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,725
Increased work breathing,
crackles bilaterally.

64
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,232
- Wife's behind us.
- Gonna be below 10 degrees soon.

65
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,425
Merry Christmas.

66
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,901
Excuse us. Keep
this pathway clear.

67
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,733
- Get a history? ZADRO:
Read it and weep.

68
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,273
- Okay.
- Okay, out of the way.

69
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,307
Okay, out of the
way. Now. Come on.

70
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,910
Systemic lupus, erythematosis.

71
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,742
- Diagnosed 20 years ago.
- Dialysis-dependent, renal failure.

72
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,545
- Dialyzed yesterday, two hours.
- Coronary artery disease.

73
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,448
Yeah, come on. Okay, let's go.

74
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,920
- Hypertension, hepatitis C.
- And a partridge in a pear tree.

75
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,218
- Sorry, I'm a handful.
- Morris. Stop eating.

76
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,386
- We got a hundred people waiting.
- Lewis already loaded me up.

77
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,259
Pratt, is your CVA
out of Trauma 1?

78
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,455
ICU just called for him.

79
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,101
- Sats correlating at 89.
- Okay, crank up the O2.

80
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,602
- Abby, I have six charts for you.
- I haven't even taken my coat off yet.

81
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,835
Oh, Carter, stay on with DHS. You have
to pound them to pick up the homeless.

82
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,673
- Right. Squeaky wheel.
- Yeah. It'll calm down soon enough.

83
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,030
They're not in by
midnight, they'll freeze.

84
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:50,477
Susan, you around tomorrow?

85
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,087
Well, I'm on at 3 but we'll be
hanging out till then. Bring Henry by.

86
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:58,453
Oh, I will. I got something for Cosmo. I
want you to see Henry in his Santa suit.

87
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,026
- You got a headache?
- No, I got a backache.

88
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,595
I was helping move a
couch. Who is on with me?

89
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:09,202
- Chen, but she's running a little late.
- Becoming a habit. Merry Christmas.

90
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,861
Oh, my God. Did you just
re-gift right in front of me?

91
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,372
Yep. I'm your
secret Santa. Enjoy.

92
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,774
Established rheumatology
patient seen by Doctor Scheer.

93
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,884
Spear, not Scheer. I'm the
wife, Carol Shoup-Sanders.

94
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,782
- It's Jared Spear.
- Sorry. That's Spear. Dr. Spear.

95
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,684
Can you touch your
chin to your chest?

96
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,188
I have his medical history here.

97
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,327
He's tachypneic,
pulse ox is borderline.

98
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,962
- We can order records.
- You'll prefer mine. Concise.

99
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,361
- Honey, let them work. KOVAC:
Tilt your head all the way back.

100
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,831
You need my help.
They just don't know it yet.

101
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,870
- No. He needs to be admitted.
- Okay, let's sit him up.

102
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,007
Gonna make you more
comfortable, Mr. Sanders.

103
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,197
Robert.

104
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,685
Okay, how long
was he unconscious?

105
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,644
Forty-seven seconds.

106
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,847
- What happened before that?
- I stood up from the dinner table.

107
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,042
- He felt short of breath, dizzy.
- Chest pain?

108
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,312
- No.
- Rheum's not coming in.

109
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,217
- Dr. Spear?
- He was unavailable.

110
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,485
The primary complaint sounded cardiac.
We'll give him nitrates, call Cardiology.

111
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,689
We have a great cardiologist,
Dr. Knauth. K-N-A-U-T-H.

112
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,564
Well, shouldn't somebody
be writing this down?

113
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,866
Another shelter van's here.
Let's go. I'll take the first 20 people.

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,771
Male, 62, lives under a bridge,
says he's having chest pain.

115
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,378
Register him. Check a
12-lead, pulse ox, chest film.

116
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,879
Diagnosis: hunger, cold.
Aftercare: food, warmth.

117
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,746
Hey, Jake Scanlon, fourth
year, transferred from Creighton.

118
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,377
Hey, Jake. This guy knows
if he says chest pain...

119
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,048
he'll be here 16 hours and get a
tray of food. So let me do you a favor.

120
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,889
Listen up, everyone. The vans are
here to take you all to the Holiday Inn.

121
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,895
- Ray.
- That is right. Thank the mayor.

122
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:49,025
There'll be plenty of food. Remember,
it's all good at the Holiday Inn.

123
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,899
- Liar.
- It works. Only the sick ones are staying.

124
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,531
Don't give him any credit.
Very good. Trick the needy.

125
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,237
It's a holiday. And it's someplace
like an inn. All right, get in the van.

126
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,745
- Ready? Gotta get Alex in 20 minutes.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,077
Abby, is that our
Cardiology on Mr. Sanders?

128
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,742
I'm on hold. But go. I'll
present to Carter or Chen.

129
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,582
- Thanks, Abby.
- You sure?

130
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,052
You've been on since 7 this morning.
Somebody should have Christmas.

131
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,423
- Yeah, Alex is pretty excited.
- Alex or you?

132
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,623
- Go ahead. We're fine. We're fine.
- Thanks.

133
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,431
- Hi. I'm calling about Robert Sanders.
- Abby, is Kovac still here?

134
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,471
Admit. Yeah. Cardiomegaly
and pulmonary edema.

135
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,972
- Luka.
- Hey, I have a lupus patient for you...

136
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,577
- in Trauma 1. Sanders.
- No, no. I can't stay.

137
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,305
I'm just here to pick
up meds for my dad.

138
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:38,577
Uh, look, I know it's a lot to
ask, but can you cover my shift?

139
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,920
- It's Christmas Eve.
- I know. I'll do New Year's.

140
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,718
Ready, Freddy?

141
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,986
I'm sorry. I can't
cover for you.

142
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,928
It's a family emergency.
I wouldn't ask otherwise.

143
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,467
Are you serious?
For tonight? Come on.

144
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,763
It's my first Christmas
with Sam and Alex.

145
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,170
I can't help you
this time. I'm sorry.

146
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,143
Dr. Chen, this is Margaret. She'll
be temp-clerking this evening.

147
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,840
- Hi.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

148
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,715
- Not a big fan of the Yuletide.
- Is Lewis still here?

149
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,448
Headed towards the exit,
as am I. Merry Christmas.

150
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:21,356
- Yeah. Merry Christmas.
- What does that mean, exactly?

151
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,460
What? "Merry Christmas"?

152
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,156
You could at least examine
him before you blow me off...

153
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,837
Okay, BNP, fine. Happy
holidays to you too.

154
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,805
Never get sick on Christmas.
Hey, did you call Psych?

155
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,002
- Yes. I suggested they bring kibble.
- Okay. And you can go home.

156
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,911
- Students don't have to work holidays.
- I volunteered.

157
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:47,714
That's twisted. Next year, I'm inventing
a family so I won't work on Christmas.

158
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,415
- What did Dr. Knauth say?
- Cardiology thinks it's a kidney problem.

159
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,654
- How's the breathing, Mr. Sanders?
- Hanging in there.

160
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,699
- Dr. MacPherson's our kidney guy.
- Right. He's on call tonight.

161
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,559
Thought I told you to go home.

162
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,934
BP, 195/105. Heart rate,
115. Resps, 30. Sats, 93.

163
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,373
CBC, troponin, chem-7,
and Card suggested BNP.

164
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,945
- What the hell is that?
- B-type natriuretic peptide.

165
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,845
I will double check that
dosage. Get started on the rest.

166
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,383
Get me a suture kit for the head lac.
- You got it.

167
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,044
- What did you say your name was?
- Jake.

168
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,186
Jing-Mei, I am sorry
about your dad. I really am.

169
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,125
- But I keep cutting you breaks.
- I know, and I appreciate it.

170
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,923
- This'll be the last time.
- Oh, man.

171
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,364
There is no way I can get anyone
to cover tonight. It's impossible.

172
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,903
- Susan, please.
- I hate to be hard-core, but I can't.

173
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,564
Look, can you stay?

174
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,405
I have a baby. And a guy
who's been watching him 24/7.

175
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,071
And I just worked a
14-hour shift. No, I can't.

176
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,912
Well, maybe Carter can handle
it. He's got Abby and Morris.

177
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,452
We're inundated with
homeless from the city roundup.

178
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,090
- I know.
- We're already understaffed.

179
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,284
Jing-Mei, please. You
have to understand.

180
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:05,122
- I do. It's okay.
- Good. Thank you.

181
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,927
I'm sorry, Susan. I quit.

182
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:23,407
And so the holiday begins.
Happy, happy, joy, joy, everyone.

183
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,953
Nine-year-old, auto vs. ped.
Transient, LOC, hit-and-run.

184
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,562
- Mom? MRS. PRICE:
Right here, honey.

185
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,388
- Confused and agitated.
- What's his name?

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,222
- Harry.
- Hey, Harry. I'm Dr. Carter.

187
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,331
- We'll take good care of you.
- I'll get Neela. My shift's over.

188
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,555
She's busy.

189
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,564
- I got a plane to catch.
- I'm not asking!

190
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,229
One, two, three.
Okay. Large-bore IV...

191
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,100
500 of saline, open.
What happened?

192
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,900
- Car hit him.
- Came out of nowhere.

193
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,976
- Weak femoral. Was he thrown?
- Diffused ecchymosis on the chest.

194
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,773
- He was outside.
- I parked the car. He was getting out.

195
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,109
- Harry flew up in the air.
- Mattie.

196
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,341
Systolic's 77.

197
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,280
You guys are okay?
You're not hurt?

198
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,854
- We're okay. They checked us.
- Tenderness, crepitus over the chest wall.

199
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,355
- What's that mean? CARTER:
He has multiple rib fractures.

200
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,424
- Mom, it hurts.
- Baby, I'm here.

201
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,826
Okay, CBC, type and cross
for forehead, chest and belly...

202
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,432
CT, trauma panel,
and a femoral line.

203
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,092
- Pulse is up to 138.
- Okay, rush the blood bank.

204
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,671
He could be anxious or bleeding out.
- Bleeding out?

205
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,001
- It's okay, Mattie. RAY:
We'll take care of him.

206
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:26,112
- Why don't we take Mattie for a walk?
- I wanna stay here. Can I stay here?

207
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,977
I'll set her up in the Family
Room. Come on, Mattie. Let's go.

208
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,688
Dr. MacPherson, this is
Lockhart again in the ER.

209
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,345
I'm calling about
Robert Sanders.

210
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,617
I know his wife can be a pain in
the ass but tonight he has a real...

211
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:45,055
Problem. And he needs
dialysis. And call me back.

212
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:50,693
Abby, take this thyromegaly and be well.
As you can see, I have a party to attend.

213
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,964
- Where are you going?
- Not that you'd know...

214
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,200
but it's the Players Ball at
The Peninsula. Kanye West...

215
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,905
- Twista, the whole Roc-A-Fella... Hello.
- Hi, I'm looking for a doctor.

216
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,083
Well, that would be
me. How can I help you?

217
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,550
- I'm looking for Dr. Morris.
- Morris. No, see, what you need is...

218
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,487
- somebody with more experience in...
- Hey, hey. Hi. Glad you could make it.

219
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,650
Come on. I'll show you around.

220
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,263
- Bye.
- Bye. She's with Morris.

221
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,400
- Chen just quit. Where's Carter?
- Quit what?

222
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,865
- The hospital. Where's Carter?
- Trauma 2, I think.

223
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,403
- Quit for good?
- Is she all right?

224
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,405
She's burnt out. We're
screwed. I can't believe it.

225
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,065
Chen.

226
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,107
- Your secret Santa gift.
- From you?

227
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,942
No. It was in the lounge with
your name. What's with Chen?

228
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,745
- I don't know. She's not answering.
<i>- "Rats, Lice, and History"?</i>

229
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,085
Ooh. That's a good one. Someone
really likes you. I got a Pez dispenser.

230
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,920
- See y'all later. NEELA:
Happy Christmas.

231
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,790
Hey, I got a 39-year-old
IV-DU, narcotic withdrawal.

232
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,692
- I'm dying.
- This guy needs detox.

233
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,460
- Get him 2.1 of clonidine.
- Hey, what are you doing?

234
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,605
This is a publicly-funded hospital,
and this is an illegal religious artifact.

235
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,707
- Well, it's Christmas.
- So?

236
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,103
So...

237
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,545
put it back.

238
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:10,741
- Sharps back. Pericardiocentesis needle.
- Systolic's 82 on one liter.

239
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:11,976
Carter, Chen just quit.

240
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,586
Harry, you're gonna
feel a little pressure.

241
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,086
- She quit? RAY:
Heart rate's trending up.

242
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,226
Yeah. That's the tamponade
limiting contractions.

243
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,795
- Gotta up the rate to compensate.
- What's that mean?

244
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,228
There's blood around
his heart. We'll relieve it.

245
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,630
- PVCs.
- Yeah, I'm in but not getting anything.

246
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,066
- Lift up his head a bit.
- Chuny, close to trauma...

247
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,469
- and refuse any more homeless.
- Good idea. Did you smell Triage?

248
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,632
How can people stink
so much in cold weather?

249
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,506
Oil of wintergreen on a mask
or breathe through your mouth.

250
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,611
You're not staying?

251
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,899
There's blood in there. But it's

252
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,846
either clotted or it's
collecting posteriorly.

253
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,990
- Can't get it with a needle. Page CT surg.
- Oh, I'll get Neela.

254
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,229
If I leave now, I can
still make my plane.

255
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:54,491
Forget about your plane.

256
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,528
- I promised my mother.
- Your mother?

257
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:02,166
- Look, somebody's gotta stay.
- I'll page Surgery.

258
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,028
Ask for an echo-guided
pericardial window.

259
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,940
- Hey, Carter, do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

260
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,474
Titrate the dopamine
to a systolic of 90.

261
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,841
Keep paging CT surg.
All right, Harry's stable.

262
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,479
And Dr. Barnett is here.

263
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,341
Apparently.

264
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,449
My lupus patient. Pulmonary
edema's worse and his pressure sucks.

265
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,853
- Can you take a look?
- Sure.

266
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,392
- Thanks.
- So Chen quit? What was it? Her dad?

267
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,121
Yeah. I'll go home, have
dinner with Chuck and Cosmo...

268
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,697
sing some carols, come back.

269
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,664
- Chuck's been cooking, my dad's there.
- All right, go home.

270
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,826
If we're busy, I'll
call. Otherwise, stay.

271
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,636
Thank you. You're
amazing. Thank you.

272
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,037
Come be amazing over here.
- I'll check in later.

273
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,235
- Did you call his primaries?
- Rheum says he's too sick for them...

274
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,007
call Cardiology. Card says call
Renal. Renal says he just had dialysis...

275
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,548
it's not their problem.

276
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,981
- BP is dropping, 88/59.
- Stop that BNP drip, lower his head.

277
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,885
Yeah, I tried that. He desats.

278
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:02,495
- Hard to breathe. Carol? JAKE:
She's gonna come right back.

279
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,325
Abby, you gave
nitropaste and BNP drip?

280
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,831
Give two vasodilators and
his pressure bottoms out.

281
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,697
You try getting hold of three
specialists on Christmas Eve.

282
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,498
You're his doctor.

283
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,741
Now he's got crackles in the apices.
Is Renal coming to take off the fluid?

284
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,175
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

285
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,908
He was dialyzed yesterday, so Renal
thinks there's another explanation.

286
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,679
- What do you think it is?
- He got half his usual dialysis time...

287
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,723
because of the holidays, ate
salty food, flooded his lungs.

288
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:35,123
- So...
- I'm waiting to hear from MacPherson...

289
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,887
the Renal Attending.

290
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,430
- Dr. Agbo from Surgery's here.
- Agbo? I've never heard of him.

291
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,628
- Junior fella, sweaty palms.
- See? Nobody wants to be here tonight.

292
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,897
- Including me.
- Okay. Why don't you call...

293
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,598
Dr. Mac-What's-His-Name again.

294
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,541
Remember, nobody knows what your
patient needs now better than you do.

295
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,715
- Sats only 88.
- Uh, put him on a nonrebreather.

296
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,477
That should help. I'll
be right back, okay?

297
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,880
These are Robert's
medical records.

298
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,226
- Listen. Um, about today on the phone...
- Pain in the ass that I am...

299
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,625
I got them from Records myself.
Otherwise, you'd have them tomorrow.

300
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,358
Now will you look at my file?

301
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,982
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

302
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,511
Heard a crazy story about
you quitting. Can I come in?

303
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,122
You know, thanks, Greg, but
I'm fine. Thanks for coming by.

304
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,804
Hey, you need some help?

305
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,501
Yeah, get me
some Ativan, please.

306
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,269
- How much?
- Two milligrams.

307
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,674
- What happened at work today?
- Sometimes he's cooperative and lucid.

308
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,843
- Sometimes he's like this.
- Sundowning.

309
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,718
Sundowning? That's
too nice a word for it.

310
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,867
- Give me my pants, please.
- You know, you got a lot of Ativan here.

311
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,031
Potassium too.

312
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,200
Jing-Mei, what are you doing?

313
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,207
Talk to me. What's going on?

314
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,576
I'll relieve the blood
accumulating around the heart.

315
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,587
- Is that the pericardium?
- 10 blade and pickups to me.

316
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,487
Watch over my boy.
Keep him safe in your arms.

317
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,993
McAlpin catheter,
60-cc syringe. Quickly.

318
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,927
- Whoa, a hundred cc's right there.
- Keep him safe, I beg you.

319
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,568
- Another 60-cc syringe, quickly.
- Hey, man.

320
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,295
- Dr. Agbo? MRS.
- God be with you.

321
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,999
- Maybe I nicked the vessel.
- Give me some sterile eights.

322
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,384
- Jesus, I call on you.
- PVCs. Bigeminy.

323
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,741
Pull that catheter back.
- I can get it.

324
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,750
It's my fault. Sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Shut up, Mattie!

325
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,340
- Hey!
- Mrs. Price, take your daughter outside.

326
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,452
- No. I wanna stay with my son.
- I said pull that catheter back.

327
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,953
- The blood will just reaccumulate.
- Get out of the way. Out of the way.

328
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:20,855
- V-tach. Crash cart.
- Catheter is out.

329
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,758
- Charged to 100. Clear.
- Just wait. Just wait.

330
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,760
Normal sinus.

331
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,558
All right. 3-0 and
a needle driver.

332
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,761
That's good. Right? That's good?

333
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,599
- Dr. Carter?
- Take this girl to the Family Room...

334
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,808
page Social Services, and
stay with her until they get here.

335
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,239
No.

336
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,516
Feeling better?

337
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,752
A little.

338
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,830
Don't lie. He's not
better. Look at him.

339
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,001
BP's stabilized, 119/85.
Pulse down to 115.

340
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,228
He's had lupus cerebritis?

341
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,066
Two years ago. It calmed
down after a steroid burst.

342
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,732
Okay. I'd like to get a head scan to
make sure the cerebritis isn't back...

343
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,572
and there's no
internal bleeding.

344
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,700
I have a discharge
and then I'll take you.

345
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:15,724
I could take him.

346
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,620
- Do you know where it is?
- Mm-hm. Can his wife come with us?

347
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,016
- Sure.
- Thanks.

348
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,751
Put him on a portable monitor and O2,
and call me if you have any questions.

349
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,150
Okay?

350
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,193
Mm-hm. ABBY: Okay.

351
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,266
Would you like to color?

352
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,937
Are you excited about
Santa coming tonight?

353
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,703
- Why not?
- Santa's not coming for me.

354
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,070
Mattie, that's not true.

355
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,652
- Hey.
- I thought you had a plane to catch.

356
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,959
Hey, Mattie. How you doing?

357
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,329
You know, when I was a kid, I used
to fight with my brother all the time.

358
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,222
Did he get hurt?

359
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:13,672
Yeah, he got hurt. I got hurt. Kids
get hurt sometimes, by accident.

360
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,331
I was mad at him for
not playing with me.

361
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:20,640
So I threw his book out. And
he went to get it, and got hit.

362
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,334
Mattie, it's not your
fault Harry got hurt.

363
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,749
It is. I tried to help
him but I couldn't.

364
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,912
- I had to go get my mom.
- Your mom wasn't there?

365
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,617
She was at work.

366
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,426
- You and Harry were alone in the car?
- We live in the car.

367
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,729
Don't tell my mom. I'm
not supposed to say that.

368
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,772
My father's a doctor. He
knows what he's asking.

369
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,435
Without the G-tube and IV,
he would've died weeks ago.

370
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,547
Oh, so now lifesaving
technology is bad?

371
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:58,613
- If someone doesn't want it.
- How do you know he doesn't?

372
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:02,448
- He's not even in his right mind.
- After he sleeps, he's lucid.

373
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,955
Each time, every day,
he begs me to help him.

374
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,253
Removing the
support's not enough.

375
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:13,760
It would take him days to die of
dehydration and he'd be in misery.

376
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,029
- Put him in a nursing home.
- So he can be somebody else's problem?

377
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,265
- Who doesn't know or love him?
- He won't even know that he's there.

378
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,378
You're not Chinese.

379
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,213
Oh. So it's Chinese to
euthanize your elders.

380
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,243
It's Chinese to respect them.

381
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,161
Here you go.

382
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,168
You should go.

383
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,170
I don't want you here.

384
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,833
You've been through a hell of a
lot this last year. You need a break.

385
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,175
Put him in a home for a month
so you can catch your breath.

386
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,009
I can't.

387
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,178
We fight to save
lives every day.

388
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,515
You know, we literally bust our asses
to give people a few more hours of living.

389
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,854
You're a doctor, you can't just
cross that line like it's nothing.

390
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:19,025
Quality of life is the only
measure that matters.

391
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,861
My proud father is
lying in his own feces.

392
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,868
He can't eat without
vomiting, can't sleep.

393
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,267
He knows what he's asking for and
he knows he can get that from me.

394
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,673
If you weren't a physician,
you couldn't do this.

395
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,610
But I am and I can.

396
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,578
Why haven't you
done it up till now?

397
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,884
If he's been asking so much?

398
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,950
Because you know,
deep down inside...

399
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,890
it would haunt you
for the rest of your life.

400
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,329
Why haven't you done it yet?

401
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,392
Maybe I don't have the courage.

402
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,563
It's over. Christ is born.

403
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,209
It's only midnight? Feels
like 4 in the morning.

404
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,868
Margaret, if you turn off
these lights one more time...

405
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,778
- I'll beat you to death with a fruitcake.
- This is totally loser's Christmas.

406
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,419
Give that back, you little minx.

407
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,814
Okay.

408
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,583
Rudolfo, can you blow like you're
blowing out candles on a birthday cake?

409
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,420
- Too many cold.
- Does it hurt to breathe in?

410
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,620
Lockhart, your lupus
patient's coding in the scanner.

411
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,766
All right. Neela,
chest film and O2.

412
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,629
Got it. RAY: Hey.

413
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,237
Hey. It was cool what
you did with that little girl.

414
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,101
- Telling her about your brother.
- Yeah. I think it helped.

415
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,573
Although I don't actually
have any siblings.

416
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,109
Why does that not surprise me?

417
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,440
Social Work's got Mattie,
Carter says I can go.

418
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,945
Can I sign out Harry to you?

419
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,607
- I thought you missed your flight.
- I'll go standby.

420
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,185
Don't want to disappoint
Mom on Christmas.

421
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,981
- Do something.
- BP's 83/50.

422
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,886
- Cycle the dynamap.
- What happened?

423
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,309
Central line got
caught and it pulled out.

424
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,353
Bleeding won't stop.

425
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,464
- Not with lupus-associated coagulopathy.
- Heart rate's dropping.

426
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,594
Okay, 8-0 and a mac tube now.

427
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,998
Ma'am, please step back.
Let us help your husband.

428
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,968
Put pressure right here.
Don't check it. Don't let go.

429
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,041
- Sats, 68.
- Yeah, he's hypoxic. I get it, thanks.

430
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,543
- Oh, God. Please don't let it be tonight.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,477
- Tube.
- Pulse, 64.

432
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,013
I'm not ready for him to die.
- I'm in.

433
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,055
- Sats coming up.
- Run, don't walk, to the blood bank.

434
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,193
Four units of O-neg.
Work on type-specific.

435
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,521
- I'll meet you in the Trauma Room.
- He's stable?

436
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,187
He needs blood. We're
gonna start a central line.

437
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,232
- Can an Attending do it?
- I put in lines all the time.

438
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,994
He's been through enough.
I want a surgical Attending.

439
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,471
He's moving in
the right direction.

440
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,544
He's gonna spend the night in
here until an ICU bed opens up.

441
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,238
You were at work
when this happened?

442
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,212
We've been living in the car since
I left my husband three weeks ago.

443
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,351
It wasn't bad when the
kids were in school...

444
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,358
but since Christmas
vacation started...

445
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,261
You left them in the car?

446
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,993
I gotta work.

447
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,689
It's okay, Mama.

448
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,032
Can their dad help?

449
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,671
He's a violent guy.

450
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:20,502
I could take it, but he was
starting in on Harry. So I...

451
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,879
Yeah. We're a little concerned about the
amount of strain that you've been under.

452
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,351
I didn't want Mattie
saying how it was...

453
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,991
because I don't want
anyone taking my kids.

454
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,559
We're not homeless people.

455
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,192
I got a job. This
is just temporary.

456
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,391
I can help you find a place to
stay until you get on your feet.

457
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:45,265
We tried the shelter.
It isn't safe for the kids.

458
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,803
No, this isn't a shelter.

459
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,531
It's a house for families
fleeing domestic violence.

460
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,743
It's safe.

461
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,506
Thank you.

462
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:03,085
I'm sorry that I
yelled at you, honey.

463
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,516
Don't be scared of me, okay?

464
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,050
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Oh, no.

465
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,389
You didn't do anything wrong.

466
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,758
Come here.

467
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,737
So, what do you think?

468
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,141
I think the bad guy's the driver,
not the mother. Lady needs a break.

469
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,747
Cafeteria's serving up a
feast. Better get up there.

470
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,110
Hey, Morris.

471
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,341
Ew.

472
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,851
Burgers probably
would've been safer.

473
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:39,114
Speaking of, I'm hungry.
Wanna get something to eat?

474
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,123
- Just lost my appetite.
- Dr. Carter.

475
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,421
Phone call from Africa.
It's Kem somebody.

476
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,791
Catch you later.

477
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,660
Hello? KEM: <i>John.</i>

478
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,859
- Hi.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

479
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:53,570
Uh, I'm not doing
anything. I'm just working.

480
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,337
No. It's too cold to snow
here. Maybe tomorrow.

481
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,781
Shh. It's okay.

482
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,785
It's okay.

483
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,724
No, no. It's okay.

484
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,990
Calm down. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

485
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,966
- Bring more Ativan!
- I add five of Haldol when he's like this.

486
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,503
Okay, calm down.

487
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,374
- What is he saying?
- To let him go.

488
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,348
Shh. Shh.

489
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:44,988
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,523
I'm sorry, Papa.

491
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,923
Okay, now squeeze. Hold on.

492
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,498
No, no. Both hands. Both
hands. Let go of my hand.

493
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,602
- Let go... RAPHAELLA:
Hee-hee-hee!

494
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,170
- Squeeze the trigger.
- My hands are shaking.

495
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,499
Hey!

496
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,199
- Hi.
- Hi.

497
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,674
Um, Neela, Raphaella Greenberg.

498
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,545
Are you a medical student?

499
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,214
I'm his girlfriend.

500
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,385
- HIPAA? Patient privacy?
- Stapling, it's nothing.

501
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,853
- This guy's totally out of it.
- This is so wrong.

502
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,356
Well, I'll staple. You watch.

503
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,423
Security! Security!

504
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,058
Somebody get Security!

505
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,427
Give me a reason!

506
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,091
- Give me a reason!
- Stop it!

507
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,465
- Whose patient is this?
- Mine. Mr. Beidermeier.

508
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,573
- I need help!
- Get Security to cuff him to a bed, huh?

509
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,108
Get him on monitor until
we figure out what he took.

510
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,405
- Should've let him OD!
- Come on. Up, up.

511
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,241
- That's the Christmas spirit.
- Yeah.

512
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,110
Back to bed, Mr. Beidermeier.

513
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,081
At least have him arrested.

514
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,810
- What's your name again?
- Margaret.

515
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,648
Margaret, we're good here.

516
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,951
Crap.

517
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,424
Got a flash. Guide wire.

518
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,586
Didn't you come because
the wife wants you?

519
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:01,666
Not her call. I like to make a
small nick with an 11 blade.

520
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,428
She's afraid Abby
might kill her husband.

521
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,469
I don't think she will.

522
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,440
Okay. Catheter.

523
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:12,977
Tachy at 110. BP,
94/79. Sats, 86.

524
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,637
That's as good as he's
gonna get until he's dialyzed.

525
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,249
His lungs are swimming in fluid.

526
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,685
Nice. Threading easily. Good.

527
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,150
Thank you for coming in.

528
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,653
It's my job.

529
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,452
You want to admit him to your service?
All those other docs are blowing me off.

530
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,992
Santa Claus is coming to town.

531
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,123
Okay, removing the
introducer, 10-cc syringe.

532
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,927
Legally and morally they have to come
when you call or lose staff privileges.

533
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,764
- Don't think they heard about my power.
- They're aware.

534
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,269
They take advantage...

535
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,601
- of submissive interns.
- I'm not submissive.

536
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:43,969
- Nice return.
- I know.

537
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,946
Like many interns and,
well, many females...

538
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:51,311
you incline yourself toward
popularity and equate it with success.

539
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,317
Well, when an ER doc is
popular, someone's losing out.

540
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,977
And it's usually the patient.

541
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,490
- All this guy has is you.
- Infusing well. Needle driver.

542
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,523
All right. Well, good job.
Really good job, Abby.

543
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,561
I'll finish up.

544
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,699
Yeah, go. Go out there
and do what you have to do.

545
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,802
By the by, did you,
um, get the book?

546
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,469
<i>Rats, Lice, and History?</i>

547
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,839
You're my secret Santa?

548
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,174
Yeah, I'm quite excited
to discuss it with you.

549
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,681
The chapter on the influence
of vermin epidemics...

550
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:30,016
on political and military history, and
the relative unimportance of generals...

551
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,520
is outrageous.

552
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,917
Oh, 4-0 silk.

553
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:44,869
- Submissive.
- Not a word I would use to describe you.

554
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:48,336
Okay. Time to get unpopular.

555
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:53,002
Look, I take full responsibility
for what happened with Sanders.

556
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:56,342
You didn't do it, the tech did. I
shouldn't have sent a student to CT.

557
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,711
I want you to send me, okay?

558
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,512
It won't happen again.

559
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,080
So, what did you
learn from all this?

560
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:06,222
Always go home when you tell me.

561
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,093
Hi. Is this the dialysis tech?
- <i>It's kind of late.</i>

562
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,130
Yeah, I know. It's 2 a.m.
I'm sorry to wake you.

563
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,748
What did he say?

564
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,287
He thanked me.

565
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,789
Said I was a good daughter.

566
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,320
You are.

567
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,770
You want me to do it?

568
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,207
Lab called on Vivadi Sanito.

569
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,074
- The coags were QNS.
- Okay.

570
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,774
And Betty Muldoon was
admitted to Medicine.

571
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,084
Can I get a cab voucher? Huh?

572
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,253
I don't think we're quite ready
to discharge you, Mr. Claus.

573
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,554
Dialysis for patient Sanders.

574
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,095
- Do you want me to...?
- No, no. I got it. Thank you.

575
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,754
Hi. Thanks for coming in.

576
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:37,300
Double overtime on holidays. But I
just did Robert Sanders yesterday.

577
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,768
Yeah. He's... His
fluid overloaded.

578
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,533
- MacPherson call in orders?
- I spoke to him on the phone.

579
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,734
- What did he want?
- The usual, standard run.

580
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,880
2K bath, 35 bicarb,
pull off a couple liters.

581
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,209
- Two or four hours?
- I'm not sure about that.

582
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,249
- I'll give him a call.
- Well, actually...

583
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:56,650
Dr. MacPherson very specifically
said he did not wanna be disturbed.

584
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,153
He wouldn't come in.

585
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,320
- He wouldn't come in.
- Ha-ha.

586
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,587
What a prick. But I need orders.

587
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:09,063
Okay. Okay, well, do you think you
could get started and then call him?

588
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:10,963
- Sure.
- Thank you.

589
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,798
- All right.
- Thank you.

590
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,496
You're welcome.

591
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,804
- MacPherson ordered dialysis?
- Uh...

592
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,277
No. I did.

593
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,238
You? You can't order...

594
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:29,416
Thank you.

595
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,218
Merry Christmas.

596
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,157
- Hm. MARQUEZ:
Tetanus is up to date.

597
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:40,992
I was putting a sled together and I
sliced myself on the metal runners.

598
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,458
It doesn't look too
bad to me, Mr. Rotolo.

599
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,628
Santa's gotta get home,
doc. Know what I mean?

600
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,298
Me and Mrs. Claus have things to
take care of before the kids wake up.

601
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,444
- Won't take long. You feel that?
- Yeah.

602
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,374
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

603
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,879
Excuse me, Dr. Carter.
When you have a minute?

604
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,017
Sure. Um...

605
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:02,120
Irrigate, open up a
suture kit. I'll be right back.

606
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,186
I have something for you.

607
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,126
- But I haven't wrapped it, it's at home...
- Liar. But my birthday's in two weeks.

608
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,893
- "Mildred"?
- Oh, sorry. Mildred didn't show.

609
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,195
I was giving out
a bunch of these.

610
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,962
Just a little something.

611
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,538
So how was your phone call?

612
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,068
It's good. She's good.

613
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,037
Oh, yeah. Very handy.

614
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:33,174
- For hooking up the VCR.
- Right. Yeah.

615
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:37,182
Oh. Yeah. You look like
an old-fashioned doctor.

616
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,889
I am an old-fashioned doctor.

617
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,761
- Okay.
- Okay.

618
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,867
Okay. Merry Christmas.

619
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,063
Merry Christmas.

620
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,005
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

621
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,073
- We got sliders.
- Yes!

622
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,904
You will never be more loved
than you are at this moment.

623
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,376
Oh, I could eat about
three dozen of these.

624
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,741
- Hi.
- Hi.

625
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,678
So is this the little
homeless boy?

626
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,408
Should we treat as inpatient?

627
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,416
- Is he hypoxic?
- No.

628
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,384
- Tolerating POs?
- Yeah.

629
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,252
Then he only
needs PO antibiotics.

630
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,559
- And a warm bed.
- I'll call the Pedes team.

631
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,830
Hi, Rudolfo.

632
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,927
Hello, doctors.

633
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,569
- Hi.
- You got a chimney?

634
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,598
I'm sorry, honey. What?

635
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,273
How's Santa Claus gonna find
me if you don't got a chimney?

636
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,476
We don't need a chimney. Santa
sees everything. He'll find you.

637
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,615
But you'll have to go to sleep
before he comes, all right?

638
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,106
Good night.

639
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,410
Do you think Dad has
a present for his son?

640
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,954
Doubt Dad's got
enough for their breakfast.

641
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,115
Santa Claus better
come up with something.

642
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,727
- Jumbo Mart?
- Do you have any cash on you?

643
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,385
No.

644
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,457
Jing-Mei...

645
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,670
it's been over an hour.

646
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,069
You okay?

647
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,576
I'll call the mortuary
in the morning.

648
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,846
What are you
gonna do after that?

649
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:22,917
Well, I have to go to China and
bury my father next to my mom.

650
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,929
Deal with his
estate. Bum around.

651
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:31,995
Visit the village where they were
born. Meet some relatives. I don't know.

652
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,598
I'm pretty tired.

653
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,472
Well, you know...

654
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,875
if there's anything I can
do. I mean it. Anything.

655
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,140
Thank you. Thank you.

656
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,113
Thank you for...

657
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,947
That's okay. Come here.

658
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,530
Where are we going?

659
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,532
Ho, ho, ho, and
a jolly old soul.

660
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,702
- Sikhs don't have Christmas.
- Grew up in England.

661
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,501
Old King Wenceslas, Boxing Day and a
family tradition of anonymous kindness.

662
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,507
- Where'd you get that key?
- Wendall from Social Work.

663
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,650
- I have a plan.
- A sly and cunning plan?

664
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,650
We give these toys and books
to the homeless kids in the ER.

665
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,549
Ahh.

666
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,188
Stealing from the bad
off to give to the worse off.

667
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,883
We buy new stuff tomorrow
in the after-Christmas sales.

668
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,724
- Belated gift for Child Life Department.
- Do we have ribbons or paper?

669
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,493
We can steal bows from the
decorations in the cafeteria.

670
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,603
- What's up?
- I thought you'd be in Miami by now.

671
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,831
O'Hare's a mess. No
seats until tomorrow.

672
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,498
Miami? I thought your
mother was in Philadelphia.

673
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,337
Hey, it's snowing. Come on.

674
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:29,003
Hey, if it's snowing, that
means it's warming up.

675
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,512
You knew he was in Miami?

676
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,673
He's got a girlfriend
that lives there.

677
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,343
I worked his shift because he gave
me some sob story about his mother.

678
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,048
Barnett, you back already?

679
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,125
I can't stay away.

680
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,989
I love it!

681
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,495
- Does snow get polluted?
MacPHERSON: Where's Lockhart?

682
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,157
Dr. MacPherson?

683
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,792
I didn't authorize dialysis for Sanders.
You started it without my approval.

684
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,650
- I wanna speak to your Attending.
- Uh...

685
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,840
Your patient was drowning.
He needed dialysis.

686
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,172
You're an Attending
on-call. I covered your ass.

687
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,871
You can't just deceive
Attendings when you don't agree.

688
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:07,883
You report me for working the system,
I report you for abandoning your patient.

689
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,377
Go, Abby.

690
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,217
See you inside.

691
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,424
- Oh!
- Miami?

692
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,893
Come on. Let's get back to work.

693
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:22,898
This is Jing-Mei Chen.

694
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:27,198
I woke up this morning and found
my father had passed away in the night.

695
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,667
Yes. He's been very ill.

696
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:36,713
Well, actually, his physician is
here. He can sign the death certificate.

697
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,919
Thank you.

698
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:48,549
It's 2753 West Cedar Drive.
