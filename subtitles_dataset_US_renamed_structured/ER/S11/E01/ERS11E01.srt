00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,718
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,832
- Where did you match?
- The University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,104
Are you withdrawing from
this residency program?

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,942
Your Honor, I love my son.

5
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,277
You'll be notified
of my decision.

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,044
- Alex and I have to leave.
- What?

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,585
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,052
I don't want to go!

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,953
We have to say
goodbye to our son now.

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,828
Can't get in touch with
Mom. Phone ain't working.

11
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,022
What? You need a ride?

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,668
Hey, jack-off! Pay
attention to the road!

13
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,475
What's your problem,
man? Get out of here.

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,902
Pay attention to this.

15
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,700
- Oh, nice.
- All right, we're out of here.

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,773
- See you, suckers!
- Feel that Hemi power, baby.

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,478
It's a beautiful thing.

18
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,744
Slow down.

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,483
There. Everybody happy now?

20
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,321
Greg.

21
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,721
Son of a bitch.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,660
He's shooting at us. - Get down.

23
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,323
- Come on. Hold on.
- We gotta get out of here.

24
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:12,738
Hold on!

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,135
Where is he? Let's go, hold on.

26
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,971
We gotta get away from him!

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,745
- Get away from him!
- There he is. Watch out!

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,856
Damn it.

29
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,132
Get away from him! Ah!

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,501
Oh, my leg!

31
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,209
- You hit?
- Yes. I'm shot.

32
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,003
Where is he?

33
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,523
Oh, God.

34
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,296
Greg. Greg, I
think I broke a rib.

35
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,731
Somebody help me, please.

36
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,868
All right, man. I'll be right
there, man. Don't worry.

37
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,345
- Where are we?
- We're in the river.

38
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,247
- Can you get out of that seat belt?
- Uh-uh, no. It hurts. I can't move.

39
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,088
Come on. We got to get out.

40
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,121
Elgin, come on, man.
We got to get out.

41
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,792
I can't feel my legs.

42
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,798
Here, take my hand. Come
on, take it. I'll pull you out.

43
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,492
I can't.

44
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,968
Come on, man. Squeeze
my hand. Squeeze it.

45
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,367
I really can't.

46
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,266
Greg, I can't get this belt off.

47
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,537
Kid might have
cervical-cord injury.

48
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,646
Okay.

49
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,283
I'm gonna call for...
Oh! Oh, my leg!

50
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,683
<i>911.</i>

51
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,289
Hello? Yes, please, help us.

52
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:14,895
We're in a car that crashed into
the Chicago River near Franklin.

53
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,690
<i>- All right, ma'am.</i>
- It's wet. I'm getting wet.

54
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,668
- Hey.
<i>- Hello?</i>

55
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,303
Yeah, there's three of us
in here. Critically injured.

56
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,803
<i>- All right.</i>
- Please hurry. We're sinking.

57
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,899
Underwater.

58
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,670
I don't want to die, man.

59
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,508
All right. I'm coming, man.

60
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,630
It's getting deeper.

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,138
I'll be right there,
Elgin. Don't worry.

62
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,874
Okay, come on. Duck under this.

63
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,938
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on, baby.

64
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,313
You have to. Come
on. Come on. Come on.

65
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,753
Yes. Get under there.

66
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,153
- Good job. Good job. Good job.
- Okay. Okay.

67
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,355
- Doc.
- What?

68
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,260
How come I can't move?

69
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,296
Looks like you hurt your
neck. It might be broken.

70
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,296
What's happening?

71
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,373
The engine takes
the front down first.

72
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,570
- Oh, God.
- I'm coming, man.

73
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,742
Oh, God. PRATT: All right.

74
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,685
It's not fair. Every
intern gets a vacation,

75
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,518
and I'm stuck with
the last overnight.

76
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,212
Maybe it's because you
called in sick, like, 50 times.

77
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,188
I have Epstein-Barr. Not my
fault they haven't found a cure.

78
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,485
- Damn shame.
- Uh-huh.

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,494
That we have to listen
to you whine all night.

80
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,825
- Who's the Attending?
- Schedule says Lewis...

81
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,796
but she's on maternity leave.

82
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,994
Maybe it'll be somebody who'll
let me out early. Kovac or Carter.

83
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,399
Just as long as it is not...

84
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,268
- Morris!
- Bingo.

85
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,807
Fifteen minutes in, you
haven't picked up a patient.

86
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,035
I was doing sign-outs.

87
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,077
From who? Colonel Sanders? Go.

88
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,339
- Where's Carter?
- Finishing up a lac.

89
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,315
Kovac? FRANK: Left
a couple hours ago.

90
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,715
- In the middle of his shift?
- Said he had to go.

91
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,321
Nice suit. Job interview?

92
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,890
- Ready? One, two, three, up.
- Okay, Elgin, try not to move your head.

93
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:03,190
- I'm cold.
- Look, Elgin, we gotta swim out of here.

94
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,923
- I don't think I can.
- I'll stay with you, all right?

95
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,293
Greg...

96
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,902
Jing-Mei, you'll be fine. Look,
when I open up this window...

97
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,506
you push out, and I'll pull
Elgin out behind you, all right?

98
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,742
All right, I got his neck.

99
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,910
All right, everybody hold their
breath, okay? Deep breath.

100
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,786
- Ah, damn it.
- What's wrong?

101
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,855
Power windows.

102
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,500
- I need to pee.
- We'll be at the motel soon.

103
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,867
Hey, you're gonna like Louisville.
They have the Kentucky Derby...

104
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,668
the Ohio River, hushpuppies.

105
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,168
Can I go in the bushes?

106
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,246
Here we go.

107
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,716
Have you ever been?

108
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,481
- What?
- Louisville. Have you ever been there?

109
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,787
Hey, it doesn't look half bad.

110
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,224
Hey, look, they
even have a pool.

111
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,497
- It's stuck.
- We're sinking.

112
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,696
Wait for the water
pressure to equalize.

113
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,671
What? ELGIN: Physics class.

114
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,073
When the water gets high enough,
you'll be able to open the door.

115
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:27,874
You gotta wait, man.

116
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,488
You gotta wait.

117
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,494
- What was that?
- Bottom of the river.

118
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,058
Now what?

119
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,596
Now I guess we wait.

120
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,277
Hello?

121
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,908
Hello?

122
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,744
Hello? MAN: <i>Can you beat that?</i>

123
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,979
<i>Look at this, Mom,
I'm fully dressed.</i>

124
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,284
- Hello?
<i>- I don't understand a word of it.</i>

125
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,855
Hi. Can I get a room, please?

126
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,894
- And just the two of you?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,397
- How many nights?
- Just one. Passing through.

128
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,468
- You folks on vacation?
- No.

129
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,229
You'd better call the
police. She's kidnapping me.

130
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,668
Alex, cut it out.

131
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,443
Kids. WOMAN: <i>I have not.</i>

132
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,443
I want you to get ready to open
the door and push out to the surface.

133
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,981
I'll pull out Elgin after you.

134
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,984
- Greg, I don't think I...
- Just do it. Just do it.

135
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,280
All right, Elgin, listen.

136
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,390
Take a deep breath and blow
it out on the way up, all right?

137
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,426
- Okay.
- All right, go, Jing-Mei. Go, baby, go.

138
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,112
- All right, big man, you ready?
- Yeah.

139
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,079
All right, take a deep
breath. Deep breath.

140
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,582
Hey! Hey! Hey!

141
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,589
Victim on surface!
Victim on surface!

142
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,761
Starboard side! Two o'clock!

143
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,863
Oh, please! Help me!

144
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,033
Grab the ring, ma'am.

145
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,501
Is there anybody else in the car?
- Two more!

146
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,500
Over here! Over here!

147
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,703
We got somebody down
here! Come on. Right here.

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Where's Elgin?

149
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,580
I couldn't get him out.
He got stuck on the door.

150
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,283
I got somebody else down there.
I got to go back down and get him.

151
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,946
Divers will get him, sir.

152
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,682
He's paralyzed. He can't move.

153
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,657
We don't need any more
victims. Get in the boat.

154
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,660
Get in the damn boat!

155
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,102
- Gored by a deer antler, sent to Ortho.
- You call Animal Control?

156
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,205
No, he fell when he
hung it on his mantle.

157
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,807
Woman got her glaucoma drops
mixed up with her Super Glue.

158
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,467
Ouch. Nice of you to
grace us with your presence.

159
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,478
- Family emergency. I'm back now.
- Don't need you now. Go home.

160
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,945
I owe you a couple of hours.

161
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,553
Next time you leave in the middle
of a shift, don't bother coming back.

162
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,210
Frank, call the nurse in Admin.

163
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,618
Tell them Sam won't
be working tomorrow...

164
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,089
or any other day.

165
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,227
Family emergency. He
doesn't even have a family.

166
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,728
- Is that it?
- Uh-huh.

167
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,163
- You have another court date?
- Yep.

168
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,859
- How'd that go?
- Okay.

169
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,526
- She's lying.
- I am not.

170
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,730
- Oof. Good luck, huh?
- She's a drug dealer.

171
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,466
Tiffany James, foreign
body in the vagina.

172
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,736
Tucked her stash up
there when we busted her.

173
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,278
- I can fish it out.
- You'll do no such thing.

174
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,144
- You having any pelvic or abdominal pain?
- I feel fine.

175
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,545
Not a medical emergency.

176
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,583
- So I can leave?
- Sit your ass back down.

177
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,279
Doing a pelvic exam
without consent is assault.

178
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,425
This guy said he would.

179
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,724
Hey, Luka.

180
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,135
Is something going on with Sam?

181
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,701
She left.

182
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,169
- She left? She left to go where?
- I have no idea.

183
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,235
Did she take Alex?

184
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,442
- Is she coming back?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

185
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,750
- You okay?
- Yeah.

186
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,321
Say goodbye to
Kem for me, will you?

187
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,331
Frank, I need an x-ray in 2.

188
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,730
Haven't you heard? New
interns start tomorrow.

189
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,700
It's my last nursing shift.
I'm finally getting out of here.

190
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,100
You ready for it?

191
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,673
Had the doctor up my Xanax.
- Abby.

192
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,503
I thought you were in Michigan.

193
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:54,273
- You get kicked out already?
- County. Meet me on Two-Bravo.

194
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,575
- Got time to grab coffee?
- No. I have to sleep.

195
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,151
- I'm back on at 6. What's going on?
- I may have thrown away my career.

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,379
Doc.

197
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,524
I don't care what your captain
says, we do not do strip searches.

198
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,023
Give me a break. The
jail nurse won't do pelvics.

199
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,525
That's your problem, not mine.

200
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,358
Multi-victim TC. How
many criticals can we take?

201
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,023
- Three. What is it?
- Auto versus pole and pedestrians.

202
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,327
Another car in the river.

203
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,299
- Who's still on?
- You and Morris.

204
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,233
Carter left, and you
sent Kovac home.

205
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,067
- Abby, can you stay?
- No, I...

206
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,301
Good. Somebody go find Morris.

207
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,037
He's probably hiding in the
bathroom again staring at <i>Maxim.</i>

208
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,416
Did they get Elgin out?

209
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,678
I'll be right behind you, okay?

210
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,520
- They need to get a collar on you, doc.
- I'm fine.

211
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,718
- They're not bagging him?
- You need a collar.

212
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,886
- Is he alive?
- I don't know.

213
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,032
<i>Confirming recovery of
a third body. Stand by.</i>

214
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,670
Why aren't they doing CPR?

215
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,204
PB 49, any vitals
on that third victim?

216
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,906
<i>Not at this time.</i>

217
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,111
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,815
- So you just left?
- After I spoke to the director.

219
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,545
Excuse me. Where do we sign in?

220
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,213
He was at a birthday party.
Always has to be the joker.

221
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,825
- What'd you put up there?
- LEDs.

222
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,984
He was supposed to
wear them on his clothes.

223
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,527
Triage nurse, straight ahead.

224
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:19,291
You were only there a
couple hours. Give it more time.

225
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,401
Auto versus utility pole. Decent
vitals, probably dislocated hip.

226
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,808
Give me something for the pain.
- Reduce the hip.

227
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,234
Ten of MS, slow IV push.

228
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,841
Pedestrian with lacs from
jumping out of the way.

229
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,909
- I can take him.
- Lily, put him in 3.

230
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,444
- I can still suture.
- You're no longer a student.

231
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,583
You're not covered to practice
here. You wanna stay, you observe.

232
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,743
Car flew into the river. Probable broken
ribs, tachycardia, GSW to the left leg.

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,354
Jing-Mei. ABBY: Oh, God.

234
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,957
- What happened?
- Road rage. A guy shot at us.

235
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,025
- The abdomen okay?
- Pleuritic chest pain.

236
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,719
- Get me off this damn backboard.
- Pratt was the driver.

237
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,889
You start with Pratt, I'll stay
with Jing-Mei. Show me a C-spine!

238
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,533
This is so stupid. I'm
fine. NEELA: Bad scalp lac.

239
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,397
- And combative.
- I'm not combative.

240
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,165
I'm just pissed off
that you tied me down.

241
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,173
Come on. Get back in there.

242
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,471
Morris, move him to Suture.

243
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,376
- Got it. WEAVER: Let's
go! We need the room.

244
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,141
- Dr. Chen?
- That's the guy.

245
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,308
That's the guy that shot at us.

246
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,814
- I want to sign out AMA.
- You can't. You're a trauma patient...

247
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,548
- with a head injury.
- One, two, three.

248
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,524
First-day labs, C-spine, chest
and pelvis, and a head CT.

249
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,130
- Will you stop it? I don't need all that.
- It's getting harder to breathe.

250
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,290
- Pulse ox is 89.
- Up her to 5 liters.

251
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,936
- How's she doing?
- Probable sternal fracture.

252
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,130
Don't wait. If there's decreased
breath sounds, put in a tube.

253
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,934
Open your mouth. - Aah!

254
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,072
Is the pain on the
left or the right side?

255
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:38,135
Keep your mouth open.

256
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:42,271
- You weren't supposed to do anything.
- No one cares if I kill a resident.

257
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,280
- I'm feeling dizzy.
- BP's 90 palp.

258
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,476
- She could have tamponade!
- Shut up, Pratt!

259
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,986
- Hello? Can I get a doctor?
- What? What is it? What?

260
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,490
Flaccid paralysis of arms and legs.
Divers fished him out of the river.

261
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,956
- Is that Elgin?
- Elgin Gibbs.

262
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,848
- Is he alive?
- He has a pulse.

263
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,057
Elgin was with you?

264
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,502
- Abby, check him out.
- You're a doctor?

265
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,029
Internship starts tomorrow.

266
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,104
I just advanced your
residency start date.

267
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,305
Now you're an intern.

268
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,932
What, you want an engraved
invitation? Go, go, go!

269
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,743
Hey, and keep your eye on
him. Make sure he doesn't get up.

270
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,281
Both toes are up-going.

271
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,510
Solu-Medrol, 30 per kilo bolus.

272
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,679
- Abby, what do we have?
- Cervical-cord injury. Starting steroids.

273
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,257
- Who's the resident on the case?
- That would be me.

274
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,122
Early bird catches the worm.

275
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,731
Fine cuts through the C-spine.
Set up for Gardner-Wells tongs.

276
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,357
Good alignment. No fractures.
You can take him off the board.

277
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,902
- About time. CORDAY:
How are you doing, Greg?

278
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,369
I'm fine. GCS is 15,
abdomen is benign.

279
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,168
How's Elgin,
spinal-cord injury kid.

280
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,742
No blood in the belly. Four
of morphine, sew him up.

281
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,642
- I'll get Morris to do it.
- Morris? No, I'll do it myself.

282
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,249
- PVC's.
- Hundred of lido, open the crash cart.

283
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,681
Could be accumulating
blood in the pericardium.

284
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,651
Need a stat echo. Run a liter
of saline. How did this happen?

285
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,580
Some kind of hit and
run. They caught the guy.

286
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,351
- Any muffled heart sounds?
- Pratt...

287
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,858
Check for pulsus paradoxus.

288
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,827
Back off, or I'll check your
rectal temp with my crutch.

289
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:09,059
Somebody has to call my house.
My dad's nurse. Her name's Marie.

290
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,670
- Both lungs are up.
- I was supposed to take over at 9.

291
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,034
- She needs to stay.
- Mediastinum appears normal.

292
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,506
GSW to the left leg. She
barely has pedal pulses.

293
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,043
- Did I transect the artery?
- Order an angiogram.

294
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,671
- We need to check compartment pressure.
- Okay, she's bradying down.

295
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,849
Amp of atropine.

296
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,644
Dr. Weaver, Abby needs you now.

297
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,789
- For Elgin?
- Prep the entire leg. Open a cutdown tray.

298
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,051
- Some guy named Eduardo, line two.
- What?

299
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,320
Says he's Sandy Lopez's
brother. Sounds upset.

300
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,963
- Wait, wait. Is Henry okay?
- Who?

301
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,222
- My son.
- He didn't say.

302
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,397
Well, go find out.

303
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,557
- We're getting a search warrant.
- Good for you.

304
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,374
How much longer
is it going to be?

305
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,631
He dropped pressure. I
ordered 2 units of O-neg.

306
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,639
Dr. Weaver, I have some questions.
- Kind of busy here.

307
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,271
Henry's fine, but this Eduardo
still wants to talk to you.

308
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,276
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

309
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,473
- I agree.
- You don't work here anymore.

310
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,312
He wants to meet as soon
as possible. Says it's important.

311
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,351
- Take a message.
- BP's only 80.

312
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,114
- What's the HemoCue?
- 11.3.

313
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,817
Okay. Good breath sounds,
spinal shock. Dopamine at 10 mics.

314
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,087
- No chest tube?
- No. Recheck the HemoCue.

315
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,697
- It needs time to equilibrate.
- He's not bleeding.

316
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,594
I'll be with Chen.

317
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,394
I should try and
call his mother.

318
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:22,806
- What size suture are you using?
- 4-0 nylon.

319
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:29,307
Morris, I shave my melon, man.
Go with the 5-0, minimize the scar.

320
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,082
- Compartment pressure's 42.
- I've lost the pulse.

321
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,686
- Kerry, Abby's doing a thoracotomy.
- What?

322
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,089
Who's getting a
thoracotomy? Elgin?

323
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,890
- Aorta's clamped. More suction.
- Are you out of your mind?

324
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,726
- He was coding.
- I told you he didn't need a chest tube.

325
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,335
- He had 3 liters of blood in his chest.
- What?

326
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,023
You want the Cell Saver? - Yes.

327
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,300
Mrs. Gibbs, this is
Neela at the hospital.

328
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,807
Your son Elgin was in a car
accident tonight. It's pretty serious.

329
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,742
When you get this, come to
the emergency room, ask for me.

330
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,610
It was the machine.

331
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,753
Last one. Beautifully averted
and well approximated.

332
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,591
You are a lightweight
when it comes to morphine.

333
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,721
- CT's ready.
- Okay. Greg, time to wake up.

334
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,891
Greg. Greg, come on.

335
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,136
Crap. He's got a blown pupil. Intubation
tray, 20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

336
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,279
- Should I get Weaver?
- Get the head down.

337
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,314
As soon as we tube
him, I want 80 of mannitol.

338
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:40,118
I need suction and an end-tidal
CO2 detector. Here we go.

339
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,151
Charge to 30 again.

340
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,386
Charged. Asystole.

341
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,726
How much O-neg has he had?
- Eight units.

342
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,855
- Ruptured proximal aorta.
- FFP, platelets.

343
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,332
- What about a side-biting clamp?
- There's nothing left to bite.

344
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,503
Are you done?

345
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,303
Hold compressions.

346
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,874
- Pratt's herniating.
- What?

347
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,746
We need to close his
chest. His mother's coming.

348
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,047
I don't want her to
have to see him like this.

349
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,098
Keep head at 30
degrees, M.A.P. in the 90s.

350
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,856
- Hyperventilate?
- A PCO2 at 30.

351
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,093
- Morris.
- Epidural bleed. Mannitol on board.

352
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,668
- He was awake.
- Presentation with a lucid interval.

353
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,136
- Skull fracture.
- Tore his middle meningeal artery.

354
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,504
Abby, call the OR. Tell
them we need an ICP monitor.

355
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,073
Hello? Hey, you ready?

356
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,276
Sorry. I got stuck
with a sick kid.

357
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,579
Called the restaurant.
They'll take us at 9:30.

358
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,882
Let me throw on a
shirt, I'll be ready to go.

359
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,357
Maybe we could just
stay home, watch a movie?

360
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,600
Sure.

361
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,603
How does Thai food sound?

362
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:21,516
The, uh, takeout menus are in
the kitchen top drawer, yeah?

363
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,458
Good news is the pupil
went down with mannitol.

364
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,966
The bad news is Greg needs surgery,
and he might have long-term brain damage.

365
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,265
- So it's wait and see?
- Yeah.

366
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,209
So, what happened in Michigan?

367
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,077
Can we maybe talk
about it tomorrow?

368
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,614
Sure.

369
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,650
You should go home
and get some rest.

370
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,952
- Go on. I can finish this.
- I'll stay.

371
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,618
- You start in a few hours.
- I think I started tonight.

372
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,229
Go, really. I'm okay.

373
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,365
You don't have
privileges here anymore.

374
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:10,435
I don't think I'm gonna be sued for
missing a suture on a dead boy's chest.

375
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,938
Go. I'll wait for his mother.

376
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,039
We'll talk tomorrow?

377
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,133
<i>Hi, this is Sam. Leave a
message after the beep. Bye.</i>

378
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,575
- Has he woken up yet?
- Not as of 6 a.m.

379
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,047
With all the trauma,
the board's a mess.

380
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:41,551
PICU can take the baby
up after change of shift.

381
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,657
Two more messages from that
Eduardo guy. He's persistent.

382
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,816
- Where do you want the fresh meat?
- Interns?

383
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,633
- Right there.
- Hey, Ray Barnett.

384
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,855
- Luka Kovac.
- Hey.

385
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,898
- Are you Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah. Sorry. Been up all night.

386
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,534
- You could've fooled me.
- Howard Ritzke.

387
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,634
Orientation's in second-floor auditorium
at 8 a.m. with the new house staff.

388
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:04,106
And the elevator's that
way, right? Thank you.

389
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,802
- We come back here at what time?
- When you're through.

390
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,107
Here's the labs on the baby.

391
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,443
- Out of here.
- That explains it.

392
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,415
All right, gotta go.
Got an appointment.

393
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,248
Sorry. My alarm didn't go
off. How are Pratt and Chen?

394
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,914
- Surgical ICU. They're both stable.
- Good.

395
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,312
Did the other interns
go upstairs already?

396
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:21,889
They did.

397
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,621
- But you've been excused.
- What?

398
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,028
I have a few pass-ons
for you from last night.

399
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,792
I don't have to
go to orientation?

400
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,199
You have an ID. You know
where the bathrooms are.

401
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,032
All you need's a lab coat.

402
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,867
Welcome to County, Dr. Lockhart.

403
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,846
Excuse me. Are you a doctor?

404
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,811
Yes, I am.

405
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,850
Sara's stool tested
positive for botulism toxin.

406
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,488
- What?
- Will she get better?

407
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,884
It can take a month.

408
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,730
A month on the
breathing machine?

409
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,623
She needs oxygen and tube
feedings until her muscles recover.

410
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,126
How could she get botulism?

411
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,095
- Spores can be present in honey...
- She doesn't get that stuff.

412
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,326
I cook and purée everything
for her myself by hand.

413
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,994
- Honey?
- What?

414
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,107
Damn it, Jeffrey, you
don't give honey to a baby.

415
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:13,336
- How am I supposed to know?
- It was in the book. You never read it?

416
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,872
- Why don't we all just...?
- You gave me four books.

417
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,679
I do the diapers, the bottles,
the cleaning, the shopping.

418
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,320
- Excuse me. Know about a warrant?
- We're not doing it.

419
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,479
It was one book. I
told you which book...

420
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,624
Hey, it's not like I
wanna be doing this.

421
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,671
You know what? The
reason I am working...

422
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,194
is because you lost another job
because you can't control your temper!

423
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,592
Good luck.

424
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,030
I've been up all night
to get that warrant.

425
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,068
Yeah, but where does it say
that we have to do the search?

426
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:41,674
Wait, you want me to go back and get
a court order to compel you to search?

427
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,005
We start doing searches, word will get
out, people are gonna be afraid to come.

428
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,374
Who? Drug-dealing hookers?

429
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,484
Fine, I'll get the order. You
refuse that, I'll arrest you.

430
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,246
How long do
those batteries last?

431
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,085
This guy's spitting up blood.

432
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,226
Hi, I'm Ab... I'm Dr. Lockhart.

433
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,335
George Pisoni, history
of oral malignancy.

434
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,386
Cancer of the tonsil.

435
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,829
- Been going like this all night.
- CBC, PT, PTT, type and cross.

436
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,765
Bayonets, gel foam
and some Cetacaine.

437
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,565
- Can you stop the bleeding?
- Going to do the best I can.

438
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,372
- Open up. HALEH:
Yankauer's ready.

439
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,246
It's just a little
numbing spray.

440
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,679
Nice coat.

441
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,613
It's a mess in there.

442
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,985
Two operations,
lots of radiation.

443
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,456
Here. This should help it clot.

444
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,375
Sorry.

445
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,235
Maybe you'd be more
comfortable holding it yourself?

446
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,257
Okay. You're bleeding
over a large area.

447
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:17,733
So we may need to put a breathing
tube in your throat to protect your airway.

448
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,232
No. HALEH: HemoCue's 8.5.

449
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,341
You might also
need a transfusion.

450
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,843
No, thanks. I have
an advance directive.

451
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,648
But if we don't stop this,
you could bleed to death.

452
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,843
I guess...

453
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,855
maybe...

454
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,922
today's the day.

455
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,373
Alex.

456
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,144
Alex, come on.

457
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,814
I could've been dead.
You wouldn't have noticed.

458
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,013
Leave now, we can
make it halfway to Florida.

459
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,455
- I don't wanna go.
- You can swim in the ocean.

460
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,093
So what?

461
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,456
All right, how about
Cousin Fran's in Atlanta?

462
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,031
- Her place smells.
- Fine. Where do you wanna go?

463
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,260
- Back to Chicago.
- Isn't an option. Come on.

464
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,300
- We don't have time for this.
- No.

465
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,200
- Well, you wanna stay here?
- Yeah.

466
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,772
- Really? Right here?
- Yes.

467
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,933
- And I can't change your mind?
- Nope.

468
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,208
Okay.

469
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:42,647
We'll stay here. We'll stay right here
in this pool for the rest of our lives.

470
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,758
I found another
treatment option.

471
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,194
Will it cure my cancer?

472
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,567
Nebulized epinephrine. It's
like a vapor. You inhale it.

473
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,038
And sometimes it constricts the
blood vessels and stops the bleeding.

474
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,703
- How long will it last?
- It's just temporary.

475
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,220
Are you sure?

476
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,322
Yes.

477
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,995
Yes.

478
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,840
I'm getting tired.

479
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,801
As your blood count
drifts down, you get sleepy.

480
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,177
Will it hurt?

481
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,215
If it does...

482
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,218
we'll give you morphine.

483
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,557
Okay.

484
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,961
Will...?

485
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,261
Will you stay with me?

486
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:04,494
- Will you stay with me a while?
- Sure.

487
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:07,901
Abby, paramedics have a new
chest pain and a febrile seizure.

488
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:16,507
I'll be here, George. Make sure
you get everything you need.

489
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:17,911
Thank you, Haleh.

490
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,845
And I'll be back,
Mr. Pisoni, okay?

491
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,399
Greg? Greg?

492
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,892
Yeah, you're intubated.

493
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,764
You had an epidural bleed.

494
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,241
Excuse me?

495
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,879
Can he get a pen and paper?

496
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:55,743
Hey, welcome back.

497
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,595
"I have a shift at 8 a.m."

498
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,297
Well, you're late.

499
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,669
It's already noon.

500
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,479
Gellin's D-dimer is positive...

501
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,485
and the spinal tap on Gomez
looks like viral meningitis.

502
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,680
- The coat suits you.
- Thank you.

503
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,985
Kovac, you expecting a collect call?
- Nope.

504
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,219
Area code 502.

505
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,392
- Wanna grab some breakfast?
- No. I'm too busy. Do you live here now?

506
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,035
I slept in the call room.
I gave up my apartment.

507
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,865
- Have you been up to see them?
- Jing-Mei's okay.

508
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,064
Greg hasn't woken up yet.

509
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,441
It's only been a couple hours.

510
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,570
Now, whatever happens, stay
calm, be professional and respectful.

511
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,716
We can appeal if we
don't like the decision.

512
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,647
Kerry, did you get my messages?

513
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:03,254
I don't think there's anything
else for us to talk about.

514
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,021
Mr. Lopez, I don't
think it's appropriate...

515
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:07,045
Please, a minute.

516
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,857
We've all agreed to let
the court decide this matter.

517
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,361
You work so much.
My parents are retired.

518
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:16,263
- They're home all the time for Henry.
- Please, Mr. Lopez.

519
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:20,838
- Dr. Weaver is aware of your concerns.
- No, please, Kerry, two minutes.

520
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,235
Please, two minutes.

521
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,399
Mr. and Mrs. Lopez,
you have now agreed...

522
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,136
that a full order of legal
and physical custody...

523
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,372
will be granted to
Dr. Weaver for Henry...

524
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,448
and you will continue in your
current role as caregiver...

525
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,348
during Dr. Weaver's working hours?
- Yes, Your Honor.

526
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,012
With visitation rights
on holidays as specified.

527
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,522
Yes.

528
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,973
We just want to be
a part of Henry's life.

529
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:43,997
Thank you.

530
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,292
Thank you. Thank you.

531
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,101
Sounds better.
Sixty of prednisone.

532
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,898
- Films on Rowland.
- Okay.

533
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,269
- Set me up for a sugar-tong splint.
- Repeat EKG on Harper.

534
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:02,244
- Mm. Oh, bolus 5000 of heparin.
- And we can't get an IV on Grant.

535
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,110
Okay, I'll do a central line.

536
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,252
- You met the new interns?
- No. It's about time. Put them to work.

537
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,981
Actually, Luka wanted you to see
a few more patients with them first.

538
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,625
- Why can't he take them around?
- He left hours ago.

539
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,260
Again?

540
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,377
Luka! Luka!

541
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,958
How about here?

542
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,465
It's okay.

543
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,544
Is there a prayer?

544
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,143
I don't know.

545
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,384
We should say something.

546
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,897
We miss you.

547
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,712
And you'll always
be in our hearts.

548
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,939
I want you to stay.

549
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:52,113
I can't. I can't.

550
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,016
Please?

551
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,917
I want us to be together.

552
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,985
I wanna marry you.

553
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,016
- Think I could eat?
- I'll order you a tray.

554
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,889
- Been here almost 18 hours.
- I'm aware of that.

555
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,224
You've held up a bed,
woken up two judges...

556
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,890
and now the head of Public
Health is coming to do your exam.

557
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,502
- Really?
- Really.

558
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,106
He's driving from Lake Forest just
for you. He's really happy about it too.

559
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:52,768
He says he hasn't done a pelvic in about
10 years but willing to "give it a shot."

560
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,873
So you can wait here another
hour for the old guy to get here...

561
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,212
and give you what I'm sure will
be a painless and gentle exam...

562
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:05,687
or you can let
me do it right now.

563
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,621
Hey. Signed, sealed,
delivered, she's all yours.

564
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,594
- You did the exam?
- No. It was more like self-service.

565
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,495
- Sign a death certificate.
- Who?

566
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,932
Tonsil guy finally bled out.

567
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,072
- George?
- Mm-hm.

568
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,537
- When?
- About an hour ago.

569
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:26,269
- Well, why didn't you come and find me?
- He was DNR. You were busy.

570
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,578
- But you were with him?
- Yeah.

571
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,882
- He was comfortable?
- Yeah.

572
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,186
Is now a good time?

573
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,759
- If you're too busy I'll just come back.
- It's fine.

574
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,328
- Where's the Marcaine?
- Drug lockup, middle cabinet.

575
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,722
- Right. And the drug lockup...?
- Behind you.

576
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,492
Thank you.

577
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,603
- Who's that?
- It's one of the other new interns.

578
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,467
Okay, what happened?

579
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,404
I told my residency director I
didn't wanna do an internship.

580
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,373
- In Michigan?
- Anywhere.

581
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,308
What?

582
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,107
- What did he say?
- To think about it.

583
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,715
- Lucky he didn't fire you.
- Would make life simpler.

584
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,764
Diarrhea boy's at it again.
- Okay.

585
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,717
You can't get licensed
without an internship.

586
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:12,119
- So?
- So you can't practice medicine.

587
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,156
- Right.
- That's crazy. It's one more year.

588
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,318
- I don't wanna do it.
- Eight years of school. You're so close.

589
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,395
What are you gonna do?
Throw away your future?

590
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,294
I'm not sure it's
the future I want.

591
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,900
- Abby?
- I'm coming.

592
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,093
Let's get something
to eat later.

593
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,269
What are you doing, Sam?

594
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,414
This is what I do.
You knew that.

595
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,908
I don't stay in one
place that long.

596
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,951
So how long are you
gonna keep doing that?

597
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,887
- As long as I have to.
- You can't keep running away.

598
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,087
Sure, I can.

599
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,466
- This isn't just about Steve?
- I'm sorry.

600
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,501
Sometimes there's a
little collateral damage.

601
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,871
- I have to do this for Alex.
- From what I can tell, it's not working.

602
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,871
Well, he's 10. He doesn't
know what's working.

603
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,778
Is this the life you want
for him? For yourself?

604
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,225
I don't know what else to do.

605
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,329
Go to your car, follow
me back to Chicago.

606
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,627
You don't have to do
this alone. I'm here.

607
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,529
You can trust me.

608
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,665
That is not
something I'm good at.

609
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,277
Why not give it a try?

610
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,814
Can't be any worse
than this, can it?

611
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,664
Come on. We should get going.
I don't wanna miss my flight.

612
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,467
When are you coming back?

613
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,971
I'm not sure.

614
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,479
Well, my schedule is flexible.

615
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,614
I can come and
visit in a few weeks.

616
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,616
Can we talk about
it when I get back?

617
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,050
Sure.

618
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,752
I'll just need a bit
of time, you know?

619
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,690
I've gotta rest.

620
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,333
Get back into work.

621
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,600
You didn't answer my question.

622
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,342
It's okay.

623
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,342
I love you.

624
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,586
You don't have to answer me now.

625
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,653
I'm just not ready.

626
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,466
Well, will you think about it?

627
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,873
Promise me that?

628
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,938
I just don't know what
to think about anything.

629
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,576
It just all happened so fast.

630
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,482
And felt so right, didn't it?

631
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,660
Well, it is right.

632
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,727
Just give me a bit
more time, okay?

633
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,883
I love you too.

634
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,110
I love you so much.
