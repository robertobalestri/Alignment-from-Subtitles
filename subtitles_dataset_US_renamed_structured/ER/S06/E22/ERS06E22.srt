1
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:13,072
<i>Multiple casualties.</i>

2
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,540
<i>Request all available units.</i>

3
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,575
<i>Stand by. Repeat: stand by.</i>

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,078
<i>Suspect firing automatic
weapons. Be advised.</i>

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,947
<i>All units responding.</i>

6
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:29,444
Go! Go! Go!

7
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:47,257
Three gunshots. One looks fatal.

8
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,126
You should have let
us land 10 minutes ago.

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,228
Suspect was pinned
down, he was still firing.

10
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,528
He was shooting at the school?

11
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,914
They were shooting everywhere.

12
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:56,015
Unit responded to an
armored-truck robbery.

13
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,234
The suspects opened fire.

14
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,468
I'll take this one.

15
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:59,535
Where are my glasses?

16
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,638
Where are my glasses?

17
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,373
Is he alert? Sort of.

18
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,407
Name's Daniel.

19
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,810
Daniel... do you
know where you are?

20
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,445
I lost my glasses.

21
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,730
Can you tell me where you are?

22
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:10,864
School.

23
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,949
Exit wound out the right temple.

24
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,034
What kind of ammunition
were they using?

25
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,970
One had a
large-caliber assault rifle

26
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,637
to shoot through
the engine block.

27
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,274
We'll never get her back
with a head wound like that.

28
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:22,630
Stop compressions.

29
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:31,802
My dad! Somebody call my dad!

30
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,536
I'm Dr. Kovac. What's your name?

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,737
Nicholas.

32
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,223
Take a deep breath, Nicholas.

33
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:38,925
Could you call my
dad? Vinny Rosato.

34
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,427
He works at Covin.

35
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:43,797
312-54... How's he doing?

36
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,298
Chest is clear.
Good radial pulse.

37
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:46,566
Titrate 4 of morphine.

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,653
54... uh, 548...

39
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,988
Don't worry. I'm
sure the school has it.

40
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,356
That could take a while.

41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,508
We're evacuating out of
the front of the building.

42
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,694
Why? We've
apprehended two suspects.

43
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,017
There might be another one.

44
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:01,031
Might be?

45
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,899
Can you feel your leg?

46
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:03,883
Kind of.

47
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,051
It's, like, going to sleep.

48
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:06,119
What, pins and needles?

49
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:07,120
Yeah.

50
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:08,338
Where are the paramedics?

51
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,606
We're waving 'em through now.

52
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,590
You got any Ancef?

53
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:12,092
Red bag, side pocket.

54
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:13,627
Is yours stable by ground?

55
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:15,662
Should be. Bullet
fragment missed the brain.

56
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:16,763
What about yours?

57
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:18,030
Clean through the shoulder,

58
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,966
but there's one to the
groin with a cold foot.

59
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,686
Okay. We've got
to revascularize...

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,554
Okay, clear out! What?

61
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,690
Go now! He's in the
building, coming out!

62
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:36,709
Let me examine him.

63
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:37,927
We have to search him first.

64
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,928
Is he still breathing?

65
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,929
Yeah.

66
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,097
He's clear.

67
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,132
All right, come ahead.

68
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,683
You shot him through the vest?

69
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:45,318
Right chest.

70
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,719
All right, BP.
Sir, I'm a doctor.

71
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm here to help you.

72
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:48,855
Can you talk? Go to hell.

73
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,891
Okay. I'll take that as a "yes."

74
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,609
Diminished breath
sounds on the right.

75
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,627
BP's 100/65. His pulse is at 88.

76
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,329
All right, let's get
in a large-bore IV,

77
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,315
and let's roll him.

78
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,367
No exit wound. All right,
he needs a chest tube.

79
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:02,185
Let's get Betadine,
and a Steri-Drape.

80
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,453
And take that mask off of him.

81
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,672
- You got this?
- Yeah. Lidocaine.

82
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,073
I'm sending the eye by ambulance

83
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:08,541
and taking the
leg in the chopper.

84
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,493
Hold on, hold on. I
might need to fly this guy.

85
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,894
No room. Take him by ground.

86
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,580
Hold on. I want to
make sure he's stable.

87
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:15,381
Bring him to Mercy.
County is the closest

88
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,549
pediatric trauma center.

89
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,651
Just wait until I get
the chest tube in.

90
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,269
All right, 32 French. Come on.

91
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,804
Chris, take two units of O-neg

92
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,273
from the cooler
into the chopper.

93
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,341
I'm loading my kid.

94
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,293
I said, wait! Kovac!

95
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,511
<i>The suspect is apparently alive.</i>

96
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,546
<i>We are waiting for
confirmation on that.</i>

97
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,215
<i>If you are just joining
us, this is a live shot</i>

98
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,018
<i>of Thalin Elementary School.</i>

99
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,085
Is that Dr. Kovac?

100
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,520
I don't know. It's hard to say.

101
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,188
Nah, he's too short to be Kovac.

102
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,423
Has anyone seen the toolkit?

103
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,424
What toolkit?

104
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,558
The do-it-yourself kit.

105
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,560
The one with the
hammer, pliers, screwdriver.

106
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,329
What are you gonna
do, build a tree house?

107
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,131
A guy drilled a wood
screw into his tibia

108
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,132
with a power drill.

109
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,266
Somebody gonna get that?

110
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,834
Thanks, Abby.

111
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,253
Hey, what are you guys watching?

112
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,621
Where have you been?

113
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:56,088
It's a shooting near a school.

114
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,390
Weaver sent Benton and Kovac.

115
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,191
We... Wait a minute.
Why did they get to go?

116
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,160
Because they don't
get sick in the chopper.

117
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,845
Hey, I already told
you I had the flu.

118
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,389
Okay? I got it.

119
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,949
What are you gonna do,

120
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,318
take it out with a screwdriver?

121
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,053
Why? You got a better idea?

122
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,121
MVA coming in.

123
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,056
Single auto versus
parking structure.

124
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,557
ETA? Five to 10.

125
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,859
All right, get Weaver.
I'll meet you in Trauma 2.

126
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,061
Hey, hey. Why do you get it?

127
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,947
I'll call you if he
needs his oil changed.

128
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:22,949
The drive might be
faster in morning traffic.

129
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,050
It's your call. Hold on.

130
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,251
Pulse is weak and thready.

131
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,719
Hey, man, are you still with me?

132
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,822
Heart rate's 120. Chest
output's over 500 cc's.

133
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,423
He's bleeding out
through his chest.

134
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,124
A unit of O-neg.
BP's down to 70 palp.

135
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,125
All right, follow me.

136
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,226
Uh, where are you going?

137
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,495
We'll transport by chopper.

138
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,797
Half liter bolus, then TKO.

139
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:38,832
He's bleeding out!

140
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:40,166
What?! The guy. The shooter.

141
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,801
He's bleeding out.
Need the chopper.

142
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,503
Where are we going to put him?

143
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,754
We have to take the boy off.

144
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,306
He has a pulseless leg.

145
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,391
Yeah, but we got five
hours to revascularize.

146
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,977
I'm not going to waste
time transporting by ground.

147
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:53,513
This guy's pressure is
crashing! Then give him blood.

148
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,348
Get out of the
chopper... No way.

149
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,983
Look, my patient
is more critical.

150
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,801
Your patient killed people.

151
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,737
That's not our call!

152
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,041
Come on.

153
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,908
Close the door! Let's go!

154
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:05,909
Let's go.

155
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,076
Kovac, open up the door!

156
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,528
You have to be
clear! Stand back.

157
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,552
Open up the door! Stand back!

158
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,142
Ow, ow, ow, ow! IV's in.

159
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,343
That's it. I'm outta here.

160
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,344
Screw you!

161
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:26,346
Oh, you're welcome.

162
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,980
Thank you, Doris. Anytime.

163
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,182
What do you got, Carter?

164
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,483
We got a combative single MVA.

165
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:31,984
Ran into a parking lot booth.

166
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,137
Get this thing off my
neck! Was anybody in it?

167
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,438
No. I can't breathe!

168
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,307
He's altered, tachy
and hypertensive.

169
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,308
He'll need a head CT.

170
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,842
Get this thing off!

171
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,061
Neck looks clear.

172
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,562
Okay. Remove the collar.

173
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,130
BP's up, 200/100.

174
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,482
Okay, hold still.

175
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,982
Get it off. That's
what I'm doing.

176
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,718
Looks like a posterior
hip dislocation.

177
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,604
All right, titrate,
200 of fentanyl

178
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:52,822
and 6 of Versed.

179
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,856
I'll reduce it.

180
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,341
You might wanna look at this.

181
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,577
What's wrong? It's a
goiter, I think. A big one.

182
00:06:57,601 --> 00:07:00,413
That's 1 of Versed.
And 50 of fentanyl.

183
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:01,914
What are you doing?
Don't touch me!

184
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,182
Keep going. He can take more.

185
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:04,851
Okay, did you notice
any hand tremors?

186
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,719
No. He was moving
around all over the place.

187
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:08,387
That's another 50 of fentanyl.

188
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,589
You thinking thyroid storm?

189
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,491
IV Inderal, 100 PTU.

190
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,926
So, he's not on drugs?

191
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,095
No, no. His thyroid
is hyperactive.

192
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,179
I'm gonna kill somebody.

193
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,730
I swear.

194
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:20,433
- How much Inderal?
- A mg every two minutes.

195
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,168
Okay. He's out.

196
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,702
Abby, you ever
reduce a hip before?

197
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:24,837
No. It's pretty easy.

198
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,856
You just want to
stabilize the pelvis.

199
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,191
Nope, from above. Up.

200
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,525
Yeah.

201
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,726
Yeah? Yeah.

202
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,329
All right, I'm gonna
pull up. On three.

203
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:36,249
One, two, three.

204
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,421
Oh, my gosh! Oh, sh... - Carter!

205
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,340
Carter, are you all right?

206
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,009
Let me up. I wanna get up!

207
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,110
Carter?

208
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,545
Push another two of Versed.

209
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,513
Okay, somebody grab
Malucci. He can do this.

210
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,081
I can do it. John, sit down.

211
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,134
I said, I can do it.

212
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,219
Is he out this time?
Yeah, he's out.

213
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,087
I don't want you to
aggravate your injury.

214
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,455
Are you ready?

215
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,556
You ready? Yeah.

216
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,442
Thank you. Now maintain
downward pressure.

217
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,943
Don't be gentle.

218
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,233
One, two, three.

219
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay. I got it.

220
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,368
Femoral head is back in place.

221
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,120
Good job, Carter.

222
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,822
Oh, it's just like
falling off a horse.

223
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:17,490
Heart rate's down to 110.

224
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:20,126
Dr. Weaver, we got
a hot MI in Curtain 3.

225
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,828
Uh, you got it from here?

226
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:22,995
Hard part's over.

227
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,330
Let's get him up to Radiology.

228
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:26,565
And then we'll get a
post-reduction film later.

229
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,034
Ahem. I'm sorry about that.

230
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:30,538
Now you know it takes
a lot of countertraction.

231
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,105
Hey, can you babysit
him to Radiology?

232
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,846
Sure. Thank you.

233
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,097
Did I leave his chart in here?

234
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,342
Is it over on the Mayo stand?

235
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,785
Um, no.

236
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,009
Just cleaning up. Yep.

237
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,141
There it is.

238
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,176
Over on the pulse ox.

239
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,320
What? The chart.
It's over there.

240
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:32,520
Thanks.

241
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:35,968
Whoa, look at this.

242
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,737
A needle stick
waiting to happen.

243
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:40,139
Mm-hm. Can't be too
careful. That's right.

244
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,473
Hey, make sure they do a head,

245
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,660
abdomen and pelvis
on that guy. Sure.

246
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,912
And come find me, hunt me
down. Let me see the films.

247
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:46,963
Okay.

248
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,052
Thanks.

249
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,055
Yep. Thank you.

250
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,064
What's his last pressure?

251
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,334
Stable, 110/70. How is he?

252
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,403
GSW to the groin,
with a pulseless leg.

253
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:11,404
What about the arm?

254
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:12,571
Neurocirc is intact.

255
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,073
Does he have
sensation in the foot?

256
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,074
We're losing it.

257
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:16,693
I'm going to lose my leg?

258
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,883
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

259
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,697
Send Burns for a shoulder x-ray.

260
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,299
Subramaniam
needs a Dilantin level.

261
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,501
What the hell is that?

262
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,470
Mr. Goodwrench is
tuning up a patient.

263
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,571
What?

264
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,239
You gotta hold still, man.

265
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,674
Malucci, what are you doing?

266
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,342
Hey, boss. Uh, you know what?

267
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,443
Let's take a break, okay?

268
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,444
Okay. Okay.

269
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,912
Guy drilled a
screw into his leg.

270
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,482
Yeah, I can see that. Think
he needs a little more lidocaine?

271
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,484
Won't even take an
aspirin. Says it interferes

272
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,686
with the healing process.
You tell him he's wrong?

273
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,988
Yeah. The chief even tried
to talk some sense into him.

274
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,090
Well, lis... Tell him if he
wants to be a masochist,

275
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,258
he can't scream so much.

276
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,859
He's gonna scare
the other patients.

277
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,429
Right. I'll have him
bite down on a bullet.

278
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,931
Carter, I heard you got
punted across the trauma room.

279
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,033
Yeah, who told you that?

280
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,101
I hear everything.

281
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,125
Haleh. Yeah.

282
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,222
Malucci. I know.

283
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,691
So did you hurt yourself?

284
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:07,210
No, just knocked the wind
out of me. Everything's working.

285
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,477
Another tough guy.

286
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,829
Something rolling up?

287
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,831
Rolling down. It's the
kid from the shooting.

288
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,232
I thought I might jump in.

289
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,535
Okay, well don't jump
off any gurneys. Yes, sir.

290
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,570
So did you call any of
those Psych referrals?

291
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,505
What patient?
That list I gave you.

292
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:20,973
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. How did it go?

293
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,041
Um... you know.

294
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:24,844
Okay, I guess.
Kind of tough to tell.

295
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,562
Yeah, it could take a while.

296
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:30,332
CBC, lytes, PT, PTT,
type and cross for two units.

297
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,534
Can we give more morphine?

298
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,568
Another 4.

299
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,503
And get a chest
x-ray and pelvis.

300
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,605
You want Ancef?
Got it in the field.

301
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,907
Nicholas, we are just going
to take a look at you here,

302
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,377
and then we'll bring you
upstairs for an operation, okay?

303
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,811
On my count. One, two, three.

304
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,247
Did they call my dad?

305
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,348
We'll take care of it.

306
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,500
Mary, call the police,
the school, or whoever,

307
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,001
to reach his father at work.

308
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,268
It's been all over the news.

309
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,788
I'm sure his dad's
looking for him.

310
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:52,839
Make sure.

311
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,140
Got it.

312
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,141
Lungs are clear.

313
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,442
BP 115/75. Pulse 80.

314
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,745
Left inguinal entrance
wound. Where's the exit?

315
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,265
Couldn't find one for the
leg. Bullet's still inside.

316
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,850
Should see it
on the pelvic film.

317
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:05,651
No pulse by Doppler.

318
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,019
Let's take a look at the back.

319
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,837
Through and through.
Missed everything.

320
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,005
I assessed it in the field.

321
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,058
I need to examine it myself.

322
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:14,326
Okay. Let's roll him.

323
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,561
Hold on, Nicholas.

324
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,929
We need to move
you on your side,

325
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:19,393
so we can look at your back.

326
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,785
Carter? Carter.

327
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,009
- Yeah, I got it.
- Let's roll.

328
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,358
Did you hit your
head or pass out?

329
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,127
Course I hit my
head. It's rugby.

330
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,129
Mm-hm. Any pain in
your chest or your belly?

331
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,831
No, nothing. I didn't
want to come in,

332
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,232
but the fellas made me. Mm-hm.

333
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,499
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

334
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,767
We need to cut off your shirt,

335
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,969
so that we can examine you.

336
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,838
Like hell you do. We
just got these jerseys.

337
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,339
If you've broken
your collarbone,

338
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,741
it'll be very painful to lift
your hands above your head.

339
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,809
Pain is relative, mate.

340
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,810
Mm-hm.

341
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,834
What was that?

342
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,703
Someone who didn't
want us to cut off his shirt.

343
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,067
Heh. Right.

344
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,958
Okay, Abby. Abby. Go ahead.

345
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,926
You are blue.

346
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,294
Did you know that, Mr. Tanner?

347
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,830
It happens as soon as you
sweat in these new jerseys.

348
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,865
Hm. Well. Maybe you
should wash them first.

349
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,200
It's brand-new.

350
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,368
Yeah.

351
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,369
Okay. Ahem.

352
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,121
Let me know if
you feel any pain.

353
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:17,055
Ah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,008
Uh, probably a
mid-shaft fracture.

355
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,376
Yeah, looks like it's broken.

356
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,295
Will I be able to
play next week?

357
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,897
I doubt it. But we're gonna
wait and see the x-ray.

358
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,565
Be right back.

359
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,789
Abby?

360
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,569
Get a clavicle film. Great.

361
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,388
Mm-hm. Is everything okay? Yeah.

362
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,412
You sure?

363
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,109
Do you have a minute?

364
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,176
I don't see a bullet.

365
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,045
Must be higher
up in the abdomen.

366
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,246
Let's shoot a KUB.

367
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,082
Are you sure your
stomach doesn't hurt?

368
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,583
It's just my leg.

369
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,085
PVC's on the cardiac monitor.

370
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:47,252
Where's the chest x-ray?

371
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,453
Whoa, run of five.

372
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,373
Bolus 60 of lidocaine.
Start 1 per minute.

373
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,491
What is it?

374
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,659
Just an extra heartbeat.
Nothing to worry about.

375
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:55,077
You're not gonna believe this.

376
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,078
What?

377
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,222
Found your bullet.

378
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,583
Oh, God. It's in his heart.

379
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,535
Traveled through
the femoral vein.

380
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,087
From there to the IVC, into
the right atrium and ventricle.

381
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,289
Lydia, call the O.R., tell
'em we're on our way up.

382
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,725
Carter, make sure there's
an open cardiac room

383
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,226
with a perfusionist standing by.

384
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,461
He may need a bypass.

385
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,763
I got it.

386
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,182
You'll have to revascularize
the leg at the same time.

387
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:17,800
Put him in right
lateral decubitus,

388
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,101
reverse Trendelenburg.

389
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,903
We don't want it to
embolize into the lung.

390
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,522
We need to move
you on your side again.

391
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:24,073
What's wrong?

392
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,942
Remember I said we
would take you upstairs?

393
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:26,943
Yeah.

394
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,527
Well, we're going now.

395
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,370
Hey. Good effort.

396
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,851
Eighteen-year-old
college student,

397
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,953
mugged outside her dorm,
stabbed in the abdomen.

398
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,005
Hey, Peter.

399
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:40,939
Two hundred cc's in the Foley.

400
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,376
Type and cross for six units.
Have two of FFP on hand.

401
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,544
She's gonna fix you up,
okay? Hang in there, buddy.

402
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,546
You'll get my dad?

403
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,930
I'll get your dad.

404
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,132
Send up the O-neg
in case they need it.

405
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,000
Peter, Elizabeth
needs another surgeon.

406
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,302
Congratulations. He's dead.

407
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,303
Who?

408
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,771
The man he
abandoned at the scene.

409
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,673
I didn't abandon him.
He went into asystole

410
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,041
five minutes outside of Mercy.

411
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,509
They cracked
him. It was too late.

412
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,311
Ten minutes would
have made a difference?

413
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,312
We won't know, will we?

414
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,613
We talking about the shooter?

415
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,715
First rule of triage:
The most critical patient,

416
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,733
that's the priority...

417
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:09,134
The boy has a
bullet in his heart.

418
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,435
It can embolize at any minute.

419
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:11,437
He could lose his leg.

420
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:12,705
Let's debate this later.

421
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,272
You didn't make a
medical judgment!

422
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,125
You made a value
judgment! I made both!

423
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,194
Get upstairs, Peter!
You didn't care, man!

424
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,528
I was caring for the boy!

425
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,929
Hey, hey, hey. That's enough.

426
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,264
That's enough.

427
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,966
Kerry, I need to talk to you.

428
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,002
Can't believe that guy!
BP's 118/78, pulse 84.

429
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,771
Can you describe the
man who stabbed you?

430
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,339
I-I don't know. It
happened so fast.

431
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,758
Chuny, get an ultrasound
and fetal monitor, Trauma 2.

432
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,060
Cleo, you need some help?

433
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,428
Yeah, I might.

434
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,729
Kerry, now. It's important.

435
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,898
You saw the boy. He needed
to get to a trauma center.

436
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,332
Calm down. Go help Cleo.

437
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,567
I'm supposed to delay care

438
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:42,902
while they take the guy who was

439
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,269
shooting at kids and cops?

440
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:46,355
Go help Cleo! FINCH:<i>
One, two, three.</i>

441
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,924
Can you give me any
kind of physical description?

442
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,625
Uh, he was, um, darker.

443
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,760
Maybe Mexican.

444
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,862
What is it?

445
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,897
Victim of assault.
Single right stab wound

446
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,198
to the lower right quadrant,

447
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,433
about four centimeters
off the midline.

448
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,434
What was he wearing?

449
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,037
A gray sweatshirt, I think.

450
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,706
Okay. A full trauma panel
and check a HemoCue.

451
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,575
How far along are you, miss?

452
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,877
W-what?

453
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:08,878
What month are you in?

454
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,712
W-what do you mean?

455
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,181
Your pregnancy.
When are you due?

456
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,405
I'm not pregnant.

457
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,269
You look about eight months.

458
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,121
Got the ultrasound.
Better cath a urine.

459
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,590
Anything else you can
tell me about the attack?

460
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,160
No. H-he just ran
up, grabbed my purse.

461
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,144
When I didn't let go,

462
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:27,730
he stabbed me. COP: Okay.

463
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,099
I'll be back. Fetal
heart tones are 142.

464
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,700
HemoCue's 13.4.

465
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,202
No intra-abdominal bleed on Mom.

466
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,269
How about the baby?

467
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,373
Thirty-two-week size.
Good cardiac activity.

468
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,457
I'm pregnant?

469
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,458
Very.

470
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,148
Oh, my God.

471
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,878
Hold on.

472
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,246
What?

473
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,247
There. A blood clot.

474
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,632
Abruption?

475
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:47,656
Could be.

476
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,636
Twelve milligrams of
betamethasone, now.

477
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,505
You can't tell my parents.

478
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,072
What's your name?

479
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,041
Uh, Gloria. Gloria Milton.

480
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,175
Gloria...

481
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,978
the stab wound has
damaged the placenta,

482
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:00,229
causing it to bleed.

483
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,964
Which would cut off
oxygen to your baby.

484
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,349
I didn't even know I had a baby.

485
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:04,850
Well, you do.

486
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:07,118
Right now it looks okay.

487
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,855
But we may need to bring
you upstairs for a C-section.

488
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,790
You mean, uh, cut me open?

489
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,358
Yes. Thirty-two weeks is early.

490
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:14,827
But we are giving
you steroids now

491
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:16,278
to help mature the baby's lungs.

492
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,829
No, wait. I don't
want an operation.

493
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,598
You might not have a choice.

494
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,617
If the abruption
continues, the baby will die.

495
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,453
But nothing bad will
happen to me, right?

496
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,255
Right now you're
all right, but...

497
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,256
Then don't.

498
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,291
Don't cut me open.

499
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,681
Don't do anything.

500
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,914
Hey, it's Dr. Torquemada.

501
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:37,115
Who?

502
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,685
Nothing. Did you discharge
your screamer yet?

503
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:40,986
It was pretty tough, Carter.

504
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,588
You couldn't tell
that from out here.

505
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,189
He took on the hurt
and won, my friend.

506
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,759
You gotta respect that.
Right. No brain, no pain?

507
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:48,903
Some cultures see
pain as a rite of passage.

508
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,865
Uh, somebody
call a staff meeting?

509
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,021
No.

510
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,503
Hey, you know, that kid
made it up to the O.R. okay.

511
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:59,822
Cardiac team's in.
Benton's working on the leg.

512
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,073
Good. Thanks.

513
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:03,008
At age 13, the Masai warriors

514
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,493
of Tanzania scar themselves

515
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,594
with red-hot spears

516
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,496
and yank out their
bottom front teeth,

517
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,498
with no Novocain, mind you. Hm.

518
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,666
Hey, Dave, why don't
you give us a minute?

519
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,668
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sorry.

520
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,852
Carter, hold on.

521
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,409
What's up?

522
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,378
I think you know.
Oh, look at that.

523
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,179
The guy leaves like
a millimeter of coffee

524
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,847
on the bottom of the pot.

525
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,249
Abby saw you.

526
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,584
She saw me what?

527
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,075
Abby.

528
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,688
I saw you inject the fentanyl

529
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,657
into your wrist.

530
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,076
What?

531
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,743
In the trauma
room, when you said

532
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:39,917
you were cleaning up.

533
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,332
I was cleaning up.

534
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,000
John. I have the chart here.

535
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,919
You drew up 200 of
fentanyl into the syringe.

536
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,921
What is this?

537
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:51,356
You gave 150
mics to the patient.

538
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,542
Okay. Hold on. Slow down.

539
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,077
This is a mistake.

540
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,478
But you stopped after 3 cc's.

541
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,147
Yeah, Haleh gave
him a bunch of Versed.

542
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,314
You were there.

543
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,099
What happened to
the rest of the fentanyl?

544
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:03,435
I don't know. Must have
wasted it down the sink.

545
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,521
Somebody's supposed
to witness you doing that.

546
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,656
Come on.

547
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,558
Come on. We do
that all the time.

548
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,394
We have a protocol
for disposal of narcotics.

549
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,561
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

550
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,386
That doesn't mean
that I injected it.

551
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:23,255
Abby...

552
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,590
f you thought you
saw something, why...?

553
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:27,076
Why wouldn't you
come talk to me?

554
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,244
It's appropriate for Abby

555
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,796
to come to us. Not
when she's wrong.

556
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,770
Carter, you still on
pain medication?

557
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,302
Why? What? For your back.

558
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,803
Yeah, why? A little. Why?

559
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,171
How much is "a little"?

560
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:41,423
Well, that's between
me and my doctor, isn't it?

561
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,898
So you're not overmedicating?

562
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,734
You think I'm a drug addict?

563
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:51,517
Huh? Do you honestly
think I'm a drug addict?

564
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,585
That I'm what, sneaking around,

565
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,377
injecting whatever
narcotics I can find?

566
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,024
Uh...

567
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:01,076
You guys... You know
me. This is ridiculous.

568
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,661
So you deny this?

569
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,697
Yes, I deny it! Abby.

570
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:08,117
I, uh, think you're
seeing things.

571
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,884
Maybe you're on drugs.

572
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,220
Yeah, I think I saw
you with a needle once.

573
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,388
Okay, Carter...

574
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,624
if this is a misunderstanding,
I apologize.

575
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:16,928
This is a misunderstanding.

576
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,078
You know why we had to ask you.

577
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,870
Can I go back to work now?

578
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,440
Thank you.

579
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,032
And thank you, Abby.
I really appreciate that.

580
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,383
He's lying, Mark.

581
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,407
I know.

582
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,089
We'll call someone
you can talk to.

583
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,574
It doesn't have
to be your parents.

584
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:50,943
It can be a friend,
a roommate...

585
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:53,311
No, please. I don't
wanna talk to anyone.

586
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,713
Gloria, we don't have much time.

587
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:56,432
If we're gonna save that baby,

588
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,433
we need to operate now.

589
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,401
I told you I don't want it.

590
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,769
You can give the baby up.

591
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,738
Your mom and dad
would never have to know.

592
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,574
I don't want an operation.

593
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,326
So just leave me
alone. All of you!

594
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,794
Just leave me alone! Okay. Okay!

595
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:10,362
All of you leave me alone!

596
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,448
Okay, but you're gonna
have to keep monitors on.

597
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,117
Why? For your own safety.

598
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,353
We need to know if you
start bleeding internally.

599
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,537
Dr. Kovac?

600
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,224
Why don't you spin another crit?

601
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:25,260
And cycle the dynamap
every five minutes.

602
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,561
Seventeen years of practice,

603
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,930
I thought I'd seen everything.

604
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,064
You're taking her up?

605
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,000
I can't. Not if she
doesn't want to.

606
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,768
The fetal heart rate
is down to a hundred.

607
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,203
The abruption is progressing.
She needs a C-section.

608
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,006
I made the consequences
very clear to her.

609
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,807
She doesn't care
about the consequences.

610
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,908
You can't cut a woman open

611
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:40,909
without her consent.

612
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,544
That's assault.
The baby will die.

613
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:43,979
I'm aware of that.

614
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,681
And you can stand by
and watch it happen?

615
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,782
There's nothing I can do.

616
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,783
You can operate.

617
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,118
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

618
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,653
I'm calling another OB.

619
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,420
Who? I am the head
of the department.

620
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,588
We don't force C-sections

621
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,756
on women in this hospital.

622
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,625
What if I can get her
declared incompetent?

623
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,627
I don't know. She
seemed coherent to me.

624
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,547
I think the stab wound
was self-inflicted.

625
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,715
You can prove that?

626
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,982
She is delusional.

627
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,884
She claims she didn't
know she was pregnant.

628
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,386
She was lying. That... That
doesn't mean she's crazy.

629
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,307
What kind of woman carries
a child for eight months,

630
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,141
and then refuses to
let us help her baby?

631
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,143
You know what? Call
Psych. Give it a shot.

632
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,144
Then I can bring her up?

633
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,368
Yeah, if they say yes.

634
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,591
Side-biting clamp.

635
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,574
5-0 Prolene.

636
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,054
If you ask me, Peter,

637
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,023
we're lucky to
have this extra time.

638
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,458
Ah, Kovac didn't know

639
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,892
the bullet moved to his heart.

640
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,861
Well, I'd have trouble
prioritizing someone

641
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,663
who shoots at a playground too.

642
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,664
BP's down, 80 palp.

643
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,799
Is that you?

644
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,968
Nope. No active bleeding.

645
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,537
Femoral vessels are clamped.

646
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,937
Shirley, recheck the pressure.

647
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,939
Still falling, 70
palp. What is it?

648
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,644
Did the bullet embolize?

649
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,301
Fluoroscope on.

650
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,269
It's still in the heart for now.

651
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,022
But it is moving closer
to the pulmonary artery.

652
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,274
- We got blood dripping.
- Where from?

653
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,793
Shirley, take the
towel off his shoulder.

654
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,311
He's bleeding out.

655
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:07,712
Oh, damn it. Saline sponge now!

656
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:11,115
We need six more units
of packed cells up here!

657
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,484
What are you doing?

658
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,853
I've gotta locate the source.
I just opened his heart.

659
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:17,255
It won't make a difference
if we don't stop the bleeding.

660
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,041
Wait! Just wait!
Clamp the auricle.

661
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,275
I can't! Just for a second.

662
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,693
The other bullet hit the artery.

663
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,612
Clamp the subclavian.

664
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,880
I need to get this bullet out.

665
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,648
Then I'll do it myself.
Move. Let's go.

666
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,066
Pressure's down to 60.

667
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,168
Where's the damn blood?!

668
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:30,669
Shirley, give him
a saline bolus.

669
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:34,473
Come on. Damn it! I
can't reach the artery.

670
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,409
All right. Crank the
sternum open a little wider.

671
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,001
He's in V-fib! Paddles! Paddles!

672
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,449
Peter, get your hands
out, now. Hold on, hold on!

673
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,924
Clear! Now! Got it. Go!

674
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,074
I don't know what to tell you.

675
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,642
But I've got a
tournament next week.

676
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,077
I can't miss the tournament.

677
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,112
You've broken your
collarbone, Mr. Tanner.

678
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,948
Aside from hurting yourself,
you'd be worthless on the field.

679
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,084
Well, can't I just put a
cast on it or something?

680
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,385
No, we sling it, and you rest.

681
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,154
Well, then, it
can't be that bad.

682
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,822
Yosh. Could you get
Mr. Tanner a sling?

683
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,423
I'll have to call Central.

684
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,625
We have a small. He looks large.

685
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,726
Hey, Mark.

686
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,595
You better make
that extra-large, mate.

687
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,186
I'll be back to discharge you.

688
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,220
So I talked to Legal.

689
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,255
Did you use his name?

690
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,957
No. I spoke in hypotheticals.

691
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,959
Uh, bottom line, we
need more evidence.

692
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,794
But he can't treat
patients, right?

693
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:32,097
I-it's one accusation.
We have to be careful.

694
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,699
Can we ask him to drug test?

695
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,701
He's taking a prescribed
pain medication.

696
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,369
He'll test positive.

697
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,071
And I'm afraid just asking

698
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,873
will push him further away.

699
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:41,907
What do you wanna do?

700
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:43,730
I wanna get him some help.

701
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,661
All right.

702
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,996
Let me talk to him again.

703
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,297
He might open up

704
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,666
if he doesn't
see it as a threat.

705
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,367
Mark, how could
we let this happen?

706
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:55,053
I mean, he showed all the signs.

707
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,888
I know. I know.

708
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,147
But it's Carter. Your
mind just doesn't go there.

709
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,885
She's a little calmer
now. That's a good sign.

710
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,920
He'll talk her into it.

711
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,021
How do you know?

712
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,022
He has to.

713
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,023
Dr. Kovac.

714
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,357
Yeah?

715
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,777
This is Vinny Rosato,
Nicholas' father. The schoolboy.

716
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:20,512
Oh, yes. Yes.

717
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:21,780
Hi... Hi, Mr. Rosato.

718
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:23,848
Your son is in surgery.

719
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:24,983
How bad is it?

720
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,169
He was shot in the
leg and the shoulder.

721
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,971
The surgeons should be able
to repair those injuries, but...

722
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,423
one bullet has
traveled to his heart.

723
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,809
He was shot in the heart?

724
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:37,262
No, no, no, no. The bullet
was swept through the vein.

725
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,215
But there shouldn't be
any major tissue damage.

726
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,404
Can they get it out?

727
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,137
We should take you upstairs.

728
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:47,172
There, you can get
more updated information.

729
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:48,824
I'll take you, Mr. Rosato.

730
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,326
Thank you, Cleo.

731
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,629
She's certainly
emotionally distraught.

732
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,330
She could be
clinically depressed

733
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,132
and even have a
personality disorder.

734
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,800
Can you declare her incompetent?

735
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,536
But she's not acutely psychotic.

736
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,905
She understands that failing
to perform the C-section

737
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,873
could endanger her baby's life.

738
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,874
You mean kill it.

739
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,659
She's willing to take the risk.

740
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:09,727
It's not a risk. She
wants it to happen.

741
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,830
She stabbed herself
to make it happen.

742
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:13,799
You have no evidence of that.

743
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,167
And she's a danger to others.

744
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:17,169
Who? The baby.

745
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:20,305
Doesn't count.
It's still her body.

746
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,558
Is the C-section
necessary to save her life?

747
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,726
Somewhere there
has to be a point.

748
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,461
Is it?

749
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,763
No.

750
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,732
Then without a court
order, you can't touch her.

751
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,268
I don't have time
for a court order.

752
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,903
That baby needs to come out now.

753
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,037
We can try to expedite it.

754
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,339
Our legal department
knows friendly judges.

755
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,942
You'll have to
write up an affidavit.

756
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,132
Yeah. Whatever.

757
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,573
When did you start smoking?

758
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:58,076
Well, that depends. Does
it make me a druggie?

759
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,766
Ask the Surgeon General. Hm.

760
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:03,370
I'm worried about you, Carter.

761
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,683
Look, I'm okay.

762
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,186
I got angry when
I shouldn't have.

763
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,255
Not that I didn't have a right.

764
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,357
I'm okay.

765
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,625
You didn't talk to
anyone, did you?

766
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:16,249
Any psychiatrists?

767
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:19,564
No.

768
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:20,588
Why not?

769
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,790
'Cause I didn't
feel like talking.

770
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,671
Look, I'm gonna be fine.

771
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:29,774
Or I hope... Nah, I-I will be.

772
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,460
It's been rough. You
can understand that.

773
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,929
I got stabbed in the back twice

774
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,248
with a 6-inch butcher knife.

775
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:37,504
I'm in a lot of pain.

776
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:42,942
And this place isn't exactly
the easiest work environment.

777
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,291
Lucy's dead, which
is partly my fault.

778
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:47,676
I haven't slept in months.

779
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,410
I... I had to take
more pain medication

780
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,714
just to function.

781
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,635
I didn't steal it.

782
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:57,702
It was prescribed to me.

783
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,404
Did you take the
prescribed amount?

784
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,995
Yeah. More or less.

785
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:08,330
I think you need help, Carter.

786
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,465
Look, I understand

787
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:13,134
that you have to make
this your business.

788
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,338
But please... <i>Please</i>
let me deal with it.

789
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,339
When are you off?

790
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,008
Midnight.

791
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,877
Okay, I don't want
you to see any patients.

792
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,579
You can work on
QA chart reviews.

793
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,465
I can see patients.
There's nothing wrong...

794
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:28,255
Carter, you have to trust me.

795
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,542
Let me figure this out.

796
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:53,341
We gotta write this one up.

797
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,676
Oh yeah, including the part

798
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,144
where you lifted
him off the table

799
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,512
while I was opening his heart?

800
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:00,115
Cranking his chest with one
hand and suturing with the other?

801
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:01,883
I still have a few
moves you haven't seen.

802
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,751
Oh, yeah? Listen,
okay, dibs on the bullet.

803
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:04,752
No way. It's mine.

804
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,954
I was the one that called it.

805
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,122
Yeah, but I fished it out.

806
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,356
Oh, yeah, but I... Hey, Cleo.

807
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,657
Hey. We just made a great save.

808
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,326
I can see that.

809
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,295
Yeah, we got the bullet
out of the boy's heart,

810
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,663
and Peter saved
his arm and his leg.

811
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,233
Father's outside Recovery
waiting to talk to someone.

812
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,617
Oh, okay. I'll do it.

813
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,321
What's wrong?

814
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,278
Nothing.

815
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,523
Hey.

816
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,636
Dr. Carter, I didn't
know what to do,

817
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,670
so I asked Dr. Greene.

818
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,406
I'm sorry.

819
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,241
And I know I don't
know you very well,

820
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,675
but I think you're
a good doctor.

821
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,844
And I know you've been
through a lot in a short time,

822
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,846
and I'm sure I couldn't
handle it myself.

823
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,270
But I felt I had to tell them.

824
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:53,408
You feel better?

825
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,062
'Cause I have work to do.

826
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:09,033
Hey, Mr. Tanner.
Here's your prescription.

827
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,036
You need to take one
every six hours for pain.

828
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,471
And you're gonna
wanna ice the...

829
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:16,574
Mr. Tanner? Mr. Tanner?!

830
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:17,808
Yosh, get Dr. Greene now!

831
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:18,877
What is it?

832
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,912
Barely has a pulse.
Lily, I need a BP.

833
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,146
What did he present with?

834
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,515
Fractured clavicle.

835
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,884
Absent breath
sounds on the left.

836
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,118
Could be a tension pneumo.

837
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:30,071
Get a 14-gauge needle
on a open syringe.

838
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,223
Come on, let's go.

839
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,390
BP's 50 palp.

840
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,142
Betadine? Yep.

841
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,045
Quickly, quickly. Get
him on a pulse ox.

842
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,145
I got it. Okay, check a pulse.

843
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,103
Stronger.

844
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:46,438
He's gonna need a chest tube.

845
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:47,823
It was just a broken collarbone.

846
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,757
Not anymore.

847
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,315
Satting at 95.

848
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,700
Okay. Get me a 10 blade.

849
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:56,948
Carter, what are you doing?

850
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,249
Saving this guy's life.

851
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,184
You must have missed
an occult rib fracture.

852
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,953
I'll take it from here.

853
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:04,055
Needle decompressed.
Gimme the Kelly.

854
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,156
I got it, Carter.

855
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,212
I'm almost in.

856
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,815
Right.

857
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,871
Right. You take it.

858
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,023
32 French.

859
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,424
Suction's ready.

860
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,526
BP's 100/60.

861
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,630
You're welcome.

862
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,590
I'm in. Hook me up. Abby.

863
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,058
Call as soon as you
know. Yeah... Thank you.

864
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:41,059
He didn't sign it?

865
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,093
They got there at 6:30.

866
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,427
The judge had already left.

867
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,196
But the clerk is trying
to track him down.

868
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,531
Can't we try another judge?

869
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:48,066
They're already working on that.

870
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,334
I-I can't wait. Luka.

871
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,086
You can't do
anything until we get it.

872
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,754
I've waited too long already.

873
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,539
Promise me that
you won't do anything.

874
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:56,346
No. I'm going to
change her mind.

875
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,896
We need to do this tonight.

876
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,298
I don't believe it.

877
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,500
Well, it makes sense.
He's been so unpredictable.

878
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:06,935
I thought he might be bipolar.

879
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,303
Carter? Come on, no way.

880
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:09,737
He as much as admitted it to me.

881
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,055
Peter, he's using.

882
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,273
I don't know for how long,

883
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,109
but the behavior's
been there for a while.

884
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,510
But is this the
right way to do it?

885
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,079
Uh... He might
feel ganged up on.

886
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,715
It's either this, or we have
to kick it to some committee.

887
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,400
I'd rather approach
him as a small group

888
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:23,634
that he knows and trusts,

889
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,204
and give him a
chance to clear it up.

890
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,538
And what about Romano?

891
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:29,473
No. We don't want
to bring him in to this.

892
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,326
You know, uh...
Carter can be stubborn.

893
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,627
He might just walk out.

894
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,995
We have to be prepared for that.

895
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,697
All we can do is be
compassionate, but clear.

896
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,139
He has two options. That's it.

897
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,222
Are you with us, Peter?

898
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,709
Kerry?

899
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,710
You needed me?

900
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,344
Yeah, Don.

901
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,980
So, what's the big emergency?

902
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:55,650
Why don't you have a seat?

903
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,951
Fetal heart rate down to 60.

904
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,321
Get a baby warmer in here.

905
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,956
Gloria, we don't have
time to argue anymore.

906
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,591
This baby needs to come out now.

907
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,026
I want another doctor.

908
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,227
The placenta's detaching.

909
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,579
You could hemorrhage to death.

910
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:08,863
You're trying to scare me.

911
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:09,897
You should be scared.

912
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,366
If you don't care
about your baby,

913
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,468
at least think of yourself.
I don't believe you.

914
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,353
You... You would've
done something already.

915
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:17,789
Heart rate's down to 50.

916
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:19,007
You're going to have a boy.

917
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,925
I can tell from the ultrasound.

918
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,794
You really want
to kill your son?

919
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:25,463
Leave me alone. I w...
I want another doctor!

920
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:26,497
Down to 40.

921
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,852
Okay, that's it. 100
of ketamine, IV push.

922
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:31,919
Dr. Kovac.

923
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,855
You heard me.
Draw up the ketamine.

924
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,389
You can't. I'm the attending.

925
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,891
I'll take full responsibility!

926
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,693
What are you doing?
Please don't do this.

927
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,362
I-I-I don't want the baby!

928
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,947
C-section tray. Prep her.

929
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:44,315
I don't want the baby! Please!

930
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,617
Heart rate's down to 20.

931
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:47,652
Please. Please help me!

932
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:48,886
Cleo, set up the suction.

933
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,122
No, I won't. Then
get out of the way!

934
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:53,658
Luka, she didn't consent.
You could lose your license.

935
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:55,443
10 blade!

936
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,811
You can't do this.

937
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,646
You can't.

938
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,262
Is it over?

939
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,855
Carter.

940
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:24,928
Got a minute?

941
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,742
No. I'm done with these.

942
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,028
If you don't want me to see
patients, I'm gonna go home.

943
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:32,618
Not yet. I need to talk to you.

944
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:35,250
Is this my suspension?

945
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,623
Not here. Come on.

946
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,554
Oh, God. Give
me a break. John...

947
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:57,688
Carter, just listen.

948
00:34:57,712 --> 00:34:58,706
Just hear it.

949
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,141
No, I told you.

950
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,509
I am on painkillers for my back.

951
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,810
But I'm functioning.

952
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,063
Dr. Carter?

953
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:08,621
You would be wise
to be quiet and listen.

954
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:14,939
My van is parked outside.

955
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:17,408
We have a ticket to Atlanta.

956
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:19,299
There's a drug rehab...

957
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:24,449
There's a drug
rehab center there

958
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:26,835
that specializes in treating
doctors with addiction.

959
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:27,969
Well, that's great,

960
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,670
but I'm on
prescribed painkillers,

961
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,172
and that doesn't
make me an addict,

962
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,340
and I think you all know it.

963
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,796
I'm not finished!

964
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:38,429
It's apparent to all of us
that you have a drug problem.

965
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:39,797
Therefore, we cannot allow you

966
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:41,599
to continue working here

967
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:43,318
or anywhere else as a physician.

968
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,770
So you have two choices.

969
00:35:45,794 --> 00:35:47,522
Get in the van,
go to the airport,

970
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,441
check yourself in.

971
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:52,527
And when you come back...

972
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,767
we will support you
in any way that we can.

973
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,454
Or I'm fired?

974
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,390
Yeah.

975
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:06,374
Everyone in this
room cares about you.

976
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,760
No one is judging you.

977
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:12,746
Yes you are. You've
already judged me.

978
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,415
You have no idea
what I've been through

979
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,616
these last few months.

980
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,135
But I've been here.
I've showed up.

981
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,604
I haven't made excuses.
I haven't complained.

982
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:20,805
That's not the point...

983
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:22,139
No, that is the point!

984
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:23,941
Can anybody tell
me that, uh... Uh...

985
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:26,205
that I have endangered patients?

986
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,013
I mean, can
anybody here say that

987
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:31,077
my performance has changed?

988
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,871
Hmm? That I'm
some kind of liability?

989
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,740
John... you put a patient

990
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,041
into anaphylactic shock

991
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:41,292
by giving her Bactrim,

992
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:44,095
when she told you that
she was allergic to it.

993
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,562
And you almost killed somebody

994
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:47,248
by leaving a guide
wire in their chest.

995
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,751
Is this about mistakes?

996
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,219
Hm?

997
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,586
Who here hasn't made a mistake?

998
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,255
Hell, I saved your
ass this afternoon.

999
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,474
John... you've demonstrated

1000
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:59,076
compulsive
drug-seeking behavior.

1001
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,211
When. Just tell me when.

1002
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:02,079
I think mainlining
fentanyl qualifies.

1003
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:04,648
Well, I didn't do that. You
want to call me a liar, fine.

1004
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,234
Call me a liar.
But I didn't do that.

1005
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,236
Okay, show us your wrists.

1006
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,659
Show us your wrists!

1007
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,399
Are we looking for track marks?

1008
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:18,685
Yeah.

1009
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:22,432
Well, there. See?

1010
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:24,735
Here. Want me to
roll up my sleeves?

1011
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:26,919
Take off your watch.

1012
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:35,312
Ah, you know... You know what?

1013
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,848
Forget it. Forget it.

1014
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:38,349
This is your only
chance, Carter.

1015
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:40,623
Great. I quit.

1016
00:37:43,477 --> 00:37:44,717
Well...

1017
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,160
Is that it?

1018
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,082
No.

1019
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,887
What are you doing?

1020
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,789
I don't need this.

1021
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,358
I've never needed this.

1022
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,360
I wanted to be a doctor,
I wanted to help people.

1023
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,228
But I don't need their damn job.

1024
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,662
Carter, you don't wanna do this.

1025
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,253
No, I'm not doing it. They are.

1026
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:15,619
Carter, wait! No!

1027
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:17,488
Carter, what are you
gonna do, piss it away?

1028
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,523
Everything you've
worked for? Eight years?!

1029
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,292
You're the ones
handing out ultimatums!

1030
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:22,860
Carter, you're
getting in that van!

1031
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,861
Like hell I am.

1032
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,029
You're not gonna do this!

1033
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,797
They tell you that I'm
some kind of junkie

1034
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:28,866
and you believe them? And
you come and ambush me.

1035
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,868
You're outta control.
If you can't see that...

1036
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,353
You're getting into that van.

1037
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,855
No. Get in the van.

1038
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,056
Don't touch me. Get in the...

1039
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,412
Don't touch me.

1040
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:39,916
Where does it end, man, huh?

1041
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,915
This week, fentanyl, next
week, you end up dead.

1042
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:45,533
Or worse. You end
up like your cousin,

1043
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,323
some babbling gork
in a nursing home.

1044
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,759
Carter, you want to
fight, that's cool, man.

1045
00:38:54,783 --> 00:38:57,416
But either way, you're
getting your ass in that van.

1046
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,541
It's all right, man.

1047
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,799
It's all right, Carter.

1048
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:33,781
Good job. That's good.

1049
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:34,999
He's crowning.

1050
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:36,000
Almost there, Gloria.

1051
00:39:36,024 --> 00:39:37,401
One more push should do it.

1052
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:40,004
Ready? And push.

1053
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,245
Push.

1054
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,199
The head is out.

1055
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:48,512
Okay. You can stop now.

1056
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,291
Clamp.

1057
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,110
And cut.

1058
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,212
Does she want to see him?

1059
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:24,036
Would you like to
see him, Gloria?

1060
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:27,490
No.

1061
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,758
You want me to pronounce him?

1062
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:35,481
No, I'll do it.

1063
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,492
Time of death, 19:47.

1064
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:00,184
Did he get on the plane?

1065
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,785
I don't know.
Peter hasn't called.

1066
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:02,886
Wonder what he said.

1067
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,522
Who knows? I just
hope Carter gets on.

1068
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,689
Yeah.

1069
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,925
Well! It's nice to
see the ER brain trust

1070
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:09,693
is diligently
working after-hours.

1071
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,961
Hello, Robert.

1072
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,130
The ICU is a zoo. Seems
nice and peaceful down here.

1073
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:14,365
Yep. Same old stuff.

1074
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,434
Yeah, fun never stops.
Elizabeth, Walt Newman,

1075
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,735
the intussusception
upstairs. What about him?

1076
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,037
Tried to reduce with an enema.

1077
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,621
Left a big mess.
We have to go in.

1078
00:41:23,298 --> 00:41:24,608
Now? Yeah.

1079
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,377
It's not quite as sexy
as snaking a bullet

1080
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,678
out of the heart,

1081
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:29,880
but it's a life-saving
procedure nonetheless.

1082
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,182
I'll be right up.

1083
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:32,486
Thank you.

1084
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,275
Good night, all.

1085
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:42,776
Guess I lost my ride.

1086
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,177
That's right.

1087
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,579
It's all right.
I'll take the El.

1088
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,580
You sure?

1089
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:47,882
Yeah. See you at home.

1090
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:50,283
I'll try not to wake
you. Good night, Kerry.

1091
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,473
Good night.

1092
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,954
You wanna go get something

1093
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,322
to eat or something?

1094
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,925
Uh, no. I-I think I'll wait
to hear that he got on.

1095
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:58,959
Okay. Well, call me.

1096
00:41:58,983 --> 00:41:59,960
Okay.

1097
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,995
Thanks.

1098
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,863
Uh, just a minute.
Uh, Dr. Weaver?

1099
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:03,864
Yeah.

1100
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,232
I've got Legal on line 3.

1101
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,867
They say to go ahead,

1102
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,411
the judge signed a court order.
