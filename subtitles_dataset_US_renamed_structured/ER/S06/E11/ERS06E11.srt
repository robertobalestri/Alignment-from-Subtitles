1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,555
<i>Has been bringing some snow</i>

2
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,623
<i>to the southern plains
and rain to Texas,</i>

3
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,459
<i>and it's heading
toward the northeast.</i>

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,993
<i>You see the trough here.</i>

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,596
<i>That's allowing some cold
air to come down tonight.</i>

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,398
<i>And then the snow, the
moisture intermingling with snows</i>

7
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,834
<i>in the western part of Kansas.</i>

8
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,052
<i>But this low that's moving
toward the northeast</i>

9
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:28,120
<i>is gonna pull up some
Gulf of Mexico moisture...</i>

10
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:29,155
Dad?

11
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,658
Hey, Mark. You're up early.

12
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:34,393
Might snow later.
Fifty percent chance.

13
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,962
Dad, it's a little loud.

14
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,164
You ought to have a door
to that bedroom of yours.

15
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:39,331
No, I don't want a door.

16
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:40,533
I can build you one.

17
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:42,234
Dad, I don't want a door.

18
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:43,758
Can you turn that thing down?

19
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:46,439
Hello?

20
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,041
Yeah. I know... I'm sorry.

21
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,831
My... My dad's visiting.

22
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:53,713
Yeah. No. Won't happen again.

23
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,548
Who the hell's
calling at this hour?

24
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,349
My neighbor. You woke her too.

25
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:00,341
It's no wonder. The walls in
this building are paper-thin.

26
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,690
By the way, we're out of coffee.

27
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:05,291
So I see.

28
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,460
There was only a
little dibble-dabble left.

29
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,495
Barely able to get a
cup out of it myself.

30
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,598
Well, I think I'll just get
dressed and go to work.

31
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:12,599
This early?

32
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:14,834
Yeah. This early.

33
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,535
I like that Weather Channel.

34
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:19,338
There's no sense in trying
to watch it in San Diego.

35
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,708
"Clear and sunny,
clear and sunny."

36
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:24,732
"Chance of a
cloud. Mostly sunny."

37
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:28,281
Hey, Chuny.

38
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,449
Carol, welcome back!

39
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:31,017
Thanks. How are the twins?

40
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,320
Oh, they're doing great. I
don't know how I'm gonna do.

41
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,987
This is my first whole
day without them.

42
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,656
Oh. Seems pretty quiet, though.

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,391
Actually, uh, no.

44
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,293
Oh, great. Back to work.
See you in a minute.

45
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,462
I'm right behind you.
They'll fix you up.

46
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:45,131
Vito Camporsero, 29, acrobat.
Rehearsing on the trapeze.

47
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:46,499
He slipped off the platform.

48
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,567
How far did he fall?

49
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,968
About five feet,
but he was up 50.

50
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,770
Yeah, but he caught
his armpit on the cable.

51
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:52,472
That's what saved
him. It's not so bad.

52
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,175
Carol, welcome back. Thanks.

53
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,078
Uh, deep laceration
to the left axilla,

54
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:01,848
three-liter blood
loss. BP's 60 palp.

55
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,151
Okay, ready, steady, lift.

56
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:06,786
Get four units of O-neg.

57
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,454
Hi, I'm Mark, you
must be the new nurse?

58
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:09,823
Hey, Mark. It's good to be back.

59
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:10,990
I need a pulse ox probe.

60
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,859
A gram of Ancef.

61
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,328
Got any water here? Does
anybody know anything about this?

62
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,629
No. I just got on.

63
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,231
All right, I'm gonna
go check it out.

64
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,382
Luka, are you all
right? All set, thanks.

65
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,952
Pressure is crashing.
Carol, prep for a subclavian.

66
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,404
Two liters on the rapid infuser.

67
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:25,422
Are you hurt?

68
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,557
Uh, no, it's Vito's blood.

69
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,859
Dominic carried
him down the ladder.

70
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,295
Pulse is 124.

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,596
Carol, the Betadine.

72
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,465
Oh, yeah. I got it.

73
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,967
It's okay if you're
a little rusty.

74
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,302
I'm fine, thank you.

75
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,437
I didn't know the
circus was in town.

76
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,490
Laceration of
the axillary artery.

77
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:45,875
I'm Dr. Romano from Surgery.

78
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,076
Hello.

79
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,645
Doctor, please help my brother.

80
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,747
Check the crits first. I
wasn't gone that long.

81
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,498
Okay. Absent wrist pulses.

82
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,517
Let's have a look.

83
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,535
Whoa!

84
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,569
Easy, easy!

85
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,604
You're hurting him!
Give him morphine!

86
00:02:58,628 --> 00:02:59,756
His pressure is too low.

87
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,840
Stop it, please.

88
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,009
Almost done. Hold on.

89
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,546
Doctor, please
step back a little bit!

90
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,248
Kovac, get these
guys out of here!

91
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,216
Okay. Okay... Stop, please.

92
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,054
Kovac... Hey!

93
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,840
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

94
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,774
Let go of me!
Hey, call Security!

95
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,027
What do you think you're
doing? Get your hands off me!

96
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,630
Put at least four
liters at every sink.

97
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,065
What's going on? Oh,
a water main broke.

98
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,967
They're gonna fix it,
but it could be a while.

99
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,301
You're not on till tonight.

100
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,403
I know. Valerie Page
called me at home.

101
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,905
The girl you ordered
the L-VAD for?

102
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,107
Yeah, they found a match.

103
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,908
She's on her way in
for a heart transplant.

104
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,343
That is great.

105
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,612
Carter, listen they're
getting stacked up at Chairs.

106
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,681
I'm sorry, I'm on
the code team today

107
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,750
and I just got paged
for a respiratory arrest

108
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,385
in the cafeteria that
was a false alarm.

109
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,720
Okay, what do we got?

110
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,723
Carter, your amoebic dysentery
patient just used the toilet.

111
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,092
So? No water? We can't flush.

112
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,093
Oh!

113
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,228
Well, sorry. I got another case.

114
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,198
Put the "Out of Order" sign
on the door. Call Housekeeping.

115
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,668
Amira, can you see if we can
get a couple of portable toilets

116
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:55,371
for the ambulance bay and
maybe some air freshener?

117
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,439
You have a lot of
calamities at this circus, huh?

118
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,075
No. No, not usually.

119
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,077
But, uh, Peng... She is afraid

120
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,879
that she won't be
able to perform tonight.

121
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,514
No, no. The
laceration is not bad.

122
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,216
No, tell her she'll be fine.

123
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,641
Thank you.

124
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,989
How did this happen?

125
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,957
Uh, one of the
platform, she broke.

126
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,860
A piece of wood fell
right on top of her.

127
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,363
Yes, but if the
wood fell from above,

128
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:24,600
how did it, uh, hit
the bottom of her foot?

129
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,482
Like this. You see?

130
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,983
Wow!

131
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,586
You know what? I think I'll
go see that circus of yours.

132
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,410
There's one of them.

133
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,620
Get him out of here.

134
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:53,713
My mother's had
Parkinson's almost 15 years.

135
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,015
Hm, has her condition
recently changed?

136
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,450
Well, in the past
couple of days,

137
00:05:57,474 --> 00:06:00,252
she's been so weak that
she can't use her walker.

138
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,888
I'm worried she had a stroke.

139
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:02,912
Hm.

140
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,959
Oh... Oh, no, no,
no, let us help.

141
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:07,594
No, I don't mind.
I do it every day.

142
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,661
Uh-huh.

143
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:12,120
Uh, good for my
health. Right, Mom?

144
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:16,051
To tell you the truth,
I... I'm a burden.

145
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,554
Louise has to lift me
onto the toilet and...

146
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,590
And s-sponge bathe me.

147
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,014
Oh, come on, Mom. Stop it.

148
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,479
She gets dizzy when she sits up.

149
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:27,981
Could it be her heart?

150
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,432
Well, we'll check.

151
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,803
Maybe... Maybe the
Parkinson's is... Is getting worse?

152
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,004
Well, I don't feel worse.

153
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,805
Well, you might not, Mrs. Duffy,

154
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,808
but I'm gonna examine
you, run some tests,

155
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,243
and find out what's going on.

156
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,663
You okay?

157
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,554
Oh, yeah. Fine.

158
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,902
Okay...

159
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,355
Carol, we got an IV
cefotaxime order for Exam Two.

160
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,356
I'll get to it when I can.

161
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,757
It's been in the
rack for an hour.

162
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,960
I just checked the rack.
Was it in the wrong slot?

163
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,894
Doesn't matter.
Lady's got pneumonia.

164
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,496
And this gentleman
has chest pain.

165
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,332
I can only do one
thing at a time.

166
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,300
Mark, I'm moving
as fast as I can.

167
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,669
I know you are, Carol. I
know it's your first day back

168
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,471
and I know you're
gonna take a little while

169
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,805
to get back into the flow.

170
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,008
Well, I don't think any of
my patients have suffered

171
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,110
from my being a little
rusty, as Dr. Kovac puts it.

172
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,379
I didn't mean to imply
that... Just give me the chart.

173
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,081
Why wasn't I paged
for the water crisis?

174
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,649
I mean, we have a comprehensive
plan for internal disasters.

175
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,119
I mean, I'm on the committee
that developed the protocol.

176
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,687
Well, there isn't
a crisis, Kerry.

177
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,356
We got two portable
toilets coming in.

178
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,092
We have plenty of bottled
water. Everything's under control.

179
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,660
Yes, except that the O.R.
can't sterilize the instruments.

180
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,464
They've canceled all surgery
and I've closed us to Trauma.

181
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,965
Well, that sounds
like a good idea.

182
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,067
If the patients can't
quite make it outside

183
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,203
or they don't want to
freeze their butts off,

184
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,805
we can use water from
the physical therapy pool.

185
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,141
A two-gallon dump
gives you a solid flush.

186
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,542
Ooh.

187
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,844
Careful, Kerry. Thanks
for the information, though.

188
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,747
Sure. That's good to know.

189
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,097
Hi! Hi.

190
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,401
Oh, God, I was just about
to have some pancakes

191
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,935
when my pager went off.

192
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,437
I about jumped out of my seat.

193
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,972
They said I had
one hour to get here.

194
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,107
I think this is news worth
missing breakfast for.

195
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:03,242
I'm so glad you called me.

196
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,910
I packed so fast I
forgot my slippers.

197
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:07,251
We'll get you a new pair
to go with your new heart!

198
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,682
Keeping up, Carol?

199
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,383
Oh, God.

200
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,519
Have you seen the old
records on my patient?

201
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,254
Yeah, the file
room's bringing them.

202
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,389
Did you fax his EKG
to his PMD? Yes.

203
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,425
Well, he said he'd call
me after he got them.

204
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,781
Well, maybe he's busy.

205
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,997
Ah, here's the
problem. Paper jam.

206
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,498
Fax it again, will you, Carol?

207
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:29,368
Anyone seen the x-rays
on that ankle in Exam Four?

208
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:30,937
Hm! Don't hold your breath.

209
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:33,039
Radiology can't process
the film without water.

210
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,807
Don't know how
long it's gonna be.

211
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:36,342
This water shortage keeps up,

212
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,944
some of us might
get out of here in time

213
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:39,212
to go grab something to eat.

214
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:41,013
Sounds like fun.

215
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,681
Yeah?

216
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,072
Have a good time.

217
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:50,023
Michael Mueller, 28. Had
a seizure while driving.

218
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,958
Crashed into a wall.
His air bags deployed.

219
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:53,993
He's post-ictal, good
BP, tachy at 120.

220
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,594
We were on our way
to a hockey practice

221
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,897
and he just started to shake.
Scared the crap out of me.

222
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,598
Curt Obarr, front
seat passenger.

223
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,534
He was up and walking
with a forehead lac.

224
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,636
Curt, you know if Michael's
had seizures before?

225
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,771
Not that I know of.

226
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,973
Okay, everybody, nice
and easy. On my count.

227
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,897
One, two, three.

228
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,443
Get a trauma panel.

229
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,245
C-spine, chest, and head CT.

230
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,647
They can't develop x-rays.

231
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,100
All right. Let's
get the fluoroscan.

232
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,802
Sinus tach, 130.
BP's 124 over 78.

233
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,222
Pupils are equal. Do you know if
he's had any medical problems?

234
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,791
Uh, he uses one of
those asthma inhalers.

235
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,227
Oh, old bruises. You guys
play pretty rough, huh?

236
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,795
He got checked
pretty bad last week.

237
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,731
Did he hit his head?
I don't think so.

238
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,165
Temp's normal, 98.8.

239
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
Whoa! Whoa! Let's roll him!

240
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,355
Add a theophylline level.

241
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,706
What's that?

242
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,831
Asthma medication. You
take too much, this can happen.

243
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:50,416
Louise? Hey.
Everything looks okay.

244
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,388
Head CT, EKG and the blood
tests are all essentially normal.

245
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:56,806
Then why can't she walk?

246
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,741
Hm, well, most likely
it's the Parkinson's.

247
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,051
But her neurologist can adjust
her medication as an outpatient.

248
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,355
C-could we talk outside?

249
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,690
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.

250
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,026
Then you're, uh, not
going to admit her?

251
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,928
Not when there's no reason to.

252
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,431
Look, please, I love my mother

253
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,368
but I can't take her
home and care for her

254
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,836
when she can't walk.

255
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,770
I mean, I'm just too exhausted.

256
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,623
Well, maybe you
need a home aide.

257
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:33,426
But I can't afford a home aide.

258
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,646
I mean, she needs to be in
the hospital for a few days

259
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,815
where she can adjust her meds
and... And get a little stronger.

260
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,451
Well, unfortunately, we
can't admit her for that.

261
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,420
I'm... I'm asking you, please.

262
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,091
I'm... I'm ju... I'm
just so tired right now.

263
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,261
It's been such a
difficult few weeks.

264
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,069
If... If... If she could just
stay for a couple of days...

265
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:02,021
Well, I... I wish I could
help you, but unfortunately

266
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:04,490
the hospital doesn't allow
for that kind of admission.

267
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:05,691
I'm really sorry.

268
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,715
Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,419
Okay, thanks.

270
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:15,034
These are...

271
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,568
"Ridiculous" would be one word.

272
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,304
That would be one word. Yes.

273
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,807
Best the gift shop had to
offer. Then I'll take them.

274
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:22,341
Thank you. You're welcome.

275
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:25,261
I got a hold of your mom
and she is on her way here.

276
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,263
And your dad is...

277
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,681
Not around. Never has been.

278
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,249
I know the story.

279
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,617
Hello. Hi.

280
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:34,119
Dr. Weaver. Valerie,
how are you doing?

281
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:36,455
Oh, the proverbial
"couldn't be better."

282
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,491
Good. Lucy, do
you have a minute?

283
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,848
Sure. Excuse us.
We'll be right back.

284
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:48,701
Um, I've looked over the
chart. And Valerie has a fever.

285
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,636
Her temperature is 100.9.

286
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,905
That's pretty low-grade.
That could just be a cold.

287
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,342
No, she needs to go on high-dose
immunosuppressive agents

288
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,444
so she won't reject
the new heart.

289
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,547
With a weakened immune
system, even a cold could be fatal.

290
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,082
What are you saying?

291
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,418
We need to notify the
transplant coordinator.

292
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,152
We may have to
decline the heart.

293
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:11,211
Uh, is there anything we can do?

294
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,195
It'll be their decision,
but in all likelihood,

295
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,630
I think that's what's
gonna happen.

296
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,333
I can't believe this.
She was so close.

297
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,535
Want me to tell her?

298
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,158
No. No, I'll tell her.

299
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,584
Shooting.

300
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:41,320
Yeah, definitely got a
fracture on your hand

301
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,489
just below the pinky.

302
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,993
You can move your hand
back. It's gonna need a cast.

303
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,528
I guess I'm lucky. It
could've been worse.

304
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:50,796
How's Curt?

305
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,564
Oh, he's fine.

306
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:56,368
His forehead's being
sutured up, and, uh...

307
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,538
Actually, I'm... I'm a
little concerned about you.

308
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,140
I feel fine.

309
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:02,708
You know, your
seizure was caused

310
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:04,610
by an overdose of theophyllin.

311
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:05,645
An overdose.

312
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:09,065
Were you trying
to, uh, hurt yourself?

313
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,966
No, I just...

314
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,735
You know, my asthma flares
up whenever I'm stressed out.

315
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,571
So I... I took a
few extra pills.

316
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,139
Stressed at work? At home?

317
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,244
I'm a... A landscaper. You
know, January's a tough time.

318
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,546
Work stops, the
bills don't, that's all.

319
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,947
Why the third degree?

320
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,534
Under the circumstances, I, uh...
I have to ask about depression.

321
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,505
Trust me, if I wanted to kill
myself, I'd find a better way.

322
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,972
All fixed up.

323
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,374
They figure out what was wrong?

324
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,776
Yeah. I... I took too
much asthma medicine.

325
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,778
Busted up my hand.

326
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:42,681
We're gonna have to find
somebody new to play left wing.

327
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,350
He gonna be okay?

328
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:45,739
Yeah. Should be.

329
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:49,955
Hey, how's the car?

330
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,125
It's totaled. Don't
worry, you're insured.

331
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,394
Is it all right to, uh, use
one of these things in here?

332
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,395
Sure.

333
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,114
I'll just get a rental.

334
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,715
When was the last
time you passed gas?

335
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,683
About an hour ago.
No fever or vomiting.

336
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,819
Well, Peter, I agree
with your assessment.

337
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,355
Mr. Hoyt... you
are full of stool.

338
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,223
Dr. Benton will see
that you get an enema.

339
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,025
Excuse me, Doctor...
Not now, we're busy.

340
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,327
Unless somebody's
dying, come back later.

341
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,596
Okay, Peter, who's next?

342
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,798
Splenectomy from
last week. Mr. Jabour.

343
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,700
Valerie Page is here
for a heart transplant.

344
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,902
Old news. The transplant
service already called me.

345
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,571
I stay informed. Then
you know she has a fever.

346
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,273
I wasn't aware of that. Did you
call the transplant coordinator?

347
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,109
Not yet. Peter,
call the coordinator.

348
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,978
Let her know we're
gonna pass on that heart.

349
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,579
You're not even
going to examine her?

350
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,748
What's the point? Can't
operate if there's a fever.

351
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,150
But her white count, chest
x-ray and urine are all normal.

352
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,752
Gold star for effort,
but in my book,

353
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,253
a fever still spells infection.

354
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,656
You're right, and I think it's
an infection of her L-VAD.

355
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,257
I did research on Medline,

356
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,244
and I found articles from
Pittsburgh and Stanford.

357
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,012
The treatment
is give antibiotics,

358
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,553
remove the device,
then give the new heart.

359
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,618
Peter, go work her up.

360
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,654
I'll talk to the
transplant service.

361
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:56,922
Miss Knight, you are like

362
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,657
a crazed Energizer
Bunny on this one.

363
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:01,059
You just keep going
and going and going...

364
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,796
Thank you. And
going and going...

365
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,898
Carol, we're out of I
and D kits in Exam Two.

366
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,365
I'll check the suture room.

367
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,502
No, I... I don't need one. I
just wanted to let you know.

368
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,871
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry,
Kerry. Big trauma came in.

369
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,773
I haven't been able to
check all my rooms yet.

370
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,341
Hey, no, I'm not
criticizing you.

371
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:18,177
I'll get to it as soon as I can.

372
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,846
It must be strange coming
back after being off for six weeks.

373
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,980
Not really.

374
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,882
I mean, if you need
to take an extra break...

375
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:24,917
Why would I need a break?

376
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,584
You might not be
getting enough sleep.

377
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,887
Oh, I'm getting plenty
of sleep. Thanks, Kerry.

378
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,192
Dr. Malucci, is there a problem?

379
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:34,656
Uh, yeah, chief. There is.

380
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,696
Check this out.

381
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,464
Dolison? Mm-hm.

382
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,934
Her husband's been popping
these puppies for three weeks.

383
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,436
Now he's vomiting blood.
What is this medication?

384
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,705
They're from Mexico.
Combo painkiller and steroid.

385
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,341
Anyone can buy
them. Unbelievable.

386
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,650
Okay, be sure ICU gets
him on a steroid taper.

387
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,397
Cleo. Yeah?

388
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,701
All right, so when I
said I was, uh, you know,

389
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,437
trying to get out of here early
and going to grab a bite to eat.

390
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,838
Yeah, I wish I
could get out early.

391
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,740
Mm-hm. So, what
if we made it later?

392
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,041
I never know when I can get out.

393
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,243
Yeah. Don't wait on me.

394
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,547
Uh-huh.

395
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,519
Carol?

396
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,650
You all right?

397
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:15,756
Oh, I'm fine.

398
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,636
You don't look fine.

399
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,340
No, really. I am really fine.

400
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,627
First day back must be tough.

401
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,378
Why don't you just leave?

402
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,448
No. I'm just gonna sit here
and I'm gonna have a good cry.

403
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,784
And then I'm gonna feel better.

404
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,124
It's what I do at home.

405
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:40,514
You see? I am...
I'm better already.

406
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,153
Thanks, Elizabeth.

407
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,934
Carol, are you okay?

408
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,003
Oh, I'm fine.

409
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:53,204
It's her first day back
She's a little overwhelmed.

410
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:54,305
I don't blame her.

411
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,274
Between the diapers
and the dishes...

412
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,210
The feedings. Laundry.

413
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:59,912
Then come for a 12-hour shift.

414
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,513
I don't know how she'll do it?

415
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,549
Staying focused with patients.

416
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:07,525
All she wants to think
about are her babies.

417
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,982
Carol, if there's
anything we can do...

418
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,251
Okay.

419
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:23,986
I'm really confused.

420
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,787
You were all set to
cancel the transplant,

421
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,390
and now you say I
can have the heart?

422
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,360
With a driveline infection, you
need a day or two of antibiotics

423
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,263
before you can
get the transplant.

424
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,464
So I lose the heart after all.

425
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,467
Not necessarily. You
have a very low fever.

426
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,502
And we think that we
can clear up the infection

427
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:45,174
with a few doses of antibiotics
and still do the transplant.

428
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,518
What if the
antibiotics don't work?

429
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,628
Worst case?

430
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,346
Yeah. Worst case.

431
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,055
After surgery you could develop
a life-threatening infection.

432
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,474
What would you do?

433
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,476
It's your decision, Valerie.

434
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,700
I know, but would
you have the surgery?

435
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,481
The risk is small.

436
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,972
And you've waited a long time.

437
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,742
I would go for it.

438
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,178
How long have you
and Curt been together?

439
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,846
A while. Yeah, everything okay?

440
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,748
Yeah.

441
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,751
What happens when
the two of you fight?

442
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,620
What makes you think we fight?

443
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,590
Well, everybody has arguments.

444
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:39,516
You got bruises, stressed out.
You OD'd on your medication.

445
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,519
I'm just trying to
put it all together.

446
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,906
It's not uncommon for...

447
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,279
fights to turn physical.

448
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,862
People don't mean for
it to happen. It just does.

449
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,719
No, no. I... I know they don't.

450
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,233
Something just sets it off.

451
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:02,322
That ever happen to you?

452
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,020
I forgot to pick up
the dry cleaning.

453
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,530
He, uh... He hit me, and...

454
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,765
and he said he was sorry

455
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,070
and he promised
he'd never do it again.

456
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,392
Has he?

457
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,113
So there have been other times.

458
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah.

459
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:33,731
I'd like you to talk
to a social worker.

460
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,373
You know, they have experience
at dealing with these things.

461
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,611
Okay?

462
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,315
I don't know. I don't know.

463
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:47,801
Dr. Corday?

464
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,750
Lindsey, how are you?

465
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,218
I'm all right.

466
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:57,277
Um, it was my sister's
funeral yesterday.

467
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,498
I just... I wanted to thank you.

468
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,218
You really don't have to.

469
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,583
The police said that, um,

470
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,826
that he finally told you
where he left Jenny.

471
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,230
Yes.

472
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,950
I'm... I'm trying to forget him.

473
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,998
I... I just hear his
voice all the time.

474
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:27,102
And it's very gentle.

475
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,092
But it's just saying
these awful things.

476
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,457
Now, you listen to me.

477
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,459
That's what he wanted.

478
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,527
To make you suffer.

479
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,163
But you don't let him win.

480
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:42,067
Now, he's nothing. He
can't hurt you anymore.

481
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,258
I know. I know.

482
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,747
It's okay.

483
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:58,317
How long is the operation?

484
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,618
Four, five hours.

485
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,220
Do they let med students watch?

486
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:05,057
Only if they're on
the transplant service.

487
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:06,691
So that means
that you can't stay?

488
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:09,527
Nah, I'm gonna talk them
into making an exception.

489
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,551
Thanks. Yeah.

490
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,898
Oh, will you do
me a favor? Sure.

491
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,667
I forgot to feed Spoony. Spoony?

492
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,235
It's my cat. Will
you tell my mom?

493
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,803
Yes. Okay.

494
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,872
I'm gonna go change.

495
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,128
I'll see you.

496
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,204
Can I have a moment with him?

497
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,113
I knew you'd come.

498
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,114
Did you?

499
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,570
Mm-hm.

500
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,217
You know, when I woke up

501
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,453
and I found you hadn't done
what you'd said you'd do,

502
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,805
I was glad.

503
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:58,715
The fact that you were a coward
never even occurred to me.

504
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,768
Your conscience
is bothering you.

505
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,892
Isn't it?

506
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,375
It is, actually.

507
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,719
Why? Because
you nearly killed me?

508
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,064
Or because you
didn't have the guts to?

509
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,801
Because I enjoyed the
power I had over you.

510
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:25,203
When I could've let you
bleed to death at the crash.

511
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,405
When your heart stopped
while I was operating.

512
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,641
When the morphine
took you under.

513
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,142
I held your every
breath in my hands

514
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,501
and I so wanted to repay
some of the pain you'd caused.

515
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:42,687
But then I looked at
your sad little body.

516
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,057
And I saw what a
pathetic man you are.

517
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:49,127
And I realized I didn't
want power over you at all.

518
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:51,262
That my job, for
better or worse,

519
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,933
was simply to put
you back together.

520
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,402
See, I don't give a damn
if you go to the chair

521
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,439
or if you spend the
rest of your life in prison.

522
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,873
My job's done.

523
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:06,033
You were my patient, you
were sick, you're better.

524
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,436
Goodbye, Mr. Rollins.

525
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,137
You can take him now.

526
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,672
Come back here!

527
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,064
I haven't finished with you
yet! Get back here, Corday!

528
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,366
Corday!

529
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,668
Do you have any chest
pain? Shortness of breath?

530
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:31,102
Maybe a little lightheaded.

531
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,436
Oh, my God. What happened?

532
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,438
The parking lot attendant's
idea of a code blue.

533
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:35,840
What? She slipped on the ice.

534
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:37,776
I was helping Mom into the car.

535
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,343
My wheelchair fell over.

536
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,379
Did you hit your head
or lose consciousness?

537
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:43,148
Louise? Did she
lose consciousness?

538
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,817
I don't think so, but I
fell first so I don't know.

539
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,218
Put her on a monitor.

540
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,452
You want this one, Dr. Chen?

541
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:49,620
I just discharged her.

542
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,189
I believe in continuity of care.

543
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:53,391
No head trauma, check
her hips and pelvis. Bye.

544
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:55,193
I'm so sorry, Mom.

545
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:56,194
I'm all right.

546
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,229
Her BP is 170/95.

547
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:59,230
Is that bad?

548
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,765
It's a little high.

549
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:03,501
How about we get a CBC,
chem panel, cardiac enzymes,

550
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,170
EKG and postural vitals?

551
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,938
I'm fine.

552
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:09,307
I'm just so... So tired.

553
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,126
What was, uh, she here for?

554
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,713
Weakness. Exacerbation
of Parkinson's.

555
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,581
She hasn't been able
to walk for three days.

556
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:19,690
It's harder for me
to take care of her.

557
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,976
Her head CT was normal.

558
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,660
I see.

559
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,230
Right atrial
cannulation is complete.

560
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:33,531
Umbilical tape?

561
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,132
How long does the L-VAD stay on?

562
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:36,167
Until we go on bypass.

563
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:37,301
Great.

564
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,671
Aortic cannula's looking good.

565
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,928
Here we go. Kill the air pump.

566
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,209
Clamp the aortic graft, Peter.

567
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,279
Okay. And got it.

568
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:49,669
Open the venous line.

569
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,285
Anyone looking for a heart?

570
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:55,953
You're early, Shirley.

571
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:57,255
Making me look bad.

572
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,457
Sorry, Dr. Hanover.
Take it up with the FAA.

573
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,558
Is it too early?

574
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,316
No, no, no. It can
wait on ice for a while.

575
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:06,148
Wow! That's her new heart.

576
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,116
Yeah.

577
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,906
It sure is.

578
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:12,754
He denied everything?

579
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,756
Claimed the boyfriend
never even touched him.

580
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,190
I thought he was ready to talk.

581
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,660
Well, it's not uncommon for
victims to change their minds.

582
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,829
He probably loves the guy
and wants to protect him.

583
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,998
Yeah, or he's afraid. You
gonna be around all day?

584
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,266
Yeah. Why? Thinking about
making another run at him?

585
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,835
Maybe. Great,
well, give ma a call.

586
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,236
Okay, thanks. Uh-huh.

587
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,871
Carol, how are you feeling?

588
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,606
Four hours and 43 minutes to go.

589
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,675
You know, counting the
minutes is not a good sign.

590
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,510
Can someone take
this ingrown toenail?

591
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,612
She's been whining for
over an hour. A real bitch.

592
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,080
Carol.

593
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,682
The woman is
exhausted. I know that.

594
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,483
So she needs a break. I can't.

595
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,152
How's the parking
lot? They lived.

596
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,454
You can't? Or you won't? Both.

597
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,156
Just say that you're
ruling out a stroke.

598
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,659
I can't lie about a diagnosis.

599
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,861
Sometimes we make
what's called a judgment call.

600
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,129
If the rules need to be bent
a little bit, we bend them.

601
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,699
I bent them last week, John,
remember? And got into trouble.

602
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,568
Look, if you're afraid
of getting yelled at

603
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,369
then maybe you're in
the wrong department.

604
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,972
Listen, everybody
does soft admits.

605
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,274
It's just part of the drill.

606
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,844
Look, I know what you're
saying, but I'm not admitting her.

607
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,948
She's my patient. It's my call.

608
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,550
Okay. Okay, you're right.

609
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,151
Yeah? Not about the patient.

610
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,286
I don't agree with you.

611
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,923
But you gotta do
whatever you think is best.

612
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,925
Well, thanks for your input.

613
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,293
Anytime.

614
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,551
Hey, Amira? I need a
telemetry bed for Louise Duffy.

615
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,866
Wait. You're
admitting the daughter?

616
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,069
Yeah. Her hypertension's
out of control.

617
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,237
I want to rule out an MI.

618
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,655
You're kidding, right?

619
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,757
She's sinkable. She
might have unstable angina.

620
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:41,159
She slipped on some
ice. You said so yourself.

621
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,911
Well, it's my
patient. It's my call.

622
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,780
And where's the
mother supposed to go?

623
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:47,487
That's your patient.
That's your call.

624
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,486
You must have misunderstood.

625
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,688
A bunch of us got into
a fight at the hockey rink.

626
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,657
Michael, we both know
you're not gonna be safe

627
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,425
until you get out
of this relationship.

628
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,093
Ah, I'll wear more
pads next time.

629
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,764
Most domestic homicides
have a history of physical abuse.

630
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,231
Now you're trying to scare me?

631
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,901
Yes. You need to
get away from him.

632
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,245
Okay, I got the
rental. We're all set.

633
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,073
You okay? Yeah, fine.

634
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,609
Is he ready to go? No,
we need to get a CT scan.

635
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,610
What for?

636
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,978
He had previous head trauma.

637
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,363
I told him we play
a lot of hockey.

638
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,032
I want to clear him medically
before he plays again.

639
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,233
Uh, I'd like to take him home.

640
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:23,801
Michael, I think
you should stay.

641
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,970
I want you to understand
the risk that's involved.

642
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,155
He understands them.

643
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,156
I'm not so sure.

644
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,724
Curt, why don't we
let Dr. Greene...?

645
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,748
Mike, shut up.

646
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,095
If you need him to sign
something, he'll sign it.

647
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,530
Won't you, Mike?

648
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,748
Yeah.

649
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:39,572
You don't have to
go. It's your decision.

650
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,705
Thanks. Uh... Uh, I
feel better now, really.

651
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,361
We should get home. Yeah.

652
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,878
One more dispo
and I'm out of here.

653
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,146
What's that?

654
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,981
All that's left in the
vending machine.

655
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,650
What's wrong with the cafeteria?

656
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,319
No water. Can't cook.

657
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,421
Then don't eat.
That stuff will kill you.

658
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,888
Has anyone seen Chuny?

659
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,024
I've been waiting a
half hour for a translator.

660
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,192
Sorry.

661
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,428
What's the problem?
Father-daughter combo

662
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,530
present with aplastic anemia.

663
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:09,731
Both of them?

664
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,300
Yeah. Strange. No
history of toxic exposure.

665
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,401
Yeah, let me see.

666
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,804
Bone marrow's not making squat.

667
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:16,971
They in there?

668
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,740
Yeah. Why?

669
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:19,808
What are you doing?

670
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:20,964
I got a hunch.

671
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,979
<i>Hola. Soy</i> Dr. Dave.

672
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,954
Dave, what are
they saying? Hold on.

673
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:48,069
Son of a bitch!

674
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,159
What is it?

675
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:56,749
Ah,<i> gracias.</i>

676
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,998
What are they saying?

677
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:02,200
Last month they got a
bunch of shots for their colds.

678
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:03,768
Did you get the
name of the doctor?

679
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,603
No doctor. They
went to a pharmacy.

680
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:07,205
What kind of
pharmacist gives a shot?

681
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:09,007
Oh, the bad kind.
It's a back-room clinic.

682
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:10,675
They smuggle
drugs up from Mexico.

683
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:12,093
Oh, God!

684
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,662
Mm-hm. Plenty of stuff that
could give you aplastic anemia.

685
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,230
What are you doing?

686
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,765
They gave me the address.

687
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,851
Wait a minute. Hold on.
We should call the police.

688
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:23,154
Yeah. They see a squad
car, they'll bolt in two seconds.

689
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,522
Cleo, we could use you out here.

690
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:27,075
Go ahead. I got this.
Dave, these are my patients.

691
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,019
I can handle it.
Yeah, they're all yours.

692
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,329
What are you going to
do? Don't worry about it.

693
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,597
Trevor, my name is Carol

694
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,767
and we're gonna take
good care of you, sweetheart.

695
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,869
Femur fracture? Auto
versus pedestrian.

696
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,671
No head trauma.
He was all by himself.

697
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,539
Call my mom. We
already have, sweetheart.

698
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,107
Someone call Housekeeping!

699
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:47,128
Amira, can you call Ortho
about that trimalleolar in four?

700
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,097
Are you gonna be able
to walk? Yeah, I'm good.

701
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,401
I'll pull the car around.

702
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:55,887
Water's all hooked up.

703
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:56,955
Oh, finally!

704
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:58,289
Somebody has to sign this.

705
00:29:58,313 --> 00:30:00,758
Dr. Greene, would you mind
signing for the water, please?

706
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:01,759
Sure. Why not?

707
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:02,994
Is the water turned back on?

708
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,996
Not yet. Gotta
check the pressure.

709
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,297
I'll be in the ambulance bay.

710
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:07,531
Hey, Dr. Greene,

711
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,700
can we page an individual
beeper on the code team?

712
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,004
If you know the number.

713
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,856
Isuprel's down to
four mics per minute.

714
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,291
Less than 50 cc's from
the mediastinal tube.

715
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,026
Wow! What?

716
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,696
That's weird. There's someone
else's heart keeping her alive.

717
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,431
Yeah, kind of cool, huh? Yeah.

718
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,999
Makes you wanna be a surgeon?

719
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,000
Vent settings?

720
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:30,538
Tidal volume: 700.14.02.5.

721
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,524
Shouldn't she be
breathing on her own soon?

722
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:35,215
Uh, general anesthesia
lasts longer in some patients.

723
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:41,621
Dr. Benton, her gaze
is deviated to the right.

724
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,710
Valerie, squeeze my hand!

725
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,995
We're going to CT. Call
Radiology. Lucy, unhook her.

726
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,870
Let's bag her. Let's go!
Come on, people! Let's move!

727
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,834
You sure you paged
the right number?

728
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,586
I hope so.

729
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,610
He's coming! He's coming!

730
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,601
Oh, my God! John,
are you all right?

731
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,103
Oh! Are you all right?

732
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,571
Yeah.

733
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:21,038
Now, that's a 10.

734
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:23,102
Looking good there, Carter.

735
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,694
So no code?

736
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:26,728
Mm. No code.

737
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,129
You okay?

738
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,448
Oh, that's very funny.
I could've killed myself.

739
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,901
Oh, it's payback time.
Just take it like a man.

740
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,005
Payback for what?
For blackmailing me.

741
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:38,644
I admitted Mrs. Duffy.

742
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:41,092
Really?

743
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,626
You're surprised?

744
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,195
You think I'm so heartless,

745
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:46,597
I'd ship an old lady to a
nursing home against her will?

746
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:49,200
I thought you were heartless
to discharge her the first time.

747
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:51,602
Oh, John, if I were
really heartless,

748
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:52,904
I wouldn't bother to tell you

749
00:31:52,928 --> 00:31:55,728
that you've got toilet
paper stuck to your shoe.

750
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,574
What was that?

751
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:04,070
Somebody help!

752
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:08,319
What happened?

753
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,022
He was trying to put
our stuff in the trunk!

754
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:12,357
We should move him!

755
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:14,125
Not till we get a
backboard and a C-collar.

756
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,593
Yeah, it looks
like a flail chest.

757
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,612
Malik, go get an airway
kit and get Dr. Greene.

758
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,746
You got it.

759
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,782
And tell the driver
to turn this water off!

760
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,367
I thought I had
it in first gear.

761
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,119
It just went backwards!

762
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,320
He's not moving much air!

763
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,721
Oh, my God, I'm sorry!

764
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,065
Don't worry, bud. We
got it. Just stand back.

765
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,229
Guy's gonna need a
couple of chest tubes.

766
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,597
I'll intubate. 80 tube.

767
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,099
Michael, you need
to wait out here.

768
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,467
I'm losing the pulse!

769
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,435
Okay. Set up the rapid infuser

770
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,459
and prep for a thoracotomy.

771
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,142
Decreased breath.

772
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,643
Prep both sides of the chest.

773
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,077
Did he just back into him?

774
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,447
Yeah. He actually pinned
him up against the water truck.

775
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,448
Tachy at 128.

776
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,782
Pressure's down to 70.

777
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,618
Let me have the 10 blade.

778
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,586
Set up two Thora-Seals
and two suction lines.

779
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,789
Okay, I'm in. Bag him.

780
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,458
32 French. Let's go. Let's go.

781
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,859
Curved Kelly.

782
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,528
Pulse ox dropping to 82.

783
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,929
Okay, mine's in. Hook it up.

784
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:09,930
Uh, chest tube.

785
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,499
Thora-Seal's not bubbling.

786
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:12,667
Pressure's down to 60.

787
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,402
Hold on. There's no suction.

788
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,704
All right. Try the other one.

789
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,905
Nope.

790
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,174
What's going on?

791
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,176
Wall suction's generated
by the flow of water.

792
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,560
No water, no suction.

793
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,328
Chuny, go down to Central

794
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:25,814
and get a portable suction.

795
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:26,815
Run.

796
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,116
I'm in.

797
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,151
Pulse ox, 75.

798
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,587
Systolic's 50. We need
to re-expand his lungs.

799
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,223
Well, we're waiting on suction.

800
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,391
What about, uh...? What
about that vacuum cleaner?

801
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,459
What?

802
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,961
Yeah, the guy was
using it at Admit.

803
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,112
Lydia? Got it.

804
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:43,498
We'll need something
to make a seal.

805
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,083
Something like clay.

806
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,367
Merocel sponges.

807
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,086
Yeah, we'll need
about 20 of them.

808
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,787
He's bradying down.

809
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:51,623
Amp of atropine.

810
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:52,624
Get the crash cart.

811
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:53,992
Found him. He was down the hall.

812
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,960
Bring him down and get me water.

813
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:58,229
Lost his pulse. We're in P.E.A.

814
00:33:58,253 --> 00:33:59,714
Okay, amp of epi.

815
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,204
Start chest compressions.

816
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,574
Sats are down to 72.

817
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,821
Okay, pour it.

818
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,480
Keep going, keep going, keep
going, keep going, keep going.

819
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,199
Okay. Okay, here we
go. Hold compressions.

820
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,544
Yep.

821
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,995
I hear breath sounds.

822
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:32,835
Pulse ox up to 85.

823
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,004
Ninety-two.

824
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,790
Good save.

825
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,856
Dr. Romano... Just
a second, Ms. Knight.

826
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,248
Thanks, Peter.

827
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,455
It was a stroke.

828
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,236
Yes.

829
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,072
They tried streptokinase but
couldn't open up the vessel.

830
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:17,016
Can she recover? Truth?

831
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,482
She's in a permanent
vegetative state.

832
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,448
It was the L-VAD, wasn't
it? We don't know for sure.

833
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:26,551
Threw a clot to her brain.
Don't blame yourself.

834
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:28,485
This is not your fault.

835
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:30,989
I'm the one who put
the thing in, remember?

836
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,908
We make these medical
decisions all the time.

837
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,648
Nothing is risk-free.

838
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,646
I better go talk to her mother.

839
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,947
Yeah. Oh, hold on.

840
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,950
Uh, UNOS has identified

841
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,141
a potential recipient
in Milwaukee.

842
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:47,754
What are you talking about?

843
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,890
A domino heart procedure.

844
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,876
We take out Valerie's new heart

845
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,578
and give it to someone
else who needs it.

846
00:35:53,602 --> 00:35:55,818
You need to get
consent from the family.

847
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,385
But she'll...

848
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,193
She is already
dead, Miss Knight.

849
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,548
Wait, where's he going?

850
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,883
Four east, ICU.

851
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,151
All right. Thanks.

852
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,186
Is he gonna be okay?

853
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,210
We'll see.

854
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,722
You want to tell
me what happened?

855
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,091
He... He asked
me to pop the trunk

856
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,459
so he could put the bags in.

857
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,660
Then I was trying to pull
forward to give him room.

858
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,630
I thought I had
it in first but I...

859
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,099
You went backwards.

860
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:33,523
It's just... I... I'm not
used to driving a stick.

861
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,091
I thought they'd have to
admit me for hypothermia.

862
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,427
Do you want to use this?

863
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,484
I'm okay.

864
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,297
Cool trauma.

865
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:50,133
Yeah, it's not so bad when
two doctors work together.

866
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,592
Assess the patient, come
up with a plan of action.

867
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:00,545
John, are you still angry

868
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:02,513
about the way I handled
Louise and Mrs. Duffy?

869
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:03,681
No.

870
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:05,483
Then you're mad
about the practical joke?

871
00:37:05,507 --> 00:37:06,984
No, I like a good
joke now and again.

872
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:08,553
You know, I'm just disappointed

873
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:11,956
that you couldn't come right out
and admit you made a mistake.

874
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,427
That your way of dealing with
it was to devise some silly gag.

875
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,929
You're right. You know, Deb,

876
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:20,030
things are gonna go a lot
easier for you around here

877
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:21,699
if you just deal
with things honestly.

878
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:24,435
John... Thank you.

879
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:27,393
Oh, and, um, no
more practical jokes.

880
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:29,796
That's a good idea.

881
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,606
She said yes.

882
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,375
Hey, Lucy.

883
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,965
I'm sorry.

884
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,473
Dr. Chen, I got x-rays
on that belly pain in One.

885
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,907
Finally.

886
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,476
The water's back
for almost an hour.

887
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,743
What takes them so long?

888
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:23,899
I don't know.

889
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,148
Oh, my God!

890
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,149
What?

891
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,018
My patient ate nails!

892
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,543
Chuny, call O.R and get
Surgery down here right now.

893
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,495
What are you doing?

894
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,281
So you made it
through the day, huh?

895
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,382
Just about.

896
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,050
Carol, good to have
you back! Thanks.

897
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,752
You're lucky to be
alive, you know that?

898
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:50,521
Hey, Malucci. What did you do?

899
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:53,190
Uh, nothing, chief. It
was just a sucker punch...

900
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,558
Any broken bones?

901
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,694
Short a few brain cells,
but otherwise okay.

902
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,562
Okay. Guard with
your left next time.

903
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,018
Right. Thanks, chief.

904
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,000
So anyway, I go in. I tell
him I have a sore throat.

905
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:06,370
The guy doesn't
even look in my mouth.

906
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:07,404
Dipyrone.

907
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,805
The FDA banned
this 20 years ago.

908
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:11,375
I know. It gets better. Then he
brings out a vial and a syringe.

909
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:14,412
Wants to give me a
shot. Chloramphenicol.

910
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,296
You didn't. What do
you think, I'm stupid?

911
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,764
I grabbed the vial, and I ran.

912
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,301
That's pretty much when
things got a little violent, so...

913
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,501
Hope it was worth it.

914
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,621
I got evidence now.
They're going down.

915
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,739
Hey, excuse me,
Cleo, you got a minute?

916
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,408
Sure.

917
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,648
Hold that.

918
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,567
So, you, uh...? You
gonna be able to get off?

919
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:38,602
Yeah, looks like it.

920
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,003
You wanna go grab some dinner?

921
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:41,371
Where you guys going?

922
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:42,990
Actually, it's just you and me.

923
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,559
What happened to everybody else?

924
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,126
That's what I was
trying to explain.

925
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,484
Peter, are you asking me out?

926
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,387
Yeah.

927
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,570
What do you think?

928
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,738
He's pretty shaken up.

929
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,873
Yeah.

930
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,775
He had a seizure? That's right.

931
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:03,076
Well, they revoke your
driver's license for seizures.

932
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,579
You cleared him to drive?
Yeah. He doesn't have epilepsy.

933
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,281
Too much asthma medicine.

934
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,617
But he didn't have any
in his system when he left.

935
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,820
Okay. Anything
else I should know?

936
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,555
No. That's it.

937
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,779
Okay, thanks.

938
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,499
Hey. Everything okay?

939
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,219
Police seem satisfied
with your story.

940
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:31,372
Yeah. I guess you
got what you wanted.

941
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,406
How's that?

942
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,997
I'll be safe at home tonight.

943
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:39,162
The social worker's
gonna be around.

944
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,564
Why don't the
three of us talk...?

945
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:43,256
No. No, I'm... Yeah,
I'm all right now.

946
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,370
Dr. Greene, your
pops is on line two.

947
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:48,372
He locked himself
out of your apartment.

948
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:50,807
Okay, Malik.

949
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:53,866
Thanks, Dr. Greene. I, uh,
appreciate your encouragement.

950
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:11,395
Lucy, you look
like you're freezing.

951
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,197
What?

952
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,900
It started snowing, and you
look like you are very, very cold.

953
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:17,056
I am.

954
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:21,471
No, no. That's okay.

955
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:22,706
No, come on.

956
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,009
I'm European. We like
to be gallant, you know?

957
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:26,033
Thanks.

958
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:32,383
So are you off?

959
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,952
I've got two tickets
for the circus.

960
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,176
No. Actually, I'm
just coming on.

961
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:40,991
Then what were you
doing here all day?

962
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,415
Not enough, as it turns out.

963
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,363
It's never been very
easy for me to be here.

964
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,603
Sometimes I felt like
I would never fit in.

965
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,127
That's something I know about.

966
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,997
But then I... I
moved around a lot.

967
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,756
And now I'm... I'm used to it.

968
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,639
But at the beginning
of every day,

969
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,141
I've been grateful
that I'm walking in here

970
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,476
of my own choosing,

971
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,940
and I'm not carried
in on some gurney.

972
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:21,832
And at the end of every day,

973
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:24,568
if I've helped just one person,

974
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,675
it's been worth it.

975
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:35,000
And that didn't happen
today. And it makes me sad.

976
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:40,072
Hey, your day is not over.

977
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,121
Maybe this is your one person.

978
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,190
I doubt it.

979
00:42:46,214 --> 00:42:48,548
Yes, but, uh, let's
see if I'm right, huh?

980
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:52,713
And miss the circus?

981
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:57,273
You know what? I have had
enough circus for today, huh?

982
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:00,359
Come on.

983
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:05,275
What have you got?

984
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,911
Paul Galinski, 36. Put a
snowmobile into a tree.

985
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:09,947
Ejected with multiple
facial fractures.

986
00:43:09,971 --> 00:43:12,215
Tried but couldn't tube
him. Too much blood.

987
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,984
He's all yours.
You can intubate.

988
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,452
Looks like a difficult one.

989
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:17,154
Yeah. I'll talk you through it.

990
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,789
Have you ever used
a...? A trach light?

991
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:19,790
No.

992
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:21,280
Okay. I'll show you how.
