1
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,760
Hey, can I give you
a hand with that?

2
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,329
Oh, thanks, John.

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,065
Paid a fortune for it and
the damn thing's stuck.

4
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,334
No problem, as long as I
can sneak under a corner of it.

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,469
I left mine at the
house on my way out.

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,738
Ooh, I hate coming in
to work in the morning

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,872
when it's still dark.

8
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,493
That doesn't look promising.

9
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:37,530
Yeah, perfect start to what's
bound to be a perfect day!

10
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,332
We got a 93-year-old
woman with COPD.

11
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,301
Increased wheezing
due to smoke inhalation,

12
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:42,768
with no evidence
of facial burns.

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,737
BP's 134 over 92, pulse 96.

14
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,140
Give her five albuterol,
get her on a pulse ox,

15
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:48,274
and order chest films.

16
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,342
What's going on?

17
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:51,077
Oh, there was a fire
in a nursing home.

18
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,179
There weren't enough
people there to get 'em out.

19
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:54,965
Carter, can you get
this last ambulance?

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,667
MAN 1:90-year-old with
tachypnea and altered mental status.

21
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,768
BP's 95 over 60.

22
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,136
No singed nasal hairs.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,322
They're sending us
two more, one critical.

24
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:04,557
Full thickness burns.
Who's on the desk?

25
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:06,826
Nobody. Steve's sick,
and Randi left at 6:30.

26
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,645
She didn't wait for
her replacement?

27
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,879
I am not her keeper.

28
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,280
If you wanna
bitch, bitch at her.

29
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,782
Haleh, I need you.

30
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,383
Oh, and Jeanie called.

31
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,727
She's not coming
in today either.

32
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,474
Got basketball practice, or
are you coming straight home?

33
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,443
- I have practice.
- You ready?

34
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,711
Yeah.

35
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:25,879
Good morning. Morning.

36
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,280
Where's your backpack?

37
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:28,465
Mm-hm.

38
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,766
It's in the upstairs bathroom

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,267
on top of the toilet,
and you dumped

40
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,235
your basketball stuff
on the basement steps.

41
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,804
If you want it to end
up in the washer,

42
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,872
you put it in the basket.

43
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,439
She can hit a
20-foot fading jumper,

44
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,864
but she can't get within
10 yards of the hamper.

45
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,578
Yeesh.

46
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,468
You got a minute? Not really.

47
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,205
Yeah, uh...

48
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,310
Carla told me that
Reece might not be mine.

49
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,914
What are you gonna do?

50
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,261
I don't know.

51
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,031
I don't know that I believe her,
with everything that's going on.

52
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,568
That bitch. What the
hell is the matter with her?

53
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,537
Jackie. Look... No. No.

54
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,039
Everything she's
put you through,

55
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,343
and she isn't even sure?

56
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:15,495
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,930
But I don't know what's worse.

58
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,197
That she's always known,

59
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,581
or she's just doing
this to get Reece?

60
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,485
Well, I got a paternity test.

61
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,454
I, uh... I haven't taken it yet.

62
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,855
How long does it take?

63
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,807
I don't know. I don't
know that I'm gonna do it.

64
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,197
You have to.

65
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,783
What if I'm not his father, huh?

66
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,448
What are you gonna do,
wait till he gets older, Peter?

67
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,216
He's bound to find
out. Yeah, I know. I...

68
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,517
Yeah, and then he's gonna know

69
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,070
that you've lied to him.

70
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,583
Hi. Hi.

71
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:44,651
What do you want?

72
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:45,652
Well, I called,

73
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,654
but the phone just kept ringing.

74
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:49,456
I don't always hear
it, it's down the hall.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,774
I gotta get to work.

76
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,441
Are you still working
at the pharmacy?

77
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,577
Yeah. Pay sucks, but
the hours are good.

78
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,880
Well, look, your tests
came back after you left.

79
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,381
You gotta come
back to the hospital

80
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,017
and get treated for
the bladder infection.

81
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,819
A bladder infection
can be very dangerous

82
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,154
when you're pregnant.

83
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,688
I'll come by as soon as I can.

84
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,223
Have you given any more thought

85
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,025
to the detox program?

86
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,726
You know, you really have to.

87
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,863
Yeah, I stopped using
about, uh, five days ago.

88
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:14,864
Oh, good for you.

89
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,021
Yeah, thanks again.

90
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,003
Yeah, I don't give a damn
how many patients you've got.

91
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,672
Excuse me. Hey, you know what?

92
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,840
We are drowning here,

93
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,275
and I need some
qualified bodies.

94
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,211
Excuse me, I'm, uh... Go away.

95
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,181
I've got 11 fried old folks, you
wanna compare patient loads?

96
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,317
Uh-uh. You need something,
talk to the boss lady.

97
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,202
Hey, you're in a
nasty car accident,

98
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:39,438
I hope you end up down
here, so that I can personally be

99
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:42,229
of absolutely no damn
help to you whatsoever!

100
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,961
Twerp. Excuse me.

101
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,963
Hi. Uh, I'm Andrew...

102
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,015
Do you have an M.D.
behind your name?

103
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,583
No, I... Okay, then have a seat.

104
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:51,607
I'll get to you later.

105
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,055
Uh, Margaret Ramey sent me.

106
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,424
You're a desk clerk?

107
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:58,558
Yes, ma'am.

108
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:01,016
Good. Then get back
here now. Come on.

109
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:04,830
Okay, so you want me to...

110
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:07,867
You're a clerk. Clerk.
Malik, get on the phone

111
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,168
to anybody who has the day off.

112
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,536
Tell them to get into work today

113
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,605
if they still wanna
work here tomorrow.

114
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,607
Oh, God! Can I help you, ma'am?

115
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,110
Oh, I... I've lost my husband.

116
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,111
Were you in the fire?

117
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:20,279
Barry's my husband's name

118
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,315
and I was following
him down the hall,

119
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,617
and they went so fast.

120
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,885
Uh-huh. Your husband's
name is Barry? Yes.

121
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,754
Well, let's go see if
we can find him for you.

122
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,156
Oh, why, thank you.

123
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,492
Sir, can you take a
deep breath for me?

124
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:34,059
Pulse ox 82 on four liters.

125
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,662
Hey, I just found
your patient's wife

126
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:36,829
wandering in the hall.

127
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,631
Can I bring her in?
Absolutely. You free?

128
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:41,233
Yeah, I was just heading back
to the desk to grab another one.

129
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,035
Well, I got two. You
can have this one.

130
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,671
No singed nasal hairs.

131
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:46,523
Barry, I'm right here.

132
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,392
Sir, I need you to lean forward
so I can listen to your back.

133
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,767
- He can't lift himself.
- I...

134
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:56,816
Wet crackles bilaterally.

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,951
Put him on a
non-rebreather mask.

136
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,004
MS, CHF, coronary
artery disease.

137
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,989
All right, S4 gallop.
Let's get a nitro drip.

138
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,375
Titrate to a systolic of 100.

139
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,495
Add another 80 of Lasix,
and four of morphine.

140
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,679
You got it? Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,617
78-year-old woman
with rheumatoid arthritis.

142
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,620
Contusion to the right thigh.
BP's 155 over 88, pulse 96.

143
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,089
Three-centimeter vertical
laceration to the forehead.

144
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,358
Knew I should've had
that third cup of coffee.

145
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,560
What's going on?

146
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,628
Nursing-home fire.
Gabe, check the residents.

147
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,230
Make sure all the
majors are covered.

148
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,898
And, Carol, can you
take over the desk?

149
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,984
They're stacking
up like cordwood.

150
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,785
No physical sign of
the smoke inhalation,

151
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,687
but she's still short
of breath and hypoxic.

152
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:35,821
Pulse ox is down to 84.

153
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:37,056
Uh-huh. Crank her up to 10.

154
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,424
All right?

155
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,759
What the hell's going on?
Her chest is clear. I mean...

156
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,028
You wanna get Dr. Greene?

157
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:44,414
Uh, no. What's her temp?

158
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,003
101.2.

159
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,035
Will you appreciate
the coarse rhonchi

160
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,725
at the right base?

161
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,043
She's got pneumonia.

162
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,128
Not much gets by
you, does it, Dr. Dave?

163
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,696
CBC, blood cultures...

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,160
Chest x-ray, ceftriaxone. Sign.

165
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,185
You know, uh,
Andy does imitations.

166
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,387
Ask him.

167
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:08,787
Imitations, huh?

168
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:10,890
Oh, I'm better at improv.
You know, Second City.

169
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,025
This is just my day job.

170
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,426
Yo, man, do Keanu Reeves, man.

171
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,228
No. Aw, come on. Do something.

172
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:17,730
Go ahead.

173
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:20,366
Whoa! So you're a
little pregnant, huh?

174
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,201
All right.

175
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,070
You picked a name
for the little dude yet?

176
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,338
No. No, I haven't.

177
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,663
Well, how 'bout Leif?
Or Bodhi? Or Keanu?

178
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,211
Keanu is a most excellent name.

179
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,712
That's very good.

180
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,515
Malik, did you get ahold Jeanie?

181
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,216
Yeah, she says she
couldn't make it in.

182
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,252
She hasn't made it in
all week. Call her again.

183
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:40,719
Tell her to come in here.

184
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,895
If not to work, then to explain
to me why I shouldn't fire her.

185
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,276
Just had a great
pickup. Oh, yeah?

186
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,778
Elderly woman
who was in that fire,

187
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,347
presented with rapid breathing
and altered mental status.

188
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,882
Tachypneic and hypoxic.

189
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,750
You're figuring smoke
inhalation, right?

190
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,118
Your Bunsen burner's still on.

191
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,720
That one sticks,
you gotta jiggle it.

192
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,921
Pulse ox was 84. You with me?

193
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,756
Struggling, but I
think I get the picture.

194
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,758
I was tempted to just
write it up as inhalation,

195
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,727
but I noticed a few
subtle physical findings.

196
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,496
Quiet crackles in
the right middle lobe,

197
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,163
a slight dullness to percussion,

198
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,331
and a low-grade fever.

199
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,933
Pneumonia.

200
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,802
Right.

201
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,170
I figure I'm gonna find
some gram-positive diplococci

202
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,338
in her sputum.

203
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,107
She's lucky she had
you as her physician.

204
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,575
Damn straight.

205
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,078
Haleh told me she heard
the rhonchi on the patient

206
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,382
and told you.

207
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,504
I... I can't understand
what he's saying.

208
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,239
He's not getting enough oxygen.

209
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,059
It can lead to confusion
and disorientation.

210
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,294
His lungs are very sick.

211
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,612
Right now our only option

212
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,680
is to place a tube
down his throat

213
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:42,949
to help him breathe.

214
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:45,584
But I don't know that
that will be helpful.

215
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,108
Well, is there a chance
he can get better?

216
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,609
There is a chance. But
in his declining health...

217
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,244
I'm not optimistic.

218
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,467
But he could get better?

219
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,304
Yes, he could.

220
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,391
Then let's try it.

221
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,744
It could also be his heart.

222
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,311
Why don't we run some
more tests, and, um...

223
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,603
Just make sure that we're
doing the right thing first.

224
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,185
Lily, can we get
Cardiology down here?

225
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,187
To, uh, do an echo?

226
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,376
Yeah.

227
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:28,827
Help me!

228
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:29,895
How you doing?

229
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,032
Uh, 89-year-old woman.
Agitated, delusional.

230
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:35,434
Vitals normal. No signs of
smoke inhalation or injury.

231
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,069
What have you done so far?

232
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,621
Gave five of
Haldol, two of Ativan.

233
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,523
I lost my reading
glasses on the way in.

234
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,507
Help me!

235
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:42,875
Why won't you help me?

236
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:43,876
Please!

237
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,094
Help me!

238
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,929
These dementia cases are so sad.

239
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,364
Hated my Geriatrics rotation.
One reason I chose Pedes.

240
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,767
Help me! Please! Ma'am.

241
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,101
You're doing fine. Help me!

242
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,855
Help me! Help me! Please!

243
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,163
Help me! Please! Please.

244
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,998
Help me, help me.

245
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:04,396
How's she doing? Fine.

246
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,531
Excuse me.

247
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,168
Think we're
getting on top of it.

248
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,836
Three have been
admitted to Medicine.

249
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,538
The broken hip
went up to surgery.

250
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:13,639
One's in CICU,

251
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:16,241
and five were
treated and released.

252
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,910
You smell gas? Yes, I do.

253
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:18,945
Malik, smell that?

254
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:19,946
Yeah.

255
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,480
Okay, I'll call Maintenance.

256
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,138
And, Malik, get
everyone out of this hall.

257
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,207
Definitely stronger in here...

258
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,174
Ah!

259
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,619
Both eardrums are intact.
How's the ringing? Still bad?

260
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,887
Ringing still bad?

261
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,288
What was it?

262
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,191
Fire department thinks
somebody left a Bunsen burner on.

263
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,694
I was doing a stain earlier,
but I'm sure I turned it off.

264
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,196
You want me to set up
an Audiology appointment?

265
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,198
No, I had it worse sitting
too close to the stage

266
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,366
at a Clash concert.

267
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,268
Ah, I just wanna get
out of these wet clothes.

268
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,703
Few scratches, but that's it.

269
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,737
Thanks, Gabe.

270
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,172
Could this day get any worse?

271
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,107
What the hell happened here?

272
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,458
We're not certain yet.

273
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,428
We think a small gas leak
may have ignited next door.

274
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,996
Small? I heard it
up on the 4th floor.

275
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,233
Fortunately, no one
was seriously injured.

276
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,270
Someone may have
left a Bunsen burner on.

277
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:19,522
Really?

278
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,656
When did the pain start?

279
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,024
Last night before I went to bed.

280
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,358
Had you had anything to eat?

281
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,960
Uh, we shared a
pizza for dinner.

282
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,095
Any vomiting? No.

283
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,163
Any pain?

284
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,265
A little bit around
my bellybutton.

285
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,366
How old are you, Eddie?

286
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,367
12.

287
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,936
Married? Big for your age.

288
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,137
You play football?

289
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,471
Eh, he's not much into sports.

290
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,240
Uh, video games.
That's what kids do now.

291
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,342
Sit up for me, will you?
Any pain back here?

292
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,644
Yeah, a little. Mm-hm.

293
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,628
Carter?

294
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:43,796
Dr. Kayson's here.

295
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,731
Thanks. I'll be right there.

296
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,733
Okay, nothing's too
serious, Mr. Bernero.

297
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,702
Maybe just a little
touch of the stomach flu.

298
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:50,903
Why don't you pee in the cup,

299
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:51,904
give it to Malik.

300
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,006
It's what he lives for.

301
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,875
Mm, pistachio,
almond and peppermint.

302
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,643
Yum, ice cream cake. Peppermint?

303
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,712
Just eat the pistachio then.

304
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:02,047
Oh, God. Another birthday?

305
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:04,200
Just leave the decorations
up permanently.

306
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,768
It's Carol Hathaway's
baby shower.

307
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,002
It's a surprise.

308
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,988
Mm. Anybody missing a
pair of reading glasses?

309
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,856
Just found them in the freezer.

310
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,191
May I see those?

311
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:14,059
I've left mine in some
pretty weird places.

312
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,394
In the dryer one time.

313
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:16,996
Are they yours?

314
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,553
No, but I think I
know whose they are.

315
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,368
Hey, you got a minute?

316
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,003
Yeah, I wish I had.

317
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,671
We can talk while
I work if you like.

318
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:27,072
Nice office.

319
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,291
Yeah.

320
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,359
You have to admire the
method to his madness,

321
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,495
no matter how sociopathic.

322
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,496
Who?

323
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,197
Romano. This office.

324
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,182
Sorry.

325
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,266
You wanted to talk?

326
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,934
Slumming amongst

327
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,142
we simple surgical
folk, Dr. Benton?

328
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,557
We were just
discussing a patient.

329
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,491
Oh, nothing that
was taking Peter away

330
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,362
from the electrifying excitement
of trauma medicine, I hope.

331
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:50,780
Lizzie, I've got a hernia

332
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,447
scheduled for
tomorrow in the a.m.,

333
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,549
and I was gonna be tied
up with a breakfast meeting

334
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,985
with insurance people.

335
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,686
And I was hoping you
could take it for me.

336
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,238
It's a bit early. Six o'clock.

337
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:00,239
In the morning?

338
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,641
Yeah, early bird
catches the worm.

339
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,410
Seems one of the
more advanced members

340
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,579
of your ER brain-trust
blew up the lab,

341
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:07,930
and the insurance company

342
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,032
is rightly concerned
about hospital safety.

343
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,066
Did anyone get hurt?

344
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,718
Your boyfriend
got his hair mussed.

345
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:13,753
Mark?

346
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:16,355
Yeah. But he bounced right back.

347
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,341
Have to hand it to
him. He is a scrapper.

348
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,675
He's deaf as a post.

349
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,345
I understand that's, uh,
probably temporary. Oh, oh!

350
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,468
Um, Lizzie.

351
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,814
How much would
you pay for my sperm?

352
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,602
I beg your pardon?

353
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,403
Oh, is that sexual harassment?

354
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:32,438
Oh. Oh, my. Oh.

355
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:34,723
No, I'm being, um, recruited

356
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,609
by the Marshall/Hillberg
Sperm Bank.

357
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,376
Its, uh... Its donors include

358
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,412
Olympic athletes and
Nobel Prize winners.

359
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,998
It's an elite gene pool.

360
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,416
And they want you?

361
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,618
Yeah. Yeah, it's a little
embarrassing, actually.

362
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:46,952
Uh, but it's for a good cause.

363
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,754
I mean, who knows
what the mother's side's

364
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:49,955
gonna bring to the party.

365
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,791
But as for my side
of the genetic divide,

366
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:54,460
I can guarantee a
significant advantage

367
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,662
over the rest of the
spermic competition.

368
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,848
Can't have too many extra
Romanos running around,

369
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,721
spicing up the
gene pool, can we?

370
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,662
Hey. What have we got?

371
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,630
Shattered femur. Rock climbing.

372
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,099
55-year-old trying to keep up

373
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,567
with his much younger wife.

374
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,969
Wow. What a mess.

375
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,955
Nothing like major
orthopedic surgery

376
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,557
and four months in a wheelchair

377
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,964
to prove your vitality
to the fairer sex.

378
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,179
You still looking for
your reading glasses?

379
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,180
Yeah.

380
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,448
I meant to stop by a drugstore

381
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,616
on the way in to pick up
one of those $10 pairs.

382
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,756
Are these them?

383
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,637
That's great.
Where'd you find 'em?

384
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,911
In the freezer in the lounge.

385
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,476
The freezer?

386
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,620
That's one place I didn't look.

387
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:50,823
Thanks.

388
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:56,072
Hey, Cleo. Could you write
me a prescription for Keflex?

389
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,991
I've got a sometime
patient, 8 months pregnant.

390
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:01,527
She's had no prenatal care,
and has a bladder infection.

391
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,528
Want me to look at her?

392
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:04,072
Well, she's not in the hospital.

393
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,965
Don't ask. I just...

394
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,632
I thought I'd get
her the prescription

395
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,122
and hope that she fills it.

396
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,592
Thank you.

397
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:17,910
It's probably the heart failure

398
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,979
that's making him sick. Oh.

399
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,402
Not his lungs.

400
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,420
I think that we need to
accept that the time has come

401
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,964
to let nature take its course.

402
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,049
I don't know what to do.

403
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:42,034
Barry always made all
the important decisions.

404
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:45,292
Do you know what a "Do
Not Resuscitate" order is?

405
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:49,107
Yes.

406
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,866
I think you need to sign
one for your husband.

407
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,997
Will you do that for me?

408
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,474
Yes.

409
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,728
Excuse me.
Dr. Spielman's office?

410
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,120
Yeah. Uh, third floor. Make
a left past the MRI suite.

411
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,251
Dr. Spielman.

412
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,521
Kerry! My God! How are you?

413
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,356
I'm fine, thanks. Oh.

414
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,159
Still sacrificing yourself
at the altar of the indigent

415
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,594
down at County?

416
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,663
Battling windmills
is more like it.

417
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,097
Please. Want some tea?

418
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,099
No, thanks. No, thanks.

419
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,868
So you moved, uh, the
office around a little bit.

420
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,737
Yeah, when we
put in the MRI suite.

421
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,871
What a mess.

422
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,174
So, what brings you
to our humble digs?

423
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,876
Job-hunting, I hope.

424
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,117
Uh, no. Gabe Lawrence.

425
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,633
You let him go a
couple of months ago?

426
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:50,807
He left the staff, yes.

427
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,722
I heard it was politics.

428
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,058
A... A bit of a palace coup.

429
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,362
With me cast as Iago, I suspect.

430
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,569
I was wondering if that's
what really happened.

431
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:06,652
Gabe Lawrence
was my closest friend.

432
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,687
My mentor, my teacher,

433
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:12,124
and the finest doctor I have
had the privilege to work with.

434
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:15,511
His leaving was the
most trying experience

435
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,879
of my career.

436
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,969
I hired him at County.

437
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,140
I hadn't heard that.

438
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,654
Renee, I need to know.

439
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,324
Should I be concerned
about the safety of my patients

440
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,615
with Dr. Lawrence on my staff?

441
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,767
Hey, have you seen Dr. Lawrence?

442
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,368
Check Trauma 2,
he's in with Malucci.

443
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,022
What have they got?
Stab wound to the chest.

444
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,492
Rib spreader.

445
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:47,526
Suction.

446
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,799
Still no pulse.

447
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,232
Gabe, do you need a hand?

448
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,734
No, we're fine. You know what
they say about too many cooks.

449
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,203
Heart's still beating.

450
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,688
Notice how little blood
there is in the heart?

451
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,206
Pulseless electrical activity.

452
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,592
All right, we need four
more units of O-neg.

453
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,260
Stab wound to
the left ventricle.

454
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,378
Keep your finger on it.

455
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,046
I'll do internal compressions.

456
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,214
How fast are you at sewing?

457
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,382
Blink and you'll miss it.

458
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:12,251
We need two needle
drivers with 2-0 silk.

459
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,353
I'm putting him into
ventricular fibrillation.

460
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:15,387
Serious?

461
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,189
You wanna sew a moving target?

462
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,558
What am I gonna do next,
Kerry? Sauerbruch grip.

463
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:21,326
Did I ever tell you Dr. Weaver

464
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,313
was the finest student I
ever had? Hands down.

465
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,149
Scary. Knew the answers
before you could ask the questions.

466
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,402
And what is the
Sauerbruch grip, Dr. Weaver?

467
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:31,569
Occlude the inflow

468
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:33,572
from the inferior and
superior vena cava.

469
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:36,408
What'd I tell you? All
right, when he arrests,

470
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:38,310
you've got 30
seconds to fix this hole.

471
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,012
Go in high, with a
horizontal mattress.

472
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,318
V-fib.

473
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:58,931
Charge the paddles to 20.

474
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:00,349
Two more units are in.

475
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,551
Keep 'em coming.
Don't tie that off too tight.

476
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,575
Paddles now.

477
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,877
Last knot.

478
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,528
Don't look at the
monitor, look at the heart.

479
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,880
That, my young friend,

480
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,916
is what normal sinus rhythm
looks like inside the chest.

481
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,006
Damn.

482
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:24,856
She was the last
one. They're sure?

483
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,957
Nobody else used it.

484
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:27,359
Are they gonna
fire her for that?

485
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:28,560
Who's going to get fired?

486
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,429
Dr. Finch. She used
the Bunsen burner last.

487
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:31,664
You can get fired for that?

488
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:33,666
If you can be fired for
dress-code violations,

489
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,467
you can be fired for
blowing up a hospital.

490
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:37,436
They can fire you for
dress-code violations?

491
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,537
Is anything open? I just
need it for a few minutes.

492
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,707
Do Christopher Walken.

493
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:44,443
Well, you see, you want a room?

494
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:48,397
The only room that's
available... Exam 1.

495
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,020
Thanks.

496
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,107
Welcome. Have fun
storming the castle.

497
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,135
Alrighty.

498
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,672
Okay.

499
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,141
Here you go.

500
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,211
Sit up.

501
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,548
All right, man. Let's get
this DNA stuff over with.

502
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
See?

503
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,074
See?

504
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,356
See how easy that
was? It didn't hurt.

505
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
All right. Yeah.

506
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:03,210
Good man. That's my big man.

507
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,462
Okay.

508
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,373
I'm sorry.

509
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,509
Come here.

510
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,950
Excuse me, is Meg
Corwin working?

511
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:33,485
Deb, where's Meg?

512
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,486
On break.

513
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,054
She's probably out back.

514
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,123
Past the water fountain
and the bathrooms.

515
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,347
Thank you.

516
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:47,733
I get paid today, really. Hey.

517
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,334
I'll... I'll catch
you later, okay.

518
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,336
Um, I'm off at 6:30.

519
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,370
Maybe.

520
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,908
What are you doing here?

521
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:58,477
Brought you your prescription
for your bladder infection.

522
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:00,145
Thanks. Who was that guy?

523
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,482
Um... Oh, Meg, you're pregnant.

524
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:06,552
No kidding. I didn't ask to be.

525
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,520
Oh, you weren't there
when it happened?

526
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,955
This is none of your business.

527
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:11,757
Look, you wanna piss
your life away, fine.

528
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,391
But your kid deserves a chance.

529
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,560
I think you're mixing me up

530
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,016
with someone who gives a damn.

531
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,448
I didn't leave it on. I
was there. I saw you.

532
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,482
I turned it off.

533
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,084
You need to tell
Dr. Weaver it was you.

534
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,751
Why would I be stupid
enough to do that?

535
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,454
Because Dr. Finch
is going to get fired.

536
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,721
Maybe she left it on.

537
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,490
Dr. Dave? Benton's
with your broken arm.

538
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,657
I checked the charts,

539
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,426
her patient came in
an hour before yours.

540
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,261
Dr. Finch was in there
long before we were.

541
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,352
I turned it off, Lucy. Honest.

542
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,082
Hey, Cleo.

543
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,436
I got a 12-year-old boy
whose blood sugar is 278.

544
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,971
Diabetes previously diagnosed?

545
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,439
No, I just got the test back.

546
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,440
He overweight?

547
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,976
Crappy diet? Couch potato?

548
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,344
All of the above.

549
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,845
Kids sit around eating junk food

550
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,081
and play video games
all day, and bingo.

551
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,416
They've got diabetes.

552
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,634
How do I treat it?

553
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:57,635
Well, you want me to
talk to the family with you?

554
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,923
Got some experience
with it. Sure, that'd be great.

555
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,292
I'd heard that Gabe
had lost a power struggle

556
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,459
with Renee Spielman

557
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,161
over some junior
staff tenure issues.

558
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,930
And you never checked
when you hired him?

559
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,698
Hey, I have known Gabe
Lawrence my entire career.

560
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,802
He trained me. He's the
reason I became an ER doc.

561
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,103
When I heard he was forced out,

562
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,722
I jumped at the
chance to hire him.

563
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:19,224
You jumped at the
chance to impress him.

564
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,964
Student hires teacher.

565
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,618
Okay.

566
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:30,953
Spielman suspected
signs of early Alzheimer's,

567
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:34,773
but when she asked him to
undergo neurological testing,

568
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:37,075
he... He blew up, and he quit.

569
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,577
He hasn't spoken
to her ever since.

570
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:39,828
You have to fire him.

571
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,830
No. She wasn't sure.

572
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,498
His inability to
cope with stress.

573
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,667
Wandering around the
halls 'cause he can't...

574
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,252
He's always been scattered.

575
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:49,054
He could endanger the patients.

576
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:50,956
Mark, I don't
know if I can do it.

577
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,992
I... I... I mean, I
love him like a father.

578
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,233
I don't know if I can fire him.

579
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,938
Is there a family
history of diabetes?

580
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:07,306
My mother has it. I...

581
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,774
I thought this was
something only old people get.

582
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,276
This type, primarily yes,

583
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,812
but some children
are susceptible to it.

584
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:16,014
We need to get your
son into a diabetes clinic.

585
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,483
There's a new drug, Glucophage,
that works well for kids,

586
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,835
but it is expensive.

587
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,971
Does your insurance cover
prescription medications?

588
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,258
I'm not insured right
now. How expensive?

589
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:28,677
$100 a month, plus he'll
need constant monitoring

590
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:29,811
and clinic visits.

591
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,179
I can't afford that.

592
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,281
Look, your son
needs to lose weight,

593
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,083
exercise and control his diet.

594
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,636
If he does all those things,
he might not need medication.

595
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,203
I'm starting a
new job next week.

596
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,906
It's got good benefits, but they
don't kick in for three months.

597
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,626
Can this...? Can
it wait till then?

598
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,295
The longer your son walks
around with an elevated blood sugar,

599
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,469
the more likely he is to
develop complications.

600
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,151
This will be a pre-existing
condition, right?

601
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:54,486
On my new insurance?

602
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,355
If you start treating
him right now,

603
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:59,124
then that's a pre-existing
addition, they won't cover him.

604
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:01,326
Uh, I don't know the
specifics of your new plan,

605
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,744
uh, but it's possible.

606
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,665
What about I start him on a
diet and get him working out?

607
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:09,467
My mother's in an HMO,
she gets diabetes pills for free,

608
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:11,086
he could take those
for three months.

609
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,621
Your son needs the support
of a physician's supervision.

610
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,508
You can't change him
overnight. He needs a nutritionist,

611
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:19,044
an exercise specialist,
a diabetic educator.

612
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:22,264
How much will all that
cost? It's only three months.

613
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,816
I'll stay on him. We
weren't even here, all right?

614
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,984
No, your son needs
medical attention.

615
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:28,486
This is a very serious disease.

616
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,988
He could suffer kidney
failure, heart disease, go blind.

617
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,657
Hang on... There
could be infections.

618
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:33,909
He could lose his limbs.

619
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:37,033
Let me talk to
Dr. Finch for a minute.

620
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,334
I think you're making it worse.

621
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:44,135
The man's considering
waiting months

622
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,671
to treat his son. Well,

623
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:48,306
forget three months. If the
insurance won't cover his son,

624
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,875
and he can't afford
the medication,

625
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:51,760
what will happen over
the next three years?

626
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,661
He can't take his
grandmother's glyburide,

627
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,548
he could drop his blood sugar,
eat more and gain more weight.

628
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,183
So we start him
off on half a pill,

629
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:00,802
two and half milligrams, the
dad gets him to lose weight.

630
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,887
When the insurance
kicks in, he gets better care.

631
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:05,057
You asked me to help
'cause you don't know anything

632
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,825
about Type II
diabetes in children.

633
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:09,260
Sedentary kids don't
change their lifestyles

634
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:10,862
without professional
supervision.

635
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:13,264
Dad hasn't been able
to get the kid off the sofa

636
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:15,934
and away from the pizzas
and potato chips in 12 years.

637
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,669
What makes you think
he could do it now?

638
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,637
Carter, your CHF
guy's in V-tach.

639
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,707
Look, he's your
patient. I'll be right there.

640
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:23,175
If you let that kid
walk out of here

641
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,410
to accommodate the
father's financial problems,

642
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,234
you're endangering
that boy's life.

643
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:36,354
But what is it?

644
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:40,313
It's ventricular tachycardia.
It's an abnormal heart rhythm.

645
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:44,351
How much longer?

646
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,799
A few minutes.

647
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:50,323
A few minutes?

648
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,979
A few minutes.

649
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,283
Oh.

650
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,331
Dr. Lawrence?

651
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,467
Can I talk to you for a
second? Yeah, what's up?

652
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,602
You told Mrs. Karis
to wait here in Chairs

653
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,805
for a prescription
over four hours ago.

654
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,841
Oh, I'm sorry.

655
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,844
I'm sorry, Mrs. Karis. I, uh...

656
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,779
I got tied up with
other patients,

657
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,482
and I... I... I completely
forgot about it.

658
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:24,018
I'm very sorry. Uh,
one pill every six hours.

659
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,254
And, uh, elevate your ankle

660
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,289
and ice it three
times a day, okay?

661
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,992
Gabe, can I, uh, talk to
you in the lounge, please?

662
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,282
Yeah.

663
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,296
Thanks, Brenda. That's it?

664
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,948
Yeah, appreciate it.

665
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:38,784
Wait... Wait a second,
what is she doing?

666
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:39,951
What is this?

667
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,653
What's going on here? Come on.

668
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,572
What the hell is going
on here? What is this?

669
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,339
Why is she taking
off her ankle wrap?

670
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,208
Dr. Lawrence,
that's Brenda Brewer.

671
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,843
She works up in Accounting.

672
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,445
She doesn't have
an ankle injury,

673
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,997
and you've never
seen her before.

674
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:53,098
You tricked me?

675
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:55,050
Please, can we not do this here?

676
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:58,086
It's been very busy here today!

677
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,173
I had several ankle
injuries. I got them confused.

678
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:04,347
I went to see Renee Spielman.

679
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:10,270
Gabe. Gabe!

680
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:20,346
Time of death is 7:42.

681
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:26,970
Mrs. Connelly?

682
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,453
Has he gone?

683
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,510
Yes.

684
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,049
Barry, you... You're so sweet.

685
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:59,230
Yes, you are.

686
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:01,554
I'll miss you.

687
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:07,822
I, uh... I need to call my son.

688
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,075
Is there...? Is there a
phone I could use nearby?

689
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,798
I'll show you.

690
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,051
Thank you.

691
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,075
Thank you, doctor.

692
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,311
Sure you wanna
go through with this?

693
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,313
Jail isn't exactly the
best place on the planet

694
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,914
to have a baby.

695
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,433
At least she won't be high.

696
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:36,901
There he is.

697
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,303
Got him.

698
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:40,822
5-3-2-0. Got a white male

699
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,766
with a leather
jacket at the alley.

700
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,528
What happens now?

701
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:49,112
Just wait to see
if it goes down.

702
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:58,423
Bingo.

703
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:13,571
Get anything?

704
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,440
Pills, some weed.

705
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:17,575
What's this, Einstein, crank?

706
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,083
Kid's a regular little
cash-and-carry pharmacy.

707
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:23,581
You bitch.

708
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,367
How could you do this to me?

709
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,818
You don't have anything to say?

710
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:29,409
How could you do this to me?!

711
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,689
Lucy, has Dr. Lawrence
come back?

712
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:48,723
No, not yet.

713
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,558
Uh, Dr. Weaver?

714
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,826
Yeah.

715
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,829
It's a possibility that
I was the last person

716
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,466
using the Bunsen burner
before the explosion this morning.

717
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,586
I understand it's been assumed
that Dr. Finch used it last,

718
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,622
but I used it as well,
maybe after she did.

719
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:06,775
Probably after she
did. I think I turned it off.

720
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,027
But it... It's
possible that I didn't.

721
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:11,446
So it could've been my fault.

722
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,181
The fire investigator
said it was the gas line.

723
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,486
They found a ruptured
pipe in the wall.

724
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,903
Oh.

725
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:21,539
Well, I... I guess it wasn't me.

726
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:25,043
Dr. Malucci, safety is our
number one priority here.

727
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:27,211
It's not acceptable
for you to "think"

728
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,514
you left on a potentially
dangerous lab tool.

729
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:30,948
Are we clear? Yes, ma'am.

730
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,917
<i>This is Dr. Lawrence.</i>

731
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:35,286
<i>Please leave your name and
number, I'll get back to you.</i>

732
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,189
Gabe, this is Kerry.

733
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:41,514
I'm at the hospital, and
please call me back.

734
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:47,653
Dr. Carter, can I come in?

735
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:50,401
Sure.

736
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:52,704
Um, this is my
son's record, right?

737
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:54,972
It was on the end of his bed.

738
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,341
Yes, it is.

739
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,405
It says in here that
Eddie has diabetes.

740
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,565
You put that in here? Yes.

741
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:04,416
Tear it up, please.

742
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,084
I can't do that.

743
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:08,341
It's illegal.

744
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,490
I'm not a fool.

745
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,559
I love my son. I wouldn't
do anything to hurt him.

746
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,511
But we're just getting
back on our feet here.

747
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,646
I don't have the kind of money

748
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,548
that other doctor
was talking about

749
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,601
for all those
specialists and things.

750
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,504
I'll have my new
insurance in three months.

751
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,939
And it's good.

752
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,941
I'll get Eddie on a
diet and exercising.

753
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:31,309
We can use my mom's pills.

754
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,778
And she gets those little
kits that, uh, check her blood.

755
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:35,780
Glucose levels.
Right, right, right.

756
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:37,615
We'll get those and
if he's not improving,

757
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,917
I'll bring him back. I'll do
whatever you tell me to do.

758
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:43,310
But if there's a chance
to do this any other way...

759
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:47,330
please help us.

760
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,495
What are you doing?

761
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,464
I was doing chart review
in here this morning,

762
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:56,434
and the sprinklers
soaked everything.

763
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,402
I just did something
and now I'm not so sure

764
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,638
it was the the right
thing. Oh, yeah? Me too.

765
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:02,540
Really? Yeah, about an hour ago.

766
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,874
What?

767
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,227
I just, uh, destroyed
what little was left

768
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,929
of a good man's career.

769
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,148
What'd you do?

770
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:14,018
Got a pregnant junkie
arrested for possession

771
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,859
so she could get clean in jail
and give the baby a chance.

772
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,674
Wanna talk about it?

773
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,193
We could drown our sorrows
in a couple of ginger ales.

774
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,561
No, thanks,

775
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,747
the girls are throwing me
a surprise baby shower.

776
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,949
I thought that was
supposed to be a surprise.

777
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,756
I'll look surprised.

778
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:38,497
I miss Doug.

779
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,785
You call him?

780
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,201
Has he called you?

781
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,070
He leaves messages
on my machine.

782
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,607
I think he calls when
he knows I won't be there

783
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,109
so I don't have to talk
to him if I don't want to.

784
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,616
You don't want to?

785
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:01,232
I don't know what
else there is to say.

786
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:06,988
Rain check on that ginger ale?

787
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,177
Sure.

788
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:27,692
Hey, Malik. Yeah.

789
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:30,127
Have you seen the T-sheet
on the Bernero kid's chart?

790
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,629
The diabetes kid?
Why is it so hard

791
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,065
to keep them on the charts?
It was there a while ago.

792
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,434
Yeah, I hate this. Now I
gotta fill out a whole new chart.

793
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,936
I don't have time for this crap.

794
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,172
Randi, Bernero kid in
Curtain 3 can go home.

795
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:44,241
Just a little case
of the stomach flu.

796
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,705
Kick him out of there.
We need the bed.

797
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:53,251
Randi, have you seen Kerry?

798
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,885
Um, Curtain 2.

799
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,020
Thanks.

800
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:57,221
Hey. Hi.

801
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:58,722
How's the baby?
He's doin' great.

802
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,492
We're having a shower for
Carol. You ought to stop by.

803
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,916
Yeah, I'll try. All right.

804
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,299
Okay, hang a banana bag
and try to dress those abrasions.

805
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,700
I think he fell on
his face again.

806
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:12,220
Kerry, Malik called, said
it was important I come in?

807
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,722
Yeah. You know, I
checked your timecards

808
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,924
and you've worked two
days in the last three weeks.

809
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,025
We depend on you down here.

810
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,694
And when you call
in at the last minute,

811
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,529
it just makes it tough
on everybody else.

812
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,065
I'm not coming back.

813
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,500
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
make it tough on everybody.

814
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,737
I didn't intend to. I should've
come to talk to you earlier.

815
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,489
Well, is everything all right?

816
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,557
I've never been happier.

817
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,526
I have Reggie and the baby.

818
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,296
And every time I'm at work,
I want to be home with them.

819
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,048
That's great. So...

820
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:42,300
if you need me to
work a few shifts... No.

821
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:43,934
No, no, no.

822
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:47,171
But as the baby gets older
and doesn't need you so much,

823
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:50,474
call me. There will always
be a job for you here.

824
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:52,114
Thanks, Kerry.

825
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,429
I'm gonna miss you.

826
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,734
I'm gonna miss you too.

827
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,519
Hey.

828
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:02,904
Hello, baby.

829
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,706
Oh, Roger was gonna pick
him up at your place later.

830
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,692
Yeah, I know, I know.
Actually, you know what,

831
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:09,894
I called him and told him I
was going to drop him off.

832
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,113
Roger! ROGER: Yeah?

833
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,082
Reece is here.

834
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,366
Hey, I, um... ROGER: My man.

835
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,191
I got this DNA kit
to test for paternity.

836
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,261
And?

837
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:24,042
And I'm not gonna use it.

838
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,844
I'm gonna throw it away.

839
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,096
Why?

840
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,552
Carla...

841
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,224
I put my hand on your stomach
when you were pregnant.

842
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,727
And I felt him move.

843
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,509
I was there when he was born

844
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,933
and all those
nights in the NICU.

845
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,181
I wake up in the
morning, that little boy

846
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,772
is the first thing on my mind.

847
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,877
When I go to sleep
at night, he's the last.

848
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,549
I love him.

849
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,463
He's my son.

850
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,198
I don't care about biology.

851
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,657
I don't need some damn
DNA kit to tell me that.

852
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:12,873
I don't have a whole
lot in my life, Carla.

853
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,376
My career...

854
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,934
Jackie and her
kids and that boy.

855
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,407
He means more to me than
all the rest of them combined.

856
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,155
I'd lay down in front
of a train for him.

857
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,347
That's how I love him.

858
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,884
So I'm asking. I am...

859
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm asking you...

860
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,398
Please...

861
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,409
Don't... Don't... Don't
take my son away from me.

862
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:06,849
Please.

863
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,336
Carol, Weaver
needs you at the desk.

864
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,572
Something about overtime.

865
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:18,695
Great. Okay.

866
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,443
Surprise!

867
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,745
Oh, my God!

868
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:28,315
You guys... You didn't
know? I had no idea.

869
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,951
We chipped in on the bassinets.

870
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,653
We have no money anymore.

871
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,589
Aw, they're beautiful.

872
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,591
Dr. Weaver,

873
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,492
Dr. Lawrence is
down in Trauma 2.

874
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,016
You were looking for him, right?

875
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:45,605
Where have you been?

876
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,158
Out walking by the lake.

877
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,928
I was worried about you.

878
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,029
<i>When despair for
the world Grows in me</i>

879
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:00,731
<i>I go and lie down
Where the wood drake</i>

880
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,368
<i>Rests in his beauty On the water</i>

881
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,759
<i>And the great heron feeds.</i>

882
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:12,743
<i>I come into the
peace Of wild things</i>

883
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,135
<i>Who do not tax their lives
With forethought of grief.</i>

884
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,519
<i>I come into the
presence Of still water</i>

885
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:25,222
<i>And feel above me
The day-blind stars</i>

886
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:27,180
<i>Waiting with their light</i>

887
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,520
<i>And for a time, I
rest in the peace</i>

888
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:39,625
<i>Of the world and am free.</i>

889
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,263
How can I remember
a William Blake poem

890
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,399
I memorized over 30 years ago,

891
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,703
and not remember
that I saw a woman

892
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,377
with a sprained
ankle this afternoon?

893
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,266
I started to notice something
was wrong about a year ago.

894
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,686
You know, memory loss

895
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,311
and not being able
to find the right word.

896
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,594
I went to Boston to see
an old classmate of mine,

897
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,251
a neurologist.

898
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,467
He did a PET scan, and it...

899
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,653
It showed bilateral
hypoperfusion

900
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,677
to the parietal areas.

901
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:36,160
He started me on Aricept.

902
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,511
It's supposed to...

903
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,279
put the brakes on... On...

904
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,981
On the Alzheimer's.
But I guess...

905
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:45,970
Guess it, uh... It
didn't help enough.

906
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:49,373
Roz Chow is doing great work

907
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:51,842
upstairs at the Comprehensive
Dementia Center.

908
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,227
You should go see her.

909
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:56,063
What for? I have a
progressive neurologic disorder.

910
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,366
They're working with
neurotrophins and antioxidants.

911
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,652
Maybe you could
get into a clinical trial.

912
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:03,916
I was thinking of
committing suicide.

913
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:08,942
I don't...

914
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,567
I can't figure out
the best time to do it.

915
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,950
Too early, and I'll miss
what little life I have left.

916
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,720
If I wait too long, I
won't remember to do it.

917
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,880
Please don't say that.

918
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,903
God, I'm gonna
miss this. You know...

919
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:37,605
You know, medicine
has been my whole life.

920
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:41,242
No. No, you could stay on

921
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,377
and you could lecture
the medical students

922
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,146
and the residents.

923
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,937
But not see patients, right?

924
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:52,603
Gabe, you are a brilliant doctor

925
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:54,405
and you are a wonderful teacher.

926
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,973
Please...

927
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:58,197
Please don't give
up those gifts.

928
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,854
Look, I saw a
woman this morning.

929
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:10,193
Dementia. She had...

930
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,731
She had no idea where she
was. She didn't know who she was.

931
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,874
Ten years, that'll be me.

932
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,845
Bedridden...

933
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:35,617
in diapers... locked
away in some home...

934
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,488
nobody coming to see me.

935
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:45,227
I'll come and see you.

936
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,644
Yeah, but I won't...

937
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:53,402
I won't know you're there.
