1
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:22,198
Got a 41-year-old male.
Status post: grand mal seizure.

2
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,433
Any history?

3
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,335
Found a bottle of
Dilantin. He's post ictal.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,304
What's open? Curtain 3. I think.

5
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,305
Coming through!

6
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,406
Can I help you?

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,508
Uh, no.

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,209
Draw 10 of Ativan, give two now.

9
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,073
Need a Dilantin level.

10
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,215
Did you mess with
my IV? Look at it.

11
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,518
I didn't touch it. That's how
it was when I picked it up

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,242
If the bag is empty, you
ask them to change it.

13
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,960
Did you see my wallet?
They took my wallet.

14
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,161
Mr. Parker, stop worrying.

15
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,363
Whoa. Sorry.

16
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,331
Four units of pac
cells, chest film.

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,066
Where's Benton? He's on his way.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,992
We need him. We need
a Foley and an NG. Go.

19
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,699
Okay, lift your tongue.

20
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,680
That should help.

21
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,384
I'm in. Set me up
for a chest tube.

22
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,268
What time are you off?

23
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,533
Hey. What are you doing
here? It's almost midnight.

24
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,225
What time are you off?

25
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,506
Now.

26
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,208
<i>Coming up tomorrow...</i>

27
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:40,493
I'm going now.

28
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,762
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Anderson.

29
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:45,165
I put the nice
tablecloth in the washer,

30
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,883
and you should
tumble-dry it on low.

31
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,651
And if you need
anything, you'll call me,

32
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,687
because my number's
right there on the fridge.

33
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,855
Uh-huh. I will.

34
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,759
Uh... And, Mark...
I'm really sorry.

35
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,360
She was a lovely woman.

36
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,161
Yeah. I know.

37
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,530
Okay. Good night.

38
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,187
Good night.

39
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,261
You're not afraid about
waking up the neighbors?

40
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,631
Harold's deaf as a post.

41
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,699
They all leave?

42
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:36,723
Yeah.

43
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,235
Good.

44
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,571
What are you making?

45
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,129
I promised your mother
I'd build her a linen chest.

46
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,433
'Kay.

47
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,736
Good night.

48
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,727
That was a good
speech you gave today.

49
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,451
Those things you
said about your mother.

50
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:11,017
I had good material.

51
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,224
Yeah.

52
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:16,904
The color guard was nice, Dad.

53
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:23,863
You okay?

54
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,054
Depends what "okay" means.

55
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:30,169
You want me to stick
around a little longer?

56
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,404
A few days?

57
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,477
Rachel loves San Diego.

58
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:40,403
Dad?

59
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,372
Doesn't seem real, Mark.

60
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,561
I buried my wife today.

61
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,478
Ow.

62
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,513
Fun stuff, huh?

63
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,381
So, you get a good
look at the bastards?

64
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,417
Well, they're skaters.
They all look the same.

65
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:52,418
Dr. Malucci?

66
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,253
It's Dr. Dave to you, Lucy.

67
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:55,722
No new fractures.

68
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:58,124
Jeez, Rick, it looks like you
banged up your chin before.

69
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,425
They don't like the way I dress.

70
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,694
Last time they slammed
my head in a car door.

71
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,262
Like they're the
height of fashion.

72
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,364
Hasn't your principal
done anything about this?

73
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,733
Where did you go to school?

74
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:09,135
I'll let that get numb,
come back and stitch ya up.

75
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,605
Um, Mr. Zito, the
COPD'er, is retaining.

76
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,606
Can I decrease his O-2?

77
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,607
Sure. Why not?

78
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:15,608
Two liters?

79
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,842
Hey, Dave?

80
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,744
'Scuse me. Did you
call Plastics on that lip?

81
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,012
Uh, nah, I got it.

82
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,280
If it's through-and-through

83
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,782
and crosses the vermilion
border we call Plastics.

84
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,151
Well, he already has a scar...

85
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,320
All the more reason.
Randy's got the on-call list.

86
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,322
Two liters, okay? What?

87
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,823
How much should
I decrease his O-2?

88
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,391
Ooh. I don't know.
Crank it down.

89
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,893
If he turns blue,
crank it back up.

90
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,028
You're kidding, right?

91
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:37,130
No. Purple ain't good.

92
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:39,787
Just keep his pulse
ox above 90. Okay.

93
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,736
Hey, it's Jackie Joyner.

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,959
Hi, Jackie, nice spandex.

95
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,890
Get a life.

96
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,025
That's good.

97
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,343
She's hot for me.

98
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,328
You've been here three
days, she's hot for ya?

99
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,762
Doesn't take long, bro.

100
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,331
Looks like your drunk is back.

101
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,683
Aw, dude, what happened?

102
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:57,984
I discharged you two hours ago.

103
00:05:58,008 --> 00:05:59,351
You gotta know when to hold 'em.

104
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,154
He was passed out in
the middle of Wabash.

105
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:02,155
When did he have time?

106
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,322
You haven't met Vodka Joe?

107
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,891
Some days he's in
two or three times.

108
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:06,192
You gotta know when to fold 'em.

109
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:07,326
Should've left his IV in.

110
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,995
Nice of you to bring
him back, officer.

111
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,096
Just doing my duty, ma'am.

112
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,430
Ya gotta know when to walk away.

113
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,099
Exactly. You...
You got this? I got it.

114
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,533
Thank you so much.

115
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,368
Hey, sweetheart.

116
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,304
You wanna meet
up with a gambler?

117
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:20,472
Hey, hey, watch it,
cowboy. That's my fiancée.

118
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:21,674
Reggie... What?

119
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,076
Fiancée? You guys engaged?

120
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,643
Not exactly. Pretty much.

121
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,778
Know when to run!

122
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,930
<i>I want to commend</i>

123
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,132
the Surgical Service
on their timely response

124
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,532
and clinical competence.

125
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,985
We had excellent outcomes
with no significant delays...

126
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,854
Hey. Can you cover
for me this morning?

127
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:37,940
I have outpatient clinic.

128
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,976
Yeah, I... But,
uh, it's important.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,550
Performance... You have
something to add, Dr. Benton?

130
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,315
No.

131
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,472
Then please give us the
courtesy of your full attention.

132
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,021
As a final note,

133
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,591
you should all offer
Dr. Corday your congratulations

134
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,343
since most of you
will be working with her

135
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,728
in her new position as
associate chief of surgery.

136
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,415
All departmental concerns can
be funneled through her office,

137
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,752
including O.R. schedules,
research funding,

138
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,338
uh, committee assignments,
et cetera, et cetera.

139
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,212
Uhh, thank you and
have a good day.

140
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,145
Melanoma?

141
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,747
It started as a small
mole on her back,

142
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,082
but it was stage four,

143
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,051
metastasized all over.

144
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,486
Liver, lungs, then her brain.

145
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,487
She failed chemo?

146
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,689
Six cycles.

147
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,324
Then immunotherapy.

148
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,109
Pulse ox 89 on two liters.

149
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:33,029
Possible pleural effusion.
There's fluid in her lungs.

150
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,448
Last time it was this
bad they had to drain it.

151
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:36,849
Has she had a seizure recently?

152
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,484
No. Why?

153
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:41,120
Might explain her
altered mental status.

154
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:42,788
She's been out of
it for the last month.

155
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,991
Her oncologist feels
it's the brain mets

156
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,092
or the liver failure.

157
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,392
I see.

158
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,201
Let's get a chest
x-ray, CBC, PT, PTT.

159
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,132
Look, you should know something.

160
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,934
She doesn't want to
go back to the ICU.

161
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,536
She has a "do not
resuscitate" order?

162
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,738
I just brought her in because
her breathing and pain

163
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,808
seemed to worsen. I thought you
could make her more comfortable.

164
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,444
Well, that we can do.

165
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:07,046
Oh, Mark. When did you get back?

166
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,514
Late last night.

167
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,483
Plane was delayed four
hours out of San Diego.

168
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:11,484
How did it go?

169
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:12,485
All right, I guess.

170
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,653
Rough, huh?

171
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,054
Wow, you grew in a week.

172
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,158
Thanks, Mark.

173
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,357
Dr. Carter.

174
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,927
Hey, Dr. Greene. I'm
sorry about your mom.

175
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:22,562
Thanks. What do you got?

176
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,898
Uh, 20-year-old girl,
end-stage melanoma.

177
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,199
Mark, can we have coffee later?

178
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,200
Uh, you on all day?

179
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,802
Yeah. I just started.

180
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,403
She's DNR actually.

181
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,706
Her Father just brought
her in 'cause she's in pain.

182
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,107
What is this all about?

183
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,443
What? Oh, that's Dr. Weaver's
new charting system.

184
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,144
Uh-huh, what was
wrong with the old one?

185
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,480
It's actually kind of cool.

186
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,715
There's a separate form
for every chief complaint.

187
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,383
Uh-huh. Multiple-choice
medicine?

188
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:47,720
Yeah, sort of. So anyway
I was thinking about doing

189
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,622
a thoracentesis or
tapping her belly.

190
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:50,756
Did you get a chest x-ray?

191
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,791
Yeah. Shooting now.

192
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,125
Well, I'd pull up the old ones

193
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,193
for comparison.

194
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:55,928
Mark. Welcome back.

195
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,097
Thanks, Kerry. Nice
new, uh, checklist.

196
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,799
Oh, yeah. It's
great. The T-system.

197
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,300
I'll train you on
it later, okay.

198
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,690
Can't wait.

199
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,609
Lizzie. Twenty minutes.

200
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,313
It took you 20 minutes to
come and see me. I'm shocked.

201
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:16,082
I thought it would
be five... Ten tops.

202
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:17,466
What's all this about, Robert?

203
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,667
No "Thank you, I'm honored"?

204
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,269
No "I hope I don't disappoint"?

205
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,653
Everyone thinks you're serious.

206
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,255
That's because I
am serious, Lizzie.

207
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,724
You know me, I'm bound to
ruffle a few feathers in this job.

208
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:27,193
I need you to
smooth things over.

209
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,694
Walk with me. I
have to hit the head.

210
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,263
If you wanted to
offer me a position,

211
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,663
why didn't you ask me privately?

212
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,132
Where's the fun in that?

213
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,133
I knew you'd take it.

214
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,768
I haven't taken it.

215
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,569
Oh, is that a "no"?

216
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:38,804
I didn't think so.

217
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,806
As much as you may view
me as a loathsome toad,

218
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,942
I know your pragmatic
and, more predictably,

219
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,543
your ambitious
nature will prevail.

220
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,045
You'll leapfrog
five or six years.

221
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,146
That's not the point.

222
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,610
No, the point is, I'm
handing this to you.

223
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,118
A fast-track career.
Independence in the O.R.

224
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:53,719
The freedom to make
your own schedule

225
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:55,321
with the minor
annoyance, of course,

226
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,323
of having to report to me.

227
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,059
I don't view you as a
loathsome toad, Robert.

228
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,300
Well, I can't tell you how happy
I am to hear that, Elizabeth.

229
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,324
There's a smile.

230
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,238
Oh, he's a cutie, huh?

231
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,374
You're gonna break
some hearts, aren't ya?

232
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,476
It's time for his cocktail.

233
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,644
Any side effects?

234
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,180
No. He's a trouper.

235
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,749
The pneumonia's cleared up.

236
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,118
He's eating solids.

237
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:27,036
Normal white count?

238
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,542
Yeah, 10,000.

239
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:31,690
All done.

240
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,509
Such a good boy.

241
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,266
I'm gonna miss you.

242
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,547
Is he being discharged?

243
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,799
DCFS will be here soon.

244
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:41,433
So they found a foster family.

245
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,624
No, he's going to an
Emergency Intake Center.

246
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,272
He needs foster care.
One-on-one nurturing.

247
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,858
Intake's temporary.

248
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm sure they'll find someone.

249
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,928
Someone who'll want
to adopt an HIV baby?

250
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,530
That mother is not
gonna pull though.

251
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,320
That mother died yesterday.

252
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,802
TM's are clear.

253
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,203
You talk funny.

254
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,304
Hunter.

255
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,305
Thank you.

256
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,140
Say "ah." Ahh.

257
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,776
That's 'cause he's
from very far way.

258
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,010
How far?

259
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,979
How far? So far that
it's dark there already.

260
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,915
Throat's red, all right.

261
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,468
Probably an, uh,
upper-respiratory infection.

262
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,353
So he'll need antibiotics?

263
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,056
No, usually it's viral.
Just give him lots of fluids.

264
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,390
Okay.

265
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,725
I'll come back soon, okay?

266
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,028
Uh, we should do a
rapid strep to be sure.

267
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,196
You got it.

268
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,364
So where are you from?

269
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,431
Croatia.

270
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,600
Oh. Wow.

271
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,602
Here's a prescription
if it's positive.

272
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,338
Great. Uh, you forgot Tylenol.

273
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,440
Usually the docs give a
standing order for fever.

274
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,827
Yes, but, uh, fevers
have a purpose.

275
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,112
Yeah, they tell us
when someone's sick.

276
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,848
And it's the body's natural
way to fight infection.

277
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,083
That's good, no?

278
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,751
I suppose.

279
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,621
So... why stop it?

280
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,293
Make the kid feel better?

281
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,331
Okay.

282
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:02,281
Uh, got a LOL in
three. Needs a nurse.

283
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,385
Not much I can do for
her. Hey. How ya doin'?

284
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,121
I told the mediator I'm not
trying to take Reece from Carla.

285
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,940
But I can't let Carla
take Reece from me.

286
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,891
Do you think she's
doing this to hurt you?

287
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,560
Well, she doesn't seem to care.

288
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:16,217
Do you care about her situation?

289
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,398
What is it?

290
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,800
I've just never talked to a...

291
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,973
A therapist before.

292
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,004
Dr. Benton,

293
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,339
I'm not here to
psychoanalyze you.

294
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,009
I only need to assess the
family dynamic for the court.

295
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,077
Well, it's simple. Carla
and I both love our son.

296
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:33,845
But she's trying to
take him away from me

297
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,231
so her new husband
can pursue his career.

298
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,500
How do you feel about him?

299
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,134
Who, Roger? Yes.

300
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,469
He's a decent guy, I guess.

301
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,470
Good to your son?

302
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,471
Yeah, sure. Loves him?

303
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,072
Look, why are we
talking about Roger?

304
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,675
Who cares about Roger? This
is about me, Reece and Carla.

305
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,428
Like it or not, he
factors into this.

306
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:51,530
How do you think
you'd deal with it

307
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:54,166
if Carla was able to take
Reece out of the country?

308
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,334
That's not gonna happen.

309
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,358
If it did?

310
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,661
The two most recent chest
films are June 28th and July 17th.

311
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,763
I'll take the folder.
Hey, congratulations.

312
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,197
Nice to know you're in the loop.

313
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,432
So it's true.

314
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,933
Sorry, Carter, I have a patient.

315
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,252
Aye, aye, chief. Please.

316
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:14,876
Here ya go.

317
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,636
Vanessa?

318
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:31,837
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to disturb you.

319
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,422
You're in the hospital.

320
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,240
The nursing home sent you over.

321
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,162
One of the nurses
brought this by.

322
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,831
She said you don't usually
let it out of your sight.

323
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,934
Maggie. I think so.

324
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,290
I wish I had the discipline
to keep a journal.

325
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:52,942
Oh, it's not mine.

326
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,843
Paul kept it.

327
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,050
I just like it near me.

328
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,171
Is that the sacred heart?

329
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,703
You're Catholic.

330
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:07,406
Eastern Orthodox. Sort of.

331
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,958
I hope it works out for you.

332
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,894
I'm sorry?

333
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:16,581
In the end it doesn't help
much. It didn't help Paul.

334
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,257
Hard to believe in a God that
does that to a man like him.

335
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,195
Too bad.

336
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,265
Heaven sounds good right now.

337
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,732
Would you like
to talk to a priest?

338
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,372
Oh, God, no.

339
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,318
We have them on call.

340
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,653
Ah, don't trouble yourself.

341
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:38,904
It's really no bother.

342
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,511
Oh, really, don't.

343
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,125
Bob.

344
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,427
Hi. Hi.

345
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,628
Did you get my page?

346
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,731
I'm sorry, I'm
swamped. What's up?

347
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,766
You're discharging the
Ortega baby to Intake?

348
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,300
Yeah, I couldn't find anybody.

349
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,402
I'll take him.

350
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,503
What?

351
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,472
I'll take him
home. I'll take him.

352
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,973
You're a licensed foster parent?

353
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,175
No, but I can become one.

354
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,209
That's nice of you

355
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,711
but I'm afraid
not very realistic.

356
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,613
Why not? Well, you
have to be screened first

357
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,081
then have a few
months training...

358
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,082
I-I can do all of that

359
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,784
and take care of
him in the meantime.

360
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,219
It has to be better than Intake.

361
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,272
He needs a mother.

362
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,857
Do you have any other children?

363
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,659
No. I can focus on him.

364
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:17,793
Support system?

365
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,861
I can do it.

366
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,518
I don't know. It's not policy.

367
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,649
Maybe it'll be a good,
short-term solution

368
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,452
until I can find a
licensed foster parent.

369
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,037
Or until I get licensed.

370
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,288
Let me look into it.

371
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,289
No promises.

372
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,313
Okay.

373
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,909
Hey.

374
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,444
Mwah!

375
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,129
Hey, Reece.

376
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,664
How are you doing?

377
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,865
Hey, Carla.

378
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:40,866
Peter.

379
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,034
Ms. Simmons?

380
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,252
I'm Debra Wexler.

381
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,353
Hi.

382
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,554
Whenever you're ready.

383
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,555
Uh.

384
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,019
Go ahead. It's pretty painless.

385
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,143
Go ahead, Reece. Go to Mommy.

386
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,178
Go ahead. Go. Go.

387
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,233
Oh, I know. I know. It's okay.
Hey, man. It's okay. It's okay.

388
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,967
Hey, Reece.

389
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,869
Hey, I'll see you later, huh?

390
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,188
I'll see you later. I love you.

391
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,644
I know. I love you.

392
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:16,902
Loculated fluid around
the lungs and lots of mets.

393
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,358
Is this going to help?

394
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,606
Belly was pretty tense.

395
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,341
It's gonna relieve
some abdominal pain

396
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:26,178
and take pressure
off the diaphragm.

397
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,747
But she's still going to
have trouble breathing.

398
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,448
This is three liters.

399
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,449
Okay.

400
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,993
I'll take this to the lab.

401
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:36,555
You have a payphone around here?

402
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,090
I'm gonna have
to call her mother.

403
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,514
Sure. I'll take you.

404
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:47,149
I'll be right back, okay?
I'll be right back. Okay.

405
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,464
You didn't call.

406
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,903
Oh, I... Sorry, I got in late.

407
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,050
You okay?

408
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,506
Yeah.

409
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,987
How's your dad?

410
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,294
We'll see.

411
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:15,132
He was shaken up
but... I don't know.

412
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,768
Numb.

413
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,192
Mom was okay.

414
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,127
And then, boom. Heart attack.

415
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,864
It's gonna take a while for
it to sink in for him, I guess.

416
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,249
And you?

417
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,587
I don't know.

418
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,770
I did hear a vicious
rumor about you.

419
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,472
Really? Which one?

420
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,709
Well, it was actually, uh,
more of an announcement.

421
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,311
It was as much a
shock to me as anyone.

422
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,913
What is he up to?

423
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,415
Oh, you know Robert. He
always has to be dramatic.

424
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,406
Yeah, but why'd he pick you?

425
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:57,669
I don't know.

426
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:00,133
Perhaps he thinks
I'm a talented surgeon.

427
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,763
That's not what I meant.

428
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,146
You're not gonna
take it, are you?

429
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,153
I was considering it, yes.

430
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,200
Okay. What?

431
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,224
Nothing.

432
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,387
So I'm going to have
to deal with Romano.

433
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,873
Well, he's a small price to
pay for such an advancement.

434
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,842
It's better than anything
I could get at rush.

435
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:20,992
If you say so.

436
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,494
Stop it.

437
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,330
If you feel the need
to express an opinion,

438
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,881
at least articulate it.

439
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,282
Fine.

440
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,834
You can't trust that guy.

441
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,101
He screwed you in the past.

442
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,087
He's not gonna
hesitiate to do it again.

443
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,839
But I think you know that.

444
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,103
Yes, and it's my
problem, isn't it?

445
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,932
I think it will be.

446
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,400
Okay, Rick, you're on
soup and milkshakes

447
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,435
for a couple of days.
Stitches come out in five.

448
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,905
When can I get this pierced?
Gonna put that thing back in?

449
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,940
Screw that. I'm not
gonna let those losers win.

450
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,009
Good for you, bro. I'll
see ya next time then.

451
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,577
Finally got ahold
of Plastics, huh.

452
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,745
Nice job, huh?

453
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,046
Did you even call 'em, Dave?

454
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,548
Yeah, I called 'em.
They tried to recruit me.

455
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,585
Hey. I need two milligrams
of morphine for Mrs. Braga.

456
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,586
Braga?

457
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,621
Your LOL.

458
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,006
Oh, yeah. Sure.

459
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,290
Don't you want to see her?

460
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,425
No, I trust you.

461
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,727
Is that roach coach
out there all day?

462
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,895
Yeah.

463
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,963
Hi, I sent up peritoneal fluid.

464
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,833
Patient name:
Stehly. S-T-E-H-L-Y.

465
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,624
Medical record
number: 4-5-2-9-8-6.

466
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,457
Okay, thank you.

467
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:27,058
Hi. How are you?

468
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,594
How are you?

469
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,362
I'm famished. I was
in the neighborhood,

470
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:33,032
so I thought I'd stop by and see
if you wanted to get some lunch.

471
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,400
In the neighborhood?

472
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,691
Yeah. I had a meeting
in the Hancock Building.

473
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,790
So can you slip away?

474
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:44,660
I don't know. Um...

475
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,262
Hey. Whose rig is that?
Yo, Betsy, whose rig is that?

476
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,530
What are you screaming about?

477
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,532
Paramedics who drive
that rig, where are they?

478
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,501
I don't know. Try
the cafeteria. Why?

479
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,135
Hey, Dave, what's goin' on?

480
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,871
Call 911! Construction
site accident!

481
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,207
Well, hang on a second! Hold on!

482
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,942
You're busy. Tonight?

483
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,246
Tonight's a given.

484
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,664
What are you doing,
Dave? Gotta help this guy.

485
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:07,366
His friend is trapped.
What happened?

486
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,867
Workin' the crane,
dropped a beam,

487
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,569
we can't get him
out. Ran here for help.

488
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,237
A block away. Your
friend conscious?

489
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,322
No. Is he breathing?

490
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,656
I don't know! Are you coming?

491
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Hold on.

492
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,079
County to dispatch,
we have reports

493
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,848
of a construction site accident
on the 1200 block of Clybourn.

494
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:25,283
We need you there code three.

495
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,588
Come on, man, let's go,
We don't have time. Come on.

496
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,271
Docs responding.

497
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,024
If he's breathing,
we don't touch him.

498
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:34,048
Yes, Mom.

499
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,280
It's right there!

500
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,883
How'd it happen? Oh, God.

501
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,685
The choker must have
slipped. It swung right into him!

502
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,220
Coming through. Come on, doc

503
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,690
Hey, I want you to be careful!
I don't want you to burn him!

504
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,058
I almost got it!

505
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,559
Anybody call 911?

506
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,794
Ain't you the 911 guy?

507
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,897
Nah, you get the
real deal, my friend.

508
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,299
Go back to the truck and
make sure Gordy called! Go now!

509
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,634
Sir? Sir, can you
tell me your name?

510
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,920
- What's his name?
- Joe. Joe Sanders.

511
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:02,921
Mr. Sanders!

512
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,122
Be careful!

513
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:05,790
Pulse: weak and thready.

514
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,247
Mr. Sanders!

515
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:09,495
His leg is totally crushed.

516
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,746
I don't see his chest moving.

517
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,965
We gotta tube him. We
gotta get in there first.

518
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:15,417
You can reach him,
right? Yeah, but I can't see.

519
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,553
We gotta do it.

520
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:18,921
Ever done a blind intervention?

521
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,422
No, but we gotta do something.

522
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,507
I'll do it.

523
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,225
Come on, let me.

524
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,561
This isn't a teaching case.
Find a window. Be my eyes.

525
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,146
All right. I'll talk
you through it.

526
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,581
Hey, watch it!
Something's loose!

527
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:30,983
All right, where am I?

528
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:33,352
Move to the left. No,
wrong way, wrong way.

529
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,603
My left or your left?

530
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,842
My left, your right.

531
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,240
Okay.

532
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,708
Okay, that's his cheek.
You gotta move over.

533
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,759
That's his ear.

534
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:44,113
There you go, there
you go. Move up.

535
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,948
There you go, there
you go. Open it. Bingo!

536
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,515
You got it?

537
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,751
Hold on.

538
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,518
Have you done this before?

539
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,503
Once.

540
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,088
On a cadaver.

541
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:56,375
All right. All right...
There's the epiglottis.

542
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,377
I'm in the vallecula.

543
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,833
All right.

544
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,181
Put it down the right pipe.

545
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,205
Yeah.

546
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:07,708
I hear EMS boys.
Too little, too late.

547
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:10,477
All right, I'm in!

548
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:23,035
Amy, you need to keep
that mask on, okay?

549
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,391
Amy.

550
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:29,636
I can't... breathe.

551
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,580
Amy, my name is Dr. Greene.
You're in the hospital.

552
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,404
Your father brought
you here. Okay?

553
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,303
I need you to keep that mask on.

554
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,371
Okay?

555
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,861
Help me.

556
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,146
Amy,

557
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,751
I can give you some morphine
to make you more comfortable.

558
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,236
Not today.

559
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,859
What?

560
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,674
I don't want to die today.

561
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,199
Do you want me to
put you on a ventilator

562
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,417
to help you breathe?

563
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,185
Is that what you want?

564
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,391
There's a good chance

565
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:21,515
you'll never come off of it.

566
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:28,021
I Don't want... to die.

567
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:33,427
Lydia.

568
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,025
I need rapid induction,

569
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,361
15 milligrams
etomidate, 100 of sux.

570
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,362
You're gonna intubate?

571
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,364
Yes.

572
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,720
She's a DNR.

573
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,385
Not anymore.

574
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:47,675
Let's go.

575
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,540
She was on a vent for
over two weeks in that ICU.

576
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,041
Then she had a
stent for her liver

577
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,611
and needed over eight units of
blood. Now, she's had enough.

578
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,480
Okay, listen. I
understand your feelings,

579
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,814
but this is what she wanted.

580
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,816
You don't know what she
wants. She signed a DNR.

581
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,351
Coming through. Watch yourself.

582
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,653
She changed her mind.

583
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,121
Crush injury to the left leg.

584
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,722
Why'd she tell you and not me?

585
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,507
Where's Dr. Benton?
He's on his way.

586
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,310
It's a femur fracture, why
didn't you use a Sager splint?

587
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,779
There was debate about that.

588
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:16,063
Hypotensive. Had to get
here. You were in the field?

589
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,633
Super-docs had him intubated.

590
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,634
He wasn't breathing.

591
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,068
On my count. One, two, three.

592
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,637
What do we got, people?

593
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:24,056
Crane operator versus
H-beam. Plowed right into him.

594
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,224
Multiple blunt trauma.
Crushed left femur.

595
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:28,059
Why wasn't he put in traction?

596
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,460
Crashing. We were wasting time.

597
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,229
You got it from here,
Peter? Yeah, go.

598
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,564
You've known her for
20 minutes. I'm her father.

599
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:35,566
How many times do I
need to tell you this?

600
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,769
She does not want
this. We decided.

601
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:40,638
Excuse me. I'm Dr. Weaver,
chief of the emergency department.

602
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:41,706
I've got it, Kerry.

603
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,874
Are you his supervisor?

604
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,442
What seems to be the problem?

605
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,295
My daughter is dying
of cancer, and she has

606
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,530
a "do not resuscitate" order.

607
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,284
And when I left the room,
he put her on a ventilator

608
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,484
and now he won't take her off.

609
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:54,920
She asked me to.

610
00:24:54,944 --> 00:24:56,254
She wouldn't do that!

611
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:57,956
Do you have the papers with you?

612
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,245
I can get them.

613
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,376
Maybe you should.

614
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,745
Now that your
daughter's intubated, it...

615
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,647
It gets a little complicated.

616
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,015
What are you talking about?

617
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,767
I'm not sure that we
should extubate her

618
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,671
until she's breathing
on her own.

619
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,974
BP's 90/60. Pulse, 110.

620
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,976
He's bleeding.
Peritoneal lavage. Let's go.

621
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,761
Hold on. Let the
doctor take it from here.

622
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,030
Yeah, I am a doctor. He
only thinks he's a paramedic.

623
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,165
This is Dave Malucci,
new second-year Resident.

624
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,318
Dr. Dave. Okay,
good breath sounds.

625
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:27,319
Yo, DPL. Let's go.

626
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,053
Hold on, hold on, Dr. Dave.

627
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:30,622
All right, let's get
a trauma panel,

628
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:32,691
lateral C-spine, chest
and pelvis, left femur.

629
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:33,875
Who is this guy?

630
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,877
Surgical trauma fellow.
Call him "Dr. Pete."

631
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,846
You want O-neg?
Yeah, four units.

632
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,815
Get a pressure dressing,
put him in traction,

633
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,916
set me up for DPL.

634
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,917
Is there an echo in here?

635
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:42,984
Didn't I just say that?

636
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,135
Get outta here. What?

637
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,637
I said, out. Get
out. What did I do?

638
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:47,238
I don't understand.
Dave, let's go.

639
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:49,240
Come on, I'm not
leaving. This is our patient.

640
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:50,642
You wanna be
the hero in the field

641
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,110
you gotta drop
'em off at the door.

642
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,995
Shut up! Carter. Now!

643
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,699
Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,451
Okay. Let's get a new
kit. You okay, Carol?

645
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,104
Yeah. Fine. All right.
Come on, let's go.

646
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:04,694
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

647
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,332
I can't believe you did this.

648
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,481
Mark? What are you doing?

649
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:14,082
My job, Kerry. It's
not your problem.

650
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,151
It is my problem. I'm
head of the department.

651
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,720
Eh. By title, remember?
You said so yourself.

652
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,522
I don't know what
your problem is,

653
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,390
but steal my gear
again, I'll kick your ass.

654
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,959
He wasn't breathing. They
teach the importance of an airway

655
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,361
in paramedic school? Relax!

656
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,630
We didn't know where you
were, it sounded important,

657
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,732
and it was down the street.
What if we were called

658
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,434
to a site and didn't
have our equipment?

659
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,302
It's in there. Go rip
it out of his throat.

660
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,403
Let's break it up.

661
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,272
This is not the
appropriate time or place.

662
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,406
You wanna take it outside?

663
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,473
I'll take it outside.

664
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,276
Nobody's taking
anything anywhere.

665
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,310
Zadro, go back to work.

666
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,311
What's the point?

667
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,545
I got doctors to do it for me.

668
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,203
Go back to work. Get outta here.

669
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,288
You two, hold on.

670
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,656
Hold on. Get back here.

671
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,991
Can we tell you what happened?

672
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,360
I heard what happened. Do
you have a brain between you?

673
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,029
Dr. Weaver, we
called them... No! No!

674
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,463
I talk, you listen.

675
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,333
You work<i> in</i> this
hospital, not on the street.

676
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,901
You are not trained for it.

677
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,336
You are not covered for it.

678
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,639
And you have patients
here who need your attention.

679
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:13,174
One of them might have coded.
Or... Or we might have been hit

680
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,309
with two or three other
traumas while you were off

681
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,145
playing paramedic. Were you?

682
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:20,515
Don't even start
with me, Dr. Malucci.

683
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,351
I'm only cutting you this much
slack because you're new here.

684
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,237
And you, Carter, you
should know better.

685
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:28,089
You're emergency
Residents, not paramedics.

686
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,445
Is that understood?

687
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,599
Is it understood?

688
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,107
That was great, Dave.
Thanks. I appreciate that.

689
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:44,622
We document all
consents in the chart.

690
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:46,191
Is there a problem?

691
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,393
You didn't tell me you
tested the baby for HIV?

692
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,794
I told you he was positive.

693
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,329
I thought we were assuming.

694
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:54,632
I didn't know you tested him
without the mother's consent?

695
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:56,033
The mother was comatose.

696
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:58,103
We had to get him started
on the antiviral drugs.

697
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,704
Well, who authorized it?

698
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:00,905
I did.

699
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,373
I was looking out for the baby.

700
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:04,209
We gained 10 days of treatment.

701
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,665
You broke the law.

702
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,180
Will this affect your
decision about foster care?

703
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:11,649
I'll have to
explain this. Will it?

704
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,685
No. You obviously
care about the child.

705
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,042
But?

706
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,958
It's not gonna work.

707
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:21,543
Why not?

708
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,461
The director won't
approve it. Did you ask?

709
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:26,298
I'm sorry, Jeanie. I
said I'd look into it.

710
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:27,804
I did.

711
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,943
Is it because I'm black?

712
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,058
What?

713
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,149
I'm black. The baby's Hispanic.

714
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,529
What do you take me for?

715
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,763
I'm not really sure.

716
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,532
'Cause you'd rather
put him in a facility

717
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,367
even after I told you
that I would take him.

718
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,970
You're not qualified.
It's as simple as that.

719
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,514
Is it because of my HIV status?

720
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,525
It doesn't help.

721
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,777
Look, I'm healthy.

722
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,429
There's no reason to think that
I won't continue to be healthy.

723
00:28:58,453 --> 00:28:59,948
What about when the child is 5?

724
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,949
When he's 10? Can
you say that then?

725
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,451
Can anyone say that?

726
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,270
Look, I don't know how to
tell you no any other way.

727
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,306
I know his needs.

728
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,130
I would be bet...
It's no, Miss Boulet.

729
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,628
The answer is no.

730
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,763
<i>Lavage is negative.</i>

731
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,966
Lost a few liters from
the popliteal artery.

732
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,167
What's the tibia look like?

733
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:22,237
Fracture in 20
pieces. Ah, it's a mess.

734
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where
do you think you're going?

735
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,740
Shirley cleared O.R. 1.

736
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,442
Yeah, thanks for
buffing him up, Peter,

737
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,843
but Lizzie can
take it from here.

738
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,211
Yeah, but he's a trauma patient.

739
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,347
Indeed he is. And this
trauma fellowship of yours

740
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,416
is through the ER,
correct? Yeah? So?

741
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,368
So that's an O.R.
That's for surgeons.

742
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:39,003
I've been operating the last
three weeks as a trauma fellow.

743
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,672
Yes, I know. But
now as chief of staff,

744
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,176
I have to be concerned
with credentials.

745
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:45,460
You chose this. Not me.

746
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,812
Elizabeth, I leave it up to
you. Under no circumstances

747
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,647
is that man to go into
that operating room,

748
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:50,849
call security if you have to

749
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,484
and enjoy your
first solo surgery.

750
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:54,118
Solo? Yes.

751
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:56,621
An associate chief
can operate by herself.

752
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:57,756
Dr. Benton.

753
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,680
Peter?

754
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,068
Hey.

755
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:12,336
You okay?

756
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,472
Uh, this case.

757
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:16,474
That dying girl...

758
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:19,099
Dad's called a lawyer. Weaver...

759
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,397
Forget it.

760
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,400
Mark, maybe you
should take a few days off.

761
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,601
I-I just had a week off.

762
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,020
That wasn't a vacation, Mark.

763
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:32,173
Losing a parent is
as stressful as it gets.

764
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,464
I oughta get back to work.

765
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,083
Why isn't he here?

766
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,352
Vanessa?

767
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,376
I'm sorry?

768
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:47,455
Is who coming?

769
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,140
<i>El padre.</i> The priest?

770
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:50,725
Why isn't he here?

771
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,327
No. You told me not to.

772
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,696
I don't want to go alone.

773
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay. Okay. He'll be here.

774
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:01,102
Jeanie, I didn't know
that you were considering

775
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,871
becoming a foster parent.

776
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,806
Robert Martin called
me this afternoon

777
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,841
asking for a referral.
I think that'd be great.

778
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,176
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it's not gonna work out.

779
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,311
Why not?

780
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,179
I didn't get a clear answer.

781
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,048
I guess too many things
stacked against me.

782
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,283
Is there anything I can do?

783
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,118
No. Thanks, Kerry.

784
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:20,688
Some things aren't meant
to be. I'll see you tomorrow.

785
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,858
Next time wait till they
stop swinging at the piñata

786
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,060
before you dive
for the candy, okay?

787
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,630
Excuse me. Mark.

788
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:31,666
Uh, Mr. Stehly's
making a lot of noise.

789
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,535
I'm gonna need a detailed record

790
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,102
regarding the care
of his daughter.

791
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,705
Your new charting
system should help.

792
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,274
This is serious, Mark.

793
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,358
Do you understand the
position you put us in?

794
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:44,261
I followed the standard of care
based upon my patient's wishes.

795
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:45,613
She's over 18.

796
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,417
She signed a DNR and gave
her father power of attorney.

797
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,484
She still has rights.

798
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,037
Dr. Greene, Amy's throwing PVCs.

799
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:53,104
How many? Ten to 12.

800
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:54,838
Did you give her
lidocaine? Not yet.

801
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,690
Just want to make sure
she's no longer DNR?

802
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,691
Yes. No.

803
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,260
So, what do I do if she codes?

804
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,261
Resuscitate her.

805
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,379
No, Carter, don't.

806
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:02,580
Kerry, she's my patient.

807
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:05,133
I can't allow you to
ignore a standing DNR.

808
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,234
She revoked her DNR.

809
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,302
She can't. Yes, she can.

810
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:08,770
Not with altered mental status.

811
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:09,854
Did you see her CT?

812
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,523
That girl has mets
all over her brain.

813
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:12,891
She's on morphine.

814
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:13,908
Probably hypoxic.

815
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,943
I talked to her, Kerry.

816
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,312
She was clear,
conscious and alert.

817
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,313
Well, I didn't see that.

818
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,169
You're gonna have to trust me.

819
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,719
I'm not sure you're in
the state of mind right now

820
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:25,904
to be objective.

821
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:28,106
Kerry... Perhaps, I should
take over on this one.

822
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,107
I've got it covered.

823
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:31,376
Mark, I'm taking this patient.

824
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,681
You're gonna
have to fire me first.

825
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,853
So, what do I do if she codes?

826
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:38,749
Nothing, Carter.

827
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,807
You do nothing.

828
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:46,112
If she codes, call me, Carter.

829
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,078
Randi, are you
sure this list is right?

830
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,545
I've paged Father Erps twice.

831
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,614
Oh, I think he's on
sabbatical in Brazil.

832
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,449
There's a junior
Jesuit subbing for him.

833
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,550
Well, where's his number?

834
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,852
It's around here somewhere.

835
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,988
Find it, Randi. The lady
doesn't have much time.

836
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,923
Lucy, where's Malucci?

837
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:02,924
He prefers "Dr. Dave."

838
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:03,925
Whatever. Where is he?

839
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,393
I don't know. Try
the Coast Guard.

840
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,095
Maybe he's off doing
search and rescue.

841
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,830
What's the problem?

842
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,865
This woman's BP
is down to 60 palp.

843
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,868
Her kidneys have shut
down. She needs dopamine.

844
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:14,936
I got it. Really?

845
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,137
Yep. Thank you.

846
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,238
Carol, have you seen Mark?

847
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,305
He was just here.

848
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,306
Is he still on?

849
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,642
I think so.

850
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,709
Hey, Elizabeth.

851
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,078
I hear you laid up
today in the O.R.

852
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,079
"Laid up"?

853
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,213
Golf term. Played it safe.

854
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,517
Lived to cut another day.

855
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,119
That's not a criticism. We
all get more conservative

856
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,687
when we're in the driver's seat.

857
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,522
Welcome to the big leagues.

858
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,090
Listen, Robert. About Peter...

859
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,760
Peter, Peter, Peter. Don't you
ever get tired of that subject?

860
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,762
He accepted this
fellowship on the assumption

861
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,930
he'd be operating on his
trauma patients. He's a...

862
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,916
I know. I'm just
messing with him.

863
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,285
So you'll let him operate?

864
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:50,004
Mm. For you, Lizzie... anything.

865
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,006
But only on trauma,
not elective cases,

866
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,107
and no general surgery.

867
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,876
Naturally. I want
you to police him.

868
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,043
I don't wanna deal with it.

869
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,545
Fine.

870
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,448
So, is that an official
acceptance of my offer?

871
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,817
I suppose it is, yes.

872
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,819
Wise choice. I'll
see you tomorrow.

873
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,321
Oh, uh, here's a,
uh, termination list.

874
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,173
We need to cut loose
some dead weight,

875
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:11,637
and it'll sound better
coming from you.

876
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,362
Dr. Corday.

877
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,464
Uh, Carter, have you seen Mark?

878
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,966
Uh, he's around here someplace.

879
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,735
Uh, I think you saw a patient
of mine in Radiology today.

880
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,237
Nichols? Your patient?

881
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,973
Yeah. Came in a couple
weeks ago. Fender bender.

882
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,541
Said she had some
minor cervical tenderness.

883
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,843
Did I miss something?

884
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:31,045
No, it was nothing
to do with an accident.

885
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,313
She came for a second opinion.

886
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:36,017
Ah. On, uh... On what?

887
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,474
Infiltrating duct
cell carcinoma.

888
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,390
Breast cancer.

889
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,026
So she's, um,
looking at surgery?

890
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,928
Has to have a
mastectomy, I'm afraid.

891
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:47,945
Mm.

892
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,981
Carter! This girl's in V-tach!

893
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,182
What? Trauma 1!

894
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,383
You need some help?

895
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:53,839
No. No, I got it.

896
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:56,653
She have a pulse? A weak one.

897
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,688
What's her BP?

898
00:34:57,712 --> 00:34:59,690
Sixty palp. Paddles are ready.

899
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,227
Dr. Carter?

900
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,796
Get Dr. Greene. Get my cardio.

901
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,864
Let's open up the pads.

902
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,449
No need, Haleh. She's a DNR.

903
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,951
Dr. Weaver...
It's all right, John.

904
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,804
I understand that you're
in an awkward position.

905
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,423
You... You're
gonna let her arrest?

906
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,625
I'll take it from here.

907
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,060
How about a chemical code?

908
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,128
No.

909
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,513
This woman is not
to be resuscitated.

910
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,482
Just an amp of lidocaine.

911
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:27,184
John, she has no chance
of a meaningful recovery.

912
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,786
She wanted this.

913
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,771
Her family wants it.

914
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,073
Don't touch her.

915
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:44,402
I know.

916
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,372
I know.

917
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,008
But I want to believe.

918
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:52,197
Now you can.

919
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,136
He forgives me?

920
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,706
He forgives you.

921
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:03,576
Can you bless me, Father?

922
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,002
Padre.

923
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,076
Where is she?

924
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,310
V-fib.

925
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,902
Damn you, Kerry. All
right, Carter, start CPR.

926
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:49,221
Let's charge to 200.

927
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,057
Haleh, charge to 200 now.

928
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,777
Okay, Kerry, you're chief.
You need to make a decision.

929
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,279
We do this, or I go.

930
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,494
Ready.

931
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:18,496
Clear!

932
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:26,779
<i>Clear!</i>

933
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,223
Three hundred.

934
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,058
Charging. Push in amp of epi.

935
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,093
How far are you gonna go?

936
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,311
She wanted a ventilator.

937
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,896
Did she say she wanted this?

938
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,597
Clear!

939
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,740
Clear!

940
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,158
<i>Still in V-fib.</i>

941
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,127
All right. One more time,
360. One hundred of lidocaine.

942
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:52,196
Did she say she wanted
you pounding on her chest,

943
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,281
shocking her heart?

944
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,955
Shut up, Kerry!
Or get outta here!

945
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,975
Clear!

946
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,229
<i>Asystole.</i>

947
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,552
You want atropine?

948
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:30,406
You want atropine?

949
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,125
No. It's over.

950
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,349
Time of death, 20:34.

951
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,433
Mark, I...

952
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,089
Hey there. Hi.

953
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,391
What are you doing here?

954
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,392
I need to talk to you.

955
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,493
What's wrong.

956
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,994
I've been thinking... Uh. Oh.

957
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,264
No, listen. That day
when you proposed to me,

958
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,099
most of me just
wanted to scream "Yes!"

959
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,868
and run to the courthouse
and do it right then.

960
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,170
Most of you?

961
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,606
But the rest of me was scared.

962
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,141
I... I knew that I loved you.

963
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:31,546
But I've just been with this
little baby who needed a mother.

964
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,470
And I knew instantly that I
wanted to be that mother.

965
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,892
I didn't wanna say yes
for the wrong reason.

966
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,045
I see.

967
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:46,276
But they told me today
that I can't have him.

968
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,478
Baby, I'm sorry.

969
00:39:47,502 --> 00:39:48,879
No, it's okay.

970
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,447
It's okay because I know

971
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,084
that I really do
want to marry you.

972
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:54,841
I know that now.

973
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:57,021
Hm.

974
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:58,388
Do you still want to marry me?

975
00:39:58,412 --> 00:40:00,452
Yes. Okay.

976
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:03,127
Isn't it a sin to
fake a sacrament?

977
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,463
It was a blessing. Anyone
can give a blessing.

978
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,965
Not posing as a priest.

979
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,868
It was her faith. That's
what's important, right?

980
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:13,037
So how did you know what to say?

981
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:15,339
I faked it.

982
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:17,391
You know, a little bit of Latin,

983
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,759
a little bit of Croatian.

984
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,694
You faked it well.

985
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:23,502
Ooh.

986
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,184
Are you all right?

987
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:30,387
Yeah. Yeah. It's
just, uh, there active,

988
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,023
moving around down there.

989
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,164
May I?

990
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,393
What?

991
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,221
You know.

992
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,776
Don't you?

993
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,115
Yes.

994
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,531
You should just leave now.

995
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:18,550
Elaine.

996
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,425
Peter.

997
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,548
Peter!

998
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,896
Did you hire a
private investigator?

999
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,387
What?

1000
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:43,103
Some guy talked to Dafina

1001
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,038
and asked her if
I've ever done drugs.

1002
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,241
Whoa, Carla, the only
person I hired was my lawyer.

1003
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,308
Well, did he get this guy

1004
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,877
to start asking
questions about me?

1005
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,233
No!

1006
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,583
I... I... I don't know.

1007
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:56,650
Why are you doing this?

1008
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,852
Why am I doing this?

1009
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:00,053
The restraining
orders and lawyers...

1010
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,574
Carla, I only have one son.
Roger can get another damn job.

1011
00:43:03,598 --> 00:43:05,876
This is a great
opportunity for us, Peter.

1012
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,611
What about Reece, huh?

1013
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:08,612
Ever think about that?

1014
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:10,113
You wanna take
him from his father?

1015
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:11,604
You may not even be his father.

1016
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:15,986
What?

1017
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,522
He might not be yours.
Th-there was somebody else.

1018
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:21,080
It was just casual.
And then there was you.

1019
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,861
I did it for Reece.

1020
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:26,963
Now, he needed a father,
and Roger can be that...

1021
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:28,687
Look, Reece is my son, Carla!

1022
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,760
Reece is my son.
