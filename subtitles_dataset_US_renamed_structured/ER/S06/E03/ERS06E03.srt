1
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,337
Hi. I'm here to see Dr. Weaver.

2
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,872
She went that way,
handing out badges.

3
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:30,896
Excuse me?

4
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,747
"Creativity, accountability,
respect, excellence." Hm.

5
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,899
That's a lot to live up to.

6
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:41,051
Hm. Malik. Yeah.

7
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,552
This man's looking
for Dr. Weaver.

8
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,120
This way. Hurry
up, man, I'm dying.

9
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,823
You'll be all right. Let's
go. Have a seat right here.

10
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,260
This guy's got a cut. A
cut? The bitch stabbed me!

11
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,727
What'd she stab you with?

12
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,402
A c-carving knife. As if I was
a damn steak or something.

13
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,265
Whoa!

14
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,667
There goes the ulnar.

15
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,302
You're killing me!

16
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,755
No. Just breathe. I'm
sorry. Sit down, please.

17
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,022
Stay seated!

18
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,425
Get down. Hold still.
Don't be such a baby.

19
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,193
We can't help you
unless you stop.

20
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:10,613
Look me in the eye. Hold still.

21
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,681
Are you a doctor?

22
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,171
Just keep the pressure on it.

23
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,436
We'll use this to
make a tourniquet.

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,271
Get his arm out.
Put your arm out.

25
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,272
Wait.

26
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:21,575
Come on around this side.

27
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,443
Pump it up to 180.

28
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,362
Keep breathing. Just relax.

29
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,780
We got 180. Okay.

30
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:30,033
All right, take your hand
off. Take your hand off.

31
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:34,204
Hm. Creativity. That's what
it says on your badge, isn't it?

32
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,539
Who are you?

33
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,008
Gabe, sorry I'm
late. You all right?

34
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,442
Yeah, of course.

35
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,944
But get me a couple
of curved Kellys

36
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,346
and some 3/0 Vicryl,
and I'll be even better.

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,382
It's good to see you.

38
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:48,785
Lucy, this is Dr. Gabriel
Lawrence, our new Attending.

39
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:49,809
How do you do?

40
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,274
Mark.

41
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,675
I know, I'm late.

42
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,910
I want you to meet
Gabe Lawrence. Hi.

43
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,779
Gabe, this is Dr. Mark Greene.

44
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,482
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

45
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,184
Well, heh, don't
hold it against me.

46
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,385
Were you in an accident?

47
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,587
No, no, I, uh... I started
my shift a little early.

48
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,656
I'm sorry?

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,424
Uh, Gabe is coming
over from New Western

50
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,093
as our new Attending.

51
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,911
As our new Attending.

52
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,114
We're incredibly lucky to
have him, don't you think?

53
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,515
Absolutely.

54
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,002
We're gonna take the grand
tour. Would you like to come?

55
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,704
I've done the grand
tour. I'm gonna get this.

56
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,789
What do you got? A
28-year-old fell off his bike.

57
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:19,058
I didn't fall. A cab cut me off.

58
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,293
Passed out for two minutes.

59
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:23,046
Forehead contusions.
Vitals are stable.

60
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,247
So Reece might not be yours?

61
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,749
That's what she said.
Think she's lying?

62
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,086
I don't know. I wasn't with
her 24 hours a day, you know?

63
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,221
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

64
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,090
She's gonna use this
against me, isn't she?

65
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,824
She can't.

66
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,661
If Carla had any doubts,
she should've raised them

67
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,796
at the parentage
petition three months ago.

68
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,260
She didn't, so it's
moot. It's not a problem.

69
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,337
You've put yourself
through a hell of a lot for this.

70
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,988
Maybe you should
make sure he's yours.

71
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:49,989
Do a DNA test.

72
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,591
No.

73
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:54,982
Peter, you hired me
to protect your interests.

74
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,003
If you're looking for a way
out, she just gave you one.

75
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,510
We're gonna have to intubate.

76
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:15,514
Okay, everybody, on my
count. One, two, three. Good.

77
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:16,950
What do we got?

78
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,484
We got a 16-year-old male.

79
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,021
Single GSW to the left chest.
I'm gonna put in a chest tube.

80
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,523
Can you, uh, intubate?
I think I can manage.

81
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:27,243
15 of Etomidate, 100 of
sux, number-eight ET tube.

82
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,611
Ten blade. Help me.

83
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,513
You're gonna be
okay. What's his name?

84
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,249
Joshua Fox. That's
the only I.D. he had.

85
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,818
Okay, Joshua. They're gonna
put a tube down your throat

86
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,553
to help you breathe, okay?

87
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,954
Haleh, can you call his family?

88
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,223
Off a video card?

89
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,357
It's all we've got.

90
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,160
- Thora-Seal's ready.
- Hook me up.

91
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,013
What's this about a rescheduled
surgery this afternoon?

92
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,516
We got a cancellation, so
I moved up a mastectomy.

93
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,917
Okay, well, you
can move it back.

94
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:52,351
I've got an elective hernia.

95
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,054
I'm sorry, I am not going to
torture a woman for two weeks

96
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,774
just so some man can
have his groin patched.

97
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,109
Male surgeons decide...
Okay, okay, I surrender.

98
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,261
Hormones talking. You
can have your surgery.

99
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,930
Okay, I'm in. Bag him.

100
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:05,398
Well, there doesn't seem

101
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:06,699
to be much blood in here at all.

102
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,118
I'm gonna sew
the tube in. 0 silk.

103
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,503
Good breath sounds. Carol,
will you call up the ICU?

104
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,771
See if we can get Joshua a bed?

105
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,539
Sure. Be right back, Josh.

106
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,258
So, Dr. Corday, the
mastectomy coming in today,

107
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,027
is that Elaine Nichols? Mm-hm.

108
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,696
Thought that wasn't until...

109
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,331
It wasn't, I moved it forward.

110
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,466
Sure that's the
right thing to do?

111
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,884
It doesn't seem kind of fast?

112
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,503
Why are you so interested?

113
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,404
She's a friend of the family.

114
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,606
Really? Mm-hm.

115
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,608
Then I shouldn't discuss
it with you, should I?

116
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,465
You make sure
you get a chest film.

117
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:37,030
You finished
assisting Dr. Carter.

118
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:38,497
Good. I have something for you.

119
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,900
The<i> Chicago Gazette</i> is
sending over a reporter today

120
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,568
to do a puff piece on me.

121
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,170
But they also
wanna look at the ER.

122
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:45,671
Well, why are you telling me?

123
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:48,574
You'll show 'em around to
see what heroes we all are.

124
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,945
How we save kiddies' lives,
et cetera. Blow my trumpet.

125
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:53,446
Won't you do that
better yourself?

126
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,580
Look at you, look at me.

127
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,349
Who would you rather
spend an hour with?

128
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:57,538
You have a point.

129
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,053
Next time wear a helmet.

130
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,121
Come on, doc, give me a break.

131
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:03,789
How 'bout a fractured skull?

132
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:05,724
You wanna be fed
through a tube, be my guest.

133
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,593
Okay, okay, I'll
wear the helmet.

134
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,894
So can I go now?

135
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,186
Not yet. We need a head CT.

136
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:14,733
What's that?

137
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,735
My Core Values badge.

138
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,905
Creativity, accountability,
respect, excellence.

139
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:23,576
Wow, all that and beautiful too.
You must be some kind of nurse.

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,744
I am.

141
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:27,780
Why doesn't Dr. Grumpy have one?

142
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,650
Guess I'm out of the loop.

143
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:33,636
Oh, looks like a broken arm.
We're gonna need some x-rays.

144
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,471
Any other sign of trauma?

145
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,273
Contusion to the right shoulder,

146
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:40,926
ecchymosis of the
face and right hip.

147
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,101
And slight
tenderness to the wrist.

148
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,465
How far did you fall, Lauren?

149
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm not sure.

150
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,002
Can you tell me how you fell?

151
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,971
Uh, did you fall like this,

152
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,890
or did you fall
more on your hand?

153
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,508
Yes.

154
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:57,310
What, on your hand?

155
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,430
I... I don't
remember. I'm sorry.

156
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,516
No, don't worry, don't worry.
That's what we have x-rays for.

157
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,184
So I'll get an AP

158
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,552
and a lateral of the forearm,

159
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,354
as well as wrist
and elbow films.

160
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,995
Sure, we don't
wanna miss anything.

161
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,777
Uh, it's busy, I know.

162
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,513
Patient through-time's
longer than at New Western.

163
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,681
But our census is bigger.

164
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,150
Nah, busy is good.
Busy keeps you young.

165
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,486
I'll just take a look
at that fellow in Three.

166
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,556
Look at that. How cute
is that. Thanks, guys.

167
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,424
Now, what's in
here? It's so heavy.

168
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,660
Something to spice
up your wedding night.

169
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:34,129
Oh, Conni. You shouldn't have.
Spice up my wedding night?

170
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,466
Sure, nice hot gumbo
to keep up his strength.

171
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,334
Jeanie, is this your
last shift for a while?

172
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,870
Yep, catching a plane
at 6:00 to New Orleans.

173
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,272
Then in the morning, Reggie
will make me an honest woman.

174
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,674
Then I'm gonna
show him the town.

175
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,676
Show him a wild time
in New Orleans, honey.

176
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,043
I'm sure you'll be very happy...

177
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,812
Oh, didn't I give you
a Core Values badge?

178
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,947
A toddler chewed it.

179
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,249
There you go.
Always wear it. I will.

180
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,074
Guess you can, uh, take it
off on your wedding night.

181
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:00,506
All right, now, open your eyes.

182
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,308
Relax.

183
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:04,176
What three things did I
ask you to remember?

184
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,578
A dog, fire truck
and Brigitte Bardot.

185
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,247
Excellent. Ah.

186
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,548
Dates me, I know,

187
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,517
but your first love is
always your strongest.

188
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,421
You must be Dr. Lawrence.
John Carter, Senior Resident.

189
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,990
As usual, I'm learning how
to be a doctor from my patient.

190
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:21,744
Meet Mr. Ulman. Minor
head trauma, brief LOC.

191
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,862
Can you tell me what
reflex would indicate

192
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,206
increased intracranial pressure?

193
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,767
Blown pupil?

194
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,571
No, not a reflex. Here,
observe, Dr. Carter.

195
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,539
I scratch the thenar eminence,

196
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,441
and I look for
ipsilateral contractions

197
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,776
of the muscles of the chin.

198
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,029
I see none.
Therefore, I diagnose

199
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,931
no significant head injury.

200
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,799
It's called Radovici's sign.

201
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,301
You can get dressed, my
friend. We'll get you discharged.

202
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,405
Thanks a lot, doc. My pleasure.

203
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,307
Radovici's sign? Yeah.

204
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,308
That's pretty cool.

205
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,743
Try it on your next head trauma.

206
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,777
I will if I can remember.

207
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,579
Got that migraine
in Four? Yeah, sure.

208
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,616
I'll tell you how I remember.
Radovici sounds like radish.

209
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,600
I pluck the radish
with my thumb...

210
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,905
The daycare said
he was crying all day,

211
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,073
pulling on his ear.

212
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,374
His temp's 101.

213
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:09,942
Must be a load off,

214
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,044
having a daycare
center right here.

215
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,813
Does his mom work too?

216
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,297
Yeah.

217
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,033
It's gotta be tough
on the both of you.

218
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,169
Such a sweet kid.

219
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,955
So, ahem, how's his ear?

220
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,390
He's got a nasty-looking otitis.

221
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,160
Is he allergic to
any medication?

222
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,961
Nah.

223
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,297
Okay, some Tylenol for the pain,

224
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,083
and let's put him on
amoxicillin for 10 days.

225
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,718
Did you have ear
infections as a kid?

226
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,253
Heh. No, why?

227
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,555
It's just they often
run in families.

228
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,692
Yeah, well, you know, he,
um, probably got it in daycare.

229
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,478
I mean, there's a lot
of sick kids up there.

230
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,946
Do you wanna leave
him here with me

231
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,090
until his temperature goes down?

232
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:53,293
Um, yeah. Yeah, sure.

233
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,992
Hey, I know. Come on, come on.

234
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,884
Go ahead. There you go.

235
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,168
Hello.

236
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,224
Hey.

237
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,990
Randi, has the ICU found
a bed for Joshua Fox yet?

238
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,925
The gunshot wound
kid in Trauma One.

239
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,994
No. Well, call them again.

240
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,563
Chuny, have you
seen my bicycle guy?

241
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,198
Isn't he still in Three?

242
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,634
Spandex-butt? Yep, he
was discharged by GL.

243
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,635
Who's GL?

244
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,970
Gabriel Lawrence.

245
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,072
Oh, right, the
good-looking, older guy.

246
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,776
I just saw him go into the
lounge with Dr. Corday.

247
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,746
So a Frenchman,
Dr. René Laënnec,

248
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,013
rather than press his ear

249
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,150
to mademoiselle's
magnificent breast,

250
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,085
rolled up a newspaper instead

251
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,188
and used that to... You
know, to listen to her heart.

252
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,023
Voilà, the first stethoscope.

253
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,126
Voilà, the first sensitive male
doctor in history. Heh-heh.

254
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,080
Dr. Greene, you know who
invented the stethoscope?

255
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,981
I don't.

256
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:58,205
Did you discharge
one of my patients?

257
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:00,920
I don't believe
so. Uh, Mr. Ulman.

258
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,238
Fell off his bike.

259
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,428
I wasn't aware he
was your patient.

260
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,877
Well, he was. I'd
ordered a head CT,

261
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,428
which he obviously didn't get.

262
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,695
Don't worry.

263
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,898
I performed a thorough
neurological examination.

264
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,066
He didn't need a CT.

265
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,701
He had a loss of consciousness,

266
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:18,336
which put him at risk factor
for intracranial hemorrhage.

267
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,105
Yeah, miniscule risk.

268
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,291
I gave him a head-injury
instruction sheet.

269
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,193
If he has any warning
signs, he'll come back.

270
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,028
He lives alone. If
he slips into a coma,

271
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,296
no one would know about it.

272
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,797
This isn't like New Western.

273
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,033
County patients tend
to be a little less reliable

274
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,235
when it comes to follow-up.

275
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,936
I'm aware of that, Dr. Greene.

276
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,056
That's why I told him
to call me in four hours,

277
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,173
let me know how he's doing.

278
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,425
Difficult for Mr. Ulman

279
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,377
if he's passed out
on the kitchen floor.

280
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,983
Dr. Corday, what would you do?

281
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:51,203
Uh, well, without seeing
the patient, I'd really rather...

282
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:53,306
No, I-I'd like to know.

283
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,807
What'd you do?

284
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:58,199
Fell off his bike, had a
loss of consciousness.

285
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,032
You did a complete neuro exam?

286
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,401
Yes, he was alert and oriented.

287
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,204
Full balance, recall,
normal reflexes.

288
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,072
How long was loss
of consciousness?

289
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,056
Less than two minutes.

290
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,209
And did you visualize the fundi?

291
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,745
The discs were sharp.

292
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,636
I think Dr. Greene was
just being very thorough.

293
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,750
Sounds like a "no" to me.

294
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,808
Look at it this way. We
just saved Mr. Ulman $800.

295
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,889
"A" for accountability.

296
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,113
Right.

297
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,329
Oh, she really does
meet all the requirements.

298
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,996
Well, I couldn't agree more...

299
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,131
Can I talk to you?

300
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,533
You'll get back to me later?

301
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,935
Yeah, as soon as I
can. What's up, Mark?

302
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,404
Why didn't you tell me
you were hiring Lawrence?

303
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,640
Well, I only found out he
was available two days ago.

304
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,242
Oh, so in two days
you didn't have time

305
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,876
for a five minute conversation?

306
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,212
Mark. Look, I mean,
the man is a legend.

307
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,848
He's one of the founding
fathers of emergency medicine.

308
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,883
We are so lucky to have him.

309
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,019
Couldn't you have the
courtesy to at least tell me first?

310
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,488
It's called respect, Kerry.

311
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,723
Hey, look.

312
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,380
It's even on your stupid badge.

313
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,059
Elaine.

314
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,172
John.

315
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,041
Heard you were coming in today.

316
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,597
Did you?

317
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:23,829
I asked you to leave me alone.

318
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,264
Yeah, I know.

319
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,166
I know that you
did, and I'm sorry.

320
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,568
But I really needed
to talk to you.

321
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,887
Because it's...

322
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,290
Because I don't want you to
have the wrong idea about me.

323
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,642
I don't.

324
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,444
I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

325
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,012
And for me, this
wasn't just about...

326
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,546
Sex? Yeah.

327
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,854
It wasn't about
that. It was for me.

328
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,085
And if we're
talking needs, John,

329
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:50,589
I don't need you to
feel sorry or worried.

330
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,524
Or tender or anything.

331
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,348
I just need you to go away.

332
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,251
I don't wanna go away.

333
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,988
Lauren's Johnson's x-ray.

334
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,424
Mid-shaft fracture
of the radius.

335
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,792
No injury to the wrist or elbow.

336
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,094
She was lucky.

337
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,463
Maybe not.

338
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,764
What's this?

339
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,601
Some more of Lauren
Johnson. I pulled her records.

340
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,871
See these calluses?
Healed rib fractures.

341
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,630
And this, uh, some
kind of blunt trauma.

342
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,079
Maybe a baseball bat.

343
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,347
She said she wanted to go home

344
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,082
as soon as we splint her arm.

345
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,150
You know, this is only
her second visit here.

346
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,486
But she has been
to Mercy three times,

347
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,889
McGaw twice,
Ravenswood once. I...

348
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,080
This time, I don't
want her to go home.

349
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,231
Dr. Kovac? Yes.

350
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,167
Yes, hi, I'm Lauren's
husband Pauly.

351
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,358
I just wanna thank you
for looking after her so well.

352
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:59,574
Lauren wasn't clear on how
the accident exactly happened.

353
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,760
Maybe because she's a
little embarrassed about it,

354
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,383
isn't that right, Lauren?

355
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,398
So how did it happen?

356
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:10,119
She was up a ladder in our
bedroom hanging drapes,

357
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,237
and she lost her footing.

358
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,988
Asked her not
to do it by herself,

359
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,690
didn't I, honey?

360
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,980
Yes, you did.

361
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,019
Shall I splint her?

362
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,368
Mark, can I have a word...?

363
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,537
Lizzie, Paula Trancoso,
<i>Chicago Gazette.</i>

364
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,539
Elizabeth Corday,
Associate Head of Surgery.

365
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,009
Mark Greene, one of
our, uh, ER docs. Hi.

366
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,177
You're wearing scrubs.

367
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,930
Yes, it was my idea.
I wanted to blend in.

368
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,299
Elizabeth's gonna show
Paula around the ER.

369
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,967
You don't mind, Mark?

370
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,054
If you feel that
Dr. Corday has the time...

371
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,506
Had I known the<i> Gazette</i>
was gonna send you, dear,

372
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,274
I would have made
time in my schedule.

373
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,742
But as it is, I'll
have to leave you

374
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,512
to the tender
mercies of Dr. Corday.

375
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,404
Well, uh, this is the
ER, obviously. Heh.

376
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,020
This is Josh's cousin.

377
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,657
Oh, great. Josh.

378
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:08,461
Josh, your cousin's here.

379
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:10,079
How's he doin'?

380
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,880
He looks a lot worse than he is.

381
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,898
His lung collapsed so
we put a tube in his chest.

382
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,418
You can talk to him if you want.

383
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,820
He's taching at 140.

384
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,087
Josh, are you in pain?

385
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,656
BP's 180 over 120.

386
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,640
Call Benton.

387
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,426
Maybe he's hemorrhaging.

388
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,193
His pulse is up to 160.

389
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,730
You're gonna
have to wait outside.

390
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,181
Wait outside, please.

391
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:32,384
Go outside. Come on. Go on.

392
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,453
What is it? Does the
chest tube hurt you?

393
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:36,488
What have we got?

394
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,345
He's tachy at 160.

395
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,609
What's his crit?

396
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,749
Drawing it.

397
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,269
Trouble breathing?

398
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,974
You were shot. Yes, we know.

399
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,011
Oh, my God. He's the shooter.

400
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,086
I'll call Security.

401
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,878
Hey, hold it right there!

402
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:17,947
He's got a gun!

403
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,090
Drop it!

404
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:28,824
Get down. Get down!

405
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,661
Go ahead and call down.

406
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,796
We need a gurney over here.

407
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,798
Looks like an abdominal wound.

408
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,166
Get a backboard over here!

409
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,634
Strong carotid pulse.

410
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,636
His chest is clear.
What's his name?

411
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,304
Uh, McGinnis. Joe McGinnis.

412
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,473
You guys need any help?
We're fine, thank you.

413
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,375
I want two lines,
NG and a Foley.

414
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,766
Roll him gently. Gently.

415
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,382
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three, lift.

416
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,518
CBC, coag, type and
cross for four. Call the O.R.

417
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,954
BP's 130 over 80. Pulse is 96.

418
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,956
No visible GSWs to
chest and abdomen.

419
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,125
Let's roll him.

420
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,794
See anything back
there? Any blood?

421
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,995
Nothing on the back.

422
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,697
All right, check
the extremities.

423
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,098
Where's the blood coming from?

424
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,833
Looks like he cut his hand.

425
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,768
Did he even get shot?

426
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,025
No, he fainted.

427
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,242
Is this the guy who
got shot? You need me?

428
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,610
Yeah, his hand needs suturing.

429
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,464
Suturing? That's it?

430
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:00,766
I want every piece of
equipment checked for damage.

431
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,235
I don't want anybody seizing
because their IVs are punctured.

432
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,005
Nineteen patients
accounted for. Nobody's hurt?

433
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,091
Nothing serious,
apart from the guard.

434
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,427
Two flesh wounds from ricochets.

435
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,179
Some glass cuts and
contusions from diving to the floor.

436
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,914
That's all? I mean,
there must've been

437
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,434
about 20 bullets flying around.

438
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,738
Guess we got lucky.

439
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:24,323
MVA, SUV versus truck.

440
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,092
38-year-old male driver
broke his nose on the air bag.

441
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:28,793
Where's my wife
and child? Behind you.

442
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,996
Wife has a few minor
scrapes, little boy seems okay.

443
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,498
Why the cops?
What's going on here?

444
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:34,733
Curtain Three.

445
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,701
- What do we got?
- David. He's 9.

446
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,038
Slightly tachy at
110. BP's 115 over 83.

447
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,705
Complained of chest
pain at the scene.

448
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,763
One, two, three!

449
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:46,629
Hi, David, I'm Cleo.

450
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,196
Do you know what
happened to you?

451
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,933
We were in an accident.
This truck just hit us.

452
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,085
Son of a bitch came
right through the red.

453
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,386
Look, I know my nose is broken.

454
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,055
What are you fiddling
with my face for?

455
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,108
Just checking to see if anything
else is broken, Mr. Bradley.

456
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,577
If David's okay, we
don't have to stay do we?

457
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,045
Lungs clear bilaterally.
He's still tachycardiac.

458
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,046
What do you mean?

459
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,414
We called our doctor.

460
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,083
He said they should
take us to Ambrose,

461
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,318
but the paramedics
said you were closest.

462
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,822
Are the paramedics allowed to
go against the patient's wishes?

463
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,959
Let's get a crit and UA,
C-spine and chest film.

464
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,128
Until I've done these
tests, Mrs. Bradley,

465
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,852
there's no question of
David going anywhere.

466
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,656
Elaine?

467
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,236
Is everything all right?

468
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,438
Everything's fine.

469
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,574
I... I just think maybe this
has all been too fast for me.

470
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,145
So I... I wanna go
home and think about it.

471
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,380
You know, I could do
with some fresh air myself.

472
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,714
Why don't we take a walk?

473
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,436
You wanna say goodbye?
I've done that all day.

474
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,637
Hey! Where you going?

475
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,906
You weren't gonna
sneak out on us, girl?

476
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,442
This is so beautiful. How am
I gonna get it on the plane?

477
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,210
Leave Reggie behind,
put 'em on his seat.

478
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,980
Thank you. Take care.

479
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,215
See you. Thanks. Wow.

480
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,617
Jeanie, I need to see
you. You too, Reggie.

481
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:00,986
Oh, my shift's over. I know.

482
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,643
We've got a plane to
catch. I know. Come on.

483
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,378
Carlos.

484
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,212
What's going on?

485
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,983
Ask Adele. She really put
herself on the line for this.

486
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,447
We're gonna let you take Carlos.

487
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,091
Really?

488
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,608
On a temporary basis.

489
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:25,210
And once you get yourself
approved as a foster parent,

490
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:28,919
then we can consider something
more official and permanent.

491
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,483
Thank you.

492
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,717
You're welcome.

493
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,975
So I guess we're not
going to New Orleans, huh?

494
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,411
We can still get
married here in Chicago.

495
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:42,315
We could, uh, try
the courthouse.

496
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:44,325
When?

497
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:47,098
Today.

498
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,170
Dr. Lawrence.

499
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,239
Dr. Greene. I've got her.

500
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:57,531
Uh, but next time, could
you sign up on the board?

501
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:04,883
Paperwork. You can
run, but you can't hide.

502
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,019
She's really hurting this time.

503
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,187
You've been sick
with fever, Cristal?

504
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,324
Vomiting?

505
00:22:12,348 --> 00:22:14,359
No. Just hurting. Mm-hm.

506
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,111
She's had a sickle
crisis before?

507
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,746
Same as last month.

508
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,499
We're gonna get you
something for the pain,

509
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:22,868
and then we're gonna run
some tests, okay, Cristal?

510
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:26,371
80 of Demerol, 40
of Phenergan, CBC,

511
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:27,772
chem panel and a UA, please.

512
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:28,796
Okay.

513
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,610
Chuny, is that
the sickle-cell girl?

514
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,312
Yeah.

515
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:37,349
Could you add a retic
count and a Beta HCG?

516
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:38,955
You got it.

517
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,955
Can we go now before
another gangbanger

518
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,456
starts shootin' up the place?

519
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,725
I need to talk to you first.

520
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,059
Sure, what about?

521
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,384
It's, uh, just some
forms to fill out. Please.

522
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:55,388
Something wrong?

523
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,672
I have to inform
you, Mr. Johnson,

524
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:02,825
that, uh, I believe
you're mentally ill.

525
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,259
What?!

526
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,745
"And because of your illness,
you can reasonably be..."

527
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,449
You're the one who's ill, pal.

528
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,790
What the hell do you think...?

529
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:15,587
Okay, okay.

530
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,771
I get it. I'm in the
nuthouse, huh?

531
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,033
I mean...

532
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:25,964
"And that because
of your illness,

533
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,499
"you can reasonably be expected

534
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:31,669
"to inflict serious physical
harm on yourself or on others.

535
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:34,406
"Therefore you are subject
to involuntary admission

536
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,859
and are in need of
immediate hospitalization."

537
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:39,450
Wait till my lawyer
gets ahold of you.

538
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,586
Dr. Kovac, you have
no criteria to hold him.

539
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,054
Her x-rays are my criteria...

540
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,489
If she doesn't press charges,
they don't mean anything.

541
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,758
She's gonna get up to Psych,
and they'll send him down

542
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,026
and he'll come home.

543
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,928
Hey, I don't care about
him. I care about her.

544
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:58,630
We can do nothing or
we can do something.

545
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,386
This way she has a chance.

546
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,891
I can't really run away.

547
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:10,892
Can I?

548
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:14,395
You can delay, but not for long.

549
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,732
Elaine, if you're worried
about reconstruction,

550
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,735
I can make an appointment
with a plastic surgeon...

551
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,072
What will happen to
it? After you cut it off?

552
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,607
Now you're being morbid.

553
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,731
Why? It's a part of me.

554
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:33,036
It'll go to Pathology
and then it'll be got rid of.

555
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,506
Just thrown in the trash.

556
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,455
Just medical waste.

557
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,480
And I'll have a
blob of gel instead.

558
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,097
What will it feel
like when I touch it?

559
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,716
When somebody else touches it?

560
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,936
Elaine, lots of women
have this type of surgery.

561
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,438
I can't imagine
feeling anything.

562
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,942
And if I can't, how
will anybody else?

563
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,561
I mean, how can I ever
be with anybody again?

564
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,980
You can't let this define you.

565
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:09,951
Well, it's hard not to. I
was happy with who I was.

566
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,642
That's exactly
who you'll still be.

567
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,317
I'd better come back in.

568
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,587
I may be vain,
but I'm not stupid.

569
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,192
Just...

570
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,756
Can you do something for me?

571
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,457
Of course.

572
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:36,627
When you cut,
you cut everything.

573
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,419
Don't leave
anything. You cut it all.

574
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,819
You know what the only good
thing is about the sickle cell?

575
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,572
There isn't anything
good. No, no, there is.

576
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,824
You know, there's a
disease called malaria

577
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,968
that kills almost a
million children a year.

578
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:55,697
What do you think protects
people against malaria?

579
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,165
Mmm-mmm.

580
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,706
The sickle-cell gene.
That isn't a bad thing, is it?

581
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:01,753
Thank you, doctor.

582
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:02,821
My pleasure.

583
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:04,489
She should drink
lots of liquids,

584
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,675
and bring her right back
in if she has anymore pain.

585
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,777
Sure. Say thank you, Cristal.

586
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,111
Thank you.

587
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,302
You're welcome. You can
get dressed and go home now.

588
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,320
Over here. Over here.

589
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,344
Thank you.

590
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,757
The labs come back yet?

591
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,925
No, not yet.

592
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,194
Let me know if they do. Okay.

593
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,698
Dr. Kovac. Carl
DeRaad, Psychiatry.

594
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,433
Your psychiatric hold:
way out of line, my friend.

595
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,501
Why?

596
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,203
Because to justify certification

597
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,372
the patient has to be a
danger to himself or others.

598
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,742
He is a danger to others.
Come on, just look at his wife.

599
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,010
She said she fell off a ladder.

600
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,245
Until she says different,
nothing we can do.

601
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,313
I'm sorry.

602
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,665
Have you talked to him?

603
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,866
I've seen him.

604
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,101
Dr. Kovac, I know
why you did it,

605
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,621
but I'm not even gonna take
him upstairs for an evaluation.

606
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,088
I'm going to release him.

607
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,309
Can you do me a favor? Can...?
Can you talk to him at least?

608
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,910
What's the point?

609
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:01,045
Please.

610
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:04,103
You and me, uh,
let... Let's talk to him.

611
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,185
It's the crazy foreigner.

612
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,154
They should put these
on you, you know.

613
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:12,190
Why? I'm not going
to hit your wife.

614
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,909
I never hurt my wife. Never.

615
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,179
Mr. Johnson, settle down.
We just want to talk to you.

616
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:18,746
Well, talk to her.
Go ahead, ask her.

617
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,482
Have I ever hurt
you, darling? No.

618
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,117
Will you let him go, please?

619
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,452
You want us to release him?

620
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,619
Please.

621
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,421
DeRAAD: Okay, let him go.

622
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,889
How long before
you hit her again?

623
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,657
On the way home?

624
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,127
Or maybe wait
till you get drunk?

625
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,594
Have a bad day at work?

626
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,729
What are you doing?

627
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,798
One thing I don't understand.

628
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:41,669
The x-rays show your wife
had three cracked ribs. Here:

629
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,770
How'd it happen?

630
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,039
Leave it, Kovac.

631
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,540
She fell off a ladder
again or what?

632
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,392
Uh, was it, uh, down
the stairs, maybe...?

633
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,194
Will you shut this guy up?

634
00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:50,628
Or did you just kick her, huh?

635
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,380
DeRAAD: That's enough.

636
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,698
To break her ribs, huh,

637
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:57,101
you'd have to knock her
down and stamp on her chest.

638
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,120
Wow, what a man.

639
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,144
Shut up!

640
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:06,133
Go on, then.

641
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,235
Screw you.

642
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,933
I'll kill him!

643
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:12,917
No!

644
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,136
Hey... I'll kill him!

645
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,837
Calm down! Get him off of me!

646
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,005
I'm gonna kill him!

647
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,723
Come on! KOVAC: See?

648
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:20,475
Danger to others.

649
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,776
Oh!

650
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,478
Get out of here!

651
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,502
See?

652
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:29,601
All right. All right.

653
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,904
Mark, Beta HCG on the sickler.

654
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,005
Where are they?

655
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:35,974
They walked out a
couple of minutes ago.

656
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:38,318
Lawrence, we got a problem here.

657
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,988
Mr. Powell?

658
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,802
Mr. Powell.

659
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,571
I need you to come
back in to the hospital.

660
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,572
But we just left.

661
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,257
Your daughter
needs another test.

662
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,376
But we've seen the
doctor. Cristal feels better.

663
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,360
What's going on?

664
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:56,494
She needs to come back in.

665
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:57,512
Excuse me?

666
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,018
The ICON is positive.

667
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,374
Oh, she has to come
right back in. Now.

668
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,461
Dr. Finch, Sam Jacobs.

669
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,229
I just want to thank
you for looking after

670
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,982
one of my favorite
families so very well.

671
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,317
We haven't quite
finished the test.

672
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,036
I've made arrangements for
David to be transferred to Ambrose.

673
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,228
So if you would be
so kind as to sign him.

674
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:28,359
I'm not happy about moving him.

675
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:30,662
I looked at his
C-spine. It's clear.

676
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,829
I've got an ambulance.

677
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,531
He complained of
back pain at the scene.

678
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:35,032
I'm still waiting
on a second crit.

679
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:37,168
Then when you get
that, fax it over to me.

680
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,170
It'll be a half an
hour, that's all.

681
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,404
In half an hour, Dr. Finch,

682
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:42,240
he'll be under
observation at Ambrose,

683
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,226
not taking up
precious space here.

684
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,849
We ready to roll, Sam?

685
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,334
Are we, Dr. Finch?

686
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:51,783
There's the ovary.

687
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,284
Yeah, it looks pretty normal.

688
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:54,886
What are you looking for?

689
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,087
There.

690
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:57,405
Mass in the fallopian tube.

691
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,406
What is it?

692
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,025
Fetal pole and a heartbeat.

693
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,359
What did he say?

694
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,161
There's a heartbeat.

695
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:04,896
What are you talking about?

696
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,899
There's a heartbeat.
Your daughter's pregnant.

697
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:09,500
No. She's 12 years old.

698
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:10,952
Gotta be a mistake.

699
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,121
There's no mistake.
She's pregnant.

700
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,257
But the fetus is in
the fallopian tube,

701
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,508
not the uterus.

702
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:18,609
I want a second opinion.

703
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,279
I'm the second opinion. We're
lucky we caught it early enough.

704
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:23,381
Yeah, your daughter
needs surgery now.

705
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,517
If it ruptures, it could
be very dangerous.

706
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,940
I'm gonna call the O.R.

707
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,207
Were you checking up on me?

708
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,699
No, just, uh, watching
out for the patients.

709
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:41,566
Will there be video games?

710
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,219
Sure. Video games,
TV, your own room.

711
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,821
Just like a hotel, really.

712
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,074
What's your favorite game, then?

713
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,909
David?

714
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,661
David? David, can you hear me?

715
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,895
Stop!

716
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,731
What's happening?
Why are we stopping?

717
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,500
He's tachy. Get a BP.

718
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,601
I can't get a pressure.

719
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,886
No pulse on the left.
Let's go to Trauma.

720
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,988
I don't want him staying here.
- He has to.

721
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,289
Hey, need a hand?

722
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,157
Name's David. In
rapid deceleration.

723
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,511
MVA, crashed while being
transferred to Ambrose.

724
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,045
Probably a traumatic rupture

725
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,214
at the junction of the
subclavian and aortic arch.

726
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,649
Why was he being transferred?

727
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,518
All right, we're going
to have to crack him.

728
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,519
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

729
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,903
Thoracotomy tray.

730
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,523
Where's Kerry?

731
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,957
She said she'd be here.

732
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,492
You know, this
place closes at 5.

733
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:25,527
Yeah, we know.

734
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,661
Do we really need two...?

735
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,763
Two witnesses, yes.

736
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:39,857
Suction. Let's start a
round with the packed cells.

737
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:41,042
He's in V-tach.

738
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,376
60 of lidocaine.

739
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,347
Son of a bitch. I
can't find the source.

740
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:46,914
Dr. Carter, he's
still in V-tach.

741
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,483
Stand by with the paddles.

742
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,084
I've never done
one like this before.

743
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,485
Why don't you
talk me through it?

744
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,554
Keep suctioning.

745
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,822
All right, what
you want to do is...

746
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,175
Conni, would you get
that woman out of here!

747
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,709
Ma'am, you have to leave.

748
00:31:58,733 --> 00:31:59,810
Peter, you need any help?

749
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,146
Get that woman out of here.

750
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,413
Okay, please go.

751
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:04,081
All right, get your
hands off of me.

752
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,567
Out!

753
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,736
Clamp distal to
the left subclavian.

754
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,038
Now, open the pleura to
identify the leaking area.

755
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,342
Scissor.

756
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,766
Release the clamp
distally to identify the leak.

757
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,464
I see it.

758
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:20,999
Now evacuate the hematoma.

759
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,718
Put a curved Potts
underneath the leak

760
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,942
to leave the aorta patent.

761
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,012
All right, now clamp
above the tear.

762
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,236
There you go, Carter.
You just isolated the leak.

763
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,239
Nice work, Carter.

764
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,038
Do you, Reginald Moore,

765
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,940
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife

766
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,143
to live together in
the state of matrimony,

767
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,443
to love her, honor and keep her

768
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,479
through health,
sickness and prosperity

769
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,047
whatever your future might be?

770
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,116
I do.

771
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,252
Um, I think he needs a feeding.

772
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,144
Yeah, okay. Here...
Just one second.

773
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,359
Sorry.

774
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,427
Hi.

775
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,295
Are you hungry?

776
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,964
It's okay. Go on.

777
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,467
And do you, Jeanie
Boulet, take this man

778
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,602
to be your lawful wedded husband

779
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,704
to live together in
the state of matrimony,

780
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,005
to love him, honor and keep him

781
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,041
through health,
sickness and prosperity

782
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,509
whatever your future might be?

783
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:22,533
I do!

784
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:29,267
No, it's not unusual.

785
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:32,036
This is a teaching hospital,
and Residents are here to learn.

786
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,138
So they're allowed
to practice on patients.

787
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,040
How else do they learn?

788
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:38,309
A bit tough on whoever
they're learning on, isn't it?

789
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,344
Residents are
carefully supervised.

790
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:43,080
What I saw wasn't
carefully supervised.

791
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,516
Uh, well, I'm sure you've
seen enough, don't you?

792
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,384
It was really, really
nice to meet you,

793
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:50,343
and I do look forward to
reading your article, okay?

794
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,425
Mark, thank God
I got rid of her.

795
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,128
Yeah, you better be careful she
doesn't turn up somewhere else

796
00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:58,796
disguised as a surgeon.

797
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,298
Did she get in the
way in Trauma?

798
00:34:00,322 --> 00:34:01,565
Yeah.

799
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,701
Mark, I didn't ask
to be her tour guide.

800
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:06,165
Yeah, well, you didn't say no.

801
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:09,724
How's it going?

802
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,726
Fine. Heard about
your Psych hold.

803
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,827
Hm!

804
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,229
Yeah, I'm very
popular with Psychiatry.

805
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,698
They took him
upstairs for assessment.

806
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,966
Maybe they'll hold him.

807
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,300
I don't think so.

808
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,536
I provoked him, in
front of witnesses.

809
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,472
Well, maybe now she'll see
what he's really like, you know?

810
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,274
You don't think she knows?

811
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,610
Yeah, I know, it's hopeless.

812
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,712
Maybe not. She didn't
go upstairs with him.

813
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,781
Lucy took her to the cafeteria.

814
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,282
Fingers crossed.

815
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,505
Yeah.

816
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,425
We got David stabilized.
He's in surgery.

817
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,894
Barring any complications,
he should be okay.

818
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,079
If you want to go and see
him, the nurse will take you.

819
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:50,848
Thank you.

820
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:52,138
Thank you, doctor.

821
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:55,809
Dr. Finch.

822
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,924
You did well to catch that.

823
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,760
If we'd waited for the tests
we would have seen this.

824
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,779
We could have operated
in a controlled manner,

825
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,065
rather than having to rip
an 8-year-old's chest open.

826
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:08,316
We had no choice.

827
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,817
I did.

828
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,508
I shouldn't have let
myself listen to you.

829
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,501
How are you feeling?

830
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:29,203
Okay.

831
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,272
It went well.

832
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,508
There was no evidence
the cancer had spread,

833
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:36,110
but we will have to wait
for the pathology reports

834
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,428
on the lymph nodes.

835
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,814
I got a plastic
surgeon in to close,

836
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,432
so we could minimize scarring.

837
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,635
And of course, within
the next couple of weeks,

838
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,408
we can begin reconstruction.

839
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,222
When can I go home?

840
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,558
Well, we had to
put in some drains

841
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,694
to collect any
accumulating fluid.

842
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,113
Like I'm a sewer system.

843
00:35:55,137 --> 00:35:58,199
Most likely it'll just
be for the night.

844
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,440
So you'll be able to
go home tomorrow.

845
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,488
Now, I've given the
nurse all my numbers.

846
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:06,691
So if you need anything,

847
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:10,950
you have any questions,
just call anytime.

848
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,887
Thanks.

849
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,703
Oh, Dr. Kovac, now that,
uh, Dr. Lawrence is here,

850
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,628
I don't believe that we're gonna
be needing you anymore, okay?

851
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:25,443
Okay.

852
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:28,045
Hey, are you on tonight?

853
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,103
No. No, I'm not.

854
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,061
All right, how much
fluid did you give him?

855
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:45,563
Two liters. What do we got?

856
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:48,165
Seventeen-year-old. Two
gunshot wounds to the right chest,

857
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:49,400
one to the left.

858
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:52,136
BP 90 over 60, pulse
120. Intubated in the field.

859
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,071
Okay, he needs
bilateral chest tubes.

860
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:55,707
One for you and one for me.

861
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:58,376
Malucci, you do a
central line. Right IJ.

862
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,240
On my count. One, two, three.

863
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,715
Two chest tubes and a
central line. Let's move it.

864
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:05,016
I've only got one chest tray.

865
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,084
Then get another one.

866
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:07,490
We'll share. 10-blade.

867
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:12,256
Here.

868
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,958
BP's down to 80. Pulse ox 92.

869
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,392
Curved Kelly.

870
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,728
20 cc's for the labs.

871
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:18,479
Thanks. O-neg's here.

872
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:19,835
Chest tube.

873
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:23,701
Get this damn
thing out of my way!

874
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,703
Somebody grab
this badge. Flip it.

875
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:26,737
Here. Here you are.

876
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,539
All right. Stitch, please.

877
00:37:28,563 --> 00:37:30,774
I'm in. Lock and
load the infuser.

878
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,098
BP's down to 70.

879
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,412
100 cc's on the right.

880
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:36,179
We got bleeding on
your side, Dr. Greene.

881
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:37,715
Okay, where's Benton?

882
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,539
He's o... Off at 6.

883
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,549
Conni, we need a
surgeon down here now!

884
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:50,317
Give me the Foley.

885
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,814
Foley. Come on,
come on, come on!

886
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,565
30 cc syringe for Dr. Greene.

887
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:55,866
What are you doing?

888
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,068
Check the balloon.

889
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:59,391
What are you doing?
Check the balloon. Come on.

890
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,491
You can't put pressure on
the bleeder from the outside,

891
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,947
we'll do it from the inside.

892
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,947
Pressure's down.
Another tube of O-neg.

893
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,449
All right. Tell me when.

894
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,405
20 cc's. Uh-huh.

895
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,743
There's 30 cc's.

896
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:22,427
Chest tube output's
down to a trickle.

897
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:23,828
Pressure's up to 80.

898
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:27,064
Old Army trick for
tamponading the subclavian.

899
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,466
Cool.

900
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,722
Very cool.

901
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,963
Okay, let's get
him up to the O.R.

902
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,180
Dr. Carter?

903
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:58,028
How is she?

904
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:00,886
She's resting comfortably.
You can go in if you like.

905
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,634
Hey, Luka.

906
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,668
Hey.

907
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,803
Want a lift?

908
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:23,855
What, in that?

909
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,990
It's my mom's.

910
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:27,942
I had to pick up
some stuff from work.

911
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,443
What, baby stuff?

912
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,444
Yeah.

913
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,748
Okay.

914
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,638
Here we are.

915
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:41,756
Yeah.

916
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,379
Let's see...

917
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Oh.

918
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,513
Oh. Ooh.

919
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:50,631
Hey.

920
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,951
Jeanie, let's get him
one of these, huh?

921
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,252
He's 9 months old.

922
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:57,455
Uh, yeah, but you... You're
never too early to start.

923
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:02,748
Ooh.

924
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:08,065
What do you think, Carlos?

925
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:09,567
You think your daddy's silly?

926
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:11,018
What about this, Carlos, huh?

927
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,353
You like one of these? Whoo!

928
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,143
"Pull over. Pull over."

929
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,992
He is silly.

930
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:22,329
Elizabeth, I wanted to
apologize for, uh, being abrupt.

931
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,431
You mean rude. Yes.

932
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,166
I'll think about it.

933
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,936
You know, you could apologize
actually for that head CT crack.

934
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,506
What? No way on earth
am I gonna apologize for that.

935
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,807
You put me on the spot.

936
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,909
Yeah, but I expected you
to give the right answer.

937
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,479
The right answer?

938
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,580
That Lawrence is still
bugging you, isn't he? Hm?

939
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,581
Yeah, well...

940
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,384
Just because he can
diagnose somebody

941
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:46,120
without having to order
every test in the book.

942
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,821
He may have some
fancy moves in Trauma,

943
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,324
but he doesn't know how to
function in an inner-city ER.

944
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,259
You're afraid you
might learn something?

945
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,861
He's too slow. He spends
hours with every patient,

946
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,297
and then he ties
up the Residents

947
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,966
chattering on about
the Radovici sign.

948
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,033
The what?

949
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,836
You... You don't
know about that?

950
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,003
No, what is it?

951
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,672
I don't think I should tell you.

952
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,961
Mark.

953
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:11,444
Look, just one more. Come
on, Reece, please. Okay.

954
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,881
Maybe not.

955
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,316
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

956
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,785
What are you doing?

957
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,471
Hey, Jackie, you
think he looks like me?

958
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:23,790
Hope not. He's got
enough problems.

959
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,195
When I was a kid, did I
have a lot of ear infections?

960
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,563
I don't know, Peter.

961
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,449
I was your sister,
not your mother.

962
00:41:31,473 --> 00:41:33,367
You were a scrawny,
little thing, though.

963
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:36,003
Always coming down
with something or other.

964
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,871
No wonder you got into medicine.

965
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,061
Mm, thanks.

966
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:42,481
I'll take him up to bed, okay?

967
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,679
All right.

968
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,181
You do the
washing up, all right?

969
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,449
Alrighty. And dry up

970
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,717
and don't leave everything
just sitting on the side.

971
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,971
Yeah. Hey, hey. Hey.

972
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:56,423
I love you. Do you love
me? Do you love me?

973
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,591
All right, get out of here.

974
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,181
Come on, my baby.

975
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,081
You live here?

976
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,315
I told you it's in the water.

977
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,859
Yeah, but I mean,
is it sanitary?

978
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,841
Sure.

979
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,422
What do you do in winter?

980
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,313
In the winter I go south.

981
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,382
Like the birds.

982
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,597
Thank you for the lift.

983
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,988
Sure. See you.

984
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,494
Sure.

985
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,939
Well, you scratch
the thenar eminence,

986
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:04,141
which causes
ipsilateral contractions

987
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,475
of the muscles of the chin.

988
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,779
Definitely contracting.

989
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:10,046
Is that a good thing?

990
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,315
Sadly, no.

991
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:16,454
It indicates increased
intracranial pressure.

992
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:19,089
Disturbances of the brain.

993
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:22,030
Which explains why
you're working with Romano.

994
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,606
<i>♪ Seems so far away ♪</i>

995
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:35,828
<i>♪ I fell in love with you ♪</i>
