1
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,962
Mark?

2
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,198
Mark, I'm cold.

3
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:22,687
All right, Dad.

4
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,824
I'll get you a blanket.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,977
Did you get any sleep?

6
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,313
You look awful.

7
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,647
I'm fine.

8
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,605
I need to turn up
your oxygen, Dad.

9
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,287
If you still have
trouble breathing,

10
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,739
I'm gonna have to
put you on a mask.

11
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:47,357
No mask.

12
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,825
We'll see.

13
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,378
You ought to go back to work.

14
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,746
Maybe later.

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,882
I wanna make sure
you're comfortable.

16
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,868
In that case, how 'bout a drink?

17
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,336
What?

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,289
I've got a hankering
for a bloody mary.

19
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:05,325
Your mother used to
make them for brunch.

20
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,044
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

21
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,349
Why, you think
it's gonna kill me?

22
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,519
With or without Worcestershire?

23
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,075
Without.

24
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:22,865
But I'll take a dash of Tabasco.

25
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,399
John? Yeah?

26
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,933
What's all the racket?

27
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,870
Oh, sorry. I'm just trying
to get back into shape.

28
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,956
When did you get this equipment?

29
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,758
Couple of days ago.

30
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:39,876
I didn't mean to wake you.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,379
You know me, I'm
up with the birds.

32
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,380
How did you sleep?

33
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,947
Like a baby.

34
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,166
Good.

35
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,801
Well, I'll let you get
back to your regimen.

36
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:50,759
Toast and coffee for breakfast?

37
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,724
I feel like pancakes today.

38
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,766
Well, I think we
can manage that.

39
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,451
Morning.

40
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,508
Morning.

41
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:08,989
Is everything all right?

42
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:11,491
I only got your answering
machine last few days.

43
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:14,027
Aw, I'm really
sorry. It's been crazy.

44
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,096
Tess had a bad cold. The
kitchen was being repainted,

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,132
so we've been
staying at my mom's.

46
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:22,274
Well, anyway, happy birthday.

47
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,924
Luka, they're beautiful.

48
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,308
I picked them from my garden.

49
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,547
M-my neighbor's
garden, actually.

50
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,799
How did you know
it was my birthday?

51
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,123
I have my ways.

52
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,000
Dr. Kovac, we need
you. GSW coming in.

53
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,925
See you later. Okay.

54
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:52,925
Looking sharp, Carter.
Where you been?

55
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,828
Uh, I was actually checking
out, uh, condos in Lincoln Park.

56
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,863
Very trendy. And expensive.

57
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,832
Too many damn
yuppies, if you ask me.

58
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:01,267
You're a yuppie, Dave. No way.

59
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,336
Young urban
professional. That's you.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,705
I am not. Hey,
chief, am I a yuppie?

61
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,141
No, but you will be
when you grow up.

62
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,742
Look, Dr. Greene
won't be in tonight.

63
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,911
I need somebody to
cover his shift again.

64
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,179
Carter, Malucci?

65
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:15,515
All night? Yeah,
you can flip for it.

66
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,117
I'll do it. You will?

67
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:20,052
I'm the senior Resident.
It's my responsibility.

68
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,821
Thank you, Dr. Carter.
You can nap later.

69
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,156
Malucci'll cover for you.

70
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,558
Dr. Weaver, your EMS
meeting's been changed to 10.

71
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:26,826
This morning? Yeah.

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,094
Where's Carol? Over there.

73
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:29,118
Carol!

74
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:31,353
Carol!

75
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:35,502
You didn't hear me calling you?

76
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,603
No, what's up?

77
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:38,471
Okay, I need the
paramedic compliance data

78
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,839
on aspirin and chest pain.

79
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,041
Okay, I'll get to it.

80
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:44,977
I put a memo in your box
last week. You didn't see it?

81
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,879
Oh, God, Kerry,
I must've forgot.

82
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:48,248
The meeting's in two hours.

83
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,650
I know it's a lot, but I need
you to compile the data.

84
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:51,684
I will. I will get to it.

85
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,508
You'll do it? I will do it.

86
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,330
I made you some French toast.

87
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,669
You want the TV on?

88
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,972
No.

89
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,996
Okay, Dad, lean forward.

90
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,140
You in pain?

91
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,497
Ugh! When I take a breath.

92
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:21,620
Probably pleurisy
from the pneumonia.

93
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,072
We'll try Toradol.

94
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:28,317
This oughta make
you feel better.

95
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:34,851
Hungry?

96
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,080
No.

97
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,170
Come on, why don't you eat?

98
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,074
For me. Huh?

99
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,340
Just take one bite.

100
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:49,030
Please?

101
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,584
Aww, I'll eat.

102
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:03,723
His lungs are still wet.
What did you give him?

103
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:05,725
Lasix, nitro and
morphine. Excellent.

104
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,261
But his blood gas shows he's
acidemic and retaining CO-2.

105
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,530
His pulse ox is dropping. 85.

106
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,866
He's tiring out. Conni,
set us up for an intubation.

107
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,169
Mr. Remmes, we're gonna put
a tube down your throat, okay?

108
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:17,993
Anything to help me breathe.

109
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,390
This one's a little tough.

110
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,059
Have you done a COPDer before?

111
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,194
Never tubed anybody.

112
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,662
Well, time to step
up to the plate.

113
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,898
Hey, I heard you guys had a
patient in respiratory distress?

114
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,133
We're on top of it.

115
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,118
I was about to take Abby
through an intubation.

116
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,920
Good. Then we can
try this new Airway Cam.

117
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,755
Abby, if you don't mind.

118
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,475
Slip this right
around your head.

119
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:42,145
Then as she intubates,
we'll be able to see

120
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,647
exactly what she sees on the TV

121
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,016
and make any adjustments.

122
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,601
Cool.

123
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,403
You ready, Abby?

124
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:52,071
Yeah. Hi, Mom.

125
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,190
Dave, why don't give
your patient 20 of etomidate

126
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,659
and start bagging him?

127
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,782
Right.

128
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,396
Everything looks okay.

129
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,864
No bleeding?

130
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,898
Nope.

131
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,868
Good, now I can go home.

132
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,003
You vomited blood
and fainted at work.

133
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,755
The IV needs to
stay in a while longer.

134
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,323
But y-you said I could leave
if everything checked out.

135
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,925
Yes, but your
potassium level's low.

136
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,959
We need to replenish it.

137
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:15,461
Where'd you put the lab slip?

138
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:18,164
Uh, the printer's down.
I got it off the computer.

139
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,433
You've wasted enough
of my time already.

140
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:23,019
Nurse, get my clothes. Whoa.

141
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,587
What's wrong?

142
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,324
Nothing. Just a little dizzy
from sitting up too fast.

143
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,510
Your pulse is weak, which
means you're dehydrated.

144
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,045
You can go after
this fluid runs in.

145
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,449
All right. But that's
it. Then I'm outta here.

146
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:37,617
Okay.

147
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,285
Lydia, can you assist
me in making sure

148
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,421
all of Claire's discharge
papers are in order?

149
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:42,445
Sure.

150
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,744
Her gag is absent,
tooth enamel's eroded,

151
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,178
she's severely malnourished.

152
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,548
She's anorectic and bulimic.
I don't want her leaving.

153
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,715
What can we do?

154
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,179
We'll get Psych to
put a hold on her.

155
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,386
What do you got?

156
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,989
Hammer vs. scalp.
We're going up to CT.

157
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,090
Have you seen Carol?

158
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,591
Not since early
this morning, why?

159
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,761
She's supposed to be
working on my paramedic data.

160
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,362
Did you page her? Twice.

161
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,529
It's her birthday.

162
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,265
I bet some of the
nurses took her

163
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,666
to Doc Magoo's for breakfast.

164
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,657
Certainly hope not.

165
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,539
All right. Go for it, Abby.

166
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,341
Scissor the mouth apart.

167
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,365
Enter on the right. Sweep
the tongue to the left.

168
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,315
Slide that bad boy
all the way down.

169
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,240
Hold on. Just advance slowly
until you see the epiglottis.

170
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,587
See it.

171
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,588
So can we.

172
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,922
A little bit more.

173
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,291
Now lift it up with your tip.

174
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,677
This is pretty cool,
Carter. I gotta admit.

175
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:41,848
No, wait, wait. Lift in the
direction of the handle.

176
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:43,933
You could have a lot of
fun with this camera, huh?

177
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,218
See the vocal cords.

178
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,108
Good, now pass the tube.

179
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,113
Good.

180
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,194
Wasn't so hard.

181
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,812
It's easy when you
got a good teacher.

182
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,635
You're right.

183
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:01,801
Dad, you're wheezing again.

184
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,803
You want another
breathing treatment?

185
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:04,992
No.

186
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,742
Having any chest pain?

187
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:10,743
No.

188
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,835
That last stuff
worked pretty good.

189
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:19,018
Just mixing up your antibiotics.

190
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,012
Damn it!

191
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,079
What?

192
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,569
Broke.

193
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,652
Ow! Now what?

194
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,653
Cut my hand.

195
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,905
You're bleeding on the floor.

196
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:40,356
Yeah, yeah, I know.

197
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,275
Shouldn't you keep
pressure on that?

198
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,860
I know, Dad.

199
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,745
Keep your hand above your heart.

200
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,830
That's supposed
to stop the bleeding.

201
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,070
You need stitches.

202
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,673
I'm not leaving you here alone.

203
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,276
You're the doctor.

204
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,044
The circulation in your
leg is poor, Mr. Fulton.

205
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,680
We need an arteriogram
to check your blood flow.

206
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,582
When my dad first
came, the doc couldn't feel

207
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,750
a pulse in his foot.

208
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,968
When was that?

209
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,525
About a month ago, right?

210
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,039
The doctor took the
dead skin off his toe,

211
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,175
told him to soak it,
gave him some ointment.

212
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,694
My shoe didn't fit right.

213
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,762
Rubbed my toe raw. Ha!

214
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,314
The toe is gangrenous now.

215
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:24,104
And you have an
ulceration on your leg.

216
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,821
We will have to operate.

217
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,540
How bad is it?

218
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:34,627
We'll probably have to
amputate below the knee.

219
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,579
Amputate? SON:
How could this happen?

220
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,914
That first doctor gave
my dad some pills

221
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,149
and told him to take aspirin.

222
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,917
We never knew this
could be this serious.

223
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,553
Remember who
treated your father?

224
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,921
Some foreign guy.

225
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,340
Kovac? Yeah.

226
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,631
Dr. Kovac.

227
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:52,679
Lydia, I'm off to Mark's.

228
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:53,813
Is it his dad?

229
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:56,148
No. Mark cut his
hand. He needs sutures.

230
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,450
Peter's covering for me.

231
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,519
Make sure Psych comes
down here to see Claire.

232
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:01,220
Don't worry. She's
not going anywhere.

233
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,388
I put her on on a slow drip.

234
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,256
She's got a couple
hours left on that bag.

235
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,291
Thanks.

236
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:06,793
I'm still massaging the data.

237
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,294
I'll make the
presentation in June

238
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,062
with three months'
worth of figures.

239
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,366
Okay, thanks.

240
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:13,899
Carol, where you been?

241
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,901
Daycare. Tess has
been cranky all morning.

242
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,102
I just postponed my meeting

243
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,571
'cause I didn't
have your report.

244
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,939
I didn't get to finish it.

245
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:21,240
You're the paramedic liaison.

246
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,942
You're supposed to
stay on top of stats.

247
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,644
I know, I've just
been incredibly busy.

248
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,612
You shoulda given
the job to another nurse.

249
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:27,814
I can handle it. Okay, look.

250
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,615
I know that your
babies take a lot of time.

251
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,484
If you need to cut
back on responsibility...

252
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:32,485
No, I'm fine.

253
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:33,852
You sure? Because I can't afford

254
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,555
to have things fall
through the cracks.

255
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:36,556
I can handle it.

256
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Good.

257
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,643
Carol? What?

258
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,948
Delivery guy dropped
this off. I signed for it.

259
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,873
Oh, God. It's, uh, from Doug.

260
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:55,497
Let's see. What did he give you?

261
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,963
Animal crackers.

262
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,166
That's a weird birthday present.

263
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,622
No.

264
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,387
It's this thing we used to do.

265
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,305
Whenever he'd go to the store,

266
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,641
he'd come back with a
box of animal crackers.

267
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,927
And I'd always put one
in his Christmas stocking.

268
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,184
Kind of like a tradition, huh?

269
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,406
I think I'll take the
foreign body in the eye.

270
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,474
Carter's got it.

271
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,342
Then I'll take the
hip dislocation.

272
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,911
Carter's got that one too.

273
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,080
Tell Dr. Carter if he wants
to see all the patients,

274
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,280
I'll be happy to go home.

275
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:38,150
He left you Mr. Barclay
in Chairs. Wound check.

276
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,174
Swell.

277
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:42,622
Mr. Barclay? Finally.

278
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,123
I've been waiting
for three hours.

279
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,625
This thing's
draining like crazy.

280
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,727
Malucci, your CHF
guy dropped his sats.

281
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,261
You have to go back to Chairs.

282
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,429
What's taking so long?

283
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,998
My patient just
stopped breathing.

284
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,599
Would you take
this guy? Yeah, sure.

285
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,701
I burnt my arm last week
cleaning out the furnace.

286
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,003
Hurt like a son of a bitch.

287
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,871
Why don't you remove
the gauze? We'll look.

288
00:12:58,895 --> 00:12:59,872
Hey, doc.

289
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,306
Excuse me.

290
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,642
Kenny Lattimer, four.

291
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,110
Been seizing for 20 minutes.

292
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:06,411
No response to two of
Ativan. Please help him.

293
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,681
Don't worry, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll take care of Kenny.

294
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,283
Yosh, prep the Pedes ER and
draw up another two of Ativan.

295
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,569
Hey, I was here first!

296
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,636
Ativan's on board.

297
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,306
Draw a CBC,
Accu-Chek, cath a urine.

298
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,475
Pulse ox is dropping, 92.

299
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,910
Has Kenny ever had
seizures before? Never.

300
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,279
He's always been healthy.

301
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,681
Could he have ingested
any medicine, poison?

302
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,416
No, we... We keep
everything locked up.

303
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,719
He complained of a sore
throat last night, that's all.

304
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,019
Any fever this morning?

305
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,988
Just a little. I tried
to get him to eat,

306
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,189
but he only wanted to sleep.

307
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,191
Then the next thing I
knew, he was shaking.

308
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,127
Push 600 of phenobarb
over 10 minutes.

309
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,096
We've got to stop this.
You want to intubate?

310
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,630
Only if his sats keep dropping.

311
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,483
Blood glucose is
really low. It's under 40.

312
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:45,651
Seizures can lower
the blood sugar.

313
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:49,427
Push 50 cc's of D-25
and get Weaver now.

314
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:51,908
Dr. Kovac?

315
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,209
Yes.

316
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,211
Do you remember seeing
a patient, Chet Fulton,

317
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,813
African-American, early 60s,
came in about a month ago

318
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,383
with a vascular insufficiency
and an ulcerated toe?

319
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,550
Do you have his chart?

320
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,976
Uh, yeah. Mr. Fulton's
back with gangrene.

321
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,856
Yes, I remember him.

322
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,359
I débrided the wound
and gave him Trental.

323
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,727
Sorry he's back.

324
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,763
Well, now I have to do a
below-the-knee amputation,

325
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,098
which could have been avoided

326
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,234
if he had been seen
in Vascular clinic.

327
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,636
As you can see in the
chart, I made the referral.

328
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,704
Uh, he's a high-risk
patient with no insurance.

329
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,540
He lives alone. He
needed follow-up.

330
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,443
And I provided that. I made
an appointment with Vascular.

331
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,012
I can't be responsible for his
medical care outside the ER.

332
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,014
But did you put him on
the nurses' callback list

333
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,449
or did you phone him yourself?

334
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,868
Do you call back every
patient you see down here?

335
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:38,387
The ones at
high-risk I do. Really?

336
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,039
Older African-American men
are at high-risk for amputation.

337
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,608
They're not treated
aggressively.

338
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,243
You should know that. I do.

339
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,795
Well, then why
didn't you call him?

340
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,996
What are you saying?

341
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,697
There's more to
emergency medicine

342
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,383
than treating and
streeting patients.

343
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:53,574
That's one more thing
you don't have to teach me.

344
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,058
- How long's he been seizing?
- Thirty minutes.

345
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,860
Load him with Dilantin, 300 mg.

346
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,962
What's his blood
sugar? Still under 40.

347
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,130
Push another 50 of
D-25. I don't understand.

348
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,233
How can the glucose
level still be so low?

349
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:09,769
Could be an insulinoma
or a metabolic disorder.

350
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,070
Haleh, give me an ammonia,

351
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:14,473
an insulin level
and a uric acid.

352
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,858
Seizure stopped.

353
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,660
Okay, start him a dextrose drip.

354
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,245
Check blood sugar
every 20 minutes.

355
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,664
His brain can't tolerate
another seizure.

356
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,332
Why isn't he awake?

357
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:27,420
It's normal for him to sleep
after something like this.

358
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,054
But he will wake up, right?

359
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:30,289
Why don't you stay with him?

360
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,257
Otherwise, he
might be frightened

361
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,843
waking up in a strange place.

362
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,711
Thanks. Thank you.

363
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,055
Thanks, doctor. Thanks.

364
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,185
Get a head CT and an EEG.

365
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,786
What are you
thinking? I don't know.

366
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,423
The D-25 should've
corrected the hypoglycemia.

367
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,857
Something else must be going on.

368
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,926
Check the labs, make
a differential diagnosis,

369
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,261
start hunting for zebras.

370
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,565
Okay.

371
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,433
Hey, Chuny, is
this your patient?

372
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,900
No, he's Carol's.

373
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,536
Can you change the
IV bag? It's empty.

374
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,139
No, I got a guy
puking all over Exam 2.

375
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,409
Carol. Your patient in
Curtain 3 needs a new IV.

376
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,433
Oh, yeah, right.

377
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:19,538
Hey, Carol. It's not like
you to let an IV run dry.

378
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,507
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,009
Is there something
bothering you?

380
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,143
I'm fine. Are you sure?

381
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,311
If you have a problem
with me, Kerry,

382
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:27,379
just go ahead and say it.

383
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,481
Don't get so defensive.

384
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,349
I'm just asking what's going on.

385
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,784
I'm taking care of 10 patients.

386
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,186
I have two babies up in daycare.

387
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,073
And you're
constantly on my back.

388
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:40,231
Stay on top of things and
I won't bother you again.

389
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,298
Forty-five-year-old guy
crossing the El tracks

390
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:47,299
tried to beat the train.

391
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:48,767
Got knocked down
but not run over.

392
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,102
Lucky guy. BP is 80 over 40.

393
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:52,104
Gave a liter of saline,
intubated in the field.

394
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:53,706
When is somebody
gonna look at my arm?

395
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,174
I came all the way
here on the bus...

396
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,341
Would you just take a seat?

397
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:58,082
<i>And three...</i>

398
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,431
We got a couple
rib fractures here.

399
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,699
BP's 75 palp.

400
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,468
All right, let's prep
for a central line.

401
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,219
This guy's gonna
need some fluid.

402
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,321
Absent-breath sounds.
This dude's got a pneumo.

403
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:10,388
Hey, chest-tube tray.

404
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,857
Hold on, I'm
prepping for Carter.

405
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,926
Why does it take so
long for a wound check?

406
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,528
'Cause this guy's
trying to die on us.

407
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,129
Get out of here!

408
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,831
Soon as I pop this baby in,
his pressure will shoot back up.

409
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:22,501
You can't assume that.
He could be losing blood.

410
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,203
Malik, stand by
to fluid resuscitate.

411
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:26,972
Did I ever tell you the story
about my first chest tube?

412
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,874
Love to hear it, but
sick people await. Ciao!

413
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,710
Cliff-diver hit the
rocks. What a mess.

414
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,411
I'm in. You done, Dr. Carter?

415
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,296
Not yet. MALIK:
Pressure still 75.

416
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,198
So much for your
chest tube, Dr. Dave.

417
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,733
Could be blood in the belly.
Malik, get me an ultrasound.

418
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,535
That guy just stole
my rig! What guy?

419
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,721
Your wound-check patient.

420
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:43,227
Oh, that sucks.

421
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,479
You're good at this.

422
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,715
Thank you.

423
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,616
The way you did the sub-Q layer,

424
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,918
you hardly need
to close the skin.

425
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,954
That's the point.

426
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:02,391
Is he giving you a
hard time over there?

427
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,959
No, David.

428
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,112
He's being a very good patient.

429
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,646
Huh.

430
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,081
Okay.

431
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:12,952
We'll remove those in five
days. Shouldn't leave a scar.

432
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:14,725
Thanks.

433
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,122
Keep it dry for two days

434
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,723
and put a plastic
bag around your hand

435
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,509
when you take a shower.

436
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,710
I know.

437
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,133
I know you know.

438
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,052
Looks like he's having
difficulty breathing.

439
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,076
Should I give him
another treatment?

440
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,441
I can't breathe.

441
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:39,249
But I can still hear
every word you say.

442
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,848
Can I make you some lunch?

443
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,152
I'm not hungry.

444
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,269
But stay.

445
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,943
Have some tea.

446
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:53,959
I'd like that.

447
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,683
Huh.

448
00:18:57,654 --> 00:18:59,732
Heard you've got
an unstable patient.

449
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:01,433
Blunt chest trauma.
Tension pneumo.

450
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,469
Still hypotensive
despite a chest tube.

451
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:06,138
Probably cracked his spleen.
- Hold on.

452
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,356
His neck veins are elevated.

453
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,140
I'm worried about
fluid around the heart.

454
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:10,810
You should be
worried about the belly.

455
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,411
Let's check for a
cardiac tamponade.

456
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:15,598
I'd be checking the
belly. You're right, Carter.

457
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,933
He's got a big effusion
around the heart. Go for it.

458
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,436
Why don't you give me a spinal
needle and an alligator clip?

459
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,771
Here. Now you
can check the belly.

460
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,740
Watch for injury current.

461
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,076
Belly's looking pretty clean.

462
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,381
You're hitting the
heart. Pull back.

463
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:32,430
I've got good return.

464
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,933
Okay, pulse is stronger.

465
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,102
Need another
syringe? I think I'm okay.

466
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:39,646
Why don't you
call for an ICU bed?

467
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,029
Good job, Carter.

468
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,528
Dr. Weaver? Yeah.

469
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,530
I did a Medline search
on the boy with seizures.

470
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,834
And? Hypoglycemia,
elevated ammonia,

471
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,969
and no ketones are
consistent with M-CAD,

472
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,370
a rare metabolic disorder.

473
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,595
Get a Genetics consult. Talk
to the parents. Good pickup.

474
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,044
How you doing?

475
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,113
Okay.

476
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,313
Look, uh,

477
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,884
I'm sorry I came
down so hard on you,

478
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,119
but I depend on you.

479
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,710
You were right. I need to
be more on top of things.

480
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,758
Carol, you're the
best nurse here,

481
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,392
but something's
going on with you.

482
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,896
I-i-is there anything
that I can do to help?

483
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,067
Not really. I just need some
time to figure a few things out.

484
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,469
I've worked with
you for five years.

485
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,026
I know you.

486
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,546
I hate my life.

487
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,285
I Mean, I... I love my work.

488
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,542
And I love my daughters, but...

489
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,898
How did I end up raising
twins by myself? It's just...

490
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,085
You know, I think
you need some time.

491
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,353
I think that you
have some sick days.

492
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:03,755
Used 'em all up.

493
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:07,092
If you check, you'll find
you have some extras,

494
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:09,866
which you can use
whenever you like.

495
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,938
Thank you, Kerry.

496
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,397
You said Kenny would wake up.

497
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,732
Your son's genetic
disorder prevents him

498
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,868
from burning fat for energy.

499
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,370
When he got sick, his
blood sugar dropped,

500
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,622
and that caused his seizure.

501
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:38,290
Is he gonna have brain damage?

502
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:40,558
We should wait for
the results of the EEG.

503
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,327
I don't understand.
Kenny was born here.

504
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:44,396
Why didn't someone
tell us he had this?

505
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,865
Unfortunately, Chicago
hospitals don't test

506
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,217
for these rare
metabolic disorders.

507
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,086
Are you saying
other hospitals do?

508
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,638
In some states.

509
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:53,772
If we'd have known,

510
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,295
is there anything
we coulda done?

511
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,345
Dr. Chen, please.

512
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,485
Tell us.

513
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,499
If you had given
Kenny sugar water

514
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,101
when he fist got sick,

515
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,804
you could have
prevented the seizure.

516
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,189
Sugar water?

517
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:11,774
Oh, my God.

518
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,115
Hey, just sent our
patient up to the O.R.

519
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,150
Hope you didn't cause
any myocardial damage.

520
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,619
Not to worry, Dave. It was
as easy as threading a needle.

521
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:28,490
<i>Hello? I'm in the ambulance,
bringing in some sick people.</i>

522
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,491
What unit is this?

523
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,992
<i>How the hell should I know?</i>

524
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,660
<i>I was on my way to
Mercy for a wound check</i>

525
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,129
<i>when they flagged me down.</i>

526
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,763
Who is this? <i>Joe Barclay.</i>

527
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,132
That's your wound-check guy.

528
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,601
Hey, this is Country General.
What the hell are you doing?

529
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,170
<i>Heading back. I got people
here puking their guts out.</i>

530
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,472
<i>Ate some bad kielbasa.</i>

531
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,240
Is that the jerk that
stole my rig? Yeah.

532
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,608
Are the patients stable?

533
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,110
<i>I don't know, man.
They're puking.</i>

534
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,978
Okay, don't let them
puke on the floor.

535
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,045
I just cleaned my rig.

536
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,481
I'm gonna let you take this one.

537
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:55,401
You've already established
a relationship with the patient.

538
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,168
Call me if there's any change.

539
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:58,192
I will.

540
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:03,642
David, I'm leaving now.

541
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,977
I have to get back
to the hospital.

542
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:08,630
A doctor's work is never done.

543
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,549
I'm afraid so.

544
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,651
Wait.

545
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:15,521
I have something
I want to give you.

546
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:20,859
Mark, get that little green box
out of the top dresser drawer.

547
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,227
It's not necessary.

548
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:23,933
I know.

549
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,568
These belonged to Mark's mother.

550
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:32,971
I gave them to her
on her wedding day.

551
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,912
I want you to have them.

552
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,360
I can't.

553
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,121
Please.

554
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,378
They're lovely.

555
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,566
Thank you.

556
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,797
Don't just stand there.

557
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,920
Help her put them on.

558
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:19,373
She looks... beautiful,
doesn't she, Mark?

559
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:22,876
Yeah. She does.

560
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:33,231
Hello, Jing.

561
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:35,200
No, it's Jing-Mei.

562
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,036
What's the matter? You
seem upset. Somebody die?

563
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,871
We should be
screening babies here

564
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,439
for rare metabolic disorders.

565
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:42,840
What are you talking about?

566
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,509
I took care of
a little boy today

567
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,378
who had a seizure
because we didn't give him

568
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,246
a $25 test when he was born.

569
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,049
Well, if we tested for every
genetic disorder in the book,

570
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,417
we'd spend millions of dollars

571
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:53,919
to identify a tiny
handful of kids.

572
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,120
Oh.

573
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:56,989
But if I had known what he had,

574
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,657
I would have treated
him differently.

575
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:01,026
I might have been able to
stop the seizure more quickly.

576
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,694
Don't blame yourself.
It's a question

577
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,429
of allocation of
precious resources.

578
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:06,331
We have to draw
the line somewhere.

579
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:07,733
We should offer the tests.

580
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,434
Well, we can't afford it.

581
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,437
Why don't you explain
that to my patient's family?

582
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:14,706
They're in the PICU,
waiting to see if their son

583
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,210
ever comes out of a coma.

584
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,929
They wouldn't stop puking.

585
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,497
Strong radial pulse here.

586
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,700
This guy is stable. ABBY:
Belly's soft on this one.

587
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:27,002
We got a father/daughter
MVA. Can you give me a hand?

588
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,870
These guys are fine.
Start a liter of saline

589
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,506
and titrate five to 10 of
Compazine. Come on, Abby.

590
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,274
Come with me. Can I
get my wound checked?

591
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,676
You'll get your wound checked.

592
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,112
Rear-ended at moderate
velocity while stopped at a red.

593
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,848
Six-year-old girl in the back
seat complains of neck pain.

594
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,717
I wanna stay with my daddy.

595
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,384
Dr. Dave is gonna
take good care of you.

596
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,286
Dave, work her up.
Abby and I'll take the dad.

597
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,488
Driver's a 35-year-old
male, no seat belt.

598
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,257
Knee versus
dashboard. Facial lac.

599
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,425
Was the wife informed?

600
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,194
They're divorced.
She's in Pittsburgh.

601
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,262
Daughter was here
visiting. Dislocated knee.

602
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,031
My knee hurts like
you wouldn't believe.

603
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,132
Had six of MS.

604
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,834
Let's give him another
ten of morphine.

605
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,202
Ever reduced a patella? No.

606
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,674
Well, you will now.

607
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,343
Did you see my patient?

608
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,711
I'm just finishing the note.

609
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,979
Thank you.

610
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:14,549
Don't thank me yet. I'm
removing the Psych hold.

611
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,318
You can't be serious.
This young woman's

612
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,552
starving herself to death.

613
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,354
She might be. But
I can't compel her

614
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,422
to stay against her will.

615
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,591
She has a job,
she's not delusional,

616
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,559
and she's not an
immediate threat to anybody.

617
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,561
She could go into
kidney failure, arrythmia.

618
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,129
What's it take to
get her treatment?

619
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,300
Her consent. Lots of people
do bad things to themselves.

620
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,067
They smoke, drink,
they eat fatty foods,

621
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,369
drive without seat belts,

622
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,137
but we don't lock them up.

623
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,473
So we're supposed to
stand by and do nothing?

624
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:42,644
Claire has the right to make her
own decisions, even bad ones.

625
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:45,246
Well, there's gotta
be something I can do.

626
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,115
If you can convince her to stay,

627
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,533
I'll admit her to
the Psych ward.

628
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:51,575
Otherwise, discharge her
after you've buffed her up.

629
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,541
Is the water too warm, Dad?

630
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,531
No, no.

631
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,837
Where's Elizabeth?

632
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,586
She left a couple of hours ago.

633
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:12,256
You have to go to work.

634
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,281
No, Dad. I'm gonna
stay right here.

635
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:17,684
Okay? Here.

636
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:21,265
Lie back.

637
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:22,667
Having any pain?

638
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:25,025
No. No.

639
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:31,331
You all right?

640
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:33,500
Yeah.

641
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,889
You look tired.

642
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,262
What...? What is that soap?

643
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,844
Plain old Ivory.

644
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,502
That's what your mother used.

645
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,838
I remember.

646
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,473
Every night when
she would tuck me in,

647
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:05,109
she'd give me a kiss
and I could smell the soap

648
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,299
on her face.

649
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:11,366
This used to be my job.

650
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,784
What's that?

651
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:18,378
Giving you a bath
when you were a baby.

652
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:22,766
I didn't know that.

653
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,887
You're a good doctor.

654
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,550
The day you became a doctor...

655
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:38,643
was the proudest day of my life.

656
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:42,002
Shhh.

657
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:47,285
It's okay, Dad. You
don't have to talk.

658
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,775
Shhh.

659
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,247
I love you, Mark.

660
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,421
I love you too, Dad.

661
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,337
Shhh.

662
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:09,462
Shhh.

663
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:12,777
Shell, you doing okay?

664
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,612
Yeah. When can I get up?

665
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:16,247
As soon as I take
a look at your x-ray.

666
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,382
Lily, send off a
CBC, dip a urine

667
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:19,584
and check a bedside crit.

668
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:21,920
HemoCue's in the other room.

669
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,888
That's two of Versed.
He's pretty relaxed.

670
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:25,957
All right, I'll keep
the hip flexed.

671
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,525
Now, keeping the
knee in extension,

672
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,662
you're gonna apply gentle
pressure direct and medially.

673
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,897
Like this?

674
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:35,166
Perfect. How you
guys doing in there?

675
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,390
Kid's stable. He's
clearing the neck.

676
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:40,538
What have you got?

677
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:41,906
Six-year-old with a minor MVA.

678
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,175
Probably just a whiplash.
I took a lateral C-spine.

679
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,044
About to do my secondary survey.

680
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:48,546
Careful. Ungh!

681
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,547
Don't!

682
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:50,582
Oh, it's okay, Shelly.

683
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:52,249
We just have to
examine you, all right?

684
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:54,633
We'll... We'll cover
you with a sheet.

685
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:57,289
Whoa. What is it?

686
00:29:57,313 --> 00:30:00,509
She's got bruises on her thighs
and blood in her underpants.

687
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,395
Could be a urethral injury
from a pelvic fracture?

688
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,697
Lily, we need a plain film
and a cystourethrogram.

689
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,087
Hold on. Hold on.

690
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,039
Does this hurt, sweetheart?

691
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,675
No.

692
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:14,277
There's no pelvic fracture.

693
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,027
You've got some blood
in your underpants.

694
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,695
Did you hurt yourself?

695
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,118
I wanna go home.

696
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,575
Uh, Shelly, we're
here to help you.

697
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:34,124
I just need to ask you
a few questions, okay?

698
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,149
Okay.

699
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,932
Has anyone ever touched you
where you go to the bathroom?

700
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:46,237
What happened?

701
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:51,130
Sometimes my daddy
plays a game with me.

702
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,904
It's okay. You can tell us.

703
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,873
It hurts.

704
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:08,348
Well, don't worry, he's never
gonna hurt you again, okay?

705
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,684
Sick son of a bitch!

706
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,853
Take it easy! What
are you doing?!

707
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,054
He molested his daughter.

708
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,489
What?! She's got sign of abuse!

709
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,558
What are you talking
about? I never touched her.

710
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,493
Mr. Burke, I'm
sorry. Dave, outside!

711
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,418
Abby, Malik, please
keep an eye on things.

712
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:31,749
You cannot go off on a patient.

713
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:33,451
He raped his daughter.
You don't know.

714
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,453
Call Social Services
and have Cleo do a pelvic.

715
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,355
I'll assist. Not after
what just happened.

716
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:39,791
That little girl trusts me.
That's a really bad idea.

717
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,135
Well, I'm gonna assist.

718
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,917
Okay, you'll
feel a little sting.

719
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,219
I heard Kerry was
out for your blood.

720
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,504
She was pretty upset.

721
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:54,422
I can talk to her if you like.

722
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,791
Oh, no, we worked it out.

723
00:31:56,815 --> 00:32:00,350
You'd think she could cut you
a little slack on your birthday.

724
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,965
Do you have plans to celebrate?

725
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,768
Oh, no. I don't like to leave
the girls with a babysitter

726
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,070
when I've been at work all day.

727
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,995
No problem. I can cook
you a birthday dinner.

728
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:15,181
Even do the dishes.

729
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,482
Okay.

730
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,606
Better get these
things to the lab.

731
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,944
Dr. Chen?

732
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:30,125
Is everything okay?

733
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,792
The doctor upstairs told me

734
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,296
that Kenny may have
permanent brain damage.

735
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,136
I'm so sorry.

736
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:40,418
This is Kenny's
baby sister Emma.

737
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:42,086
The sitter dropped her off.

738
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,593
She's beautiful.

739
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,891
I want you to give her that test

740
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:49,227
that you talked about.

741
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,317
Please.

742
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:55,600
I can't force her to stay,

743
00:32:55,624 --> 00:32:57,969
but I was hoping that
she'd listen to you.

744
00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:00,338
I love my daughter. I'd
do anything to help her.

745
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:01,828
I'm sure you would.

746
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,794
She's exhausted from not eating.

747
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,863
My God.

748
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,953
She's skin and bones.

749
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,087
You told the mother?

750
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:17,589
I had no choice.

751
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:19,207
She's over 18.

752
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:22,332
She has a terrible disease.
I had to do something.

753
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,549
<i>"I would not like
them here or there.</i>

754
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,351
I would not like them anywhere."

755
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,387
"I do not like green
eggs and ham.

756
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:34,027
I do not like them, Sam-I-am."

757
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:38,031
You're gonna feel my hands now.

758
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:41,445
"Would you like them in a house?

759
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:43,648
"Would you like
them with a mouse?

760
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:45,549
"I do not like them in a house.

761
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,619
I do not like them
with a mouse."

762
00:33:47,643 --> 00:33:49,320
"I do not like
them here or there.

763
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:51,155
I do not like them anywhere."

764
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,113
That's good. Almost through.

765
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,568
She's got bleeding from
complete transection of her hymen.

766
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,154
Can we keep reading?

767
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,657
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

768
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,960
"I do not like green
eggs and ham.

769
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:14,517
I do not like them, Sam-I-am."

770
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,294
Hey, Carter, you
wanna order dinner?

771
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,996
Going to Lucky Moon.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,231
Get me kung pao chicken,

773
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,733
mu shu pork and
a side of egg rolls.

774
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,270
Wow, you're hungry. I'll
save the mu shu for later...

775
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:06,740
65-year-old with chest pain.
Just dropped his pressure to 80.

776
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,376
He's got ST elevation
in V-1 through V-4.

777
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,913
His lungs are wet.
I'm gonna tube him.

778
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:12,914
Lily, start dopamine.

779
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,232
Pulse ox is 82.

780
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,450
All right, I'll bag him.

781
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,217
Do you want me
to call the cath lab?

782
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,119
Yeah, tell them
we've got a hot MI.

783
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,688
He's tachy at 130.

784
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,473
Damn it. Get me some suction.

785
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:23,991
You want cricoid pressure? Yeah.

786
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,411
Your kid with multiple
bee stings is crashing.

787
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,746
I'm in. Bag him. You
want me to take it?

788
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,434
No. Get this guy's pressure
up and take him to the cath lab.

789
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,003
Pressure's down to 75 palp.
Should I increase the dopamine?

790
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,805
No, hold on. There's
a pansystolic murmur

791
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,806
I didn't hear before.

792
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,675
Mitral regurge?

793
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,678
No, a parasternal thrill.
Could be septal perforation.

794
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,330
Why don't you get me an
8 French cordis introducer?

795
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:48,516
Putting in a central line?
Then I'll float a Swan.

796
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,950
We don't do those down here.

797
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,251
We don't have any Swan modules.

798
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,252
Get one from the ICU.

799
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,588
It's against policy.

800
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,389
I just to sample a little blood

801
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,692
from the right side of his
heart to make the diagnosis.

802
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,827
Come on. Carter,
we can't do this.

803
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,863
Fine. I'll do it myself.

804
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,553
I'm getting Dr. Kovac.

805
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,004
Kerry, did someone page me?

806
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,040
I did.

807
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,547
Mark's father passed
away a little while ago.

808
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:17,829
How's Mark?

809
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:18,846
He's all right.

810
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,432
He... He said that
he would call you

811
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,216
as soon as the
funeral home leaves.

812
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,004
I'm going over there
as soon as I finish up.

813
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:29,490
Peter's still on call. Would
you mind asking him to cover?

814
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,525
Not at all.

815
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,126
Dr. Corday, we
need you right now.

816
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,629
I'm leaving. I want
this IV out now!

817
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:37,331
Claire, please don't do this.
She won't listen to reason.

818
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,733
Claire, you're anorectic.
You need to be hospitalized.

819
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,302
That's not what
the shrink told me.

820
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,469
We can't force you to stay.

821
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,004
You could die without treatment.

822
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,129
Take this damn thing out!

823
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,926
All right.

824
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,828
All right, Lydia, remove the IV.

825
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,081
I never said that you
could call my mother.

826
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,582
I'm an adult.

827
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,788
I can do what I want.

828
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:02,106
You're right, you're
right. I'm sorry.

829
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,891
I'm only trying to save you.

830
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,015
I don't want your help.

831
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,482
A friend of mine died
today fighting for his life.

832
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:14,319
You want to leave?
Fine. Kill yourself.

833
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:17,221
If you don't give a
damn, neither do I.

834
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:18,678
Discharge her.

835
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:27,087
There. I'm in the RV. Lily,
draw blood from the distal port.

836
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:30,467
Blood's bright red. I knew it.

837
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:31,969
This guy's got a
hole in his heart.

838
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:34,205
Leaking oxygenated
blood to the right side.

839
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,573
Pressure's still low.

840
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:37,709
Start a Nipride and
call the O.R. Tell them...

841
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,677
What are you doing? I
told you to get this guy

842
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:40,845
to the cath lab.

843
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:42,546
I'm advancing to
the pulmonary artery.

844
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,765
We don't do Swans in the ER.

845
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,300
I told him that.

846
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,101
This guy should be
getting angioplasty.

847
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,636
He would've died
in the cath lab.

848
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,170
What are you talking about?

849
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:53,107
I used the Swan to sample
blood from the right ventricle.

850
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,891
It's bright red. He
perfed his septum.

851
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:57,895
What about his MI?

852
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,398
They can bypass him
when they fix the rupture.

853
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,582
Grab those IVs, would you?

854
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,717
Put 'em on the pole,
the O.R.'s waiting.

855
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,620
We're supposed to work together.

856
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,321
Next time you tell me
what you are doing.

857
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,345
<i>Okay.</i>

858
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,010
Can't you give me something?

859
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,295
Just a couple more sutures.

860
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,997
Then they're taking you to jail.

861
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,215
Ow! You're hurting me, damn it.
- Sorry.

862
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,917
Make him stop. He's killing me.

863
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,836
Dr. Malucci, your
patient's in pain.

864
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,170
He needs more lidocaine.

865
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,039
Well, I did an
infraorbital block.

866
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,680
You must've missed the
nerve. Infiltrate locally.

867
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:32,313
Well, if I do that it'll distort
the wound edges, so...

868
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,753
Infiltrate subcutaneously
or I'm gonna take over.

869
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,561
Fine.

870
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:43,930
You do it.

871
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,016
Dr. Chen, we keep
meeting in such odd places.

872
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,252
You paged me for a consult?

873
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:56,887
Yes. But first, I wanted
you to meet Mrs. Lattimer.

874
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:59,223
She's the mother of the
little boy I told you about.

875
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:02,259
Oh. Oh, hey, hey, I'm, uh,
terribly sorry about your son.

876
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:03,628
Thank you.

877
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,896
I told Mrs. Lattimer that
we would test her baby girl.

878
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,998
That's an excellent idea.

879
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:08,416
Dr. Chen was telling me

880
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,268
that if hospitals
screened every newborn,

881
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,053
hundreds of lives
might be saved.

882
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,738
And since the test only costs...

883
00:40:13,762 --> 00:40:16,140
You know what? I'm sorry. I
have a hot appy waiting for me.

884
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,842
If you can show me
where my consult is...

885
00:40:17,866 --> 00:40:20,111
Oh, this is not a
surgical consult.

886
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:21,612
It's not?

887
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:22,613
No.

888
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,715
I'm sponsoring a petition

889
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:25,867
to have County General

890
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:28,936
offer expanded
newborn genetic testing.

891
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,739
I told Mrs. Lattimer and
she wanted to meet you.

892
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,791
Though Kenny didn't get tested,

893
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:36,077
at least some good
will come out of all this.

894
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,078
Mm-hm.

895
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,946
Dr. Romano, if
you would just sign

896
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,669
on the bottom page...

897
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,018
Well, like I tell
all my Residents,

898
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,895
what's good for
County... is good for me.

899
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,498
Kerry, have you seen
Carol? Not in a while.

900
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,066
Please tell her
I'm looking for her.

901
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,668
Okay. Thanks.

902
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,237
Dr. Carter, I heard you
performed quite a heroic save.

903
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,740
Oh, just doing what I
thought best for my patient.

904
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:09,310
We have Attendings here for a
reason: to supervise Residents.

905
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,211
Fine. No, it's not fine.

906
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,113
Don't perform dangerous
procedures alone.

907
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,749
Is that clear, John? Yeah.

908
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:17,418
<i>ETA is five minutes.</i>

909
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,119
Copy 43. See you in five.

910
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,955
Okay, I'll be setting
up Trauma 1.

911
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,591
We got multiple stab wounds
to the chest coming. Interested?

912
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,993
No, thanks.

913
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,728
How's that little girl doing?

914
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:30,197
Cuts will heal. See
you tomorrow night.

915
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,221
See you.

916
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:33,851
<i>There you are.</i>

917
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,842
I was looking for you.

918
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,456
You all right?

919
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,324
I've been up here thinking.

920
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:43,461
Yeah. Birthdays can
make you do that. Heh!

921
00:41:43,485 --> 00:41:46,597
It's been... quite a year.

922
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:48,888
Yeah. For me too.

923
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:53,025
I'm looking forward
to the next one.

924
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,927
Luka, I'm sorry, I don't think

925
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,650
I can have dinner
with you tonight.

926
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:06,950
Did I do something wrong?

927
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:09,626
Oh, no. No, it's not you. I...

928
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,246
It's me.

929
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,567
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

930
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
Mark?

931
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,653
Hi.

932
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,926
I'm so sorry.

933
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,643
Can I help with anything?

934
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,913
Not really.

935
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,382
Called all his Navy
pals in San Diego.

936
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,185
I just got off the
phone with Rachel.

937
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,329
Got some forms to fill out.

938
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,390
His taxes.

939
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,425
Mom used to do his taxes,

940
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,916
so they're kind of a mess.

941
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,197
And his house.

942
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,421
Gotta sell the house.

943
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,404
I promised him that I...
I wouldn't sell the house

944
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,973
when he came out here.

945
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,013
But I don't...

946
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,704
I don't see a reason to keep it.
