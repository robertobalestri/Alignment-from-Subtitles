1
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,617
Mark, what are you doing?

2
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,254
Playing Tetris.

3
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,669
It's 5:30 in the morning.

4
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,039
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

5
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,506
This wouldn't
have anything to do

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,108
with your father arriving today?

7
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,044
No, of course not.

8
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,413
You know, you'd
feel a whole lot worse

9
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,148
if he spent the holidays alone.

10
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:42,752
Yeah, what would Thanksgiving
be without turkey and guilt?

11
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,555
God, I hope we can
fake it gettin' along.

12
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,858
I just hope he'll be comfortable
with our sleeping arrangements.

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,928
Yeah, him and me in here
and you out on the couch...

14
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,952
Stop it.

15
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,739
Peter! Peter, wake up!

16
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,186
How long was I asleep?

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,587
How should I
know? I just came on.

18
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:02,855
We need you now.

19
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,912
Shh!

20
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:11,631
Watch your back.

21
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,099
Peter, rough night on call?

22
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,367
Yeah, we got slammed.

23
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,003
Nothing like a trauma
to get the juices flowing.

24
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,604
Ready and lift.

25
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:19,805
What happened?

26
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,275
Choir bus from Louisville
got hit by a semi.

27
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,376
Louisville?

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,978
Yeah, they drove up
for a gospel festival.

29
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,614
That's blunt abdominal
trauma. May need surgery.

30
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,383
I'm assigning him
to you, Dr. Benton.

31
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,384
Assigning him?

32
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,119
I am the Triage officer.

33
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:35,588
You need to let me know
what's going on with your patients.

34
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:36,923
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.

35
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:39,659
He's a senior. He
requested more responsibility.

36
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,261
Hey, let me know
if you need help.

37
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,896
Right-o, the blood bank
is running low on O-neg.

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,932
So let's all try and go
easy. Give me the bullet.

39
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:48,234
Twenty-six-year-old woman,
complains of neck pain

40
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:49,769
and midline tenderness. No LOC.

41
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,204
Vitals? Stable.

42
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:53,773
Let's shoot a lateral C-spine
and leave her on the backboard

43
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:55,942
until can come in and
clear the x-ray myself.

44
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,111
Whatever you say, John.

45
00:01:58,135 --> 00:01:59,446
Chuny, where you going?

46
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,281
Taking this lady
for an ankle x-ray.

47
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:03,316
Wait, she might not need it.

48
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,251
And we don't wanna
tie up Radiology.

49
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,287
Ow!

50
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:08,288
Okay, take her to X-ray.

51
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,223
Good idea.

52
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,824
Lucy, so glad you could join us.

53
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,026
Sorry, I slept through...
I need you in 4.

54
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,895
Can't I take my coat
off? No, you cannot.

55
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,263
Coagulated Colles' fracture.

56
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,031
I have an open space
down here. Talk to me.

57
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,134
I'm on top of it. CARTER:
Check the wrist pulses?

58
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,103
No, I... I just thought
I'd just amputate.

59
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:24,137
Dave.

60
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,572
Neurocirc is fine. Don't worry.

61
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:27,440
Good, let's get her
something for her pain.

62
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,509
Get her to X-ray, and get
busy in the suture room.

63
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:30,798
Yes, maestro.

64
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:33,713
How we doing, Carter?

65
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,348
Under control.
What have you got?

66
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,950
Chest contusion. I'm puttin'
her on a monitor just to be safe.

67
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:39,319
What's the 12-lead show?

68
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:40,487
I just brought her in.

69
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:43,490
Oh, right. Uh, I got a
space open in Exam 4.

70
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:44,557
Do you think I can attend

71
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,593
the Emergency Services
committee meeting?

72
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,027
Carter, one step at a time.

73
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,562
Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah.

74
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,930
I gotta go.

75
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,298
Haleh, can you take this guy...?

76
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:53,799
A patient in 3
needs a breathing...

77
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:55,602
Chuny, are you free?
Gotta run to the lab.

78
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:57,170
I need... Allergic reaction.

79
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:58,474
I need sub-Q epi.

80
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:03,393
If anybody needs me,
we'll be in the men's room.

81
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,034
I got it. Thanks, Conni.

82
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:04,170
Appreciate you filling
in at the desk, Carol.

83
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,838
Oh, sure. There's
not much else I can do

84
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:07,573
except answer phones anyway.

85
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,042
Dr. Weaver, that was
Dr. Romano reminding you

86
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,312
to bring Q/A data to the
Emergency Services meeting.

87
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,415
When don't I? Carol,
remember to elevate your feet

88
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,350
to reduce the
swelling in your ankles.

89
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:19,018
Conni, could you
give Carol a stool,

90
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,586
so she can put
her feet up, please?

91
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,754
Thank you.

92
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:23,323
Is there anything
else I can get you?

93
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,291
You know, a carton
of milk would be great.

94
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:27,081
And I could use some pens.

95
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,584
My pleasure.

96
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:34,200
Thanks. Oh, Conni, Conni, Conni,

97
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:36,869
could you slide the
phone over here?

98
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,538
Great.

99
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:39,905
Guess I'm all set now.

100
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,541
Morning.

101
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,409
Hey, you're back.

102
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,628
Yeah, Dr. Weaver called me in.

103
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,881
I thought you went
south for the winter?

104
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:50,145
Soon. Before the first snow.

105
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,235
You look great.

106
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,369
Really? Yep.

107
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,760
I feel like an
overgrown pumpkin.

108
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,857
Pumpkin?

109
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,976
Big round orange thing
you carve on Halloween.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,511
Oh,<i> bundeva,</i> yeah.

111
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,280
Actually, I'd say
more like a<i> lubenica.</i>

112
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,720
What is that?

113
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,127
I forget how to say it
in English. See you.

114
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:12,956
<i>Lubenica.</i>

115
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,426
He's oozing.

116
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,494
Crit's 29. Want the
last unit of O-neg?

117
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,396
No, no, I've got the
bleeding under control.

118
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
Morning, Peter. Morning.

119
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,134
Laser surgery on a liver lac?

120
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,603
Yeah, I'm using the argon
to reduce the blood loss.

121
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,871
Would you like me to scrub in?

122
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,539
No, no, no. I got it.

123
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,109
But I do need to
ask you a favor.

124
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,377
What's that?

125
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,445
I need some time off.

126
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,446
How much time?

127
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,730
I'm not sure.

128
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,432
My custody case
is goi" to trial.

129
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,151
I don't know how
long it's gonna last.

130
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,519
Hello?

131
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,487
If you'd be willing to
trade holiday shifts...

132
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,488
Whatever it takes.

133
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,739
I'll see what I can do.

134
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,341
Dr. Benton,
chain-reaction pileup

135
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:49,375
off the Roosevelt.

136
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,809
They need you
to go to the scene.

137
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,028
Ah, damn.

138
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,947
Look, you finish
up here. I'll take it.

139
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:55,415
No, no, no, I got it.

140
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,682
Peter, even you can't operate

141
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,651
and fly on a chopper
at the same time.

142
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,170
I owe you.

143
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,405
Your ER compliance rate
is a meager 78 percent

144
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,006
for the pneumonia
clinical pathway.

145
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,675
Really, I expected
better from you.

146
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,610
This is only the
first month's data.

147
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,013
All the nurses haven't
been in-serviced yet.

148
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,681
Well, let's shoot for a minimum
of 90 percent next month,

149
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,105
shall we, ladies?

150
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,303
Sorry we're late.

151
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,071
To what do we owe
the unexpected pleasure

152
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,557
of Dr. Carter's company?

153
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,059
Oh, uh, Carter wanted
administrative experience,

154
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,395
so I appointed him as the
new Resident representative.

155
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,697
Thought I told you.

156
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,898
No, you didn't say squat.

157
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,200
Kerry, do you know about this?

158
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,652
Carter asked. I said, no.

159
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:34,870
Ah, so it appears Dr. Carter's

160
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,923
been playing Mommy
against Daddy.

161
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,825
I can step out if you'd
like to discuss this...

162
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,460
There's nothing
to discuss, Carter.

163
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,128
Have a seat. Really?

164
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,364
You're comfortable sending
the message to our Residents

165
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:46,866
that their opinions
are worthless

166
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,335
and, uh, they're just
here to serve you?

167
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,893
Actually, I'd be completely
comfortable with that.

168
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,507
But since I admire
the deviousness

169
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,426
with which you
got yourself here...

170
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,295
Good. Carter, welcome to the
Emergency Services committee.

171
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,239
Unfortunately, I
have to take off.

172
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,939
So, Carter, can you,
uh, take good notes?

173
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,825
So, what's on the agenda?

174
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,394
Chad's lost 20 pounds.
His grades are falling.

175
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:16,696
Mom, I'm fine.

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,564
Has your appetite
changed recently, Chad?

177
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,700
Not really. He's
doing drugs, I know it.

178
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:23,669
I told you a thousand
times, I don't get high.

179
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,738
Yeah, what about those
losers you hang out with?

180
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,039
Mom, you don't know anything.

181
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,408
Start with a few blood
tests. Try to rule out anemia.

182
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:31,076
I brought him in
here for a drug test.

183
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,478
You see, she never believes me.

184
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,146
And I don't feel
that it's appropriate

185
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,180
to force that on Chad.

186
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,449
Well, who's in charge here?

187
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:39,251
Let's, uh, call a social
worker and try to...

188
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,285
Is there a problem?

189
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,854
Yes, my son is on drugs,

190
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,422
and she refuses to test him.

191
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,991
Uh, Chad denies drug use,
and I was urging Mrs. Kottmeier

192
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,948
to consider family counseling.

193
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,985
Chad, do you object
to being tested?

194
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,319
Whatever. If it'll
get her off my back.

195
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,220
Problem solved.
Run a tox screen.

196
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,205
Fine.

197
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,907
Excuse me. Lucy.

198
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:02,709
I'm a medical student.
You're a Resident.

199
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,777
You have every right
to question my judgment.

200
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,478
Just don't do it in
front of my patients.

201
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,881
Chad had no objections. You
didn't have to choose sides.

202
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,467
I wasn't choosing sides. I
was trying to work with them.

203
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,920
Well, sometimes the path of
least resistance works best.

204
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,587
Since you've got
this all figured out,

205
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:16,811
why don't you take this case?

206
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,193
<i>Meet Babette Fritzler,
28, GSW to the shoulder.</i>

207
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:24,964
Neurovasculars intact.
Husband, Max, shot her.

208
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,331
It was an
accident. I... I... I...

209
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,200
I was trying to scare
the hiccups out of her.

210
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,534
No... Nothing else worked.

211
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,804
Sweet pickle juice is more
effective and a lot safer.

212
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,773
Why don't you go find
some, Dave? I'll do this.

213
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:35,207
Oh, no you don't, Carter.

214
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,409
Malucci, get an
upright chest x-ray.

215
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,644
I'll send Kovac in.

216
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,512
Come on, you're doi"
the positive charts.

217
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,814
Aw, can't I do that later?

218
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,150
No, people could be getting
sick and not even know it.

219
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,384
What do I have to do?

220
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,853
Okay, I want you to
review all positive urine

221
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:49,121
and sputum cultures

222
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,657
from the past 72 hours
and call back any patient

223
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,260
who wasn't treated with
the appropriate antibiotic.

224
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,428
When you're done sorting
through these, I want you

225
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,199
to check our compliance
on TB-mask fit testing.

226
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,701
You asked for more
administrative experience.

227
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,503
And yet somehow I
feel I'm being punished.

228
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:05,871
Yeah, no pain, no gain.

229
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:07,190
<i>Multi-car pileup.</i>

230
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,325
We're transporting
four to local hospitals.

231
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,459
Any criticals?

232
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,894
Truck driver's okay.

233
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,230
We don't know about the
guy underneath the truck.

234
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,231
What's this?

235
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,067
Neck and back pain.

236
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,702
How you doing?

237
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,237
I'm okay.

238
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,060
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

239
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,276
Great. This one's
clear to go by ground.

240
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,494
What's his status?

241
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:30,162
Couldn't get in to take vitals.

242
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,597
Is he awake? Talking?

243
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,865
He was groaning.

244
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:34,900
Okay, how soon before
we can get to him?

245
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:37,703
The gas tank's leaking. We
gotta finish foaming the area first.

246
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:38,987
How soon?

247
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,278
Shut it off.

248
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,643
I can't see anything.
Can you break through?

249
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:50,099
Help me. Please, somebody help!

250
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,651
Hello, can you hear me?

251
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,436
What's your name? Dean.

252
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,938
Okay, Dean, we're
gonna help you.

253
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,463
He's got a weak carotid pulse.

254
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,012
Hang on, Dean. We're
gonna get you out.

255
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,752
Hang on!

256
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
ER.

257
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:15,141
No, you don't need
an appointment. Stupid.

258
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:17,210
Hey, Carol, can you order
a stain on this sputum?

259
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,811
I'm just answering phones.

260
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,145
Oh, well, excuse me.

261
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,514
What are you makin'?

262
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,715
What's it look like?

263
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:23,800
A blanket.

264
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,518
It's a hat.

265
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,820
Sorry. Nice color.

266
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,154
Lucy, I wanna talk to you.

267
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:31,423
Did you change your mind
about drug testing that kid?

268
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:32,791
Nope, waiting for the results.

269
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:33,859
ER.

270
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,243
It's rough bein' a fourth year.

271
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,446
You wanna fly solo, but
nobody thinks you're ready.

272
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,948
Excuse me.

273
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,919
I got two members of my choir
out here still needs to be seen.

274
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,070
And a cut on my hand.

275
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:45,738
Cleo.

276
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:48,441
Lucy, why don't you assess
them, order their tests,

277
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,343
and I'll sign off before
you discharge them?

278
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,367
Sure.

279
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:56,482
ER.

280
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:59,673
Hey, Carol, can you
order my Gram stain now?

281
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,477
You the doc?

282
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,112
Yeah, Corday from County.

283
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,680
Detective Curson, Violent Crime.

284
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,149
Still alive? Just about.

285
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,317
What about his passenger?

286
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,151
There's no one else in his car.

287
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,571
Well, there should be. He
carjacked a lady this morning.

288
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,439
Help me.

289
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:21,641
What'd you do with her?

290
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:23,342
Somebody help me.

291
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,278
What'd you do with
the lady you carjacked?

292
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:28,030
Oh! Okay! He's cut his carotid.

293
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,498
Open a few bags
of four-by-fours.

294
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,799
He'll need two large-bore IVs.

295
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,002
Please... CORDAY: Don't move.

296
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,937
You've cut an
artery in your neck.

297
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,456
We'll have to remove the
collar to stop your bleeding.

298
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,541
Tell me where she is.

299
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,842
Who?

300
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,511
You know who,
you son of a bitch.

301
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,714
Don't move! Don't move. Now
back off him and let me work.

302
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,099
There's a woman in trouble.
God knows what he did to her.

303
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,557
Tape his forehead to
the board. Don't move!

304
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,222
Don't let me die.

305
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,857
I'm a doctor. I'll
look after you.

306
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,460
Listen to me. There is a woman
out there that could be dying.

307
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,644
Do you understand that?

308
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,479
We gotta find her.

309
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,794
Where is she, Dean?

310
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,663
You're bleeding really badly.

311
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,086
Where is she?

312
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:21,083
I don't know.

313
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,789
BP's down to 70.

314
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,640
This is your last chance.
Do you want to die?

315
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,914
Uh... Uh-uh.

316
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,578
Then you tell me where she is.

317
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:35,848
You tell me where she is,
or I'll let you bleed to death.

318
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,155
Do you hear me?

319
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,327
Linc... Lincoln Park,
under the bridge.

320
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,179
She's in Lincoln
Park under the bridge!

321
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,916
Lincoln Park! Lincoln Park!

322
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,501
Okay, we gotta
stop his bleeding.

323
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,492
Get me an atraumatic clamp now!

324
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,134
How's he doing?

325
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,068
He's stable. I intubated
him on the chopper.

326
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,470
I heard you tied
off his carotid.

327
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:32,938
That's a pretty aggressive move.

328
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:35,941
I had no choice. Are
handcuffs necessary?

329
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,244
He's not going anywhere.
Just following procedure.

330
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,748
He's under arrest
for attempted murder.

331
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,519
Carol, Judy Rogers.
I'm Meg Corwin's nurse.

332
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:50,155
She had a baby boy and
would really like to see you.

333
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,291
Why does she wanna
see me? She didn't say.

334
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:53,292
How's the baby doing?

335
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,361
Quite well under
the circumstances.

336
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,730
We were able to got Meg off
the heroin before she delivered.

337
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,399
She said you got her arrested.

338
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,733
Well, she refused treatment.

339
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,719
I didn't have much
choice. Hey, I'm with you.

340
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,888
If you wanna see her,
she's on the jail ward.

341
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:06,955
Thank you. Hey, Carol.

342
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,357
I hear UCAN's
flying in a trauma?

343
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,725
Elizabeth and Peter have it.

344
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,026
I'll go see if they need a hand.

345
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,928
Not so fast. I
checked over your list.

346
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,597
You haven't been
fitted for a TB mask.

347
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:15,664
Well, I'll do it later.

348
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,466
Yeah, I expect you
to set a good example

349
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,001
for the other Residents.

350
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,853
Let's go. Hmph.

351
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,921
He's shocky. Conni,
type and cross.

352
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,157
Hang two units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser.

353
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,325
Blood bank's out of O-neg.

354
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,494
We have to type him
first. We need blood now.

355
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,896
What do you know, he's
got a blood-donor card.

356
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,431
"I was an angel.
I donated blood."

357
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,400
He's B-positive.
Okay, I'll order it.

358
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,202
Send off blood, C-spine
and a chest x-ray.

359
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,037
All right, let's get
a gram of ancef.

360
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,240
Let's update the tetanus.

361
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,508
Recheck his chest.

362
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:44,943
Belly's soft. Chest is clear.

363
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,846
He's got an unstable
pelvis. Add an AP.

364
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,313
Pressure's down, 60 palp.

365
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:50,883
Okay, he's bleeding out. Let's
logroll him. Check his back.

366
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,367
Can't. He's cuffed. Uncuff him.

367
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,635
We're supposed to keep 'em on.

368
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,271
Lily, get the bolt cutters.

369
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,523
All right, but
you're responsible.

370
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:58,547
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,298
All right, go.

372
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,579
No sign of any injury.

373
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,947
Could be a pelvic hematoma.

374
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,483
Could be an intra-abdominal
bleed. I'll do an ultrasound.

375
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,984
Why don't you take
a break? I got it.

376
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,786
No, I brought him
in. I'll stay with him.

377
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,455
All right. You got it.

378
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,591
Where's the
competition being held?

379
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,826
At Navy Pier.

380
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,629
They're sendin' over
a bus to pick us up.

381
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,332
So keep the sutures
clean and dry.

382
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,468
And in about a week, go see your
doctor and have them removed.

383
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,070
Thank you.

384
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,257
Are you okay, Mr. Owens?
You're breathing kinda fast.

385
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:33,325
You know, let me
listen to your lungs.

386
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,860
Oh, I'm fine.

387
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:38,397
I'm gonna have you
breathe in and out, deeply.

388
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:41,489
Again.

389
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,108
You've got rales. Wet lungs.
Are you on any medications?

390
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:52,478
Uh, Digoxin and, uh, Lasix

391
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:55,081
for congestive heart failure.

392
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,015
I'd like to run
some blood tests.

393
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,033
Oh, no.

394
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,602
I've had this for five years.

395
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,956
I need to round everyone
up and reassign parts.

396
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,875
Your lungs sound bad, Mr. Owens.

397
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,116
Well, so will my choir
if we don't rehearse.

398
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,600
He's got a pelvic hematoma.

399
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,269
He may need embolization.
Conni, call Steve in Radiology.

400
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:18,871
Lily, how we doing
on that blood?

401
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,889
Four units
B-positive on the way.

402
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,358
Radiology's ready.

403
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,976
They must've found her. Who?

404
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,977
The woman he
kidnapped. She's alive.

405
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,530
Pressure's 60. What?

406
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,565
BP's 60. You want
another liter of saline?

407
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,885
No. Lily, get the rapid infuser.

408
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,342
Multiple stab
wounds to the chest.

409
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:39,224
Decreased breath sounds.
You wanna put in a chest tube?

410
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,425
Yeah, 10 blade.

411
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,928
She's hypotensive.
BP 90, pulse 130.

412
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,997
The blood bank have any O-neg?
- Not yet.

413
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,866
Okay, does her husband
know her blood type?

414
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,083
He said he doesn't.

415
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,085
Type and cross here for four.

416
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,654
Are those scratches on her
neck? Step back. We need to work.

417
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,645
Dr. Weaver, you might
wanna take a look at this.

418
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,728
Abrasions to the
external genitalia.

419
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,451
Yosh, get the camera.

420
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,521
Sandra.

421
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,653
Can you describe the
man that stabbed you?

422
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:09,076
No.

423
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,824
Where's Ron?

424
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,208
Try and remember.

425
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,196
Sats have dropped to 88.

426
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,247
I gotta intubate.

427
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,548
You gotta get outta here. Go.

428
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,834
I need a positive ID. You
heard her. Get out now.

429
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:25,254
Sandra, I'm gonna put
a tube down your throat

430
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,922
to help you breathe.

431
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:30,125
Fifteen of
etomidate, 100 of sux.

432
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,515
My husband...

433
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,880
Don't worry. Your
husband is on the way.

434
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:37,249
She's bleeding out.
Hang the cell saver.

435
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,101
Chuny, run a red
top to the blood bank.

436
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,352
Tell them to drop everything

437
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:42,254
and get us four
units of type-specific.

438
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,488
Done.

439
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:45,690
Check the second HemoCue.
Prime the rapid infuser.

440
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,592
Peter, how're we doing
on that central line?

441
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,261
I'm almost there.

442
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,051
He can't hold his arm up.

443
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,768
Squeeze my hand.

444
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,202
Tighter. What's wrong?

445
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:57,836
He's got right-sided weakness.

446
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,288
You tied off his carotid.

447
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,657
He should still have good
collateral flow to his brain.

448
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,791
I got the B-positive.

449
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,092
Hang it on the rapid infuser.

450
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,595
We need to put in a shunt.
He could be stroking out.

451
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,698
Conni, get a Javid from the O.R.

452
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,000
All right, that's it. I'm in.

453
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,407
Bring down as many
sizes as you can.

454
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,557
Okay, Malik. Malik, clamp it.

455
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:20,092
Got it. CORDAY: Clothes off.

456
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,549
Prep his neck and
get a vascular tray.

457
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,315
What the hell are you doin'?

458
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,316
I'm saving his life.

459
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,734
No, you're destroying evidence.

460
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,069
That woman's blood could be...

461
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:31,386
That was a unit of donor blood.

462
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,438
It doesn't matter.

463
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:34,540
Okay, stop, stop
cutting his clothes.

464
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:36,525
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

465
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,611
Keep all his
belongings separate.

466
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,946
Weakness is progressing.
We gotta get that shunt in.

467
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,490
Don't clean him up until I
come back with a warrant.

468
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,970
How much have you given her?

469
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,905
I autotransfused a liter back.

470
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,041
Okay, she's bled another liter
into the cell saver. Hang that.

471
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,511
Blood bank says another 10
minutes on the type-specific.

472
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,679
We can't wait that long.
She's lost too much blood.

473
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,347
Check and see if
anyone here is O-neg.

474
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,449
- What's your blood type?
- I'm B-positive.

475
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,041
Malucci, what's your
blood type? A-positive, why?

476
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,724
Tell me if you taste anything.

477
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:09,992
What's your blood type? AB.

478
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,159
Carter? O-negative.

479
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,661
What? O-negative!

480
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,663
You're the man. Come on.

481
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,664
Carter's O-negative.

482
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,165
What's goin' on?

483
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,035
We need you to donate. Set
him down. Get a 14-gauge needle.

484
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,136
Put this on.

485
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,138
Multiple stabbing
victim. Needs blood.

486
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,940
There's no time to type her.

487
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:28,376
Squeeze in another two liters
of saline. Get another pressure.

488
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
How about numbing
it with lidocaine?!

489
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:32,931
I got a flash.

490
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,366
Keep your arm straight, Carter.

491
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,869
This is a needle,
not a catheter.

492
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:38,937
She's tachycardic.
Heart rate's 140.

493
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,339
Stand by with the paddles.

494
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,874
Vessel loops are in place. Okay.

495
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,876
I'll cannulate the
proximal end of the shunt.

496
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,694
That way, we can flush it out.

497
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,947
Otherwise we could send
an air embolism to the brain.

498
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,171
Snug it down while
I do the distal end.

499
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,321
What's wrong? The
shunt's not advancing.

500
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:58,824
Hold on, hold on. You could
be raising an intimal flap.

501
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,109
He's throwing PVCs.

502
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,779
Give him 100 of
lidocaine and prep a drip.

503
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:04,880
There, I'm in.

504
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,599
Distal vessel loops are secure.

505
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,586
All right, let's open the
shunt and see how he does.

506
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,289
With any luck, he'll
be able to stand trial.

507
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,423
Blood's ready.

508
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,659
Hang it on the infuser.

509
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,627
You're a good bleeder,
Carter. What can I do?

510
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,830
Go to the lounge. Get some
orange juice and cookies.

511
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:22,886
Hey, I'm fine.

512
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,801
Carter! Oh, go!

513
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,202
Pressure's dropping.

514
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,070
We gotta control the bleeding.

515
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,571
I put in another chest tube.

516
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:31,640
Oh, my God.

517
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,976
Sir, you have to leave.

518
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,729
My wife, she's
gonna be all right?

519
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:39,031
Yeah, we're doing
everything we can.

520
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:41,266
Wh...? Where is that
music coming from?

521
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,567
Lucy's gospel singers.

522
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,302
Okay, ask them to stop singing.

523
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,637
We're trying to work here.

524
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,040
We've lost her pressure.
Thoracotomy tray.

525
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,346
What are you doing?

526
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,578
We have to stop the bleeding.

527
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:54,913
Get him out of here
now. Come on, sir.

528
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:55,964
We need a sternal saw.

Y-you just can't...
You can't sing in here.

537
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:21,573
Then we'll rehearse
outside. Let's go, everyone.

538
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:22,941
No, Mr. Owens, you can't leave.

539
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,610
His blood tests aren't back yet.

540
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:27,074
Take it up with Dr. Weaver.

541
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:29,414
Where you goin'?

542
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,682
I gotta pee.

543
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,184
Do I have to go in a cup again?

544
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,869
No, you can flush this time.

545
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,072
Is that drug test back
on Chad Kottmeier?

546
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,807
Yeah, tox screen
came back negative.

547
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,975
That's good news.

548
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,111
But his liver function
tests were abnormal.

549
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,480
Could you call the lab and
add on a blood-alcohol level?

550
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,504
Sure.

551
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,052
Oh. Whoa, Carol, are you okay?

552
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,819
Dave, need a hand.
Carol's presyncopal.

553
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,439
I'm just dizzy. Yeah, okay.

554
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:55,073
I'm okay, really.

555
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:56,475
Take some deep breaths, okay?

556
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,642
Guys, I'm fine.

557
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,077
She's probably hypotensive.

558
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,113
We're putting you and
the babies on a monitor.

559
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:02,614
Come on, I'm all right.

560
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,316
Carol, breathe.

561
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,905
I've got the blood.

562
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,207
Okay, hang it wide
open on the rapid infuser.

563
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,875
Pulmonary vein is
shredded on my side.

564
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,343
Clamp off the hilum.

565
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,545
She's losing blood faster
than we can give it to her.

566
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,014
Give me suction.
Give me suction.

567
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,048
Two-0 silk and pickups.

568
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,983
Okay, hilum is clamped.

569
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,719
Take over compressions.
Give me the stitcher.

570
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,721
She's in fib.

571
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,422
Heart's filling.

572
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,656
Give me the paddles.

573
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,810
Charge to 30. And clear.

574
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,245
Let's take him to
Radiology for embolisation.

575
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,246
Do you still need me?

576
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,247
No, I'll take him up.

577
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,471
All right.

578
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,353
Uh, Conni, you go on.
I'll be up in a minute.

579
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:42,543
Okay.

580
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:48,893
Can you tell me what
they're doing to my wife?

581
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,830
They're shocking her heart
to try to get it beating again.

582
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,824
Why are they stopping?

583
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:05,149
Mr. Perry, we
need to talk to you.

584
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,087
They okay?

585
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,923
Good variability.
No contractions.

586
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,325
Your babies are doing great.
It's you I'm worried about.

587
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,127
I'm taking it easy.

588
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,547
There's no such thing
as taking it easy in the ER.

589
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:44,566
You're in your third
trimester, with twins.

590
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,734
You need to go home and rest.

591
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,269
Heard you collapsed. You okay?

592
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,003
I didn't collapse. I'm fine.

593
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,439
Her blood pressure was low.

594
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,708
Normal for this stage
of the pregnancy. Okay.

595
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,260
Uh, call me if you
have any problems.

596
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,395
Thanks.

597
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,263
You need to... I
have to go home.

598
00:23:58,287 --> 00:23:59,281
I know. Yes.

599
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:00,899
Hey, how's your dad?

600
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:02,734
He never got off the plane.

601
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,703
Was it the right flight?

602
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,871
Yeah, it's the only morning
flight from San Diego.

603
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,241
The airline wouldn't
give me any information.

604
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,742
Did you call him at home?

605
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,712
Yeah, and I checked with
a neighbor. She has a key.

606
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:16,514
And she went over to the
house. There's no sign of him.

607
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,516
Well, maybe he
took a later flight.

608
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,218
Yeah, or he's just
lost somewhere

609
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:22,676
in the continental
United States.

610
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,728
Guess I'm off the hook, huh?

611
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:31,028
Not quite.

612
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:35,099
Your tests are a
bunch of crap. I'm clean.

613
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:36,968
You're drunk.

614
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:41,044
If you call this drunk, lady,
you don't get out much.

615
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:44,632
When was your last drink?

616
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:48,196
I had a few beers last night.

617
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,664
Must have had more than a few

618
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,950
to still have alcohol in
your blood this afternoon.

619
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:56,788
Okay, so maybe I
had a couple six-packs.

620
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,056
I don't remember.

621
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,640
Is that because you blacked out?

622
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:06,148
Chad, you've already got
liver damage from the alcohol.

623
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,468
That means you've been doin'
some seriously heavy drinking.

624
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:12,971
I like to party with my friends.

625
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,189
Nothin' wrong with that.

626
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,109
We need to talk to your mom.

627
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,277
So, what's she gonna say?

628
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:21,435
She gets bombed
every night herself.

629
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:38,252
She just went to go
get us coffee. That's all.

630
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:43,408
Mr. Perry, could we
speak to you outside?

631
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,128
I can't leave.

632
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,043
Not yet.

633
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,112
We need to talk to
you about something

634
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,835
that's going to
be very difficult.

635
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:01,308
We have to do a rape
exam on your wife.

636
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,416
Please come with us.

637
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,042
I'm very sorry, but,
um, I must ask...

638
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,044
Have you had intercourse

639
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:29,181
with your wife in
the past 72 hours?

640
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:31,021
Why?

641
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:36,087
If the exam is positive,

642
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:39,196
we have to make
sure that it wasn't you.

643
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,967
No.

644
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,379
He's bleeding from
the internal iliac.

645
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:02,881
We'll have to
embolise the vessel.

646
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:04,348
Any other sites of hemorrhage?

647
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,984
No, he lucked out.

648
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,120
Nonetheless, he's
got a fractured pelvis,

649
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:14,358
shredded carotid, dislocated
hip, torn hypogastric.

650
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,160
All the radiologists
and all the surgeons

651
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:18,513
might not put Humpty
back together again.

652
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,032
Uh, step out please.
We're about to take x-rays.

653
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,600
I have a warrant
to gather evidence.

654
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:24,669
The charges against this
guy have been changed.

655
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:25,737
What do you need to do?

656
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:28,657
Fingerprint him,
scrape under his nails.

657
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:31,159

Well, that damn stuff

668
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:53,064
made me pee like a fountain.

669
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,800
We're late. We
gotta be headin' out.

670
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:58,019
Uh, you can't leave until
your blood tests are back.

671
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,622
Well, I'm not gonna
disappoint my choir.

672
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,058
I'll come back right after
the concert. I promise.

673
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,459
Freddy, we're taking off. No...

674
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,460
Okay, you're leaving
against medical advice.

675
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,129
I'm gonna need
you to sign a waiver.

676
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,431
Just... I-I have to go
get a doctor, okay?

677
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,817
I thought you were a doctor!

678
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:14,786
I'm a medical student.
You stay there!

679
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,188
If the boy doesn't want help,
there's not much we can do.

680
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:20,358
If he keeps it up, he's going
to kill himself or someone else.

681
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:22,761
Well, I can give you the names
of some treatment programs

682
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,228
that you can refer him to.

683
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:27,198
I offered that. He refused.
Can't we commit him?

684
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:29,634
We can't pull him out of his
home for being an alcoholic.

685
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:31,235
What if I convince
the mom to sign him

686
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,837
to a treatment
facility? Dr. Finch.

687
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,740
Ah, Mr. Owens is leaving
AMA. You have to talk to him.

688
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:37,259
He's in congestive
heart failure.

689
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,260
What's his EKG?

690
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:39,895
Uh, no ST changes.

691
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,897
Lasix and Nitropaste,
and I'm waiting

692
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,765
on the cardiac
enzymes. Where is he?

693
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:48,887
Why didn't you get me sooner?

694
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:50,855
Thought I could handle it.

695
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:52,957
Well, if his enzymes show
he's had a heart attack,

696
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,447
you better find him.

697
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,415
Hey, how was the emergency
committee meeting?

698
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,851
I'll let you read the minutes.

699
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,418
Dr. Weaver is making
me type them up.

700
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,988
Mark, cab company from
San Diego called back.

701
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,890
They say they picked
up your dad this morning

702
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,391
and dropped him
off at the airport.

703
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,692
Thank you.

704
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,828
No, not yet. What are
you still doing here?

705
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,363
If I don't finish
these time cards,

706
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,765
the nurses don't get paid.

707
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,266
Well, can't somebody else do it?

708
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,434
Well, it's gonna take me
just as long to explain it.

709
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,470
Besides, I'd be doing
this at home anyway.

710
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,905
ER? Take it easy.

711
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,173
Yes, doctor.

712
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,975
Mark, the neurologist
wants to know if you

713
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,510
or Dr. Weaver can come
up. It's about Dr. Lawrence.

714
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,511
Where's Kerry?

715
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,780
Oh, she's doing a rape exam.

716
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,481
All right, tell him
I'm on my way.

717
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,484
Ooh, I almost forgot.
Some girl named Meg called.

718
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,086
She said she really
wants to see you.

719
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,030
Thanks. Mm-hm.

720
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,096
It's a volcano.

721
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,564
Whether it's Mount
Etna or... Vesuvius,

722
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,633
I couldn't tell you.

723
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,051
Okay, volcano will do.

724
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:55,470
This is ridiculous.
I feel like a lab rat.

725
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:56,638
Just bear with me.

726
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,924
All right, fine. Just
point me to the cheese.

727
00:29:58,948 --> 00:29:59,948
What's this?

728
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,845
It's a martini glass
without the base.

729
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,268
Or it's a...

730
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,687
It's a cone.

731
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,688
Right?

732
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,090
Okay, let's try another one.

733
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,114
What's this?

734
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,698
Those are the picker-uppers
that you use to...

735
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,200
To put the ice in
the martini glass.

736
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,524
They're also called...

737
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,839
Call them whatever
you like. Okay.

738
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,040
They're tongs.

739
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,274
Great. They're tongs?

740
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,442
Who...? Who the hell cares?

741
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,461
How about this one?
No, stop this nonsense!

742
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:37,929
We're not quite finished yet.

743
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:40,197
I am. I'm not gonna sit here
and play guessing games

744
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,588
with you and a... And a
bunch of lousy drawings.

745
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,858
I'm sorry.

746
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,782
Why don't we take a short
break? I'll be right back.

747
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,186
Don't rush.

748
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,983
Saline.

749
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,190
Ready for the Wood's lamp?

750
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:40,713
Yeah, please.

751
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,626
I see a spot.

752
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:07,574
It looks like semen.

753
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,637
That's it.

754
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:25,370
Finished up?

755
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:27,538
I'm just waiting
for the test results.

756
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:29,457
Have a seat. Share my boredom.

757
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,292
Grab a cup of coffee?

758
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,195
Well, sure. Why not?

759
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,831
How are things going?

760
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,534
For a doc who can't practice
medicine, can't complain.

761
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,704
I called your son.
He's on his way over.

762
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,007
Oh, no. Come... Look, I just...

763
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,542
I told that neurologist, I
don't want my son involved.

764
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,112
You can't enlist in a clinical
trial without a caregiver.

765
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,915
You need someone to be in
touch, have on a daily basis,

766
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,649
make sure that
you take your meds.

767
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,919
My son is not gonna babysit me.

768
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,288
You took care of him
when he needed you.

769
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,989
Now it's his turn.

770
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,158
That's just it.

771
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:08,329
I was too busy being a doctor,
too busy helping everybody else.

772
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,465
Yeah, well, let your
son decide, okay?

773
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,868
No, I'm... I'm not gonna
be a burden to him.

774
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,637
Dr. Chow is gonna be
testing a new neurotrophin.

775
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,039
It could give you
some more time.

776
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:20,341
What difference is a couple
of more months gonna make?

777
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,577
So you're just giving up
because you're too damn proud

778
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,168
to ask your son for help?

779
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,761
If he says yes,

780
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,665
I'll still end up the...
The way I'll end up.

781
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,121
I don't think I could
bear for him to say no.

782
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,411
Just talk to him.
He might say yes.

783
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,286
I think it's too late.

784
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:04,931
I'm gonna clean out my locker.

785
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,112
Doppler showed and
intimal tear of the carotid.

786
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,279
We'll go in and tack it down.

787
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,148
Ah, sounds like a plan.

788
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:19,450
Lizzie, I understand you've
had yourself quite a day.

789
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,618
I'm not in the mood.

790
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,819
Perhaps you'd be in the mood

791
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,588
to hear what's been
going on downstairs.

792
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:25,623
No. Your patient
raped that woman.

793
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,025
Oh, dear God.

794
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:30,211
Yeah.

795
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,180
I also got a little visit
from an investigator

796
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,915
in the public defender's office.

797
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,217
It seems some bleeding heart

798
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,720
is claiming that
you coerced Rollins

799
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,960
into telling you
where he left her.

800
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,144
Did you coerce your
patient into giving information

801
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,179
in exchange for his life?

802
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:50,381
It's okay, Peter.
I'll answer that.

803
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,922
I think it's fair to say I
pressured Mr. Rollins.

804
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:56,353
Wow, Lizzie, you
never fail to impress me.

805
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:58,937
I didn't think you had it
in you to cross that line.

806
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:03,260
But you may wanna reflect
on whether that's really

807
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:05,229
how you'd characterize
what happened today.

808
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:08,532
Because, unfortunately,
in this country,

809
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:12,925
when a confession is
coerced, it's usually thrown out.

810
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,607
I'm here to see Meg Corwin.

811
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:33,123
Change your mind?

812
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,458
I wanted to see the baby.

813
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:37,261
Just in time. Social Services
will be here soon to take him.

814
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:40,698
She's in here. Kinda crazy
havin' to lock her in like this,

815
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,166
but County has its rules.

816
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,602
<i>Hi, Meg. Hi.</i>

817
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,337
<i>This is Joshua.</i>

818
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:47,871
<i>He's beautiful. Hm.</i>

819
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,207
<i>Hi, Joshua.</i>

820
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:53,077
They're... They're
sending me back to jail.

821
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,879
I need you to talk to someone

822
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,481
about letting
Joshua stay with me.

823
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:58,333
Oh, Meg, that
wouldn't do any good.

824
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,301
You... You did this.

825
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:04,038
If you hadn't gotten me busted,
I wouldn't be here right now.

826
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,808
I did what I thought was
best for you and your baby.

827
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:10,178
I'm gonna be in
jail for 10 months.

828
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,442
Think that's
what's best for him?

829
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,916
Look, I know how hard this is,

830
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,583
but if you get your
life back together,

831
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,685
and you prove that to them,

832
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,820
I'm sure you can
get Joshua back.

833
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,573
How can you be so
damn self-righteous?

834
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,692
Meg, Social Services is here.

835
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,261
Just give me a little
more time, okay?

836
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,496
You know the rules.

837
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,164
Moms can't keep
their babies in jail.

838
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,368
This isn't right. I-I
know I screwed up bad.

839
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:34,736
<i>But he needs me.</i>

840
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,637
<i>I'm his mother. Carol,
please do something.</i>

841
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,272
<i>There isn't anything I can do.</i>

842
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,273
<i>Carol, please!</i>

843
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,375
<i>I'm sorry, Meg.</i>

844
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,377
<i>Please, Carol.
You did this! I...</i>

845
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,878
<i>Let him stay a
little while longer.</i>

846
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,781
<i>We're gonna help
find a good home...</i>

847
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,282
Can you open this door?!

848
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,585
Just a moment. Yes, sorry.
<i>He's really happy with me.</i>

849
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,453
<i>Please let him stay.
I'm sure, Meg, but...</i>

850
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,121
Open this door now, please!

851
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,190
<i>I'm his mother!
- -precious one a place to live.</i>

852
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,760
<i>No, no, please don't take
him. We'll take good care of him.</i>

853
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,728
<i>Please don't take my baby!</i>

854
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,597
<i>I'm his mother! When I get back</i>

855
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,232
<i>I'll get you something,</i>

856
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:06,334
<i>so you can get some sleep.
Mama loves you, honey!</i>

857
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,668
<i>Attendant, come with me.</i>

858
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,237
<i>I Love you. I love you.</i>

859
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,904
<i>Don't take him.
We'll be back for you.</i>

860
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,762
<i>I'm his mother!</i>

861
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,630
Dr. Lawrence, what
are you doin' here?

862
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,998
Waiting for my ride.

863
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:23,284
Earl Rydiger. Wife
found him unconscious.

864
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,851
Seized in the rig
for three minutes.

865
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,672
Gave him two of Ativan.
History of Type Two diabetes.

866
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:29,590
He's seizing! Two
more of Ativan.

867
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,259
Load him up with
Dilantin, 15 per kilo.

868
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,894
Page Dr. Weaver.

869
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,396
I guess I got myself all
worked up over nothing.

870
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,765
Mrs. Kottmeier, alcohol
abuse is hardly nothing.

871
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,533
Oh, so he had a few
beers with his friends.

872
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,819
Thank God it wasn't
speed or coke.

873
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,242
Your son is an alcoholic.

874
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:46,741
He has a serious
problem we can't ignore.

875
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,327
With your permission I can
refer Chad to a treatment program.

876
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:52,864
Doctor, uh, Finch, I brought my
son here to be tested for drugs.

877
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:55,366
I did not give you permission
to test his blood for alcohol.

878
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,884
Your son needs help.

879
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,986
Look, he's not on drugs, right?

880
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,570
Are you avoiding this because
you have a drinking problem?

881
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,883
How dare you? Come on, Chad.

882
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,436
<i>How much Dilantin's onboard?</i>

883
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,503
Four hundred milligram.

884
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,939
All right, keep pushing it.

885
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,741
PH is low, 6.95.
Potassium's 6.8.

886
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:21,875
Why's he so acidemic?

887
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,978
He's diabetic. Could
be ketoacidosis.

888
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,314
Blood glucose is normal.
- Septic?

889
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,349
Temp and white count
are normal. BP is stable.

890
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,550
Seizure stopped.

891
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,152
I don't understand this.

892
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:33,204
- He's throwing PVCs.
- Lidocaine.

893
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,438
What the hell's going on?

894
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,740
He's seizin' again.

895
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,960
He's gonna arrest.

896
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,261
Dr. Lawrence, can you help me?

897
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,362
I don't work here anymore.

898
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,729
Please, got a guy who's coding.

899
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,731
His pH is falling, and
his potassium's rising.

900
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,995
He's having refractory
seizures. Please.

901
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,738
It's nothing obvious. It's
not DKA. It's not sepsis.

902
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,340
It's not aspirin.
It's not uremia.

903
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,442
He's throwing multi-focal PVCs.

904
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,276
Get me six of Pavulon. Pavulon?

905
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,895
Just do it.

906
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,930
Guy with refractory
seizures and acidemia.

907
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:02,165
Dr. Lawrence has asked
me to give him Pavulon.

908
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:03,601
Come on, push it, Carter.

909
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,320
I've never tried giving Pavulon
for acidemia and seizures.

910
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,904
It's strychnine poisoning.
Give me that. I'll do it.

911
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:19,700
It worked.

912
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,002
How did you know?

913
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,304
Strychnine
competitively antagonizes

914
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:24,972
the central
inhibition of glycine,

915
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,274
which causes hyperexcitation.

916
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,211
I had a case like
this 20 years ago.

917
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:34,415
A patient tried to commit
suicide by eating Gopher Go.

918
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,885
Once you see strychnine
poisoning, you never forget it.

919
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,389
Check his pH. I bet you'll
see it's coming back up.

920
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,224
Dr. Carter, your
patient will recover.

921
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,592
Thank you.

922
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,034
Score one for the
absent-minded professor, huh?

923
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,207
Well, I gotta go.

924
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,936
Gabe, that patient would've
died if you hadn't been here.

925
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,972
This old dog can still
teach you a few new tricks.

926
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,436
I wouldn't be here without you.

927
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:20,544
I just gave you a little
push in the right direction.

928
00:40:20,568 --> 00:40:21,667
That's all.

929
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:24,151
What are you gonna do?

930
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,975
Mark called my son and
asked him to stop by today.

931
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:32,178
We talked, and...

932
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:38,329
Um, I agreed to live with him.

933
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,615
I'm glad.

934
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,705
He's pickin' me up now.

935
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:52,426
I'll see you, Kerry.

936
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,050
I'll see ya.

937
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,182
Did you find that patient?

938
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,450
I called. Nobody's seen him.

939
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,718
What do you got?

940
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,920
Fifty-five-year-old male,
complains of headache

941
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,722
and chest pain along
with gospel singers.

942
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,125
We suspected
carbon-monoxide poisoning.

943
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,710
This is all your
fault. Mr. Owens...

944
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:26,911
We missed the festival.

945
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:29,835
Call Cardiology, and
don't lose him this time.

946
00:41:32,106 --> 00:41:33,134
Mark?

947
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,670
Dad? You all right?

948
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:38,472
Where you been? I've
been worried about you.

949
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,709
I'm fine. A little tired,
but 200 bucks richer.

950
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:42,977
What?

951
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,378
My flight was overbooked,

952
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:45,980
so I volunteered
to take a later one.

953
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,232
You know, they actually
pay you to get<i> off</i> the plane.

954
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,666
Dad, you don't have to worry

955
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,268
about savin' a
couple hundred bucks.

956
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:52,653
You know, I can
buy you a ticket.

957
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,597
I can afford my
own ticket, Mark.

958
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,658
Dad, how about a tour?

959
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,593
I've been in
plenty of hospitals.

960
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,162
Well, you've never
been in this one.

961
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,863
You're the boss
around here, right?

962
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,287
Yeah, one of 'em.

963
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,438
Dr. Kovac, thank you.

964
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,874
Oh, for what?

965
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,859
For doing a good
job on a tough case.

966
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:16,860
<i>Oh.</i>

967
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:18,617
Until next time.

968
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:24,852
Luka, I would like you to stay.

969
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,854
Permanently.

970
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,363
Uh, there's a-an opening here
since Dr. Lawrence is leaving.

971
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,144
Okay.

972
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:34,266
Great.

973
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:37,698
Wanna know how much it pays?

974
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,021
You'll be fair.

975
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,318
See you tomorrow.

976
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:43,126
See ya.

977
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,858
I'll close. What's
his blood loss?

978
00:42:47,882 --> 00:42:49,125
Seven hundred cc's.

979
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,627
Okay, let's give
him another unit.

980
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,895
Normal sinus at 100.

981
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:55,332
Lucky bastard. I
should've let him die.

982
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:56,700
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

983
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,002
You getting him to talk
made it possible to find her.

984
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,504
Yeah, a fat lot
of good that did.

985
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:02,439
Hey, look, she didn't die alone

986
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:04,875
outside and under a bridge.

987
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:07,410
He's in V-tach!

988
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:08,912
His pressure's dropping.

989
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:10,547
All right, let's
get the paddles!

990
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:13,784
Charge to 200.
Paddles are charged.

991
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:16,186
What do you want
to do, Elizabeth?

992
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,843
Elizabeth?

993
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,560
Clear!

994
00:43:24,585 --> 00:43:27,105
He's back.
