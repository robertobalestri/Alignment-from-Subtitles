1
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:16,843
Hey, Dr. Weaver,
you better hurry up!

2
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:18,411
You're gonna miss
the party! What?

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,715
Ha, ha!

4
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,883
Hey, Dr. Weaver.

5
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:25,217
Cleo. You're off?

6
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,519
Uh, Dr. Kovac just gave me 15

7
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,354
to grab my dry-cleaning
before it closes.

8
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:29,456
We're slow, I take it?

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,574
We are now.

10
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:33,009
What's that music?

11
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,548
Looks like nail polish
to me. It's buffed, okay.

12
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,050
You got a manicure, Malik?

13
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,717
Hey, man, that's
what the ladies like.

14
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,486
First thing they check
out is your hands.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,121
I check out the butt, myself.

16
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,256
You know what I'm sayin'?

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,475
Oh, that's a myth. I tested it.

18
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:49,476
Tested what?

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,143
It's so not worth explaining.

20
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,430
Kerry, happy Valentine's Day.

21
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,097
Isn't it a little loud?!

22
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,332
Sorry!

23
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:58,857
Hey, what are you doin'?

24
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:02,656
Oh. Hi, chief. You on?

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,258
All night. I see someone
went overboard with the hearts.

26
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,760
What's wrong with them? Nothing.

27
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:08,161
Want some pizza? No. Thanks.

28
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,729
Isn't...? Wait,
isn't Mark still on?

29
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:11,464
Oh, he left at 8. Double date.

30
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,008
I'm on till 9. Mighty fine.

31
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:17,070
We slowed down. No
one's waiting to be seen.

32
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,439
And I took over the board.

33
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:21,941
Okay. Everyone,
another five minutes

34
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,399
and then back
to work, all right?

35
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,683
I'm sorry, Mrs. Minear,
it was a mistake.

36
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:31,918
It won't... Yeah, I...

37
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:35,155
Well, I was expecting
some money, and it, uh...

38
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,557
I was... I was expecting a
check to clear, and it didn't.

39
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,760
I'm sorry, but I promise... Yes.

40
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,361
I promise I'll get it to you.

41
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:44,363
Thank you.

42
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:46,666
Teach me to check my messages.

43
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,901
Everything okay?

44
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,320
Uh, no. But I'm
sure it'll work out.

45
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,871
God, I'm beat.

46
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,305
Are you leaving?

47
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,641
Yeah. I've been on since
7. I gotta be back here at 7.

48
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:58,078
And I just wanna go
home and hug my girls.

49
00:01:58,102 --> 00:01:59,963
Lose a patient today?

50
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,653
Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:05,001
Nice to have
someone to go home to.

52
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,036
<i>♪ You feel the same way too ♪</i>

53
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,938
Oh, no, girl, Alex
and I broke up.

54
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,640
What happened? I
thought he was The Man.

55
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,774
Yeah, so did my neighbor.

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,009
Ouch.

57
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,011
Luka, do have anybody
you need to hand off?

58
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,245
Oh, yeah, if you want.

59
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,080
Ankle films are back on Cupid.

60
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,517
A Singing Telegram,
slipped on some ice.

61
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,052
I need a doc in Radiology
to inject an IV contrast.

62
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,220
Patient named Rodriguez.

63
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,321
I think that's Carter's.

64
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,523
Okay, find Carter.

65
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,424
I need a bath.
Can I have a bath?

66
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,792
Let me look at your foot first.

67
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,428
Pablo, you're alive, huh?

68
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,712
Oh, yeah, I'm alive.

69
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,414
We haven't seen you in a year.

70
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,448
They put me on a bus.

71
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:36,682
Bus? What kind of a bus?

72
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:37,817
A green one.

73
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,552
A green bus?
Where did it take you?

74
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,720
Oh, I need a bath.

75
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,222
I think Pablo got deported.

76
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,223
It was very hot.

77
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,324
How'd he get back here?

78
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:45,825
That part's a little fuzzy.

79
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,927
I took a long time. I bet.
Welcome back, Pablo.

80
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,729
Yeah, welcome back.

81
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,998
Hey, Kerry. Happy
Valentine's Day...

82
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,233
Or night, I guess.

83
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,434
Yeah, you too.

84
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,170
You know where,
uh, Sobriki is? Who?

85
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:59,205
Paul Sobriki. I got
called down for a consult.

86
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,806
Yeah, I just got on.
Check the board.

87
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,130
Thanks.

88
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,281
So you must be Mr. Morris.

89
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,516
How'd you guess?

90
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,750
Is that my x-ray?

91
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,951
Yep.

92
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,542
Let's take a look.

93
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:16,289
Is the bone broken?

94
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:17,590
Hold on.

95
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,492
Eh. Gotta find another board.

96
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,261
I'll be right back.

97
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,630
Ah, Dr. Weaver, can you
talk to Toxicology for me?

98
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:24,864
What's the problem?

99
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,166
"Bare Butt Booty Oil"?

100
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,833
Kid drank it, but
he's not symptomatic

101
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,335
so they won't test
it. Sent it back.

102
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,470
No ingredient list.

103
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,004
Well, yeah. "Bare
Butt Booty Oil."

104
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,406
Okay, I'll talk to them.

105
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,762
Thanks.

106
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,399

Watch it on the right!

125
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,120
No, I can't stay on the line!

126
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,722
This guy could still be here!

127
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,191
Just get 'em here! Every cop
in the city knows where we are.

128
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:34,160
John! John, can you hear me?

129
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,461
Airway looks clear.

130
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,363
John, open your eyes.

131
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:38,731
No response to command.

132
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,166
Glasgow coma-scale 7.

133
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,051
How long do you think
they were lying there?

134
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,219
Long enough to lose liters.

135
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,803
I can't believe
nobody saw anything.

136
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,206
Let's talk about it later.

137
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,575
One, two, three. Push
etomidate and sux now.

138
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,044
Stab wounds to the
left neck and chest.

139
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:54,714
Oh, man. Two more to the belly.
Right and left upper quadrants.

140
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,649
Number 8 ET tube. What's her BP?

141
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,384
Hold on. Pulse ox
is low. Eighty-two.

142
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,587
That's why I'm tubing her.
Get me a blood pressure!

143
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:01,838
Chest-tube tray.

144
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,223
No, start a central line.

145
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,258
BP is 90/50.

146
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,843
Four units of O-neg, hang
two on the rapid infuser.

147
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,434
Give me some cricoid pressure.

148
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,052
You okay, chief?

149
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,800
I got it.

150
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,820
Okay, start the
central line now.

151
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,238
Betadine and a sterile drape.

152
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:19,505
People are having parties

153
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,889
while these two were in
there bleeding to death.

154
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,581
Two stab wounds
to the left flank.

155
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,950
First one is at L-2, four
centimeters off the midline.

156
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,036
The second one is L-5
in the mid-scapular line.

157
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,754
Did he hit the spinal cord?

158
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,339
Depends on the angle.

159
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,707
BP is 70/50. Pulse, 120.

160
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,843
Squeeze in two liters.
Set me up for a subclavian.

161
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,312
Good breath sounds
bilaterally. Pulse ox, 93.

162
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,496
Should we intubate?

163
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,915
No. Ten liters by mask for now.

164
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,218
Send a trauma panel,
type and cross for four,

165
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,186
and get X-ray in
here for a chest.

166
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,308
And one shot IVP.

167
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,579
I was just talking to him.

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,080
Right here. The patient's gone.

169
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,587
Oh, boy. What's his name?

170
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:09,656
Paul. Paul Sobriki.

171
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,657
Who are you?

172
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,158
Carl DeRaad,
chief of psychiatry.

173
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,559
I was called to consult.

174
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,810
What's he look like?

175
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,379
I don't know. I
hadn't seen him yet.

176
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,947
I'll get his chart.
No, I'll get it.

177
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,491
No one else goes in
here. This is a crime scene.

178
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,595
Oh! Hey!

179
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,796
It's okay. He's a doctor.

180
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,898
Subclavian's in.
- First crit is 31.

181
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,066
Is he conscious?

182
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,201
Is he conscious?!

183
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,636
No, but he is responding
to fluid resuscitation.

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,039
It was some psych patient.
Got Lucy, too, pretty bad.

185
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,775
Roll him, let me see. Oh, man!

186
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,276
Pressure's up to 90 palp.

187
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,378
Why wasn't he in
restraints? I don't know.

188
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,164
- Where's the Foley?
- That's next.

189
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:52,165
Pulse ox is 83.

190
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:53,432
Give it a minute. 10 blade.

191
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,668
Dr. Weaver, the police
are sealing off Curtain 3.

192
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:56,836
They need to talk to anybody

193
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,537
who took care of
the patient right away.

194
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,672
Handle it, Randi.

195
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,091
God, look at this.
Look at this, chief!

196
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,259
Damn it. Damn it.

197
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,427
Tracheal laceration.

198
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,878
She needs a crike. No, a trach.

199
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,979
Get Benton in here.

200
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,547
Prep the neck, and
open a Melker kit.

201
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,266
Now. Let's go. Let's go.

202
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,385
Dr. Benton! Hold on.

203
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,187
Toes are down-going.
That means no spinal injury.

204
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,940
Hang the next two
units on the infuser.

205
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,274
Hold on. It's not set up.

206
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,876
Get it set up! I got it.

207
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,510
Probably got the
descending colon.

208
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,179
Peter, Dr. Weaver
needs you right now.

209
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,231
She has to trach Lucy.

210
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,567
Book an O.R. Get ready to send
Carter up. Where's the Foley?

211
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,603
I'm working on it. Betadine
prep. Sterile drapes.

212
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:32,971
Okay, clear the field of blood.

213
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,812
Hemostat!

214
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,677
Connie, where's the infuser kit?

215
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,982
It should be there.

216
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:46,853
They're not here!

217
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,976
Well, try the, um, top shelf.

218
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,179
What is it?

219
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,380
Uh, a knife.

220
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,349
Don't touch it. We got a weapon.

221
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,050
Any blood? Yeah, some.

222
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,117
It's from the lounge.

223
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,061
We were gonna
use it to cut the cake.

224
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,079
I-I have to go find some tubing.

225
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,066
Are you working on
one of the victims?

226
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,067
Yeah. I'm trying to.

227
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,068
Is he gonna make it?

228
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,069
I don't know.

229
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,070
Is he awake?

230
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,094
Got it!

231
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,408
Second unit is in.
- Got the tubing.

232
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,010
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.

233
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,444
Give a gram of cefotetan.

234
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,114
Right pupil is five
millimeters and reactive.

235
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,304
Left is... John? John!

236
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,804
John.

237
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,605
Deb? Look at me.

238
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,795
Do you know where you are?

239
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,644
My back.

240
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,045
You were stabbed. We've
got your pressure up.

241
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,280
Lucy?

242
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,199
I'm Officer Bernini.
Did you see the man...?

243
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,567
Do we need to do this now?

244
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,735
It's better if...

245
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,603
You'll have to wait! I'm sorry!

246
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,854
What?

247
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,940
Nothing. Looks like he
missed your spinal cord.

248
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,166
BP's 80 palp.

249
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,498
Is that Lucy?

250
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,917
Yes. She's alive.

251
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,502
Dr. Kovac.

252
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,519
What?

253
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,921
What?

254
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,278
What is it?

255
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,368
Get Benton. He
needs to go up now!

256
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,460
Get ready to bag her.

257
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,762
Dr. Benton, we need you!

258
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,863
Hook up the Thora-Seal!

259
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,698
I've got breath
sounds. Dr. Benton!

260
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,166
Carter's got a bad renal lac.

261
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,467
Foley output is bright red.

262
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,869
What's her pulse ox? Down to 80.

263
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,738
Got another surgeon coming?
- Go!

264
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:32,507
Yeah, we're outside!
I'll be right there! Yup.

265
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,598
Dad, wait for us inside.

266
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,581
Register around the
front of the building.

267
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,416
I'm a surgeon! I have to see ID.

268
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,617
We don't have time for this!

269
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,152
And you have to
move the vehicle.

270
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:45,688
There!

271
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,757
Okay, go ahead.

272
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,726
Dad, I need you to move the van.

273
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,261
Where do I park it?

274
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,847
You're asking me?

275
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,415
I want you to stay awake, John.

276
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,017
You stay awake
until you get up there.

277
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,385
You want FFP? Yeah. Two units.

278
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,686
Come on, Carter, stay with me!

279
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,054
How is he? Stab wounds

280
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,355
with renal lacerations.

281
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,756
We're red-lining him to the O.R.

282
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,592
A patient did this? ABBY: Yeah.

283
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:07,726
What's his pressure?

284
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,112
I've got it, Elizabeth.

285
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,446
Kerry needs you. Go! Carter!

286
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,898
Carter, look at me. Come on.

287
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,199
Right in the eye.

288
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:14,800
Stay with me, man. Stay with me.

289
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,902
Xeroform and Elastoplast.
Belly's distended,

290
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,521
probably an
intra-abdominal bleed.

291
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,688
Why wasn't the guy sedated?

292
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,073
I don't know. Get Ultrasound.

293
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,741
W-was...? Was he on a hold?

294
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,127
Was there a sitter with him?

295
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,294
I never saw him! What?

296
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,862
Where are we?
Multiple stab wounds

297
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,248
to the left neck and chest,
right and left upper abdomen.

298
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,534
We did a chest tube, central
line and had to trach her.

299
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,601
How much blood loss?

300
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,902
400 in Thora-Seal.

301
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,672
Could've been another
2000 before we found her.

302
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,008
Yeah, it looks deep.
How long was the blade?

303
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,009
Pressure's down to 60.

304
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,094
She needs volume now.

305
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,862
Maybe not. Could be tamponade.

306
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,314
No, wait! Check the CVP.

307
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,399
Too late! Lost her pulse!

308
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:47,567
We're in P.E.A.

309
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,468
Starting compressions.
Neck veins are up.

310
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:52,070
We need to crack
her. Prep her chest.

311
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:54,190
Okay, amp of epi.
Sterile gloves, please.

312
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,692
You need better exposure.
Stab wound is near the midline.

313
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,327
Sternal saw. Now, Lily.

314
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,662
Go! Go! Go!

315
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,929
Ultrasound is ready.

316
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,031
In a minute. In a minute.

317
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,584
10 blade. Stand back.

318
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,891
Sats are down to 85.

319
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:26,912
Almost got it.

320
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,358
Okay.

321
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,581
Rib spreader.

322
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,550
Suction.

323
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:43,391
V-fib! Start internal
compressions.

324
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,781
You're right. There
is an effusion.

325
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,297
Metz.

326
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:53,683
- Prep internal paddles.
- Pericardium's open.

327
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,751
We've got a major
hemorrhage. More suction.

328
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,303
Looks like the proximal aorta.

329
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,337
Keep your finger on it.

330
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,090
I need a 4.0 prolene
on an RB-1 needle.

331
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,341
Belly's full of blood.

332
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,426
Probably got the spleen.

333
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,727
Gotta cross-clamp the aorta.

334
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,994
One thing at a time.

335
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,180
Autotransfuse
from the cell saver.

336
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,581
Charge the paddles to 15.

337
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,072
Cut! Cut! Cut!

338
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,519
Clear! NURSE: Clear.

339
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,523
We're still in V-Fib.

340
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,575
Another amp of epi.

341
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,365
Clear. NURSE: Clear.

342
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,750
Sinus tach. Check the pressure!

343
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,151
Get a portable monitor.

344
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,719
We're moving her
to the O.R. now.

345
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,704
Hang the other units.

346
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,955
Pulse ox is up to 92.

347
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,019
Pressure's 90
systolic. Let's go!

348
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,876
Whoa! Pulse ox cable!

349
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,144
Is she making urine?

350
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,130
Only 50 cc's in the Foley.

351
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,397
That's better than nothing.

352
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,966
Tell O.R. we have an open chest.

353
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,101
We'll need a laparotomy.

354
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,702
We're waiting on
the type-specific.

355
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,303
Have the blood
bank send it upstairs.

356
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,772
Putting her on bypass?

357
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,040
I don't know. Have a
perfusionist stand by.

358
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,041
Hold the elevator.

359
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,309
Malucci, don't bag so fast.

360
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,878
We don't want to
make her alkalotic.

361
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:56,979
Need anyone else?

362
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,380
I hope not.

363
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,204
Wait! And don't forget
the drug box. Go!

364
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,996
I can't believe this.

365
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,379
You think we got it in time?

366
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:14,913
She has a good chance.

367
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,048
Kerry?

368
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,315
You Dr. Weaver?

369
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,117
You're the one who
found them? Excuse me?

370
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,920
We got a problem with
the Medevac chopper.

371
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,487
Industrial trauma.
Try to divert.

372
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,312
I did but Lakepoint's
closed... Whatever.

373
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:06,715
Peter! I just heard.
What the hell happened?

374
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,283
I'm not sure.
Tammy, this is O-neg.

375
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,451
I asked for type-specific.

376
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,519
He is O-negative.

377
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,804
I'm gonna scrub in.

378
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,811
Hang in there, Dr. Carter.

379
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,158
How many units is that?

380
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,900
That's five, but, uh...
you shouldn't be counting.

381
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,404
It's bad, isn't it?

382
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,154
Well, we're having problems,
uh... keeping your crit up,

383
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,023
but, uh, I think that's
from the renal lac.

384
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:32,992
I'm gonna give you
Versed to relax you a little

385
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,296
before I intubate, okay?

386
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,446
It could be the aorta.

387
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,332
Or the vena cava or
mesenteric vessels.

388
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,733
Oh, God.

389
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,486
Carter, don't worry. I'm
gonna explore the abdomen.

390
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,470
I'm gonna check
out everything, okay?

391
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,847
I'm glad it's you.

392
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,879
Hey, I'm getting you
through this, man.

393
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:56,132
You hear me?

394
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,554
Carter?

395
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,368
Okay, ready to intubate.

396
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,020
Let's prep him for
a midline incision.

397
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,639
I want to be able to
cut in two minutes.

398
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,429
I mean it. You got it.

399
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,515
Had a laceration to
the proximal aorta.

400
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,516
What happened?

401
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,184
She tamponaded.
We had to crack her.

402
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,402
Peter, I got this.

403
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:18,437
Who's on anesthesia?
I got her. Go scrub.

404
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,005
Put her on the table supine

405
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,441
and keep her chest covered
with moist, sterile lap pads.

406
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,708
I don't understand.

407
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,810
You need a six-inch
butcher knife to cut a cake?

408
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,978
Hey, I didn't bring it.

409
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,579
They just told me
that's what we use.

410
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,881
Yes, and we just leave it out?

411
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:46,915
I didn't.

412
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,450
Was it at Admit
or in the lounge?

413
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,085
I don't know.
Somebody said lounge,

414
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,120
but I couldn't find it.

415
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,954
Amira, go upstairs
and get Security

416
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,356
to open up the personnel office.

417
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,725
I need emergency contact
numbers for Carter and Lucy.

418
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,293
Want me to look
through their files?

419
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,961
No, I want you to
bring them down. Go.

420
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,830
Okay, he presented
with a headache.

421
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,598
Who? Paul Sobriki.

422
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,534
Mark, please tell
me that you saw him.

423
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,535
Yeah, I saw him.

424
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,470
Lucy worked him
up, Carter supervised.

425
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,139
And who supervised him?

426
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,573
The LP came back negative.

427
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,176
If you wanted to leave early,
you could have at least rounded.

428
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,877
Kerry, I ran the
board with Dr. Kovac.

429
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,246
For how long? For 30 seconds?

430
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,880
He was up to speed. Hold on.

431
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,449
You didn't tell me
he was psychotic.

432
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,918
I didn't know he was
psychotic. Did he present to you?

433
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,153
No, I didn't see him.

434
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,272
I thought we were waiting
for his psych consults.

435
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,940
Unless his status changes.

436
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,142
Someone should say. I was
managing the whole board.

437
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,777
You were having a party!

438
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,111
Hold on. Kerry! Come on!

439
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,314
We both thought that Lucy
and Carter had it covered.

440
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,549
Well, they didn't. Excuse me.

441
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,752
We both know that
we use the Residents

442
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:40,886
to keep us informed.

443
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,254
You're blaming Carter, Mark?

444
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,323
No, I'm not blaming
anyone. Are you?

445
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,659
Excuse me. I have
Samantha Sobriki with me.

446
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,763
She's looking for her husband.

447
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,936
I got a message on my answering
machine from Lucy Knight.

448
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,335
She said to come down. That...

449
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,893
That Paul's okay, but she
didn't say what was wrong.

450
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,399
You'd better come with me.

451
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,315
That chopper's
landing right now.

452
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,316
What?

453
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,517
The Medevac from Whiting.

454
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,285
Kerry, you go and
change. I'll take it.

455
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,620
Right.

456
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:15,821
What happened?

457
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,523
Oh, good. You're
here. I need you. Okay?

458
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,624
The air squad's here.

459
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,225
Was there a bomb
scare or something?

460
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:21,782
I wish.

461
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,415
No, I don't believe you.
Where's Paul? I wanna see him.

462
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,983
He's not here.

463
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,586
Paul wouldn't hurt
anyone. He couldn't.

464
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,153
He needs help, Mrs. Sobriki.

465
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,923
There's been some
kind of mistake.

466
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,931
We believe he may
have schizophrenia.

467
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,679
What?

468
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:45,489
The first psychotic break
can happen in your 20s.

469
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:47,636
You're wrong, okay?

470
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,260
No, I... You're wrong.

471
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,277
<i>More lap pads.</i>

472
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,645
The kidney won't tamponade.

473
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,446
Didn't have time to get an IVP?

474
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,515
His crit was falling. I
didn't want to chance it.

475
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,285
Colon is lacerated, all right.

476
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,753
All right, 3.0 silk
on a GI needle.

477
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,989
Dr. Anspaugh, there's
blood welling in the hilum.

478
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,690
All right, all right, all right.

479
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,558
Isolate the renal
artery. Get a clamp on it.

480
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,362
He's hypotensive.
Heart rate's 120.

481
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,614
We gotta get this kidney
out before we lose him! Move!

482
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:18,717
Let me finish suturing his colon
before we do something drastic.

483
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,170
I'll dissect out the arteries
and tie them off. Move!

484
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,171
I said wait, Peter!

485
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,772
Why? He's lost too much blood.

486
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,057
His... His hilum is trashed.

487
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,242
He's getting shocky.
Pressure's 78 palp.

488
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,811
All right, pedicle
clamp. Come on.

489
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,479
We still have
time. No, we don't!

490
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,598
Peter, will you calm
down? And you listen to me!

491
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:33,999
Before there's no turning back,

492
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:36,101
let's check the source of
the bleeding once more.

493
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,353
Too many vessels injured.

494
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,026
Squeeze in another
unit. Let's be sure.

495
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:47,079
Too much bleeding. I
can't identify the source.

496
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,279
More suction.

497
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,181
Abdominal lap pads.
I'll pack off the liver.

498
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,651
BP's 105/70.

499
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,853
All right, angled Potts
now. What are you doing?

500
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,922
Pringle maneuver. Have
to cut this blood loss.

501
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,956
More suction, damn it!

502
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,541
The spleen's still bleeding.

503
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,843
Okay, give me a second.

504
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,544
BP's falling, 80/60.

505
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,629
Run another unit.

506
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,514
She's losing it as
fast as we give it.

507
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,704
Then do it quickly!

508
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,222
A and O times four.
BP, 132/82. Pulse, 110.

509
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,791
You sure there
wasn't a projectile?

510
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,992
A bolt? Some hardware?

511
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:17,993
No, just the oil.

512
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,661
Must've been a loose fitting.

513
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,629
Foreman said a small
stream at that pressure

514
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,131
will cut through you like a .22.

515
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,766
Mark? Hey, Dad.

516
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,134
What's going on? Hold on.

517
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,302
Okay, get a trauma panel,

518
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,437
type and cross for four
and an upright chest.

519
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,173
I'll be there in a minute.

520
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,374
A couple of our staff were hurt.

521
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,943
Oh, I heard that
part. Who's that?

522
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,412
I'm just covering.
Everything's a little off-balance.

523
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,413
Where's Elizabeth?

524
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,781
She's upstairs in Surgery.

525
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,251
Dr. Greene... Uh, sorry.
We've got an MVA coming in,

526
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,152
auto vs. pedestrian,
ETA five minutes.

527
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,439
Grab Chen or Malucci. And
Weaver should be around.

528
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:48,874
What do I do with her mother?

529
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,676
Uh... Just give me
a half-hour, okay?

530
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,844
I'll drive you guys home.

531
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,545
Are they gonna
be all right? Who?

532
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,213
Your friends.

533
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,066
I don't know, Dad.

534
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,667
You're acting like
you know he did it.

535
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,768
You don't know he did it.

536
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,370
You're right. We
don't know for sure.

537
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,737
But we still need to find him.

538
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,961
He's not at home. Nobody's
seen him at the diner.

539
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,809
Is there any other
place he might go

540
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,161
if he needed to feel safe?

541
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,428
So he was a little depressed.

542
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:11,752
It doesn't make him crazy.

543
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:13,665
Maybe not.

544
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,367
But at the moment,
we have to assume

545
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,203
he could be a great danger
to himself or other people.

546
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:19,637
It doesn't make any sense.

547
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:20,772
If he was that dangerous,

548
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,716
then why did they
leave him alone?

549
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:26,812
I understand.

550
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,548
This doesn't make
much sense to any of us.

551
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:32,751
But if Paul is in
trouble, he needs help.

552
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:35,776
And it's better if we
can find him now.

553
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:46,131
Sometimes he goes to the
roof when he wants to be alone.

554
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,232
The roof?

555
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:48,972
Of our apartment building.

556
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:53,238
He didn't do this.

557
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:54,439
Bleeding's under control.

558
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,640
If we can just keep it there.

559
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,375
Pean clamp.

560
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,576
Okay, watch the pancreas.

561
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,945
Hold on.

562
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:02,580
I'll enlarge the incision in
the posterior peritoneum.

563
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,717
Watch out for the
splenic flexure.

564
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,786
Got it. I'll clamp, you cut.

565
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,609
Mm-hm. Metz.

566
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,494
Bastard really sliced
the hell out of it.

567
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:17,763
It's senseless.

568
00:22:17,787 --> 00:22:20,132
Why we have to cut up
this poor girl like this...

569
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,734
It's better than the
alternative, isn't it?

570
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,103
Let the renal artery
flush retrograde

571
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,022
before closing the defect.

572
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,391
There. Think we got it?

573
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,527
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

574
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,429
Release the clamp,
let the kidney perfuse.

575
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,087
Okay. Go ahead.

576
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,206
No bleeding.

577
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,742
Hilum's intact.

578
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,511
And the kidney is pinking up.

579
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,014
All right, we did it.

580
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,718
You were right. Thanks.

581
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,568
Well, he could've
lived without a kidney.

582
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,286
I just didn't want
to have to tell him.

583
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,171
Pressure's still down, 80/62.

584
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,406
We caught up on volume?

585
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,641
Almost.

586
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,985
Why is he still hypotensive?

587
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,729
There's some swelling
in the periaortic area.

588
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,064
There's a hematoma forming.

589
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,782
From the lumbar artery?

590
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,867
I hope so.

591
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,151
Hope so? It could paralyze him!

592
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:14,458
It's better than his aorta.

593
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,994
Dissect down to the artery.

594
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,162
Some kind of life to lead, huh?

595
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,530
Well, I hope this is not normal.

596
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:28,188
No. No, no. I don't think so.

597
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:32,220
You've got quite a
girl there in Elizabeth.

598
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,139
Heh. I wish I could
take the credit.

599
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,262
The boarding school raised her.

600
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,165
Oh?

601
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,064
I was teasing.

602
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,987
Oh.

603
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,270
Her... Her father passed on?

604
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:51,862
No. He was still
alive, the last I heard.

605
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,943
Oh. I'm sorry.

606
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,329
Oh, don't be. It
wasn't your fault.

607
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,096
Have you heard anything?

608
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,732
They're both still in the O.R.

609
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:02,434
Think we should go up there?

610
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,375
Nah. I'm sure they'll call
when everything's okay.

611
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,756
What have you got?

612
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,024
John Doe hit by a van running
across Michigan Avenue.

613
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,793
No head trauma, but
repeated questions.

614
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,662
I called a cab!
There's a cab waiting.

615
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,014
I think we got a
looney-toon. Why?

616
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,150
He was running around
naked in the freezing cold.

617
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,174
Get Weaver. Now.

618
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:21,853
You never want to
be doing this to me!

619
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,221
Sure it's him? Yeah, it's him!

620
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,589
What are you doing to me?

621
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,691
Trauma panel, C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

622
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,326
Is he combative? He's agitated.

623
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,561
I'm not taking any chances.

624
00:24:29,585 --> 00:24:32,314
Okay, get the police
detective in here!

625
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,982
Diminished breath
sounds. Get X-ray.

626
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,684
Abdomen is soft, non-tender.

627
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,120
I won't... I won't talk! I
made promises to people!

628
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,288
Pupils equal and reactive.

629
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,889
Paul, do you know where you are?

630
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,741
Who told you my name?!
I don't even know you!

631
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:44,493
Paul, do you remember
what happened?

632
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,044
You can't trick me!
I don't know you!

633
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,213
Abrasions on the
feet. No deformity.

634
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,464
I'm not deformed!

635
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,328
Temperature's 95... No!

636
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,719
Get off of me now!

637
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,287
Leave me alone. Don't stick me.

638
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:58,223
You want some Haldol?
They wouldn't stop.

639
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,176
Dr. Weaver, do you
want some Haldol?

640
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,729
Dr. Weaver?

641
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,797
Two liters of warm saline
and five of Haldol, IV.

642
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:06,965
Where are you going?

643
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:08,633
Looks like fluid in
Morrison's pouch.

644
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:10,202
Can you take this patient?

645
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:12,104
You okay? He's the guy.

646
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:14,523
He's the psych patient.
He got hit by a car.

647
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:15,991
What is it? Can
you just take him?

648
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,859
Okay. We'll send him
to the O.R. Thank you.

649
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,895
BP 120/82 after a liter.

650
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,497
Probably some venous oozing.
Cleo, can you go up with him?

651
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,498
Who's our surgeon?

652
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,567
Whoever's free.

653
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,235
He needs a chest
tube and head CT.

654
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,369
Okay.

655
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:29,921
I don't want you to touch me!

656
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,890
Stop sticking me!

657
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:33,592
No hemotympanum.

658
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:34,593
Let me go!

659
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,394
Keep that mask on him!

660
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:39,352
Don't cut me! Don't cut me! No!

661
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,826
Hell of a way to spend
Valentine's Day, huh?

662
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,030
She's satting at 98
on 30 percent oxygen.

663
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,355
Well, can't ask for better
than that. Good work.

664
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:01,443
How's Carter?

665
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:06,108
Well, it took a while
to control the bleeding.

666
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,209
They salvaged his kidney.

667
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,144
Now they're working
on a colostomy.

668
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,263
Unbelievable. Yup.

669
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:14,332
Dr. Romano? County
supervisor's on the phone.

670
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:15,567
He just heard what happened.

671
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:16,685
Tell him I'm in surgery.

672
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,021
I just told him you got out.

673
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,688
Thank you.

674
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,712
Appreciate that.

675
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:25,165
I'll be right back.

676
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:29,616
Dr. Corday, she's waking up.

677
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,478
Lucy... Lucy, can you hear me?

678
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:41,814
Do you know what
happened to you?

679
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:45,763
There were several stab wounds.

680
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:47,904
One lacerated
your proximal aorta.

681
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,604
We had to perform a
thoracotomy after you arrested.

682
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:55,640
They gave you a trach
to maintain your airway.

683
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:59,144
And we brought you to the O.R.

684
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:02,330
Your liver was damaged,
but we were able to repair it.

685
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,422
However, we did have
to remove your spleen.

686
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:08,992
I'm sorry.

687
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,131
Lucy, you can't speak.

688
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,847
You can whisper
if I plug the trach.

689
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:20,991
Do you want to try that?

690
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,601
Okay.

691
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,628
Remember, only whisper.

692
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,471
Thank you.

693
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:45,707
Bring the proximal
colon to skin surface.

694
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:46,992
3-0 chromic.

695
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:49,927
You hanging in there,
Peter? You look a little ragged.

696
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,229
I'm fine.

697
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,198
Metz.

698
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:54,466
You know, all in all,

699
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,068
I think young Dr. Carter
here is very fortunate.

700
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,836
Well, that depends
on how you look at it.

701
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,972
Dr. Anspaugh, we
need a surgeon in O.R. 3.

702
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:02,374
What is it?

703
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,193
Some kind of penetrating
trauma. Something about oil.

704
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,178
Where's Dr. Corday?

705
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:07,429
Do you want me to page her?

706
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,097
We're busy here.

707
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,865
Why don't you go
take a look? I can finish.

708
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,100
I've come this far.

709
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,218
Patient stable? Yup.

710
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:14,853
Who's with the
patient? Dr. Finch.

711
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:17,037
Ask her to stay
until Corday shows.

712
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,614
They need me in the
O.R. I'll be back, Lucy.

713
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,418
Hold on. Her sat's down to 82.

714
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,321
What is it? Chest
pain? Sudden onset.

715
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,823
Put her up to 100 percent.

716
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,307
We need to go
for a spiral CT now.

717
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,325
PE?

718
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,044
Yes, Lucy, PE is a possibility.

719
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:40,745
What's going on?

720
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:42,614
Sudden onset chest
pain. Dropped her sats.

721
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,815
We're going to scan her
for a pulmonary embolism.

722
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,752
Bolus 5000 heparin. Start
a drip at 1000 an hour.

723
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:49,053
Whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on.

724
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:51,155
Keep going. Come here.
Wait till after the scan.

725
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,224
I don't want to thin her
blood if we don't have to.

726
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:54,792
I think she threw
a massive clot.

727
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,428
She's just had major surgery.
We don't want her to bleed out.

728
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,230
If she can survive
some post-op bleeding,

729
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:00,898
if it is PE and we
don't thin her blood,

730
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,199
she could throw another clot.

731
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:03,568
We'll have FFP standing by,

732
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:05,637
and we won't heparinize
for more than two hours.

733
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,661
I won't need that
long. Let's go.

734
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,328
Were you the one
working on my husband?

735
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,580
Your husband was hit by a car.

736
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:17,782
Collapsed lung, but we fixed it.

737
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,049
No head trauma.

738
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:21,203
And he's seeing
the psychiatrist now.

739
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:22,387
Can I see him?

740
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:26,157
You might want to wait a minute.

741
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,543
We gave him a drug
to calm him down.

742
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,750
No, I really need to see him.

743
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:33,965
There. Right pulmonary artery.

744
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,733
Yep. Get her in
Angiography for a filter.

745
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,803
I'll meet you there.
Get the room ready.

746
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,705
Chest and abdominal
dressings are soaked through.

747
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:44,909
Watch her BP, and
send her for a hematocrit.

748
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,411
Okay. There's
just a little oozing

749
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:47,845
from the incision.

750
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,680
That happens with heparin.

751
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,322
Your blood pressure's fine,
and there's no major hemorrhage.

752
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,870
Lucy, the CT shows a
pulmonary embolism.

753
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,005
Don't worry. We're
taking you to Angiography.

754
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,474
We'll put in a
Greenfield filter.

755
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,992
We'll reverse the heparin.

756
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:03,884
However, you might need
to have another transfusion.

757
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:08,454
Lucy, are you with me?

758
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:14,794
I'll get you through
this. All right?

759
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,950
All right.

760
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,735
Want anything?

761
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,937
Uh, just coffee.

762
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,671
Two coffees, please. KOVAC: Hey.

763
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,040
Hey. CHEN: Hi.

764
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,142
You didn't wanna go
home neither, huh?

765
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,609
Sit down.

766
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,553
We thought it was better
than waiting upstairs.

767
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,514
Pretty scary, huh?

768
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,284
Yeah, pretty scary.

769
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,538
I was complaining about<i> my</i> day.

770
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:49,306
BP's 112/78. Pulse, 102.

771
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,811
AC 14, tidal volume
600, 100 percent FI-O2.

772
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,930
Another two of Versed.

773
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,133
It's just to relax you a
bit during the procedure.

774
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:00,801
I... I want to be awake.

775
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,470
You want to stay awake?

776
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,505
Okay. Okay.

777
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,941
I'm going to numb the
inguinal area with lidocaine

778
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,444
and introduce a catheter
into the femoral vein.

779
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,744
I'll prep. Get gowned.

780
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,113
Spun crit is 32.

781
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,148
Good. Go.

782
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,771
I'll be right back, Lucy.

783
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,822
Don't worry, Ms. Knight. We
put far too much time and energy

784
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,806
into your training
to lose you now.

785
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,895
Greenfield filters are a snap.
I've done about 100 of 'em.

786
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,153
I'll talk you
through it if you like.

787
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,603
BP's down to 60. Pulse ox, 72.

788
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,422
Lucy! Lucy!

789
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:38,589
No carotid pulse.

790
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:40,773
Damn it. She's
throwing another clot.

791
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,650
Start chest compressions.

792
00:31:44,753 --> 00:31:45,896
You, get in here and bag her!

793
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,898
Lizzie, I need you now!
Get me a staple remover!

794
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:48,983
Come on, come on, come on!

795
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,887
Throw some
betadine on the chest.

796
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,605
You're gonna open her?

797
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:54,672
She won't make it to O.R.

798
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:55,974
We need two more nurses.

799
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,075
What happened?

800
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:58,693
She's in PEA. Get wire cutters.

801
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,662
Wire cutters?

802
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,697
We wired the damn breastbone.

803
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:03,998
Dr. Corday's tied up.

804
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,667
What is she doing?
She went down to CT.

805
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,835
All right, can you take
it? Peter, I'm suturing.

806
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,437
Well, I've gotta
run the bowel again.

807
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,673
That man needs
an ex-lap. Now, go.

808
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,137
I'll page you if
anything changes.

809
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,512
Vitals?

810
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,780
BP's 125/85. Pulse, 92.

811
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,015
Crit? Forty-two.

812
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,883
That's normal. Okay,
prep for an ex-lap.

813
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,752
Cleo, stay here until
the surgeon comes.

814
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,820
You're not staying?

815
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,689
I'm still operating on Carter.

816
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:30,058
Start internal compressions
as soon as you can.

817
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,458
The right ventricle's dilated.

818
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,061
Side-biting clamp.
Come on, come on.

819
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:36,097
Do you want a fogarty?
Nope, just a yankauer.

820
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,587
Scalpel.

821
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,234
Try and suck out
whatever we can.

822
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,524
Suction.

823
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,776
Okay. All right,
that's the right side.

824
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,944
We've got a few clots here.

825
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,046
Good. Maybe she'll
get some oxygen.

826
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,514
Pressure's dropping.

827
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,815
He can't wait. Where are they?

828
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,917
Down to 80 palp.

829
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,518
Probably tore a
mesenteric artery.

830
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,819
Get Benton. Lost the pulse.

831
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,887
Starting compressions.

832
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,088
Betadine!

833
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,323
What are you doing?
Thoracotomy tray.

834
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:05,392
H-h-hold on. He... He
only needs a laparotomy.

835
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,961
I don't know how
to do that. Do you?

836
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,129
You can't operate up
here. Wait for the surgeon.

837
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,665
He can take over
when he gets here.

838
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,435
Somebody get me a scalpel!
And get Benton up here now!

839
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,236
- One more 4-0 prolene.
- Pulse ox?

840
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,504
Sixty-eight on 100 percent.

841
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,172
Still not oxygenating.
I don't know.

842
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,674
Removing side clamp.

843
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,276
- V-fib! Resuming compressions.
- Internal paddles.

844
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,800
Charge to 15.

845
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,797
Clear!

846
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:28,499
Still in V-fib.

847
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,368
Charge to 30. ROMANO:
Push an amp of epi.

848
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:31,402
Clear.

849
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,805
Nothing. Again.

850
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,674
Clear.

851
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,276
Sat down to 62.

852
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,979
Charge again. A
hundred of lidocaine.

853
00:33:41,003 --> 00:33:42,947
Clear.

854
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:43,971
No.

855
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,602
Again. Clear.

856
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,836
What the hell are you doing?

857
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,305
Saving his life. You
cracked his chest.

858
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,308
He needed a laparotomy.
Should've been here.

859
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,809
Should've called
me sooner. Gown.

860
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,877
Aorta's cross-clamped.
Pressure's coming up.

861
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,364
This was completely unnecessary.
What were you thinking?

862
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:00,865
A minute ago there
was no pressure.

863
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,734
Now there is. Sterile
gloves. I've got it.

864
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:03,868
He was about to arrest.

865
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:05,175
Step the hell back now!

866
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,322
10 blade.

867
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:08,856
Pulse is down to 90.

868
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,991
All right. Lap pad and
Bovie. Let's move, people.

869
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,460
Peter, I'm sorry
Carter's hurt...

870
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,729
Irrigate the chest with
three liters of warm saline.

871
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,464
Come on.

872
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,465
Clear!

873
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,334
Asystole. Push
an amp of atropine.

874
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:20,335
When was the last epi?

875
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,336
Four minutes ago.

876
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,887
Push another 7 mg now!

877
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,506
Clear!

878
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:34,286
Okay, that's it. We've
done everything we can.

879
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,142
Holding compressions.

880
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:51,604
Oh, damn it.

881
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,013
Son of a bitch.

882
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,064
No.

883
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:07,364
No, no.

884
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:09,467
Let's give a minute for
the last epi to circulate.

885
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:10,731
Charge to 30. Let's go.

886
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:14,022
Come on! Lizzie, let's go!

887
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,512
Robert...

888
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,130
Call it.

889
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,787
Time of death 2:56.

890
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,632
When can I go home?

891
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,034
I don't know.

892
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:04,339
I want to go home. I need...
I need to feed my dog.

893
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:08,042
Paul, we have
someone here to see you.

894
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,033
Paul. Sam.

895
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,283
Are you okay?

896
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,352
It's all right. I wanna go home.

897
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:18,653
Paul, what happened?

898
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,988
They took my clothes.

899
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,022
And they took my shoes.

900
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,607
DeRAAD: Who took
your clothes, Paul?

901
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:23,992
Them.

902
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,160
Who's them?

903
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,696
They had a... A blue cake.

904
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,832
DeRAAD: Is that
where you got the knife?

905
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,750
They were gonna open me.

906
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,552
Paul, where did
you get the knife?

907
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:36,204
They were gonna take my organs.

908
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:37,922
DeRAAD: What organs?

909
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,457
My internal organs!

910
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:43,115
Don't you understand? I
had to... I had to protect them!

911
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,746
Don't try to tell
me I don't know,

912
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,481
because I know.

913
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,800
They were trying to take them.

914
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:51,807
And I had... I had to stop them!

915
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,275
DeRAAD: Is he ready?

916
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,221
Yeah.

917
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:09,587
Do you want to
take him upstairs?

918
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:11,856
Can I...? Can I
please go home now?

919
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,046
I need to feed my dog.

920
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:30,708
I'll meet you in recovery.

921
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:33,610
Is Carter out of the O.R.?

922
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,480
Yeah, he's... He's
extubated in recovery.

923
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,514
Vitals are stable.

924
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,954
Peter... No, no,
no. Listen, um...

925
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:45,022
You were right.

926
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:46,289
I put you in a tough position.

927
00:37:46,313 --> 00:37:47,980
You did what you had to do.

928
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,401
What's wrong?

929
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,339
There was a
complication with Lucy.

930
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,605
Not "Vanessa" Vanessa!

931
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:02,139
The one and only. Oh.

932
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:03,340
You know her?

933
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,109
Oh, I saw her when I
was in medical school.

934
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,379
She comes in with abdominal
pain. Carter orders a pelvic.

935
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:10,147
Tells Lucy the
patient would feel

936
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:11,516
more comfortable with a woman.

937
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,717
Oh, man!

938
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:13,984
Who...? Who's Vanessa?

939
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,436
Lucy's all official.

940
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,437
She's polite.

941
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,556
She gets her tray all in order,

942
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,225
puts on her gloves,
pulls back the curtain...

943
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,443
Carter's outside waiting.

944
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,812
Uh, waiting for
what? The scream.

945
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:25,947
I don't get it.

946
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,849
Carter sent her
in to do a pelvic

947
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,651
on a drag queen.

948
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,675
He did not!

949
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,654
Swear to God.

950
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,323
Terrible. How
could she not know?

951
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,191
Oh, you gotta
hand it to Vanessa.

952
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,926
He's got a better
figure than I do.

953
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,470
What is it?

954
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:47,840
Um, Lucy.

955
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:03,234
BENTON: Tell me
when the vibration stops.

956
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,901
What about the pancreas?

957
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,902
It's totally intact.

958
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,638
He just got the
descending colon.

959
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:09,406
How long will I have
the colostomy for?

960
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,870
About a month.
We'll do a take-down.

961
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,379
Now.

962
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:16,980
Good.

963
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,871
Sensation's intact.

964
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,670
You were lucky, Carter.

965
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,294
I know.

966
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,713
Thank you.

967
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,546
You're welcome. All right.

968
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,347
I'm gonna test
your motor strength.

969
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,770
Lift your leg.

970
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,269
How's Lucy doing?

971
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,638
Come on, man. Lift, lift.

972
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,527
That hurts. I know.

973
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,312
Now, don't let me
push it down, okay?

974
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:50,198
Hold it.

975
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,199
Hold it.

976
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,534
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

977
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,157
Good, good.

978
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,738
Oh.

979
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,473
My back is killing me.

980
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,507
Yeah, I know.

981
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,075
Hematoma around
the lumbar plexus.

982
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,344
I'll give you some morphine.

983
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,968
I want you up and
walking in 12 hours, okay?

984
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,678
Lucy's dead, isn't she?

985
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,369
Oh, you're home.

986
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,985
Is everything all right?

987
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,608
No.

988
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,158
Do you want to tell me about it?

989
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,215
Not particularly.

990
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,187
I'll make breakfast.

991
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:30,081
We still need a pressure
transducer for Trauma 1.

992
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:31,482
Get two units of
O-neg down here.

993
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:32,550
We're out of Ancef.

994
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,152
Well, call the pharmacy.

995
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:38,711
Mark... I just heard.

996
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:42,593
How did this happen?

997
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:44,695
Can we, uh, talk about it later?

998
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:45,719
Yeah. Sure.

999
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,668
Something coming in?

1000
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,437
Multi-victim trauma.

1001
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:54,739
Assembly-line accident.

1002
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,640
Told them we'll take
two majors, six minors.

1003
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,042
ETA? They're rolling up.

1004
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,211
I just realized we're short
a doc and a med student.

1005
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:01,712
Hey, Abby, are you on? No.

1006
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,414
We're short. Can you cover?

1007
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,082
Uh... Sure.

1008
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,106
Great. I need
someone to cover triage.

1009
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:16,594
Forty-two-year-old male.

1010
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,828
Crush injury, right arm.

1011
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:19,797
Gave him morphine
and two liters in the field.

1012
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:21,398
A little shocky, 90/60.

1013
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:22,766
Neuro-circ intact?

1014
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,668
No. Couldn't get a
radial or brachial pulse.

1015
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:25,703
Multiple fractures.

1016
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:28,405
Okay. Call Ortho and Vascular.

1017
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:31,475
Type and cross for four.
Get him into Trauma 2.

1018
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,044
I had to close her chest.

1019
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,174
Thank you.

1020
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,086
The nurses can do that.

1021
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,073
I know.
