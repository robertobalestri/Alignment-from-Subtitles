1
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,555
One minute, I'm freezing,

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,723
the next I'm burning up.

3
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,792
I can't keep anything down.

4
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,128
Sir. It's probably the
flu. It's going around.

5
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,530
Oh, I got body
aches, nasty cough.

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,216
I really need to see a doctor.

7
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,853
Have a seat. We'll
get to you in a minute.

8
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:28,488
That's what you
said an hour ago.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,090
Hey. I need to go home, chief.

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,159
Forget it, Malucci. We're
shorthanded as it is.

11
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,927
No, really. I just
puked up my breakfast.

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,963
So did half the Radiology techs.

13
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:38,231
I got a fever, all right.

14
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,132
Feel my head.
Feel your own head.

15
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:42,469
Well, cold and flu season
has hit with a vengeance.

16
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,604
Yes, take your pick.

17
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,039
Fever, sore
throats, runny noses,

18
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:48,941
assorted aches
and pains, vomiting.

19
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,343
Why don't these people go home?

20
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,345
My point exactly. I got
it coming out both ends.

21
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,947
Thanks for sharing, Dave.
Okay, the lab is backed up.

22
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,149
It's taking four
hours to get a CBC.

23
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:58,985
They're 40 behind in Triage.

24
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,219
You look awful, Kerry.

25
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:01,954
Yeah, and I look
better than I feel.

26
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,357
No telemetry beds, we're
boarding seven patients.

27
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:07,159
Carol called in
two... registry nurses.

28
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:08,995
God only knows
when they'll get here.

29
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,031
Nasty cough, Kerry.
You should see a doctor.

30
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:13,332
I should too. You don't want me

31
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,701
exposing the patients, do you?

32
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,803
Take some Imodium. Wear a mask.

33
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,223
Did you touch the thermostat?

34
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,025
No, I just cleaned
out the sediment.

35
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,793
Morning, Mark. Good morning.

36
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,528
Hey, Mark. Did you
let the faucets run?

37
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,697
Yeah, for, like, 10 minutes.
It was freezing cold.

38
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,333
I had to boil water on the stove
and wash my hair in the sink.

39
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,385
I'll have to call a
plumber. No, no, no.

40
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,686
Let... Let me look at it again.

41
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,388
A plumber will want
to sell you a new one.

42
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,972
It's old, not dead.

43
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,425
What?

44
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,127
Kovac is fixing
your water heater?

45
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,151
Well, trying to fix it.

46
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:45,664
He was dropping
me off, Mark. Oh.

47
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,866
From work.

48
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,834
I was complaining about
it making some noise,

49
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,104
and he w... Why am I
even explaining this to you?

50
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,338
Beats me.

51
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,507
No, it's not what think.
Then what am I thinking?

52
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,409
I don't know, but
it's not. It's not what?

53
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,993
It's not anything.

54
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,097
Move back, now.

55
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,121
We're coming through.

56
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,452
If you've got the
flu... Excuse me.

57
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,737
It's too late for a flu shot.

58
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,372
I'm Abby Lockhart.
ER, please hold.

59
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,236
I'm supposed to
be... ER. Please...

60
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,164
ER.

61
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,545
Abby. Yeah.

62
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,780
Did they send you
down here? Um, yeah.

63
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,848
Oh, God. I was wondering

64
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,352
when we were
gonna get some help.

65
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,352
Carol. Hathaway.

66
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,522
Right. You were my
OB nurse. Thanksgiving.

67
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,190
Twins girls. How
are they? Great.

68
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,776
Sleeping through the night.
Just not at the same time.

69
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,444
I don't know how
do you do it. Well,

70
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,612
it's not easy, but neither
is managing 36 patients

71
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,681
when we're short two
nurses. Well, actually...

72
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:37,716
Coming through. I
found him in the L station.

73
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,185
I asked him to
move. He can't walk.

74
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,887
What's open, Carol? If
you can find a bed, grab it.

75
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,956
Oh.

76
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,023
Sorry. That's lovely.

77
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,624
Somebody call Housekeeping!

78
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:46,826
Yeah, great. Med students.

79
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,127
They think we're their maids.

80
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,929
We are so swamped.
Right. But actually...

81
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:51,797
Can you send Mr. Sranski
up for a chest film?

82
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,865
Sranski? Flu patient.

83
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,233
That helps.

84
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,235
You're gonna need
scrubs. No. I don't think...

85
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,072
Haleh, do we have any
scrubs? I don't know, I don't care.

86
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,306
We really do get along.

87
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,108
Hey, Carol, you
believe in zombies?

88
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,509
What? <i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

89
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,978
Human cadavers walking the earth

90
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,545
after they've died?

91
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,148
No. What's Earl Cartesh's
body still doing in Exam 1.

92
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:11,417
I called Transport. What do
you want me to do about it?

93
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,718
Piggyback it to the morgue.

94
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:13,953
I need the bed.

95
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:16,272
Residents. Only thing
worse than students. Right.

96
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,908
Can somebody take this?
I've been waiting five minutes.

97
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,910
Did you call ahead?
Yeah. Todd Sullivan, 5,

98
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,678
of the sledding
Sullivans. Good vitals.

99
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,780
But he took a nasty header

100
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,147
while sledding. Mom's coming.

101
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,016
I lost my teeth.

102
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,184
Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

103
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,285
They're your baby teeth.

104
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,704
Hey, Malik, can you call a doc?

105
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,438
Yeah, right. Good luck.

106
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,107
He's avulsed his front incisors.

107
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,842
We need a C-spine and a head CT.

108
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,476
Yeah, if we can
find a doc to order it.

109
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,378
I could do it. What?

110
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,815
Med students work on
patients, right? Yeah.

111
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,850
I'm a third-year. I start
my ER rotation today.

112
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,618
You're a med student?

113
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,253
Yes.

114
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,177
What can I say? I crossed
over to the dark side.

115
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,561
His facial films are clear,
and I paged an oral surgeon.

116
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,362
Luka, do you want me
to update his tetanus?

117
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,930
He had one a year
ago. Uh, guess not.

118
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,883
By the way, I'm Luka Kovac.

119
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,751
Abby Lockhart. I'm a third-year.

120
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,787
Another new resident
in the middle of the year?

121
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,755
Well, I'm a med student. Oh.

122
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,657
Another half gram of Ancef?

123
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,192
Uh, Abby?

124
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,244
Uh, sure. Sounds good.

125
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,118
Okay. Nice job.

126
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,917
Well, we never had
doctors like that up in OB.

127
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,352
Hm. Easy on the eyes, isn't he?

128
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,321
I'll say. Is he single?

129
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,323
He doesn't talk
about his personal life.

130
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:14,524
Ooh. Tall, dark, handsome

131
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,859
and mysterious, huh?

132
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,861
What are you doing? Cleaning up.

133
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,663
Oh, don't worry. I
got it. Don't be silly.

134
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,299
No, really, I got it.

135
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,889
Okay.

136
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,293
Um, Carol.

137
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,774
I'd love to see some
pictures of your girls later.

138
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,413
Sure.

139
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:38,114
He has to take his
blood-pressure pills every day.

140
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,782
Well, sometimes he forgets.

141
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,150
Well, maybe you can remind him.

142
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,618
S-sometimes I forget.

143
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,021
Well, maybe you can put a
note on your medicine cabinet

144
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,289
to remind you.

145
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:50,092
That's a good idea.
I'll try to remember that.

146
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,128
Hey, Mark, I'm...
I'm feeling horrible.

147
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,629
Can you cover
the rest of my shift?

148
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,798
Must be bad. I don't
remember you taking a sick day.

149
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,499
I'd rather die at home.

150
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,201
Oh, and we have a
new medical student.

151
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,702
Make sure she
doesn't kill anyone.

152
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,539
Hey, Malucci, leave
her alone. Abby...

153
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,541
Give me a break,
chief. Yeah, suck it up.

154
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,177
Abby Lockhart, third-year,
Mark Greene, Attending.

155
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,545
We've met. Good.

156
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,048
Good. I'll see you tomorrow,
if I live through the night.

157
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,750
So she wasn't hallucinating?
No, I'm a med student.

158
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,819
And an OB nurse.
Well, I take a shift

159
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,187
occasionally to pay the bills.

160
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,889
Right. Well, welcome
to the glory that is ER.

161
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,492
Has anybody given you
the $3 tour? No, not yet.

162
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,994
Well, you start
here by signing up

163
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,395
for your patient on the board.

164
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,764
Grab a T-sheet based
on the chief complaint.

165
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,532
Nurses' orders go here.

166
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,102
Labs and x-rays
go here for the clerk.

167
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,171
Any questions? So far, so good.

168
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,940
That's Curtain Area 1.
This is Curtain Area 2.

169
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,741
That's Yosh Takata.
Wave hi to Yosh.

170
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,116
Hi.

171
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,163
That's Trauma 1,
Trauma 2. Haleh...

172
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,265
We've met. Hi.

173
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,532
Still hurting, Todd?

174
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,334
A little. Yeah?

175
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,102
Uh, we gave him
four, uh, morphine.

176
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,237
Can we give him two more?

177
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:53,005
Why not. You sure
you need this tour?

178
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,173
Couldn't hurt.

179
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,875
Then come on. The
tram doesn't stop.

180
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,611
You need to keep your hands
and arms inside at all times.

181
00:06:58,635 --> 00:06:59,845
What do you got, Carter?

182
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:02,348
This is Darnel Smith, 13,
with muscular dystrophy.

183
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,350
Visiting us with a
possible forearm fracture.

184
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:07,553
What happened, Darnel?
Loser pushed me down the stairs.

185
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,255
In your wheelchair? Duh.

186
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,789
Yeah, he got into
a fight at school.

187
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,024
Cleo's got the pusher.

188
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,226
All right. Well, let's keep

189
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,094
the two of them apart, shall we?

190
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,096
Oh, that was Carter. Got it.

191
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,032
And this is the Pedes ER. It's
really just a large exam room

192
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:21,667
with, uh, pediatric equipment

193
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,668
and murals on the wall.

194
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,736
Hey, Cleo.

195
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,854
Hey.

196
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,656
I was just going to class,

197
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,491
and then he just started
freaking out on me

198
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,626
in the hallway when
I tried to get past him.

199
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,662
That's no reason to
push a kid down the steps.

200
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,664
Yeah, well, he...
Especially in a wheelchair.

201
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,031
I didn't even push the psycho

202
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,267
until he stabbed
me with his pencil.

203
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,653
What are you looking at?

204
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,739
Darnel, don't be rude.

205
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,374
Well, the good news
is his arm's not broken.

206
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,243
I can't believe one
of his classmates

207
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,212
would be cruel
enough to do this.

208
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,513
Well, I heard that he
might have provoked it.

209
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,882
Darnel, is that true?

210
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,305
No.

211
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,803
He's been acting up lately.

212
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,171
At home and at school.

213
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,473
Is he in special ed?

214
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,408
No. He's in a regular classroom.

215
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:05,144
We wanted his life to
be as normal as possible.

216
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,462
It says here you have cancer.

217
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,981
They're gonna
chop off your penis.

218
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,066
Hey, that's enough
of that. Darnel!

219
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,733
He's just kidding.
He's just kidding.

220
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,602
Mrs. Henry, why don't
you go wait in Chairs.

221
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,003
I don't like to leave him alone.

222
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,473
Well, I still need to check
him for other injuries.

223
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,709
Oh, all right. You
behave yourself.

224
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,545
A-and I'll be right
out in the waiting area

225
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,049
if you need anything, honey.

226
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,651
So, Darnel...

227
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,195
sounds like you're having
a little trouble in school.

228
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,124
That wouldn't
have anything to do

229
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,548
with your muscular
dystrophy, would it?

230
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,719
So suddenly you don't speak.

231
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:44,583
I can't feel my toes.

232
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,585
It looks like you have
frostbite, Mr. Clayton.

233
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,021
Do we need to
débride? Is he diabetic?

234
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,689
No. He has a
respiratory infection.

235
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:52,491
Probably the flu.
But his lungs are wet.

236
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,227
All right. Skin is pliable.
Frostbite is superficial.

237
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:58,597
Start him on a rapid rewarm
of 105-degree circulating water

238
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,965
for 20 minutes, okay? Thanks.

239
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,567
Is anybody in
this city not sick?

240
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,135
It's like the damn
plague down here.

241
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,637
I don't suppose you're here to
lend a helping hand, are you?

242
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,273
Why mess with natural selection.

243
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,909
A good influenza epidemic
thins the herd. Where's Kerry?

244
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,111
She went home sick.

245
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,934
They wonder why we
call them the weaker sex.

246
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,049
Oh, did you, uh,
book an O.R. for 3:00?

247
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:18,884
Oh, yeah. I saw an
opening, so I grabbed it.

248
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,187
I'm assisting Dr. Ashcoff
on a facial-scar revision.

249
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:23,155
Why can't that be done
in the Plastics clinic?

250
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,458
Multiple scars. Ashcoff
wants to do it under General.

251
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,059
And what does that
have to do with you?

252
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,860
Well, the little girl's
a patient of mine.

253
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:30,996
I'm following up on a dog
bite from six months ago.

254
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,431
Yeah, so?

255
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:33,865
Well, Medicaid won't cover it.

256
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,568
So, uh, I got Ashcoff
to donate his time.

257
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:37,236
I was hoping that...

258
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We provide
medically-necessary services

259
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:40,872
to the poor.

260
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,674
That does not include
cosmetic surgery.

261
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,577
What's next,
liposuction for fat kids?

262
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,944
A little girl is disfigured.

263
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,147
Look, Peter... I admire
your noble effort.

264
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,781
But this is exactly
the kind of thing

265
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,084
that could lose our
state funding, okay?

266
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,308
I'm sorry, big guy.

267
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:56,922
I won't get lead poisoning,
will I? From the pencil?

268
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,491
They use graphite in pencils.

269
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,959
Temp's 99.2.

270
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:00,960
Did that hurt?

271
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:03,762
Ah, no. No. It's just cold.

272
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,298
Oh. Sorry.

273
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,605
How did you get these bruises?

274
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:13,894
Uh, I don't know.

275
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:17,743
Who hit you, Marty?

276
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,044
Some kids at school.

277
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:20,546
Are you sure?

278
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,748
Oh, yeah, I'm sure. I mean,
I'm there when they do it.

279
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:24,183
Do your parents know about this?

280
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,318
No.

281
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,220
What about the
teachers or the principal?

282
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:29,122
Yeah, so that they
can really kill me?

283
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,206
What's this?

284
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,708
Uh... Mosquito bites.

285
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,909
In February?

286
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,212
They must be hungry.
You have quite a few.

287
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,315
Look, is my dad coming?

288
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,816
He's on his way.

289
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,150
I'll be back.

290
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,423
Get a CBC, Chem-20,
and a tox screen.

291
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,492
Those are infected track marks.

292
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,293
What exactly am I looking for?

293
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,862
Top of page 4. I was enjoying

294
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,162
my first free morning in ages.

295
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,964
Sat down with a
paper, when I spotted it.

296
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,965
What?

297
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,966
Oh.

298
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,635
For Pete's sake.

299
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,739
"University of Chicago's
Department of Astrophysics..."

300
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,908
Blah, blah, blah. "will
present a symposium."

301
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,778
Blah, blah. "Guest
speakers include..."

302
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,613
"Isabelle Corday." Your mother.

303
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,548
Yes.

304
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,216
I see the resemblance.

305
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,251
I look like my father.

306
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,554
See, you didn't tell me your
mother's coming to town.

307
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,524
I didn't know. It's so like her.

308
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,858
You guys having a fight?

309
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,127
No. No. She's just
being Mother. Oh.

310
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,529
You know, you should call her.

311
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,933
I'm supposed to come to
her, that's part of the game.

312
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,101
Or don't call her.

313
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,269
I won't. I'm not
playing anymore.

314
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,371
Get off me! I'll kill you!

315
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,040
Yeah... I'll kill
you! Hold still!

316
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,675
Was he trying to hurt himself?

317
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,276
No, he's just freaking out.

318
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,679
Is he on any medication?
He's on drugs.

319
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,115
Yeah. Looks like PCP
to me. What happened?

320
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,617
Jumped out a third-story window.

321
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,018
Let me go! I'll kill you!

322
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,220
He didn't even feel it. He
tried to walk away from it.

323
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,472
He'll feel something soon
enough! Get out of the way!

324
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,473
What are you doing?

325
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:55,641
I wanna tape this so he sees

326
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:56,742
what he acts like on this.

327
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,327
Chris, We're trying to help.

328
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,962
Bilateral tibial deformities.

329
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,265
He's broken both
legs. Exposed bone.

330
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,667
Ever seen an open
fracture? Not up close.

331
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,502
He's taching away.
Pulse is strong.

332
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,254
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

333
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,424
Ten of Haldol, I.M.
Get those restraints on.

334
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:13,593
Get that out of here!

335
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,261
Please back up,
let the doctors work.

336
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,679
No, no, this is too good.

337
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,780
Now! CORDAY: CBC, coag panel,

338
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,349
tox screen, UA and a myoglobin!

339
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,083
I'm gonna kill you, you bitch!

340
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,085
I need that Haldol now!

341
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,570
What? More restraints or Haldol?

342
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,489
I got it. CORDAY:
Okay, tetanus booster,

343
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:27,690
gram of Ancef! Let me go!

344
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,244
Okay. Roll him.

345
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:32,717
Give it in the thigh interior.

346
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,784
Ow! Ow.

347
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,536
You okay? Yeah.

348
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,837
I'm gonna need a culture swab.

349
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,005
Set me up for P.M. splints!

350
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,473
Let me go!

351
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:51,463
You had Heptovax, right?

352
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,665
Yeah. But the patients
generally don't bite in OB.

353
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,668
Yeah, it's an occupational
hazard down here.

354
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,403
Serologies will
be back tomorrow.

355
00:12:58,427 --> 00:12:59,839
Don't sweat it.

356
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,374
Bet you didn't expect to
be your own teaching case.

357
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:05,978
Well, I expected the ER to be different.
- Ow!

358
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,380
Well, if you would stop
squirming, I could get it in.

359
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:09,782
Well, could you be any rougher?

360
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,567
Could you whine anymore?

361
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,071
Dave. Be glad she's
not putting in a Foley.

362
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,272
We have a tradition down here

363
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,374
that once you've been
bitten by a raving lunatic,

364
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,042
you're ready to see patients.

365
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,277
I don't know.

366
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,278
Grab a chart.

367
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,812
And yell if you
get into trouble.

368
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,748
Okay.

369
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,949
Carol... can you
keep an eye on her?

370
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,984
Sure.

371
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,874
Oh, and update her tetanus.

372
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,224
I want you to press on my hand

373
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,649
like you're stepping on the gas.

374
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,230
Uh, that's good.

375
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,534
Let's do the other foot.

376
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,311
You do much driving, Darnel?

377
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,527
Okay.

378
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,508
Okay.

379
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,444
Now I want you to
squeeze my hand.

380
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,778
And if you make me scream,

381
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,247
I'll give you a prize.

382
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,548
Give me a break.

383
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,817
He speaks!

384
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,319
Okay, come on.

385
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,320
I wanna see how the MD's

386
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,624
affecting your body.

387
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,424
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy

388
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,360
is an x-linked
genetic disorder...

389
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,131
characterized by the progressive
wasting of skeletal muscles.

390
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,234
First you lose your
legs, then your arms,

391
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,669
and then you die.

392
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,527
That's how it's
affecting my body.

393
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,913
I want you to
hold his head still.

394
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,414
I'm sorry, he's
gotten to the point

395
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,282
where he really hates hospitals.

396
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,851
It's okay, Conner,
don't be afraid.

397
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,936
We wanna make you better.

398
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,804
He's really a good-natured kid,

399
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:41,673
you know, considering
everything he's been through.

400
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,743
What kind of surgery has he had?

401
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,111
He had a Nissen fundoplication

402
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,412
for gastroesophageal reflux.

403
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,748
He's had a hemicolectomy,

404
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,866
and a few laparotomies
for adhesions.

405
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,168
When did he start vomiting?

406
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,202
This morning.

407
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,204
Okay, mucus membranes are moist.

408
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,374
Were you feeding him
orally or through his G-tube?

409
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,442
Well, I gave him a little
bit by mouth last night.

410
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,844
But not enough to induce this.

411
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,213
I'm praying it's just the flu.

412
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,049
But I'm afraid he's got
another bowel obstruction.

413
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,584
Abby. Can you get this?

414
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,103
We have a foreign
body ingestion in Exam 2.

415
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,204
Sure. Just a sec.

416
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,538
Luka? Hm?

417
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:14,706
Can I steal Abby from you?

418
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,242
We're really
backing up out there.

419
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,077
Yeah, yeah. It's okay. Go ahead.

420
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:20,512
So, what do you think it is?

421
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,781
I'm not sure.

422
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:24,316
I'm gonna have to
take some x-rays first.

423
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,351
Carol, uh, can I get a weight

424
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,520
and a three-way
abdominal series?

425
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,055
Sure.

426
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,825
You dehydrated or something?

427
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,693
How'd you guess? Jeremy Barnes.

428
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,362
Three days of abdominal
cramping, some diarrhea.

429
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,764
Maybe a low-grade fever

430
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,065
with a history of a triple-A.

431
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,233
How are you feeling, sir?

432
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:42,835
Lousy.

433
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,069
Mm-hm. Any vomiting?

434
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:47,072
No. I... I... I feel
real nauseous now.

435
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,607
When was your aneurysm repaired?

436
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,375
Uh. Year and a half ago. I...

437
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,409
Any complications?

438
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,245
No complications. I...

439
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,947
I was feeling great
until last week.

440
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,715
Well, it's benign.
It's just the flu.

441
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:57,850
Thank you. Mm.

442
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,339
You're welcome.

443
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,373
Maybe he's telling the truth.

444
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,374
Mm, kids his age,

445
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,775
school can get kind of rough.

446
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,278
This isn't roughhousing. He
has skin-popping abscesses.

447
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,713
You get a tox screen?

448
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,048
It's negative. Only the
white count's up. He's clean.

449
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,216
You can't be sure.

450
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,884
Tox screen doesn't
cover everything.

451
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,519
What are you
thinking? I don't know.

452
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,755
But, uh, maybe you
can bluff it out of him.

453
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,258
Lucy, you okay?

454
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,992
Somebody stole my patient.

455
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,827
Peter, did you
steal Lucy's patient?

456
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,685
Check the lost and found.

457
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,466
Dr. Benton?

458
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,268
Hi. Mrs. Fulton. Hi.

459
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,270
I took Tia up to
surgery to register,

460
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,572
and the nurse said she can't
have her operation today?

461
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,074
Uh... You... Actually,
I tried to call you.

462
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,509
Please, have a seat. Come on.

463
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,344
Um, there's an availability

464
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,412
problem in the O.R.

465
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,547
Mm-hm. Did Dr. Ashcoff
change his mind?

466
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,548
No, no, no, no, no.

467
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,900
We just have to reschedule.

468
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:51,792
Well, we came all
the way down here.

469
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,156
We can wait.

470
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,391
Tia hasn't eaten in
eight hours like you said...

471
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,927
We can't... do it today.

472
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,231
I'm... I'm sorry.

473
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,383
I'm not gonna get 'em fixed?

474
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,352
You waited this long.

475
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:08,896
A few more days
isn't gonna hurt.

476
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,056
Hold on a minute, honey.

477
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,013
Can we...?

478
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,762
It has taken me
months to get Tia

479
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,797
to step out of the house.

480
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,349
I can't give her false hope.

481
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,935
Now, if this isn't
gonna happen...

482
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,758
you need to tell us.

483
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,490
It's gonna happen.

484
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,795
I just need a little
time, that's all.

485
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,033
Thanks.

486
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:39,117
Mr. Barnes needs 5 of Compazine.

487
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,653
Then run a liter
of saline through

488
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:43,077
and check his electrolytes.

489
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,758
Can't you get a
nurse to do that?

490
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:47,125
Rumor has it you used to be one.

491
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,560
Well, that's not why I'm here.

492
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,629
You're absolutely right.
You're here to learn.

493
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,631
And this is a great
opportunity for you to learn

494
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,466
how to check his stool for...

495
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,402
fecal leukocytes.

496
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,958
Thanks.

497
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:02,007
What's his pulse
ox? It's down to 82.

498
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,374
And how much O2 is he on?

499
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:05,065
Ten liters.

500
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:08,614
The flu is making it

501
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,915
difficult for you to breathe.

502
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:12,756
Ah, it ain't... just the flu.

503
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,294
It ain't...

504
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,008
No. You also have

505
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,810
what's called
congestive heart failure.

506
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,911
And we need to put a tube

507
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,630
down your throat
to help you breathe.

508
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:27,287
No. Thank you.

509
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,732
Do you have someone we can call?

510
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,855
No.

511
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,391
All my friends is homeless.

512
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,310
No phones.

513
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,812
Any family?

514
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:41,335
None.

515
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,766
Okay.

516
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,569
I really think you need
to go on a ventilator.

517
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,654
No.

518
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:51,389
Thank you.

519
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:55,093
I... always hoped I might...

520
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:58,130
die in a warm bed.

521
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,398
W... With clean sheets.

522
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:02,856
If it's all the same to you.

523
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:12,277
X-rays show nonspecific
bowel gas pattern.

524
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,146
So it's not another adhesion?

525
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,147
Right.

526
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,614
Blood gas is back.

527
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,784
PH is 7.38. PCO2 is 30.

528
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,619
Is it respiratory alkalosis?

529
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:24,489
Partly. But, uh,
also an acidosis.

530
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,809
It's... It's complicated.
Are you a nurse?

531
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,510
Oh, no. I've just
read every book

532
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,279
and every Internet
article on chalasia.

533
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,497
Last time, did they
do an upper GI?

534
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,299
Six months ago. They
thought he might have

535
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,869
a gastric outlet blockage.

536
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:38,871
You're not gonna have
do that again, are you?

537
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:40,406
It will rule out an obstruction.

538
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,940
Oh, no, please. It was horrible.

539
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,842
He couldn't swallow the barium.

540
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,527
T-they had to put an
NG tube up his nose.

541
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,246
He wouldn't stop
crying. Mrs. Brant,

542
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,913
I know Conner has
been through a lot.

543
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,716
But he has a severe
metabolic disorder,

544
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,218
and we... We have to find
out what's making him sick.

545
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,170
And I'll be as
gentle as possible.

546
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,872
Okay?

547
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,840
Okay.

548
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,330
I'll be back.

549
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,931
What?

550
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,366
You tell me.

551
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,903
Nothing.

552
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,639
We tested your blood, Marty.

553
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,507
Yeah? So?

554
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,609
So where do you
get the dirty needles?

555
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,828
What do you mean?

556
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,602
Marty, I know.

557
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,336
You can't tell my dad. Please.

558
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,603
He's not gonna understand.

559
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,122
You can't use dirty needles.

560
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,423
You're getting an infection.

561
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,924
And if you share,
you could get HIV.

562
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,359
Do you know what that is?

563
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:35,443
Yeah, don't even worry.

564
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,379
I stole them from
my grandmother.

565
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,414
She's got diabetes.

566
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,599
Why are you doing this?

567
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:43,302
Mm. Kids with crooked
teeth get braces, and...

568
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,971
my mom got laser
surgery on her eyes.

569
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,807
You know, why
can't I use hormones?

570
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,951
For what?

571
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,065
To grow taller.

572
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:56,365
You're injecting human
growth hormone?

573
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,132
Where do you get it?

574
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,235
Look, it... It's not illegal.

575
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,037
You can't get HGH
without a prescription.

576
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,238
Where do you get it, Marty?

577
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,992
Off the Internet.

578
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,394
Then you don't even
know what's in it.

579
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,296
Do you have any idea
what sort of health risks

580
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,881
you've exposed yourself to?

581
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,667
W... Well, it can't be any worse
than being beat up every day.

582
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,835
I mean, even that stupid
kid in the wheelchair

583
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,359
thinks that he can pick on me.

584
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,542
Look. If you can get
me the real stuff, I-I...

585
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:25,577
Hormone therapy is for kids

586
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:26,578
who have problems,

587
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:28,313
not for healthy adolescents.

588
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:30,448
Yeah, well, I'm not healthy.

589
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,450
You know, I go to
school every day

590
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:34,686
knowing that I'm
gonna be beat up

591
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,688
or shoved into a locker

592
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,796
or dragged into the
girls' shower room.

593
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:42,027
Do you have any idea

594
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,196
how embarrassing it is to
be stuffed inside a trash can

595
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,621
while the whole
cafeteria's laughing at you?

596
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,293
Hormones aren't
going to help that.

597
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,207
Yeah?

598
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,764
Well, being bigger will.

599
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,685
Hey. Hi.

600
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,039
You okay?

601
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,040
Oh, yeah.

602
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,675
Have you seen the Cetacaine?

603
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,477
No. I haven't used any.

604
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,479
We always keep
it on this counter.

605
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,348
Sorry. Ugh.

606
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,682
Um, Carol?

607
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,050
Are you...

608
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,619
uncomfortable
with my being here?

609
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,237
Why would I be?

610
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,171
Well, I know, sometimes
it's hard for nurses

611
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:29,006
when nurses go to med school.

612
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,876
Kind of like I switched
teams or something.

613
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,960
I think I'm gonna be sick.

614
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,245
No, you know, actually...

615
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,714
Um, I almost went
to med school myself.

616
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:36,965
Is it something else?

617
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,001
It's just stupid.

618
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,902
Oh, my God!

619
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,205
Mr. Barnes. Have
you had an ulcer?

620
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,672
Oh, my God. What's
wrong with him?

621
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,308
I don't know. Uh,
prep the section.

622
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,076
I'm gonna go get a
doctor. Okay. Um, uh...

623
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,345
I-I need a Yankauer. Top drawer!

624
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,897
Peter!

625
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,768
I'm gonna start a line.

626
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,036
What is it? Check his BP.

627
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,238
Uh... Had some Compazine,

628
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,274
and he just started
vomiting bright red blood.

629
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,441
Okay, what's the history?

630
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,010
Um, looks like triple-A.

631
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,411
I think he came
in with an ulcer.

632
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,812
You think? He's not my patient.

633
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:10,782
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

634
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,550
All right. Set me
up for a central line.

635
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:16,187
Carol, squeeze in two liters.
Get me four units O-neg.

636
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:17,188
Typing cross for eight.

637
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:18,390
What's wrong with him?

638
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,091
He's bleeding out
through his GI tract.

639
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,193
Somebody call the O.R.
What the hell happened?

640
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,096
Aortoenteric fistula.
We need an airway.

641
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,964
Should we get him to
the O.R.? No, tube him.

642
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:26,965
8-0 ET.

643
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,133
Ah, damn it.

644
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,384
Come on, Malucci. Now.

645
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,952
Why wasn't he sent upstairs?

646
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,604
Corday said it was the flu.

647
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,038
His pulse is weak. BP's 50 palp.

648
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:36,408
He won't make it to the O.R.
unless we stop the bleeding.

649
00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:39,043
Lines in. What's your name?
Abby Lockhart. A med student.

650
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,678
Can you sew this? Y... N... Yes.

651
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:42,147
Uh, just an interrupted suture?

652
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,048
I don't care. As long
as it doesn't pull away.

653
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,049
Let's move.

654
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:46,651
All right, prep
his belly for a lap.

655
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,253
You can't do a
laparotomy down here...

656
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,388
We don't have a choice. Scalpel!

657
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,857
All right. Do a small
midline incision

658
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,781
and clamp below the diaphragm.

659
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,679
You got that? Almost.

660
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,514
All right. Let's go. Let's move.

661
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,153
Pressure's up to 90.

662
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,822
This'll hold till we
get him upstairs.

663
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,223
Call O.R. Tell 'em we're coming.

664
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,725
Two units of O-neg
in. I need more.

665
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:11,860
Operating in the ER,
Peter? Shame on you.

666
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,294
He had an aortoenteric fistula.

667
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,397
Then why the hell didn't
you admit him to surgery?

668
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:16,832
He presented with flu symptoms.

669
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,200
This look like the flu...
What's your name... Malatucci?

670
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,202
Malucci. No, but the
patient was bleeding out.

671
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,905
If it wasn't for
Dr. Benton... Yeah.

672
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,172
Save it for the hearing, kid.

673
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,573
Peter, let's get
this guy to O.R.

674
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,648
before you use up the
rest of our blood supply.

675
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,578
You got to admit, that was...

676
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,002
That was pretty cool.

677
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,238
Can I go home now?

678
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,341
Not just yet.

679
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:43,975
I want you to try
something first.

680
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,944
What?

681
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:47,446
Computer.

682
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,180
I've seen one or two.

683
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,483
I was thinking maybe you
were having trouble at school

684
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:53,819
because the MD's
affecting your motor skills.

685
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:54,919
Wrong.

686
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:56,321
In which case, a computer

687
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:58,357
might help you keep
up with the other kids.

688
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,859
Who says I want to?
The school is full of losers.

689
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:02,193
Oh. Well, come on.

690
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:03,450
Just give it a try.

691
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:08,215
Oops.

692
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,268
Feel better?

693
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,302
A little.

694
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,438
You want to smash
something else?

695
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:15,162
Maybe.

696
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,196
Is that the best you can do?

697
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:30,736
Yeah. You can
do better than that.

698
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,247
Here.

699
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,833
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

700
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,296
Now, let me see
you write your name.

701
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,763
Why are you doing this?

702
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,331
I'm trying to help you.

703
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,902
I'm tired of people trying
to help me all the time.

704
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,705
I can do things for myself.

705
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,995
People trying to help
too much sometimes?

706
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,547
I don't need to
be pushed around.

707
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,117
I don't need to
have my food cut.

708
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,409
I don't need my mom giving
me a freaking bath all the time.

709
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,681
I'm not a baby.

710
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,952
No, you're not.

711
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,801
I'm gonna go talk
to your mother.

712
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,602
Why don't you clean this up?

713
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,304
Me?

714
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,572
You helped me make the mess.

715
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,106
You can help me clean it up.

716
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,398
Okay.

717
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,016
It's okay, honey.
It's almost done.

718
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,184
There. No more.

719
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,986
Luka, I need to talk
to you for a minute.

720
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,620
Hold on. I have to
give the contrast.

721
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,555
It'll just take a second.

722
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,791
Okay. I'll be right back.

723
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,060
Good boy. Good boy.

724
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,918
Yeah. Good boy, honey.

725
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,080
Good boy.

726
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:05,383
I tried contacting
his pediatrician.

727
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:07,251
Mm-hm. He doesn't have one.

728
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:09,454
Which seemed kind of
weird to me for a kid this sick.

729
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,523
So I called around.

730
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,125
I called Northwestern,
Rush, Mercy.

731
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,494
Conner's been
admitted to all three ERs.

732
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,730
Several times,
multiple admissions.

733
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:20,031
Several laparotomies.

734
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,299
I know. I've seen the scars.

735
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:23,501
Yeah. But he's only ever
really needed surgery once

736
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:24,568
for his fundoplication.

737
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,437
All the rest were
exploratory procedures,

738
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:27,923
and they didn't find anything.

739
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,357
He has a metabolic disorder,

740
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,892
and he is still at high risk

741
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,511
for adhesions and obstruction.

742
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:34,513
But nobody has been
able to document anything

743
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:35,730
since his first surgery.

744
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,682
I know. But something's
making him sick.

745
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,851
You've thought about the mother?

746
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,937
Yeah. What about her?

747
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,689
Well, maybe she's intentionally
inducing his symptoms.

748
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:46,991
Carol, she's done
everything she can

749
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,777
to find out what's
wrong with him.

750
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,829
Maybe she likes the
attention. Attention?

751
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:53,281
You mean... What, she'd
hurt her child for attention?

752
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,117
I've seen parents do it before.

753
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,818
Okay, how? I mean,
how is she doing this?

754
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,086
I don't know. Yeah, but

755
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,705
you can't say this kind
of thing without proof.

756
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,740
What happens when
his upper GI is negative?

757
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,376
CT shows nothing?

758
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,177
Are you gonna
admit him for surgery?

759
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,447
I've just started the work-up.

760
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:11,716
Give me a chance
to figure it out.

761
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,101
Will you just consider it?

762
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,270
Yeah. I'll... I'll consider it.

763
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,593
Okay.

764
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,474
There's nothing wrong with him.

765
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,409
He's being abused
by his classmates.

766
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,910
So he needs to
learn to fight back.

767
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,146
That's not a solution.
Look, Dr. Finch.

768
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,848
My son's short. So what?

769
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,867
I'm short.

770
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:30,634
And, yeah, I got picked on.

771
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:32,503
But I learned to deal
with it. And so will he.

772
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,574
How? By injecting himself
with God knows what?

773
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:38,160
That's not gonna happen
again. I can assure you.

774
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,962
Dr. Finch, Marty
spiked a fever of 103.

775
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,664
How are you feeling, Marty?

776
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,198
Pretty crummy.

777
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,633
What do you expect after pumping

778
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,768
that crap into your body?

779
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,503
Have you had a fever recently?

780
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,372
Last week he had the flu.

781
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,224
There's a pansystolic murmur.

782
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:53,391
What does that mean?

783
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:55,060
Has he had a heart
murmur before?

784
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:56,978
No. He's got
splinter hemorrhages.

785
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,813
What's going on?

786
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,648
Yosh, get three sets
of blood cultures.

787
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,300
We'll start him on
pentox and gent.

788
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,818
And order a cardiac echo. Okay.

789
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,321
Is there something
wrong with my heart?

790
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,555
The needle you kept using

791
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,691
may have put bacteria
into your bloodstream...

792
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,155
causing an infection
of your heart.

793
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,062
Mr. Spencer?

794
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,664
I'm Abby Lockhart.

795
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,832
I need a private room.

796
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,333
I don't think we have any.

797
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,602
Well, there should be.

798
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,169
With this flu
epidemic, this place

799
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,337
is one big petri dish.

800
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,739
Would you take a deep breath?

801
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,374
What if somebody
comes in with TB,

802
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:27,742
or leprosy or something?

803
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,611
What seems to be
your problem today?

804
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,746
I think my pulse
is thready. Really?

805
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,948
My stomach's upset.
My chest feels tight.

806
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,316
I'm fatigued.

807
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,274
Uh, my head is pounding,
and I can barely hear anything.

808
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,855
Do your stools glow in the dark?

809
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,824
What?

810
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,559
Your ears are full
of wax, Mr. Spencer.

811
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,895
Oh, man. I read
somewhere you can get that

812
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,330
from food additives or
environmental toxins.

813
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,598
I can clean them out for you.

814
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,134
How do you do that? I was
told never to put anything

815
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,536
in my ears smaller
than my elbow.

816
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,170
Well, we use a special drill.

817
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,539
A... A drill? I'm kidding.

818
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,395
I use peroxide.

819
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,444
Mrs. Brant? Radiology's ready.

820
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,614
Okay. Okay. Here we go, sweetie.

821
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,783
What about my palpitations.
I think I need an EKG.

822
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,185
I'll try to find one. Carol,
where's the EKG machine?

823
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,487
Uh, Try the Trauma rooms.
Do you need me to draw labs?

824
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,856
No. I got it.

825
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,357
We can wheel him
out on the gurney.

826
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,125
No, I'd rather carry
him, if that's okay.

827
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,348
Okay. Sure.

828
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,530
Dr. Romano, I'm still
on shift downstairs.

829
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,699
You should've considered
that before you decided

830
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:27,018
to turn the ER into your
own private operating room.

831
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,954
But I'm not doing anything
here. It won't kill you to observe.

832
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:32,156
You obviously still have
a few things left to learn.

833
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,826
Somebody turn down the heat.
It's a hundred degrees in here.

834
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,528
The thermostat's set at 68.

835
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:38,580
Maybe you have the
flu. I don't get sick.

836
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:41,283
Maybe you're going
through the change.

837
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,118
DeBakey clamp.

838
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,369
I can finish up if you'd like.

839
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:46,204
What I would like is
for you to stand there

840
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:48,907
and shut up while I try
to save this man's life.

841
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,263
Suction.

842
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,244
What did you find?

843
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,097
No obstruction. The
study was negative.

844
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,682
So, what do we do now?

845
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,801
We should do a CT scan.

846
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,159
What about endoscopy?

847
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,690
I don't want to put your son

848
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,425
through an another
invasive procedure

849
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,610
if I don't have to.

850
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,345
Okay, but I feel
we're wasting time.

851
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,929
Shouldn't a surgeon see him?

852
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:15,638
After the scan.

853
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,694
Sats down to 78.

854
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,748
Put him on 100%
nonrebreather mask.

855
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:32,033
Mr. Clayton, is there
anything else I can do for you

856
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,568
to make you more comfortable?

857
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,838
My lunch box.

858
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:43,833
This?

859
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:50,439
There's $118 in there.

860
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,155
Give it to my friends.

861
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,779
Is there a specific shelter
you want it to go to?

862
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:02,197
Oh, just... throw
it off the roof.

863
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,866
Throw the money off the roof?

864
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,723
Yeah. They'll find it.

865
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,324
Conner's GI series was negative.

866
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,660
You seem surprised.

867
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,262
After you said that
about the mother,

868
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:19,230
I was hoping to find
something wrong with him,

869
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,699
but, uh, she wants an endoscopy.

870
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,901
Almost seemed disappointed
when I wanted to wait.

871
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:27,076
And, uh, I-I think
you might be right.

872
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:29,473
Is this going to hurt?

873
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,743
No. It's just peroxide.

874
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,210
You might feel a few bubbles.

875
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:36,014
Bubbles? What if they
get into my bloodstream?

876
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,182
I could get an embolism.
That's not gonna happen.

877
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,784
Um, I forgot a
curette. I'll be back.

878
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:42,319
What about my chest
pains? Your EKG was normal.

879
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:44,421
Yeah, but that doesn't
rule out unstable angina.

880
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:45,890
Maybe I should
have a stress echo.

881
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,391
I don't think that's necessary.

882
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:48,893
What is the sense of having

883
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,695
all this sophisticated
technology

884
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,064
if you die before you
get a chance to use it?

885
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,353
Hey!

886
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:56,668
Sorry about that.

887
00:32:56,692 --> 00:32:58,736
That's okay.

888
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,371
How's he doing?

889
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,040
Oh, uh, well, not so good.

890
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,107
Uh, it's the same story.

891
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,542
Lots of tests,

892
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,610
and they can't figure out
what's wrong with him.

893
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,612
Well, I'm sure Dr. Kovac
is being as thorough...

894
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:10,899
Did he call for a
surgical consult yet?

895
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:13,234
I don't know. I could check.

896
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,491
Would you? Sure.

897
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:20,925
Another 3.0 Prolene.

898
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,911
Get that rake out
of my way, please.

899
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:24,845
Oh, man!

900
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,580
Dr. Romano, sure
you're okay? Yes.

901
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,249
You just spent
the last 20 minutes

902
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,168
over-sewing the duodenal defect.

903
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:32,587
There's no substitute
for precision, Peter.

904
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,173
Lizzie. Come to join the party?

905
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:37,041
I heard Mr. Barnes
eroded his aortic graft.

906
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,342
Is he a friend of yours?

907
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:39,843
Well, I evaluated
him downstairs.

908
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,679
I thought he had
gastroenteritis.

909
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,681
Really? Peter, you
never mentioned that.

910
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:46,518
How valiant of you to
not have ratted Lizzie out

911
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:49,437
on her gross oversight.
How's he doing?

912
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,505
Fine. Now that he's been
competently diagnosed

913
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,724
and brought to a proper O.R.

914
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:54,976
Peter, you're dismissed.
Lizzie, scrub in.

915
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,043
Well, I'm off, actually.

916
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,729
No, actually,
you're not anymore.

917
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:59,230
Give me a peanut.

918
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:02,066
I'm gonna dissect the small
bowel off the aorta now.

919
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,467
You'd be better
off using a Metz.

920
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:05,169
Peter, I'd quit while
I were ahead if I...

921
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:06,571
Ah! Ow! Damn it!

922
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:11,926
Robert? I'm fine. Uh... Robert?

923
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,077
God, he's burning up!

924
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:14,511
I got this. Open up a new tray.

925
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:15,964
Let's get Metz and pick-up.

926
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:18,466
Get a gurney! He's got a
weak pulse! Tachy at 140.

927
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,669
The suction. 3.0
Prolene. Let's get ready.

928
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,246
You're not afraid
you'll catch cold?

929
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,181
Hey, if I haven't
caught one by now...

930
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,950
They're not stacking
up again, are they?

931
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,618
No. I think it's over.

932
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,854
Figure out what was
wrong with that kid?

933
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,489
Yeah, he got
tired of being short,

934
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,858
so he injected himself
with bogus growth hormone.

935
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,460
Of course. Why
didn't I think of that?

936
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:48,530
His echo shows vegetations
on his mitral valve.

937
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,231
Endocarditis?

938
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,634
Kept reusing Grandma's
insulin needles.

939
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,368
What did Cardiology say?

940
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,121
They admitted him. Put
him on triple antibiotics.

941
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:59,924
Hopefully, I caught it
before he needs surgery.

942
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,459
Wooh. All of that for
a couple of inches.

943
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:03,483
Yep.

944
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,281
You're releasing too
early when you shoot.

945
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,083
Oh. Why don't you show me?

946
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,418
You don't want any of this.

947
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,075
Oh, I don't? Trust me.

948
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,889
Okay. Show me what you got.

949
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,929
What is it? Something's wrong.

950
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,265
His stomach is distended.
Give me a syringe.

951
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,368
I told you to call a
surgeon! He's getting worse.

952
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:28,936
W-what? What are you doing?

953
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,992
Hold on.

954
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:33,524
Oh, my God. What is
that? Is he bleeding?

955
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,828
No. It's an indicator
mixed with saline.

956
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,580
Turns red in the stomach acid.

957
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,782
What are you talking about?

958
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,383
That's not mine.
Th-that belongs to

959
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,151
the doctor or the
nurse, whate...

960
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,638
Whoever it was,
she left it here.

961
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:48,205
Well, actually, we
had her leave it.

962
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,425
And it's not
peroxide. It's saline.

963
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,476
I don't know what
you're talking about?

964
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,862
Oh, yes you did, Mrs. Brant.
You've been poisoning him.

965
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,647
And this proves it.
Security to Curtain 3.

966
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:57,965
Okay, okay, wait. Stop, stop.

967
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,834
I... I didn't give you
permission to do this.

968
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,769
We are leaving! No,
I'm afraid you're not.

969
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,527
I can't allow you
to keep hurting him.

970
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,808
I love Conner.

971
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,160
I would never hurt him.

972
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:12,447
Mrs. Brant... you need help.

973
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:15,282
Oh, God.

974
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,066
Okay, sweetie. It's okay.

975
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:20,071
It's okay, sweetie.

976
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,605
They're not gonna hurt you.

977
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:24,075
Mommy has you.

978
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,511
Mommy has you, honey.

979
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:29,380
It's okay.

980
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:31,448
Amira, call Transport.
Mr. Clayton in Exam 1

981
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:33,550
needs to go to the
morgue. That old guy died?

982
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:34,886
From the flu.

983
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,521
Put him into
respiratory failure.

984
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,812
I knew I should've
gotten that flu shot.

985
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,694
Someone give you a tip?

986
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,763
He had a daughter. Who?

987
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,232
My homeless man who
died told me he had no family.

988
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,134
And what? You're the
executor of his estate?

989
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:51,490
Something like that.

990
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,005
Hey, Abby. Hey.

991
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,007
Did you know it's a
tradition for the residents

992
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,808
to take students for
a drink after day one?

993
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,377
Thought you were sick.

994
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:02,413
Well, maybe you could
nurse me back to... Whoa.

995
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:07,135
Wow. You... You
look... Sst. Wow!

996
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,202
Uh, y-you know...

997
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,921
Did you have a hot
date or something?

998
00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:11,477
Maybe.

999
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:14,892
Excuse me, you're
drooling on my chart.

1000
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:18,195
Sorry. Um... So... yeah.

1001
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,997
How about that drink?

1002
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:22,099
You're kidding, right?

1003
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:23,289
I'm just...

1004
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,189
How's he doing?
Grouchier than ever.

1005
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,758
He has a kidney stone.

1006
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:31,892
Ah. You're kidding.

1007
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,361
Not as big as
we'd like, mind you.

1008
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,562
He won't need surgery.

1009
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,063
Passing through
the old plumbing.

1010
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,615
That can't be a lot of fun.

1011
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,617
Thanks for covering for
me. You didn't have to.

1012
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:41,035
But I really appreciate it.

1013
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,204
Anybody could've
missed it. Well, I hope so.

1014
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,268
My mind was elsewhere. Yeah.

1015
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:48,759
So you're going in to gloat?

1016
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:49,794
Oh, yeah.

1017
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,113
Yeah, I wouldn't take too much

1018
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,614
glee in this if I
were you, Peter.

1019
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:56,116
No, no, no. I just
came to tell you

1020
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,019
that Mr. Barnes is,
uh, stable in Recovery.

1021
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,522
It's a good thing I was
observing when this happened.

1022
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,608
Suppose you think this
means I owe you something.

1023
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:06,027
I'll settle for a thank you.

1024
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,829
How very gracious of
you, Peter. Thank you.

1025
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,114
And the O.R. time that I need

1026
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:12,183
for the little girl's
facial surgery.

1027
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,787
Look, you finished a repair
and closed for me. Big deal.

1028
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:17,521
How can you be
against a little girl

1029
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,823
getting her face fixed?

1030
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:20,913
This is my<i> job.</i>

1031
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,028
If word gets out that
I do favors for you,

1032
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,629
I'll have to do
them for everybody.

1033
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:30,551
Which is why we never
had this conversation.

1034
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,592
So that means I
can have the O.R.?

1035
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,677
I don't want to
know about... Mm.

1036
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,845
Ah. And good luck with that.

1037
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,314
Thank you.

1038
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:44,615
You're welcome, Peter.

1039
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,303
Abby, thank you for
helping back there.

1040
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,738
I know it was bizarre. Oh, sure.

1041
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,506
Did she actually pour
it down his G-tube?

1042
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,941
Yeah, it didn't take her long.

1043
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,310
I bet you were never part
of a sting operation upstairs?

1044
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,546
No. It's the first.
Welcome to the ER.

1045
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,680
Abby? Yeah?

1046
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,249
Do you have a patient
named Spencer?

1047
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,984
The hypochondriac, yeah.
He's having a heart attack.

1048
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,336
What?

1049
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,588
All right, start him on
dopamine, 10 mics per kilo.

1050
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:08,855
Oh, God. What happened?

1051
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,124
Is this your patient? Yeah.

1052
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,593
Did you give him medication?
No. I cleaned out his ears.

1053
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:13,727
BP, 70 palp.

1054
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,696
All right. Did he complain
of any chest pains?

1055
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,065
Yeah, he complained of
everything. His EKG was normal.

1056
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,067
Not anymore. ST
elevation on the 12-lead.

1057
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,335
He's having an acute MI.

1058
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,436
He had a history of reflux.

1059
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,188
There was no
cardiac risk factor.

1060
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:26,223
HemoCue is six. Hang
two units of pac cells.

1061
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,492
He's gonna need
nitroglycerin and a heparin drip.

1062
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:29,894
I'll start a second line.

1063
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:31,762
V-tach.

1064
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,197
Charge to 100.

1065
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:34,386
Synch cardioversion.

1066
00:39:35,724 --> 00:39:37,201
Chuny can get that. Take those.

1067
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:38,769
It's your patient.

1068
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,328
Clear.

1069
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,478
Elizabeth. Hello, Mother.

1070
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:50,047
What are you doing here?

1071
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,349
Oh. I live here, remember?

1072
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,518
Yes. I meant to call you.

1073
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,287
I just got in last week.

1074
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,023
Oh, Elizabeth, save
me the pouty face.

1075
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:00,624
I'm not pouting. I
just can't believe

1076
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,794
you were going to travel several
thousand miles and not call me.

1077
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,430
Yes. Well, I'm here now.

1078
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:07,998
And freezing.

1079
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:10,200
So if we're going to
continue this conversation,

1080
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,303
could we find somewhere warm?

1081
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,471
Preferably where
they serve alcohol.

1082
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,240
Or have the
Americans banned that

1083
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:17,909
together with tobacco?

1084
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:20,111
Anyone ever tell you
white men can't jump?

1085
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:21,912
Now, that was a foul. Ha.

1086
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,780
Oh, I get a foul
because you tripped.

1087
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:25,199
No, you hip-checked me.

1088
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,250
Dr. Greene?

1089
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:28,252
What is it?

1090
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:29,754
You said call if I
got into trouble.

1091
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:30,871
Yeah.

1092
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,395
Well, um...

1093
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,727
He was a hypochondriac.

1094
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,696
All his tests came back normal.

1095
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,766
MIs don't always present
textbook symptoms.

1096
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,368
You didn't get a blood count.

1097
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:46,837
White count was 1800.

1098
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,806
Crit was only 18.
What does that mean?

1099
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,175
Aplastic anemia.

1100
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,210
Bingo. Decreased
oxygen-carrying capacity

1101
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,112
is a risk factor.

1102
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:57,848
You're gonna need Hematology
down here for a consult.

1103
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,250
They're gonna want to
do a bone marrow biopsy.

1104
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:02,086
I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry.

1105
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,520
I should've protected you more.

1106
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,921
It's great that
you were a nurse,

1107
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:07,624
but you gotta start
thinking like a doctor, okay?

1108
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:09,259
You don't have to do it all.

1109
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:10,827
From now on, make sure that

1110
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,096
the nurses order your labs.

1111
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,764
Okay? They have a
standing order on CBCs.

1112
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:16,548
See you tomorrow. Okay.

1113
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:22,974
I don't know how you managed
to keep your complexion here.

1114
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:24,608
Wind. Nothing but wind.

1115
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,543
I don't work on a
construction site.

1116
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,878
Oh, that's right.

1117
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,614
You cut people
up, like your father.

1118
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:32,749
How is Charles?

1119
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,852
Happy. We had a lovely time

1120
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:36,270
when he was in town last.

1121
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,939
You know, Daddy
stays at my place.

1122
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,362
How delightful.

1123
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,586
Would you like to
come and stay with me?

1124
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,746
Whatever for?

1125
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,914
Because I have a spare room.

1126
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,534
Uh, because I haven't
seen you in three years.

1127
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:52,253
That's not my fault.

1128
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:55,344
I'm just saying, I'd like
you to come and stay.

1129
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,593
All right. I agree.

1130
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,717
I'm honored.

1131
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,765
You do look well.

1132
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,433
You must have a man.

1133
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,719
Do I need a man to look well?

1134
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,254
It helps.

1135
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,857
So... have you?

1136
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,124
Yes.

1137
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:15,943
I suppose he's a doctor.

1138
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,395
Actually, yes.

1139
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:19,647
His name's Mark.

1140
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,866
And he's lovely.

1141
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:26,770
Come on, chicken.

1142
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,072
We never finished that game.

1143
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,506
You were down by eight points.

1144
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,375
Yeah, well, I was pacing myself.

1145
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:33,232
Good night. Quitter.

1146
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,568
All right. Bring it on.

1147
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:46,123
Good night, Mark.

1148
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,346
Nice hat.

1149
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:52,996
Hey. Hi.

1150
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,765
Uh, you're the new
med student, right?

1151
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,566
Yeah. I'm Abby Lockhart.

1152
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,401
Lucy. Nice to meet you.

1153
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,603
How was your first day?

1154
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,905
Um... Well, let's
put it this way.

1155
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:04,307
I haven't had one
of these in two years.

1156
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,526
What happened?

1157
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,562
It's more like,
what didn't happen?

1158
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,231
Ah, I used to work in OB,

1159
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,901
and up there, I
would deliver a baby.

1160
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,620
And then I would deliver a
baby. Then I would deliver a baby.

1161
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:21,375
And today, I was
puked on, spit at, bit...

1162
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,061
And then I tricked
a psychotic woman.

1163
00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:27,964
And then I almost killed a guy.

1164
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:30,267
That sounds about right.

1165
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:32,535
Fortunately, in the ER,
"almost" doesn't count.

1166
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,640
What are you doing?

1167
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:39,193
Patient's last request.

1168
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,537
Toss some. You
might feel better.

1169
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,698
Do you have to say a
prayer or something?

1170
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,388
I don't think so.
