Yeah. Aren't you freezing?

00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:53,506
Not once I get warmed up.

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,474
I used to be that
thin, you know.

36
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,179

me through the bird.

37
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,148
Excuse me? I was
stuffin' the turkey.

38
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:03,382
Hey, Kerry.

39
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,885
Hey, Carol, I thought
yesterday was your last day.

40
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,553
I know, but I still
need to show Lydia

41
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,255
how to do the
productivity report.

42
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,090
She took off. What?

43
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:12,591
Yeah, she's drivin'
to Wisconsin.

44
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:13,993
You were supposed
to be here at 8.

45
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:16,228
I needed to sleep. I... I
thought she had a shift.

46
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:18,865
Yeah, the night shift. Well,
why didn't she call me?

47
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,033
I came all the way in.

48
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,100
She figured you bailed.

49
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:22,601
Didn't wanna
bother you. Oh, man.

50
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,870
Carol, do you feel all right?

51
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,838
No, my back is killing me.

52
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,406
Well, we're about
to do the potluck,

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,741
so why don't you stay and rest?

54
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:30,743
No, you know what? I'm
gonna go home, take a nap,

55
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,511
store up my energy
to deal with my family.

56
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:34,013
Hold up, I got you
down for dessert.

57
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,482
Oh, sorry, casualty
of pregnancy.

58
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,273
What, no pie?

59
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,457
Wait, okay, okay.
Time-out. Time-out.

60
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,693
There's no time-outs
in a snowball fight.

61
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,460
No fair. I'm a girl.

62
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:49,729
A girl who tried to ambush me.

63
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,514
That's very mature, Carter.

64
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,866
Oh, you want a piece of this?

65
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,033
Don't even think about it.

66
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:55,368

86
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:49,982
How long ago?

87
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,006
Fifteen minutes.

88
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,020
You're already
having contractions?

89
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,688
How many? Two.

90
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,993
How far apart?
Seven, eight minutes.

91
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,560
Did anyone call an ambulance?

92
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:03,028
No, County's just one stop back.

93
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,292
Why don't you get on that train?

94
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:08,000
You try walking
during labor pain.

95
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:10,469
Yeah. How far along are you?

96
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:11,726
Oh, 38 weeks.

97
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,540
Was the amniotic fluid clear?

98
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,542
Ah, kind of hard
to tell on the el.

99
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,976
So no meconium, then, huh?

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,078
I don't think so.

101
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:20,401
Good, good, good.

102
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,468
Don't worry, I could
be at this a while.

103
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,203
Tell you what.

104
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,371
We wait for the next train.

105
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,872
If it doesn't come
in five minutes,

106
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,074
we call an ambulance, okay?

107
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,708
Oh, yeah.

108
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,813
10-9. That ain't
no fair. No hands.

109
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,982
I'm a goalie, man.
That's what we do.

110
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,683
It's too easy. Use the chair.

111
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,652
Okay, whatever you
say, bro. I still own you.

112
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,154

113
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,288

114
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,992
Yeah, I'm fast.
What can I tell ya?

115
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,481
Oh!

116
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,528
I'm cool. I'm cool.

117
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,828
Hey, Dr. Weaver.

118
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,997
Finish your notes, Dr. Malucci?

119
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,499
Ooh, absolutely, chief.

120
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,101
I was just, um, waiting
on a paramedic run.

121
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,803
Is it always this
slow on Thanksgivin'?

122
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,705
If you're bored, you
can start studying

123
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,707
for your National
In-Service Exam.

124
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,809
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna
bring down the average.

125
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,411
Ouch, and I
thought you liked me.

126
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,712
Whatever gave you that idea?

127
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,981
It'll pick up once people
start eating dinner.

128
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,650
Barf Central, huh?
Already started.

129
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,752
Shelly Robinson, 18,
persistent vomiting and diarrhea.

130
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,771
Hypoglycemic,
altered mental status.

131
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,106
Gave her IV fluids
and Compazine,

132
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,376
but her glucose
is still 42 after D50.

133
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,511
Did you get an
endocrine consult?

134
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,647
Yeah, he's probably at
home stuffing his face.

135
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:28,981
Did you get a travel history?

136
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,048
Not outside the U.S.

137
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,150
Well, how 'bout Florida?

138
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,051
Actually, she just got
back from there. Why?

139
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:35,120
Well, ask her if she ate
an oily, yellowish fruit

140
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,122
with black seeds.

141
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,957
What? Akee fruit.

142
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,158
Poisonous before it's ripe.

143
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,860
Induces vomiting
and low blood glucose

144
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:43,496
by inhibiting hepatic
gluconeogenesis. Known as JVS.

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,497
JVS.

146
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:47,050
Jamaican Vomiting Sickness.

147
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,585
But the akee also
grows in southern Florida.

148
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,154
You're kidding, right?

149
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,554
You better start a D20 infusion.

150
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,058
There's a high fatality
rate if it's left untreated.

151
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,897
If you don't believe me,
just check the differential.

152
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,684
Might be a doctor after all.

153
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,402
Jamaican Vomiting Sickness?

154
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,359
Look it up, John.

155
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,574
Jamaican Vomiting Sickness.

156
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,409
Okay, a little step.

157
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,643
Thank you for doing this.

158
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,779
Not a problem. It's okay.

159
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,780
Oh, God!

160
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,182
Is it a contraction? Oh, yeah!

161
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,950
Okay. Sit. Sit here. Sit here.

162
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,886
So maybe... Maybe
standing's better, huh?

163
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,954
Yeah. Okay.

164
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,756
Carol, have you
taken a birthing class?

165
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,790
Mm-hm.

166
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,825
Uh...

167
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,428
Just look at something.
Try to stare at something.

168
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,596
Stay focused on it, okay?

169
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,565
Uh, is...? Is she having a baby?

170
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,233
Yeah. W-we're
okay. She just started.

171
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,301
Are you sure?

172
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,069
Yeah, it's all
right. I'm a doctor.

173
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,304
She doesn't look all right.

174
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,939
Oh! Oh.

175
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,107
Uh... I-I think I better
pull the emergency cord.

176
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,142
No, no, no.

177
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,443
That stops the train.

178
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,795
Well, she needs help. No,
we only have to go one stop.

179
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,196
It's okay. Better to be safe.

180
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,732
No, no, don't pull the cord.

181
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:55,785
The sign says, "Pull cord
in case of emergency."

182
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,287
This isn't that
kind of emergency.

183
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,956
"Police, fire,
medical emergency."

184
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,326
Don't pull the
damn cord! Oh, God!

185
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,327
Can she cook?

186
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,694
What kind of a question is that?

187
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:06,762
So she can't?

188
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,364
I don't know. We eat out a lot.

189
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,999
My experience with English food:

190
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,367
it's always bland.

191
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,069
Would you rather I cooked?

192
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,570
Is she pretty?

193
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,972
Yes, she's pretty.

194
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,473
Prettier than Cynthia?

195
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,640
Different kind of pretty.

196
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,809
Beauty is overrated.

197
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,233
She's pretty, all right? Jeez.

198
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,914
Happy Thanksgiving.

199
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,516
See? What?

200
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,385
Nothing. Uh, Elizabeth, this
is my father, David Greene.

201
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,453
Nice hat.

202
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,854
Thank you. Come in.

203
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,990
This is Rachel. Hello, Rachel.

204
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,491
You're not supposed
to wear those.

205
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,559
They're for decoration.

206
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,162
Ah. Uh... Well, I saw
it in the drugstore,

207
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,698
and I thought it looked cute.

208
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,367
I got the wine.

209
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,501
Great. I'll open it.

210
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,502
No, no, no, I'll get it.

211
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,904
Scotch and soda
for me, if you have it.

212
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,272
Actually, I think I might.

213
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,408
Rachel, would you care
for something to drink?

214
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,542
Can I have some wine?

215
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,144
No. I have soda.

216
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,145
Okay.

217
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,679
Mind if I turn on the game?

218
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,716
Oh, um, my telly's
broken, I'm afraid.

219
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,917
Doesn't work?

220
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,653
Yeah, apparently my
neighbor was stealing his cable.

221
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,557
So the company came and,
um, they snapped the wrong line.

222
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,658
On Thanksgiving?

223
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,494
No, no. This was a month ago.

224
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,779
I just haven't had time

225
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,446
to ring up and complain.

226
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,698
No football.

227
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,122
We can play
charades if you like.

228
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,521
Let me just sit for
a second, okay?

229
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,323
The contractions
are too close together.

230
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,424
You're in active labor.

231
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,192
Oh, gee. You think?

232
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,994
I'm sorry. I just...

233
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,996
You might have progressed
more than you think.

234
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,801
No, I'm okay. It just hurts.

235
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,636
How dilated were you
on your last OB visit?

236
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,304
Uh, 3 centimeters, Monday.

237
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,305
Any back pain?

238
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,225
Yeah, for the last three months.

239
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,760
Worse lately? This morning.

240
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,496
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

241
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,898
Oh, can't I have
the babies here?

242
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,400
If you wanna make
the news. Come on.

243
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,502
Oh, God, they feel like
they're between my knees.

244
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:53,669
Yep, that's the idea.

245
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,271
Oh, son of a bitch.

246
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,473
Okay, sit. Sit here,
sit here, come on.

247
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,475
Okay. Okay, focus.
Focus, Carol. Carol.

248
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,246
Try... Try humming.

249
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,248
Huh? I-I know it
sounds very strange.

250
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,583
But it helped my wife.
Okay, just hum, like this.

251
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,421
Yeah, just do it.

252
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:16,709
Okay.

253
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:23,315
Hey, remember that
renal-failure patient?

254
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,349
Five-minute ETA?

255
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,951
Let me guess. Diverted to Mercy?

256
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:28,787
Now she's a Trauma patient.
Some guy plowed into the ambulance.

257
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:29,788
Ah, that was smart.

258
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,189
Hey, Dave.

259
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,791
Good call on the akee fruit.

260
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:34,426
She bought off a
curbside vendor.

261
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,094
Ah, I won't say I
told you so, but...

262
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:37,997
How'd you know about
it? I'm a good doctor.

263
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:39,532
No, really. Really.

264
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,900
And I might've seen it before.

265
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:43,101
Where? No, don't
tell me. You, uh...?

266
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,703
You did the Peace
Corps or something?

267
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,705
Yeah, exactly. I spent
some time in the jungle.

268
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,107
And if you're nice to me, I'll
show you my piranha scars.

269
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,342
Come on, where'd you see it?

270
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,744
Let's just say you
owe me a favor.

271
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,568
What is this, a secret?

272
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:57,082
What, you're suddenly
sensitive, Dave?

273
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:59,418
Oh, did you, um,
lose a patient to this?

274
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,453
Fine. Whatever. I saw
it in Grenada, okay?

275
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,855
You did a rotation in Grenada?

276
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,390
No, Sherlock, I went to
med school in Grenada.

277
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,491
Oh.

278
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,749
Oh. Your, uh, first choice?

279
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,463
I had fun in college.

280
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,766
From what I can remember
of it, my grades sucked.

281
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,334
My MCATs... Long story.

282
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:19,204
But I knew I could be a better
doctor than those ass-kissers

283
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,306
whose only hard-on was
for what was on some test.

284
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,959
Gotcha. So I did Grenada.

285
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,927
It's the Harvard of the
Caribbean, actually.

286
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,329
I'm sure that it is.

287
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,331
Still says M.D., Carter.

288
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,634
See? M.D.

289
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,435
I know. I know.

290
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,404
Well, now I can appreciate
you that much more.

291
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,405
Good.

292
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,707
So, what did you
get on your MCATs?

293
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,830
All right.

294
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,629
Hey, it started snowing again.

295
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,565
Yeah. You ready?

296
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,267
I think so. Okay.

297
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,471
So how long was
your wife in labor?

298
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,357
Sixteen hours,
for the first one.

299
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,459
How many has she had?

300
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,761
Two. At different times.

301
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,364
Oh, well... They
still live in Croatia?

302
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,165
No, not anymore.

303
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,567
Mm.

304
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,934
Oh! What?

305
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,770
Okay, sit. Sit down.
Come on. Deep breaths.

306
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,272
Hey, and don't worry.

307
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,541
It's probably a vagal
reaction to the contractions.

308
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,410
Oh! Okay? Deep breaths.

309
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,464
Oh, I have to go
to the bathroom.

310
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,699
We're almost there. No, I
mean I really have to go.

311
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:21,968
We must hurry. Can you stand?

312
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,369
Mm-mm.

313
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,604
What is it? What is it?
Another contraction?

314
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:28,307
Already? Okay. Okay.

315
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,543
Uh, don't push. Don't
push. Listen to me, Carol.

316
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,513
Carol, don't push, okay?

317
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:35,681
Carol?

318
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:39,140
Carol?

319
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,954
Seventy-eight-year-old
woman with chronic renal-failure

320
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,122
and respiratory distress.

321
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,156
Missed her dialysis.

322
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,658
Other injuries
from the accident?

323
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:03,676
Maybe chest trauma.

324
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,094
She responded
to 10 liters of O2.

325
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,612
Decompensated after the crash.

326
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,497
Anyone else hurt?
Zadro banged his elbow.

327
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,122
The jerk who hit him is behind
us. He's faking a heart attack.

328
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:13,857
Kerry!

329
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,171
Oh, my God.

330
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,394
We need a gurney out here!

331
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,545
What happened?

332
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,047
Vagal reaction.

333
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,114
Is she in labor?

334
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,138
Uh, yeah.

335
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,629
Get her BP.

336
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,863
She had a syncopal episode.

337
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:41,864
I'm fine.

338
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,266
How far apart are contractions?

339
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,634
Three minutes. Babies moving?

340
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,901
All day long. What's wrong?

341
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,002
What do you think?

342
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,904
- What's open?
- Trauma rooms.

343
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,474
Oh, no, Kerry. Just take me
upstairs to Labor and Delivery.

344
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,559
Carol, you passed out. I
wanna check your vitals

345
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,977
and your cervix. Who's your OB?

346
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,244
McLucas. Please, Kerry.

347
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,447
Kerry, just take me
upstairs. Yeah, in a minute.

348
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,350
Malik, can you page Dr. McLucas?

349
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,451
Is he on the on-call list?

350
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,486
She. OB has it.

351
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,087
Do you want a fetal monitor?

352
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,189
Get the Doppler scope.
No. She's gonna check me.

353
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,240
Then I'm going upstairs!

354
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,409
Hey, I could use
help. I got two here.

355
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,443
Luka, can you help him?

356
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,496
Yeah, uh, sure.
Should I call Mark?

357
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,464
He's off. He's her Lamaze coach.

358
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,334
Oh, Carol, you
want us to call Mark?

359
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,252
Okay, let's go nice and easy.

360
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,554
I hope it's done.

361
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,656
I'm not used to serving
so early in the afternoon.

362
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,424
Well, we need time
to gorge ourselves,

363
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,582
so that we can pass
out on the couch.

364
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,330
It says 180.

365
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,133
You know, you didn't
have to do all this.

366
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,201
The two of them together
can be a bit much.

367
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:39,004
Don't be silly. All families
are eccentric in their own way.

368
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,939
I guess.

369
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,341
Okay, everybody,
dinner is served.

370
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,244
- Hit me.
- You have 18.

371
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,179
Soft 18 against
your nine. Hit me.

372
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,197
Dinner's ready, guys.

373
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,965
Rachel, can you get
the mashed potatoes?

374
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,967
Smells good. I
hope it's all right.

375
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,953
What's that on top there? Bacon.

376
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,288
Ew, on the turkey?

377
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,056
You don't have it that way?

378
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,259
Rachel? I said mashed potatoes.

379
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,727
I didn't think you
celebrated Thanksgiving.

380
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,664
Well, it's not really
my holiday, is it?

381
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:09,218
The Pilgrims came here to
escape persecution from the British.

382
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,354
Yes, so they could go
about persecuting the Indians.

383
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,224
Okay, everybody. Now.

384
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,726
I'll do that. I got it, Dad.

385
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,160
Mark, I said I'd do it.

386
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,829
Don't worry. Sit down. Relax.

387
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,331
Mark doesn't think I can do
things for myself anymore.

388
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,066
Be my guest.

389
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,568
Did you tell her you want
to put me in a nursing home?

390
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,104
It's a retirement community.

391
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,206
A retirement
community with nurses.

392
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,774
Can we talk about this later?

393
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,876
It's all you wanted to
talk about last night.

394
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,331
Sorry.

395
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,499
That's all right.

396
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,168
Uh, I think I have instant.

397
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,170
Are you on call?
No, no. It's yours.

398
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,073
Um, look. Let's clean
this up, shall we?

399
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:49,708
<i>Okay, ready?</i>

400
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:50,842
And lift.

401
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,545
Lungs are wet. Some
JVD. Not making any urine.

402
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,015
Mrs. Olson, why did
you miss your dialysis?

403
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,617
I was having my hair done.

404
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,286
Oh. It's nice to look good,

405
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,788
but your health
should come first, huh?

406
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:05,491
You think I look good?

407
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:06,725
Yeah, beautiful.

408
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:09,961
Oh, it's for my birthday.

409
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,497
Today? Yes.

410
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:12,631
Oh, happy birthday.

411
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:13,965
Well, thank you.

412
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:17,136
BP's 102/54. Pulse is 124.

413
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,372
Congestive failure.
Wet crackles halfway up.

414
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,624
You want Lasix?

415
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,459
No. Start a nitro drip
and call the dialysis unit.

416
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,495
Can I call a family member?

417
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,230
No, that's all right.

418
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,965
I'm sorry.

419
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm sorry. Sternal tenderness.

420
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,337
You see, this is why idiots
need to stop for ambulances.

421
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,973
Muffled heart sounds.
Check for<i> pulsus paradoxus.</i>

422
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,974
Heart?

423
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,643
What's wrong with my heart?

424
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,145
Mrs. Olson, your
fluid overloaded

425
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,647
from missing your dialysis.

426
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,066
Some fluid is collecting
around your heart.

427
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,101
It's probably from
the renal failure.

428
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,937
But it could also be an
injury from the accident.

429
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:53,171
Oh, my.

430
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,675
Enalapril 1.25 IV push,
and get me an ultrasound.

431
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,544
They're using it next door.

432
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,180
Then get me another one.

433
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,181
Oh!

434
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,482
Carol, you're pushing, honey.

435
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,551
Don't push. Betadine?

436
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:09,088
Doppler sounds good.
Fetal heart tones are 140.

437
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,689
BP's 112/70. Pulse, 88.

438
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,157
Legs up, Carol. Okay, it's over?

439
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:13,358
The contraction's over?

440
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:14,626
Almost, yeah.

441
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,130
I'm gonna check your
cervix, Carol. Relax.

442
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,514
You'll remember this
Thanksgiving. Yeah.

443
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,945
Kerry, what is it?

444
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,697
You're at 10 centimeters, Carol.

445
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:32,978
What? Fully effaced.

446
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,613
Two plus station.
Haleh, open an OB.

447
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,648
No, no. I don't want it
delivered down here.

448
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,450
I don't wanna deliver in the ER.

449
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,985
Wanna deliver in the elevator?

450
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,704
How can I be 10 centimeters?

451
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,038
Probably contracting all day.

452
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,740
Oh, God. Call Pedes.

453
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,209
Let's rotate the gurney
and give her some privacy.

454
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,628
No, no, no. No,
Kerry, I'll just hold it.

455
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,047
Okay, I promise I
won't push. I won't push.

456
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,181
Let's make a deal.

457
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,969
We'll deliver this
one down here.

458
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,337
And have the next one upstairs.

459
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:00,172
Oh! MARQUEZ: Lift up your butt.

460
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:02,892
Okay, uh, I'm gonna
need that fetal monitor.

461
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,310
The second on the ultrasound.

462
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,611
Get out of here, Carter!

463
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,513
It's okay, don't
worry about a thing.

464
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:09,914
Give me some sterile
gloves. Carter, get out!

465
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,817
John, I've got it. Why don't
you see if Dr. Kovac needs help?

466
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,403
I've delivered babies before.

467
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,538
Not this one. Dr. Weaver?

468
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,506
She knows you. She
doesn't feel comfortable.

469
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,608
She just paged Dr. Greene.

470
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,209
Yeah, he's not
delivering. Get out.

471
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,478
Okay. Good luck. Oh. Oh, God!

472
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,281
Okay, let's break the bed down.

473
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,083
Fifteen of
etomidate, 100 of sux.

474
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,685
BP's down to 80 systolic.

475
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,087
Pericardiocentesis tray.
Get me an alligator clip.

476
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,389
You need some help?
Yes, please. Intubate.

477
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,958
What is it?
Pericardial effusion.

478
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,626
I can't tell if it's the trauma

479
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,061
or her renal failure.

480
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,429
Pressure's down to 70.

481
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,797
Number eight ET tube.

482
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,265
Double up on the dopamine.

483
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,733
Is she having the
babies in there?

484
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,135
At least one of them.

485
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,354
JARVIK: V-fib.

486
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:51,857
Charge the paddles.
Carter, CPR now.

487
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,292
What do you think
it is, hyperkalemia?

488
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:57,078
Probably high potassium.
Give an amp of calcium.

489
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,102
Come on, clear.

490
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,867
Still V-fib. Three hundred, now.

491
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,635
You want insulin and glucose?

492
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,287
Go ahead. And an
amp of, uh, bicarb.

493
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,027
Paddles ready. Clear!

494
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,711
Nothing. Three-sixty.
Stand by with epi.

495
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,413
Come on, come on.
Hurry up, hurry up.

496
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:16,704
Okay, clear.

497
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,235
Tell her I'll be right there.

498
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,037
What is it? Carol's in labor.

499
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,105
Is she in the hospital?

500
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,673
Yeah, and I might
miss the first one.

501
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,741
Who's Carol? Uh,
she's a friend of ours.

502
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,443
Dad, we gotta go. Why?

503
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,046
Well, I'm the Lamaze coach.
And so I gotta talk her through it.

504
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,448
Where's the
father? Dad, let's go.

505
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,750
Rachel, I'm gonna drop you
guys off on the way. Come on.

506
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,319
I'm hungry. Me too.

507
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,954
Mark, we might
as well eat dinner.

508
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,122
Could be a while.

509
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,690
Well, I can drive them home.

510
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,991
Are you okay with this, Rachel?

511
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,993
She's fine.

512
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,328
Go coach. We'll eat.

513
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,330
Here, take a biscuit.

514
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,965
Call with all the details.

515
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,667
Boys, girls, weight,
length, all that.

516
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,535
You're sure about
this? Carol needs you.

517
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,536
We'll be fine.

518
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,737
If they give you any trouble,

519
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,423
just lock 'em in the closet. Go.

520
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,190
No turkey for me.

521
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,192
Animal fat's bad for your heart.

522
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,761
Not today.

523
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,596
Push, push, push, push.

524
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,732
Good job, Carol! Almost there!

525
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,933
Okay, I see the head. Crowning.

526
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,769
Okay, keep breathing, honey.

527
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,970
Contraction subsiding.

528
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,772
Okay, Carol, I want
you to push hard for 10.

529
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,741
I'm trying! I know.
Come on. Come on.

530
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:18,877
Ten, nine, eight,

531
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,045
seven, six... Count faster!

532
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:23,649
Five, four, three...

533
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:25,517
Okay. Okay. Just relax.

534
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,718
Is he out? Not yet. Not yet.

535
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,387
Next contraction. Good job.

536
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:30,322
You're doing great,
Carol. Almost there.

537
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:31,890
Did you plan natural childbirth?

538
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:32,957
Hell, no.

539
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,793
Where's Pedes? I paged them.

540
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,261
Somebody get Cleo in here.

541
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:38,397
Dr. Weaver? Details on twin A.

542
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,198
What? No, let me see.

543
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,200
Okay, get the OB on call

544
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:44,636
and have L and D bring
down a vacuum extraction...

545
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,171
Vacuum? No.

546
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,308
Carol, look at me,
honey. It's just for safety.

547
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,610
The first baby's heart
rate is down to 90.

548
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:54,012
But we're okay
over 80, all right?

549
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,246
Okay.

550
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,682
Okay, good.

551
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,900
Let's go with a scalp electrode.

552
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,535
Oh, no, do you have to?

553
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,838
Yeah, it just gives me
more accurate monitoring.

554
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,372
Okay, you rest up.

555
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,797
In two minutes you're
gonna push this baby out.

556
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,517
How much atropine has she had?

557
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,618
Two amps.

558
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,520
How long since the
last epi? Five minutes.

559
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,704
Let's check in on the rhythm.

560
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,827
Asystole. That's it.

561
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,102
Time of death, ahem, 13:17.

562
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,519
Happy birthday.

563
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,121
- You got it.
- Seven, six, five...

564
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:37,823
- How close is she?
- She's there.

565
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,157
Fetal rate is 85.

566
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:42,144
Okay, the head's
out! Bulb suction.

567
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,511
Don't push. Carol, don't push.

568
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,780
Don't push, honey.

569
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,520
Is the cord around its neck?

570
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,485
Not anymore.

571
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,957
All right. Here we go.

572
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,891
Carol, say hello
to your daughter.

573
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,060
It's a girl?

574
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,395
Yes.

575
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,663
It's a girl. Congratulations.

576
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,332
Hi. Hello.

577
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,571
Let's check the
presentation of twin B.

578
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,506
It's okay. It's okay.

579
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,409
Looks like about 6 pounds.

580
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,844
- She's so little.
- So little.

581
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:35,179
But that's a good
size for a twin.

582
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:38,316
I have to take her now,
Carol. Take a good look at her.

583
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,585
She's healthy, right?

584
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,729
She's beautiful.

585
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:45,312
Okay. Okay. Okay.

586
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,193
Okay.

587
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:51,991
There we go.

588
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,271
Have you picked out a name yet?

589
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,386
Tess.

590
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,143
I think I'm gonna name her Tess.

591
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,546
Welcome to the world, Tess.

592
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,102
There we go.

593
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,142
You did great.

594
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,728
Carol Hathaway?

595
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,097
Hi. I'm Abby. I'll
be your OB nurse.

596
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,099
Heard you had a little
excitement downstairs.

597
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,868
Ultrasound showed second
twin is vertex and high.

598
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,137
Okay, just relax, Carol.
We'll get you through this.

599
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,972
Is the bag intact? Yes.

600
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,208
Hi, Mom, I'm Sandra.

601
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,475
I have to tag you and your baby

602
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,044
before I can take
her to the nursery.

603
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,512
Can't she stay with...?

604
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,081
We'll warm her up, bathe her,

605
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,766
and bring her back
after this one's out.

606
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,334
Well, what if she gets hungry?

607
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,168
Well, we can
supplement a little bit.

608
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,437
Sure? Yes, I'm sure.

609
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:07,104
Here, I need you
to scoot over a little.

610
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,239
Nice and easy.

611
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,129
There we go.

612
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:14,412
Oh, Kerry, could
you go with her?

613
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:16,414
Sure. I'll see that she
gets settled in, okay?

614
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,432
Thanks.

615
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,518
Three-five-one-six-four.

616
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,720
Three-five-one-six-four.
All set.

617
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:23,272
Say bye-bye, Mommy.

618
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,523
Bye, honey.

619
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,276
Bye. Thanks, Kerry.

620
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,545
Are the contractions
still strong?

621
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,282
Well, they're a little
spaced out. But yeah.

622
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,849
Well, we'll do
another ultrasound.

623
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,785
But if the baby's high,
it could take a while.

624
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,553
Is Dr. McLucas on her way?

625
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,821
We're working on that.

626
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,039
Do you want an epidural?

627
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,642
I can still have
one? Absolutely.

628
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,962
Oh, well, if I wasn't
sure before, I am now.

629
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:47,986
Wimp.

630
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,215
Mark.

631
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,051
Heard I missed the party.

632
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,219
Oh, God.

633
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,287
I'll call the anesthesiologist.

634
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:58,857
A girl? Hm. A girl.

635
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,326
Troublemaker already?
You hangin' in there?

636
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,817
It's brutal, Mark.

637
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,149
One down, one to go.

638
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,984
Uh-uh. I quit.

639
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,119
I don't think you
have much of a choice.

640
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,788
Well, you know,
you could shoot me.

641
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,124
Yeah, if it comes to that.

642
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,626
I'm sorry to pull you away
from your Thanksgiving dinner.

643
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,130
You kidding? I'd rather be here.

644
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,866
D-Day. Five beaches.

645
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,304
The Americans take
Utah, and... Here.

646
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,472
The potatoes.

647
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:33,041
And Omaha, the squash.

648
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,709
Now, the Brits land here

649
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,729
and share Juno, the, uh...

650
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:39,864
The stuffing, with the Canucks.

651
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:41,433
The Canucks?

652
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,635
The Canadians. Right.

653
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:44,936
Are you with me?

654
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,438
Yes, yes, yes, I'm
with you. Mm-hm.

655
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,339
All the heavy German resistance

656
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,859
is concentrated on
the American lines.

657
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,294
Massive casualties are
suffered by the Americans,

658
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,764
6000 in the first day.

659
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,616
The Brits had their
share too, didn't they?

660
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,317
Should the gravy
go with the potatoes?

661
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:00,741
Fine.

662
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,989
Now, instead of pushing forward

663
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:05,624
and cutting off the
Germans at Caen,

664
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,209
Montgomery, the
British general...

665
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,010
Yes, I know who Montgomery is.

666
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,746
Montgomery sat on
his ass and had tea.

667
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,715
I'm going to the bathroom.

668
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,017
Well, the British were
fighting the Germans

669
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,086
for nearly three years
before the Americans.

670
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,555
Perhaps they were just
a little more cautious.

671
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,990
"Cautious" is one word for it.

672
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,493
I suppose "tea-loving"
would be another.

673
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,895
That's two words.

674
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,633
It's a hyphenate, actually.

675
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,269
Well, anyway, the
82nd Airborne Division...

676
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,338
Do you have to
use a straight cath?

677
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:39,040
The epidural numbs your bladder.
You won't control your urine.

678
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,276
Great. Sorry, we
do it for everybody.

679
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,910
No catheter, no epidural.

680
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,879
Seems like a small
price to pay, Carol.

681
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,715
It's not your bladder.

682
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,316
Are we doin' this?

683
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,385
Carol? Hm...? Yes.

684
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,986
All right. All set.

685
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,822
Okay, Carol, you have to sit up.

686
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,424
Oh, can't we do it on my side?

687
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,727
No, it's better upright
when you're pregnant.

688
00:26:58,751 --> 00:26:59,927
I'm a nurse. Tell me why.

689
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,996
To get a clear shot at
the intervertebral space.

690
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,498
You don't want
him fishing around.

691
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,233
Okay, come on, up
you go. Up you go.

692
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,402
You better get it
right the first time.

693
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,338
I generally do if the
patient cooperates.

694
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,939
Mark, is it? Yeah.

695
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,608
Could you grab
her other shoulder?

696
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,710
Okay, Carol, lean
into us. A little bit more.

697
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,212
Keep your back nice and round.

698
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,616
And you'll feel a little prick.

699
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,985
Carol Hathaway?

700
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,953
Carol, it's you.

701
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,422
Dr. Coburn.

702
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,591
Mark. I had no idea.

703
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:32,760
Congratulations. No,
he's my Lamaze coach.

704
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,929
Oh, I see. How are we doing?

705
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,382
High and intact, 6
centimeters. Six?

706
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,134
You shrink down
between deliveries.

707
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,503
I know, but 6?

708
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,055
You need some more local?

709
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,723
Oh, no. Contraction.

710
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,926
Just hold on, Carol.
You're doin' great.

711
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,094
Carol, Dr. McLucas
is in Wichita.

712
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:52,397
She asked me to cover her
practice over Thanksgiving.

713
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,398
Is that all right?

714
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,599
I gotta lie down.

715
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:56,101
No, Carol. He's
in the middle of it.

716
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,102
You have to hold still.

717
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:58,103
No, I can't!

718
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,470
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

719
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:00,772
Here, hold my hand, okay?

720
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:02,974
You're gonna feel much
better once we get through.

721
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:04,142
It hurts, Mark.

722
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,143
I know.

723
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,612
No, I mean, it really hurts.

724
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,614
I know. I know.

725
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:12,183
Hang in there. Hang in there.

726
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,120
One night Stu
and I were on deck.

727
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:17,889
He asked me for a light.

728
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:18,890
I reached in my pocket,

729
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,314
and when I looked
up, he was gone.

730
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:22,594
What do you mean, gone?

731
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,663
Gone. He'd fallen overboard.

732
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:27,465
Oh, my God. Did he drown?

733
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,001
If the fall didn't kill him.

734
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:32,354
That's terrible. Yeah.

735
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,723
'Bout the only thing worse
than the working conditions

736
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,290
on that carrier was the food.

737
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,714
Probably took more
men than anything.

738
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,496
You mean worse than the English?

739
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,283
I was kidding. This is great.

740
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,827
I haven't had a
meal like this since...

741
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,611
Well, for a while.

742
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:54,592
Since your wife died?

743
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:55,994
Yeah.

744
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:59,164
I'm sorry. I can only imagine
how difficult it must be.

745
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:01,199
As difficult as you
make it, I guess.

746
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:03,583
What do you mean?

747
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:07,305
How's Mark? You
know, dealing with it?

748
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,308
Oh, in his stride, I suppose.

749
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,643
To be honest, he
doesn't speak of it much.

750
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,187
And I've learnt not
to force the subject.

751
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,867
There are certain
things he carries inside.

752
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,318
But you must know that.

753
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,585
Well, don't ask me.

754
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,738
His mother was the only
one who understood him.

755
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,173
He's not that big a mystery.

756
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,942
Well, don't get me
wrong. He's a good man.

757
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,000
It's just that with Ruth gone...

758
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,473
I don't know...

759
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,088
How 'bout some pie?

760
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,828
With his mother gone what?

761
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,461
Nothing.

762
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,730
Just seem to have
lost a bridge, I guess.

763
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,954
A bridge? Yeah.

764
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,307
Maybe you both just miss her.

765
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:00,813
I'll get some plates.

766
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:05,463
Hey, Rachel, come get
some pie. What's with her?

767
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,298
She's been in there a half-hour.

768
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:08,555
I'll check.

769
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,892
Rachel?

770
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,908
Are you all right in there?

771
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:18,198
Rachel?

772
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:21,579
Rachel, are you in there?

773
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:23,170
Go away!

774
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,754
What are you looking for?

775
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,878
I don't know.

776
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:35,815
Am I boring you?

777
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,098
No! No.

778
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:41,566
You wanna just talk?

779
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,984
Sure.

780
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,448
Okay.

781
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:46,955
What do you wanna talk about?

782
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,123
I don't know.

783
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,826
Hey, the post-game show's on.

784
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,195
Whoo.

785
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,530
How are you feeling?

786
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,732
I am in love with
the epidural man.

787
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,600
Some people call him
an anesthesiologist.

788
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,704
Oh, he will always be
the epidural man to me.

789
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,306
You know what, I'm just
gonna go get a magazine.

790
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,975
Oh, uh, I should
call Elizabeth too.

791
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,144
She's probably crawling
out on a ledge by now.

792
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,430
Hey, could you
call my mom? Sure.

793
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,632
What do you want me to
tell her? Just what you said.

794
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:16,034
One down, one to go.

795
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:19,437
Her number's in my
organizer in my bag.

796
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,381
Anybody else you
want me to call?

797
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:24,609
No, not yet.

798
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,311
Are you sure?

799
00:31:26,335 --> 00:31:29,369
I just wanna get
through this first.

800
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,917
All right.

801
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,223
What's wrong?

802
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,373
Nothing. Just lost the signal.

803
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,630
Where'd it go? Hold on.

804
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,748
Sandra, could you call Dr. Coburn
and bring the ultrasound?

805
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:47,749
Right there.

806
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,055
Got it.

807
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,237
It's above the umbilicus.

808
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:53,238
What does that mean?

809
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:55,240
Baby could be rotating.

810
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:57,908
It's fine. Heart rate's 140.

811
00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:58,909
Do we have an O.R. clear?

812
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,013
I'll see.

813
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:05,183
Wait, I don't... I don't
need a C-section, do I?

814
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,352
No, not necessarily. But
if the baby turns breech,

815
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,696
we'll have to labor
you in the O.R.

816
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,856
It's just a precaution, Carol.

817
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:14,492
Oh, man.

818
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,960
<i>Hello and welcome</i>

819
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:18,562
<i>to a jam-packed
edition of</i> Sports Tonight.

820
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,764
<i>Steve Murphy alongside...</i>

821
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,233
What's goin' on in there?

822
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:24,902
She sticking her
finger down her throat?

823
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:29,107
I'm afraid she's having
her first menstrual period.

824
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:30,463
Menstrual?

825
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:33,611
She's 10.

826
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:37,382
It can happen at that age.
It's early, but not abnormal.

827
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,117
So one of us needs
to go to the store.

828
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,518
Now, do you want
to stay with her?

829
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,487
Or shall I?

830
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:44,755
Uh, what do you
need from the store?

831
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:46,312
Sanitary napkins.

832
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:49,799
You don't have that stuff?

833
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:53,364
I only have tampons.

834
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,950
Um, it's not really the
best for a young girl.

835
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,475
Oh, right.

836
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:02,123
Listen, um, there's a
drugstore just on the corner.

837
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,257
Sanitary napkins.

838
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,592
That...? That's the flat ones?

839
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,249
Ask the clerk.

840
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,586
What if he's a guy?

841
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,602
How are we doing?

842
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,570
We'll move her right
after this contraction.

843
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,306
Baby's in lotus position.

844
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,407
What's this for?

845
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,476
We have to prep you for the O.R.

846
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,311
What, even if I'm not
being operated on?

847
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,014
Don't worry, I won't
take any pictures.

848
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,682
Ha-ha.

849
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,783
Uh-oh.

850
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:29,784
What is it?

851
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,585
I think my water
just broke again.

852
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,121
Let's see.

853
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,557
Sure did. Nice and clear.
We'll clean you up once you...

854
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,627
What? Fetal heart
rate's in the 90s.

855
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,629
Um, Carol, I have to check you.

856
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:42,930
Yeah, but we're good till 80?

857
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,866
Just relax, Carol, I
have to check you again.

858
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,333
What're you lookin' for?

859
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,402
I have to wait till this
contraction finishes.

860
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,204
Seventy-five.

861
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,305
What's wrong?

862
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,107
Damn it. Prolapsed cord.

863
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,509
Prolapsed? The cord
gets out before the baby.

864
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,678
Cutting off the oxygen?

865
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,746
Stat page Coburn
to the O.R., please.

866
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,314
All right, fetal
heart rate's 65.

867
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,949
We have to get
this baby out now.

868
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,151
She's only 6 centimeters.

869
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,519
We'll have to crash C-section.

870
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,953
Oh, my God!

871
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,889
The O.R. is not clear yet.

872
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,223
Yeah? We're goin'.

873
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,224
What are you doing?

874
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,692
I'm keeping the
baby off its cord.

875
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,445
Wha...? This can't be
hap... This isn't happening.

876
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,948
Just try and stay calm.
Mark, don't let this happen!

877
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,292
Don't worry, I'm
right here. Oh, God.

878
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,405
Is the baby hypoxic? We're okay.

879
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,407
What's the heart rate?
We're not on a monitor.

880
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,475
What happened?

881
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,976
Prolapsed cord.
Heart rate was 65.

882
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,211
Okay, scrub in, Abby.

883
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,313
She's got her hand on the
cord. Get somebody else.

884
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,965
I've got it, Dr. Greene.
Don't let go!

885
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,333
You wanna assist on a C-section?

886
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:37,051
Not really. Then I
need 10 seconds

887
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,920
for her to scrub in.
Take over Sandra.

888
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,471
Okay, everybody, on my count.

889
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,474
Nice and easy. One, two, three.

890
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,076
All right, get your
hand on that cord.

891
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,344
Mark, you gotta save the baby.

892
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:48,079
We will. No, promise me.

893
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:49,546
I promise. I got it.

894
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,681
Let's prep her fast.

895
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:51,983
Where's Anesthesia?

896
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,184
I just paged them.

897
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,686
Get Anesthesia down here now!

898
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,355
There's no time.
She had an epidural.

899
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:59,590
Keep 100 mics of
fentanyl standing by.

900
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:02,577
Okay, I'll monitor her vitals.

901
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,378
Please save this baby.

902
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,663
Gloves now.

903
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:06,664
Please.

904
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,333
Okay, Mom's BP, 118/84.

905
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,036
Pulse, 102. Satting
98 on room air.

906
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,339
Okay, nasal oxygen. - I'm on it.

907
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,374
Here we go!

908
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:19,332
One minute from
skin to baby. Scalpel.

909
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,363
There's skin.

910
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,350
And mark the time.

911
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,385
Please, God, please,
please. Don't worry.

912
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:29,554
Abby, stretch. Pull.
ABBY: I'm pulling.

913
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:30,855
Where's Pedes?

914
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,557
On their way. Bladder blade.

915
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:35,944
Retract inferiorally.
Scalpel again.

916
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,679
Uterine incision.

917
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,449
Okay. And another stretch.

918
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,700
Pediatrician's here.

919
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,268
Mark, what's happening?

920
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,304
- I see the baby.
- Blue towel.

921
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:48,306
Up.

922
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,041
Ah, looks like a girl.

923
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,209
Did you hear that? Hear
that? You got another girl.

924
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,544
Is she okay? Hold on.

925
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,129
Second shoulder.

926
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,632
Head flexed.

927
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,883
Another clamp. Scissors.

928
00:35:58,907 --> 00:35:59,884
Is she out?

929
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,919
She's out.

930
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:02,920
Why isn't she crying?

931
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,921
She will.

932
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,757
I got her. COBURN:
She looks okay.

933
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,892
- She's not crying.
- How'd we do?

934
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,927
- Blow by 15 liters.
- Fifty-one seconds.

935
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:11,479
Mark, she's blue.

936
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,114
She'll pink up.

937
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,732
Uterus is boggy.
She needs Pit, 20.

938
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,784
What's the Apgar? Don't worry.

939
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:17,986
Mark, what's the Apgar?

940
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,905
Five-minute Apgar's
more predictive.

941
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,142
Oh, my God. What happened?

942
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,944
Damn ice. I slipped.

943
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:28,979
It was a pretty bad
spill. I saw it from here.

944
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:30,014
Let me see.

945
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:32,016
I'm fine. You should throw

946
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,751
salt out there.
Know what time it is?

947
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,986
Yeah, time my
10-year-old granddaughter

948
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,290
started her period.

949
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:42,226
You got this? Uh, yes,
thanks for buzzing me.

950
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,028
Right. We need to get you
to a hospital and stitch that up.

951
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:48,016
Like hell. It will stop
bleeding with a little pressure.

952
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,518
A nasty gash. You need
sutures and a tetanus booster.

953
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,620
What I need is a
Band-Aid and a drink.

954
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,690
Fine. Well, if you sit still,
you'll even get a lollipop.

955
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,426
Five-minute Apgar
is eight, Carol.

956
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,895
Can I see her?

957
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,064
Hold on. We've got
some active bleeding.

958
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,498
What's her pressure?

959
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,400
Hundred over 60.

960
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,319
What took you so long?
They just paged me.

961
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:10,121
She delivered five minutes ago.

962
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,223
Profuse bleeding.
Uterus is still boggy.

963
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,042
How much Pitocin has she had?

964
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,510
Forty units in.

965
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:16,911
Another 0.2 Methergine.

966
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:17,978
I.M.?

967
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,380
No, I'll do it intramyometrial.

968
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,216
Hemostat. More suction.

969
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,085
She's oozing everywhere.

970
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,476
Sponge stick. Check
another pressure.

971
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,224
Oh, my God.

972
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,414
I'm bleeding out.

973
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:34,896
It always looks like
more than there is.

974
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,640
How are we doin'?

975
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,150
Pressure's down, 80/40.

976
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:42,686
All right, let's pump
in some saline.

977
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,854
I'll put in a line.

978
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:45,356
I wanna see my baby.

979
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,757
You will. Just a little while.

980
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,925
I'll take her to the nursery.

981
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:50,761
We're at 70.

982
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:53,230
Okay, she needs blood.
Type and cross for four.

983
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:54,499
Okay.

984
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,334
Three liters are up.

985
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,102
Hemabate, 0.25 I.M.

986
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:00,771
The blood'll be
here in 10 minutes.

987
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:02,662
We don't have 10 minutes.

988
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:05,343
Open a hysterectomy tray.

989
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,512
What? Hold on. Are we there yet?

990
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:09,347
Carol, your uterus is atonic.

991
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,182
It's not firming up.
You're losing blood,

992
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,083
in spite of the medication
we're giving you.

993
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,519
Don't do a hysterectomy.

994
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,104
We may not have a choice.

995
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,406
Don't, please. Mark.

996
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,507
What else can we do?

997
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,775
Uterus is still boggy.

998
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,093
Another 500 cc's of
blood loss. Okay, Bovie.

999
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,196
There must be something
short of a hysterectomy.

1000
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,530
Yes. Losing the patient.

1001
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,265
Can't you clamp off an artery?

1002
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,801
Please step out, doctor.
It's only 30 seconds.

1003
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:32,303
It's 30 seconds
she may not have.

1004
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:34,288
She doesn't want it.

1005
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,056
She's a nurse. She
understands the risk.

1006
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,360
Respect her decision.

1007
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,995
O'Leary stitch. O-vicryl.

1008
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,380
O-neg is up and ready.

1009
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,881
Hold the transfusion.

1010
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,182
What's her pressure?

1011
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:46,750
Systolic is 80.

1012
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,252
Cycle the dynamap.
Check it again.

1013
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:49,620
That's a hypogastric.

1014
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:50,954
She's lost 3 liters.

1015
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:52,523
Needle driver and pickups.

1016
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,347
Hang in there, Carol.

1017
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:16,013
She needs a name.

1018
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:19,417
Tess needs to know what
her little sister's name is.

1019
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,619
Is she all right?

1020
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:22,853
She's perfect.

1021
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:25,188
They are both perfect.

1022
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:27,425
Hm.

1023
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,676
What happened?

1024
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,845
You gave us a bit of a scare,

1025
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,434
but you toughed it out.

1026
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,867
Yeah, you still
have your uterus.

1027
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:41,022
You're up.

1028
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,656
How you feeling?

1029
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,991
A little groggy.

1030
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,159
Any pain?

1031
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:48,362
Actually, no, for
the first time today.

1032
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,031
Drugs.

1033
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,200
Enjoy them while they last.

1034
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,403
I wouldn't repeat this
outside of this room, but, uh,

1035
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:58,377
you owe your friend
here your future children.

1036
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:02,025
You know, they both
came out so well,

1037
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:03,878
you oughta think
about doing it again.

1038
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,846
Yeah, I'm gonna
get right on that.

1039
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,636
So, what's her name?

1040
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,185
You wanna name her?

1041
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,209
Me?

1042
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,123
What was your mom's name?

1043
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,480
Ruth.

1044
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,466
Middle name Katherine.

1045
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,865
Kate? Oh, I like that.

1046
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,769
Kate.

1047
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,441
Dr. Greene, they
need you downstairs.

1048
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,542
What for?

1049
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,910
They brought your
dad in for a laceration.

1050
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,279
What happened?

1051
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:42,405
Oh, I don't know.
Um, I'll be right back.

1052
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,041
Mark?

1053
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,504
Yeah.

1054
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:50,624
Thank you.

1055
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,315
You did good, Mom.

1056
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,302
Can you, uh, call long
distance on this phone?

1057
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,843
You might need a calling
card. Where are you calling?

1058
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,595
Seattle.

1059
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,245
You come in handy. Thank you.

1060
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,948
How many stitches, do
you think? Six, maybe seven.

1061
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,782
Dad, what
happened? It's nothing.

1062
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,184
He slipped on the ice.

1063
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,386
I would have caught myself
if I hadn't been carrying

1064
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,754
such a big bag.

1065
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,357
How many different kinds of
sanitary napkins do they make?

1066
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,359
Thin, maxi, mini...
What is he talking about?

1067
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,328
Rachel started her period. What?

1068
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,663
Scented, unscented. I had
to buy every kind they had.

1069
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,565
Dad, hold on a minute.
Can I talk to you?

1070
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,949
Couldn't just have regular.

1071
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,971
Ra...? Rachel had her period?

1072
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,372
I was as surprised as you are.

1073
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,557
Well, where is she now?

1074
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,392
She's on the phone,
talking to her mom.

1075
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,793
She wants to go
back to St. Louis.

1076
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:44,595
Why'd you let him
go out in this weather?

1077
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,097
You'd prefer I left him with
your menstruating daughter?

1078
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,665
Excuse me, Dr. Greene?

1079
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:50,568
Uh, did she have the other baby?

1080
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,735
Carol Hathaway?

1081
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,470
Yes. And, uh,
what...? What was it?

1082
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:54,822
A girl. Two girls.

1083
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,657
Oh. And everything's all right?

1084
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,858
Everything's fine now.

1085
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,294
Good. Thank you.

1086
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,029
Here. You stitch up your father.

1087
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,352
I'm gonna say hello.

1088
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:06,657
I like her.

1089
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,858
Hm-mm.

1090
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,673
Sometimes you'll have to
tickle her feet to wake her up,

1091
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,642
'cause new babies
are sleepy. Hm.

1092
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,878
Okay, wait till she opens
her mouth really wide.

1093
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,314
That's it.

1094
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,983
Yeah, make sure her mouth
covers the whole areola.

1095
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,308
Yeah, see her little jaw moving?

1096
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,356
Oh, she's a barracuda.

1097
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,213
She's a natural. Ooh.

1098
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,767
You listen for the
swallowing. Do you hear it?

1099
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:40,618
Okay. I have to go.

1100
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,686
Your postpartum nurse
will take over from here.

1101
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,704
You're leaving? Yeah.

1102
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,172
You'll be fine.

1103
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,674
Congratulations.

1104
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:50,211
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

1105
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,462
You were very brave.

1106
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:54,030
I don't know about that.

1107
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:57,167
Oh, trust me.

1108
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:59,102
Good night.

1109
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:01,055
Good night. Happy Thanksgiving!

1110
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,446
Happy Thanksgiving.
