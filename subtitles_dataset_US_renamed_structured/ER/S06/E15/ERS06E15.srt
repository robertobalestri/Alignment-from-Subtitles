1
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,458
So is he standing
on the frozen lake

2
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,526
or will he be sitting in
one of those little huts?

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,261
It beats me.

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,663
What kind of fish do they catch?

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,730
Beats me. MALUCCI: Yo!

6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,231
Morning.

7
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,718
I can't believe he rides
that thing in the winter.

8
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:26,186
Damn. Malucci.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,254
What? Case
conference with Romano.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,924
Malucci admitted a patient and
I left my notes in my apartment.

11
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,159
Ah, that'll teach you,
sleeping at my place.

12
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,393
Yeah. I'll see you later.

13
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,417
Oh.

14
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,882
You should get a U-lock.

15
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,151
A pair of bolt cutters and
somebody's gonna leave you

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,686
with a broken chain and no ride.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,921
Thanks, Mom.

18
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,889
Tired of scolding me
for not wearing a helmet?

19
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,691
Dr. Dave, I'd never
want to get between you

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,682
and your personal
path to brain death.

21
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,280
Abdominal pain,
possible ischemic bowel,

22
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,683
just went to CT and
needs a surgical consult.

23
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,284
Got those x-rays
back from Mr. Wyatt.

24
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,787
Oh, good. Hey, Mark, could
you finish up with Luka, please?

25
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,821
Sure. What's left?

26
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,490
Exam 2: Mr. Kechevsky,
rule out MI.

27
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:07,760
And if somebody could call
me with the enzyme results,

28
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:08,928
I would like the follow-up.

29
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:10,597
Abby, can you
handle that? Of course.

30
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,831
Okay. So that's it? Yep.

31
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:12,999
All right.

32
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,237
ER. Yeah. Yeah,
hang on a second.

33
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:20,840
Abby, it's for you.

34
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,241
It's my job to
answer the phones.

35
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:23,442
Just trying to help.

36
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,133
And I appreciate it.

37
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,114
Abby Lockhart.

38
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:30,038
Yes, I did call. Three days ago.

39
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,086
Look, whatever. I just...

40
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,543
I need to talk to you
about the late payments. I...

41
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,079
What?

42
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,328
Well, you'll just have
to sell 'em. I don't...

43
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,130
Look, I really don't
care how you do it,

44
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,432
just make the payments. I...

45
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:48,589
Just make the payments.

46
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:50,492
Bye.

47
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:55,642
That was my
soon-to-be ex-husband.

48
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,209
Sounds bad.

49
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,979
Yeah, he's taken a flyer on some
tech stocks with my loan money.

50
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,881
Ow. Well, maybe they'll go up.

51
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,350
Yeah, I'll never see the cash.

52
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,486
Okay, I'm leaving
before I fall over.

53
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,821
Till next time, ladies.

54
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,489
Bye.

55
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:12,208
Men.

56
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,779
Elizabeth.

57
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,148
Morning. I forgot some
notes for a meeting.

58
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,685
You look tired. Were you
watching<i> Charlie Rose</i> again?

59
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,092
Not exactly.

60
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,231
Uh, morning, Elizabeth.

61
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,968
David came over for breakfast.

62
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,455
In boxers and slippers?

63
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,690
My slippers.

64
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,910
Uh, hope you don't mind.

65
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,962
I thought you were ice fishing.

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,649
Well...

67
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,913
I didn't make it.

68
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,732
Can see that.

69
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,438
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

70
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,862
See you.

71
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,146
Can I freshen your cup?

72
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,932
Good Lord, Mother, I
practically drank the whole pot

73
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,699
while the two of you
were saying goodbye.

74
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,123
So are you amused?

75
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,444
Bemused?

76
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,775
Irritated? Shocked?
Chagrined...?

77
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,477
That's a start.

78
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,446
I suppose you think at
my age I shouldn't be...

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,581
Mother. Mother, please.

80
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,584
Do you really think what
the two of you are doing

81
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:18,818
is a good idea?

82
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,155
I'm a little older,
but I'm not dead.

83
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,623
His wife is. Recently.

84
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,025
Then bloody well good
for him for getting on with...

85
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,049
Mother!

86
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,831
Is it so difficult to imagine

87
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,100
that two people could
be attracted to each other

88
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,556
and actually act on it?

89
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,340
Were you using,
you know, protection?

90
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,808
There are diseases.

91
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,176
You think he's diseased?

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,377
That's not the point.

93
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,346
And you really
want to discuss this?

94
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,247
No! No!

95
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,337
No.

96
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,653
He's my boyfriend's father. Oh!

97
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:56,156
You always cared too much
about what other people think.

98
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,273
Even as a little girl.

99
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,275
I did not! Yes, you did.

100
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,167
Well, how would you
know? Did the nanny tell you?

101
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,166
Yes, Elizabeth. You
were<i> so</i> neglected.

102
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,301
Don't pretend to know
me when you don't.

103
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:11,304
I know you a lot
better than you think.

104
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:15,842
I'm just trying to say, this
could get very complicated.

105
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:20,046
Why are you always so afraid
relationships will go wrong?

106
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,182
Well, perhaps because
ours hasn't exactly gone right.

107
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,906
I have to get to work.

108
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,157
Hey, no fair doing paperwork
when there are patients to see.

109
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,659
I'm not even on yet, Dave.

110
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,661
Oh, I get it. Just making
the rest of us look bad?

111
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:37,597
I'm doing chart reviews for
Carter and Lucy's patients.

112
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,331
S-sorry. Need my help?

113
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,455
I've got it.

114
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,870
Hey, Abby, I got a
couple of cases for you.

115
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:45,939
Foreign body up the
nose and hemorrhoids.

116
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,339
Be right there.

117
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,375
Um, and the CPK was normal.

118
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,845
Good. Good. Discharge
him, Abby. Yeah.

119
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,481
Yeah, he should follow
up with Cardiology.

120
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,283
No, I have the
night shift all week.

121
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:00,853
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

122
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,097
Laura!

123
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,595
Stop! Stop!

124
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,059
It hurts. I know it hurts.

125
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,629
I know it hurts. I'm a doctor.
I'm gonna help you, all right?

126
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,898
Okay, look at me.
Look at me, please.

127
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,917
Try to breathe slow
and easy, okay?

128
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:34,087
Now, tell me your name
and where it hurts, huh?

129
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,522
Laura. My leg.

130
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,374
Okay, try to keep
your head still.

131
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,510
I didn't think that you
remove nose piercings.

132
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,280
Uh, I got a new stud. I
thought I'd put it in the old hole.

133
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,548
Okay, just inject 2
cc's of air into the Foley

134
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,906
and pull it back gently.

135
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,037
Bless you.

136
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,373
Hey, thanks. You're welcome.

137
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:55,441
Can I go now?

138
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,243
I-in a minute. Um,
hemorrhoids next?

139
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,145
Do the initial workup,
then find me or Mark.

140
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,179
Okay.

141
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:01,581
Hi.

142
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,783
You're not planning to use
that thing on me, are you?

143
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,850
We'll see.

144
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:05,902
I'm Abby.

145
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,303
Ron Perth.

146
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,071
Listen, I feel kind
of stupid coming in.

147
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,107
I mean, I didn't
expect to feel great,

148
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,541
but I'm concerned.

149
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,545
I'm still bleeding from the...
You know, hemorrhoids.

150
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,980
Uh, what, they were
banded just last week?

151
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,916
Yeah.

152
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,733
You look kind of pale.
How much bleeding?

153
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,469
Oh, it's not that much. Uh...

154
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,737
Listen, I... I'm supposed
to fly back to Denver at 5.

155
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,373
It's my girlfriend's birthday.

156
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,792
And, uh, I was kind of hoping
that you could give me a cream

157
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,577
or something, you
know, to shrink it down?

158
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,729
Sorry.

159
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,480
I was planning to
take her dancing.

160
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,433
You might want to make
it just a candlelit dinner.

161
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,734
Need a hand? Uh, yeah.

162
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:42,671
Could you order a
CBC, Chem-7 and coags,

163
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,872
and prep for anoscopy.

164
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,941
Mm-hm.

165
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,326
Is that what I think it is?

166
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,827
I'll be gentle.

167
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,050
Oh, man.

168
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,780
Where's my mom?

169
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,749
Somebody get my mom!

170
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,917
She'll be here, Laura.
Your sister went to get her.

171
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,753
Laura, I need to cut
open your pants now

172
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,121
so I can look at your leg, okay?

173
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,956
Oh, my God! Is
she gonna be okay?

174
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,691
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm Dr. Kovac.

175
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,210
I already called 911.

176
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,461
Laura... Hey, be careful.

177
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,014
Her left leg is broken
and maybe a rib too.

178
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,550
Mom, it hurts! Oh, I
know, baby. It's okay.

179
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,854
Can't you do something?

180
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,771
Okay, can you go and tell
that lady we need her broom?

181
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,456
I'll get it. What are you doing?

182
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,058
I'm going to splint her leg.

183
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,626
- Why?
- I need to check

184
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,931
to see if there is any
damage to the artery.

185
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:25,820
We...

186
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:30,269
We heard you can't tell
anybody anything we say to you.

187
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,813
Well, that depends
on what you tell me.

188
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,161
It's...

189
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,331
It's about...

190
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,263
Sex?

191
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,465
Well, uh, if there's
no abuse involved

192
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,000
and the guys are under 18,

193
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,419
then everything you tell me
has to remain confidential.

194
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,887
So you couldn't
tell our parents?

195
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,505
No, I couldn't. You promise?

196
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,895
Go ahead. What is it?

197
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,234
Look, I can't help you if
you don't tell me what it is.

198
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,101
Um, we're afraid we might
have caught something.

199
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,437
Well, what do you think
you might have caught?

200
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,712
We heard some syphilis
was going around school.

201
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,944
I see.

202
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,247
Why don't you girls
come with me, okay?

203
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,431
Okay. Okay.

204
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,351
My chest hurts! What is it?

205
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,453
I'm worried she's
bleeding internally.

206
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,338
Oh, no. Well,
then, do something!

207
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,340
I mean, where's the
ambulance? It'll be here.

208
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,209
No, let's just...
Let's drive her.

209
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,312
It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

210
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,479
Sir!

211
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,249
You, the plumber. Yeah.

212
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:37,587
I'm Dr. Kovac. I need your help.
Can you make room for this girl?

213
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,021
You want to put her in the van?

214
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,224
Yeah. She needs to get
to the hospital right now.

215
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,058
It's urgent.

216
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,861
Okay, let's... Let's
go. Okay, thanks.

217
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,029
In his underwear? My father?

218
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,464
I couldn't believe it either.

219
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,565
What did you say?

220
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,833
What could I say?

221
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,701
I tried to talk to her
about it after he left,

222
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,303
but it just turned
into an arguement.

223
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,505
I didn't find it that amusing.

224
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,840
Well, it beats ice fishing.

225
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,608
Well, don't you
find it a little bizarre?

226
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,111
Well, they're adults. You
know, it's not such a bad thing.

227
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,812
So what? Are they
gonna keep on doing it?

228
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,281
Where? Your place or mine?

229
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,816
He's coming in to see the
pulmonologist this afternoon.

230
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,885
I'll talk to him.

231
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,471
Yeah, thanks.

232
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,724
- I can't breathe.
- Okay, hang on.

233
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,625
Her broken rib could've
punctured the lung.

234
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,460
Look to the right, Laura.

235
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,179
Now to the left.

236
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,714
Laura? Laura?

237
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,170
Oh, my God!

238
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,686
No breath sounds.
What's happening?

239
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,254
She has a tension pneumothorax.

240
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,206
An air leak has
collapsed her lung,

241
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,659
and compression is keeping
her heart from beating.

242
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,528
We have to put this
needle in her chest

243
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,747
to relieve the pressure.

244
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:38,915
Oh.

245
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,979
Oh, my God! Okay...

246
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,669
Wait, why is she bleeding?

247
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,855
I might have nicked an
artery when we hit that bump.

248
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,089
An artery?

249
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,009
Here, keep pressure where
the blood's coming out.

250
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,260
Oh, God.

251
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,628
Something wrong back there?

252
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,013
These pads are soaked.

253
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,604
Just keep pressing
them, okay? Okay.

254
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,686
Come on, damn it.

255
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,223
Yeah, this is Kovac. Yeah, I'm
coming in with a major trauma.

256
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,293
Clear a room and
get four units of O-neg.

257
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:08,317
Yeah.

258
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,785
Go faster. We need
to be there now!

259
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,285
Auto versus 10-year-old girl.

260
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,655
Blunt trauma to right lower
chest and fractured left femur.

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,224
Hang on, honey!

262
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,092
We need to set up for
a chest tube right away.

263
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,294
Pulse is thready.

264
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,395
You need any more help?

265
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,659
No. Got it. Thank you.

266
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,666
She was stable, but
then I lost her pulse

267
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,534
with decreased breath
sounds on the right.

268
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,670
Some improvement
with needle thoracostomy,

269
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,405
but I may have
nicked her intercostal.

270
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,873
What happened?
The van hit a bump

271
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,275
when the needle was inside her.

272
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,976
Why didn't you wait
for the paramedics?

273
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,411
I waited seven minutes.

274
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,814
I thought I might lose her if
I didn't get here right away.

275
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,283
Paramedics arrived two
minutes after you left the scene.

276
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,085
I'm sorry. You'll
have to wait outside.

277
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,453
Get a trauma panel,

278
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,854
UA, type and cross for 4.

279
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,023
Two large-bore IVs. Uh,
squeeze in a saline, prep the chest.

280
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,792
BP's 80 palp, pulse, 110.

281
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,328
I want my mom. Where's my mom?

282
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,996
She's just outside.
How are you doing?

283
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,131
Mom!

284
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,832
Give her something for the pain.

285
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,501
- Lidocaine.
- 10 blade.

286
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,553
- I need ultrasound.
- 28 French.

287
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,422
Luka, you've been
off for an hour.

288
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:10,473
We got it from here.

289
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,891
I'll stay.

290
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:14,477
Get X-ray up here.
Pulse ox, 92 on 10 liters.

291
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,579
We need to intubate.
6-and-a-half ET tube.

292
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,930
I'm in, hook me up.

293
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:20,183
Whoa! Uh-oh.
Chest full of blood.

294
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,069
Pressure's down to 70.
FINCH: You did hit the artery.

295
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,404
Lydia, call the O.R.,
have them hold a room.

296
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:26,989
Looks like it was
more than a nick.

297
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,491
Got more than a liter out.

298
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,909
Pressure's down to 50.

299
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,861
Laura.

300
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,846
- She's unresponsive.
- All right, let's prep

301
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,166
for a right-sided thoracotomy.

302
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,834
Not much longer now, Andrea.

303
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,469
Is Terri okay?

304
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,139
She's fine. She's
sitting over in Chairs.

305
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,757
There's cervical bleeding.

306
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:48,044
And thick and white
dysplasia with papules.

307
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,379
Is that syphilis? Dysplasia?

308
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,681
There's no sign of syphilis.

309
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,884
But we have to wait for
the blood test to be sure.

310
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,852
You can go ahead
and get dressed.

311
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,970
So I can go?

312
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,105
No. Your HIV test
won't take long.

313
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,140
I'd like you to wait.

314
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:02,525
Well, am I all right?

315
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,149
Let's wait and see
what the test says.

316
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,029
The other girl looks okay,

317
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:10,198
but get Pathology to do a
stat Pap-smear on this one.

318
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,800
Okay.

319
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,744
All right. Let's
get you dressed.

320
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,990
Well, Mr. Perth... Ron, please.

321
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:18,991
Ron.

322
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,459
Uh, your blood count's normal.

323
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:21,827
That's good, right?

324
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,797
Right, uh, although
sometimes it takes a while

325
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,299
for a crit to show a blood loss.

326
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:28,417
Yeah, but I... I feel okay.

327
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,086
Yeah, but I'd hate to
have you on that plane

328
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,511
and start to bleed
out at 35,000 feet.

329
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,558
You want to do another test.

330
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:36,592
Yeah.

331
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,428
I'm going to draw some blood,

332
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,064
which is then tagged
with a radionucleotide,

333
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,400
which I then reinject by IV.

334
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,769
And then a scan lets
me trace for bleeding.

335
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,572
Yeah, okay. As long as
I won't glow in the dark.

336
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,695
Nah, quick and
painless, I promise.

337
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,495
So honestly, is it really
the thought that counts?

338
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,697
Uh, about what?

339
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,949
Oh, uh, for my
girlfriend's birthday.

340
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,667
I was thinking of jewelry.

341
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:03,953
But if I go there, I've
got to go big, right?

342
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,455
I don't know.

343
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,157
The best present my
husband ever gave me

344
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,760
was a surprise picnic
that he packed himself.

345
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:11,927
Ah, romantic.

346
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,094
Cheap.

347
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,096
Hello. Hi.

348
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,498
Oh, Dr. Weaver, Mr. Perth.

349
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,699
How's he doing?

350
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,501
Rule out GI bleed.
I'm drawing some blood

351
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,102
for a nuclear medicine scan.

352
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,639
Oh, we don't do those
very often down here.

353
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,025
CBC and lytes come back?

354
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,993
Yeah, they're normal.

355
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,728
Abby, can I talk to
you for a minute?

356
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:30,784
Sure.

357
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,454
Hold that.

358
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,772
Okay, the belly's benign,
there's no evidence of a bleed.

359
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,175
So... So why order
such an expensive test?

360
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,776
He just doesn't look well to me.

361
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,579
His... His skin is pale,
his eyes are dull...

362
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah, that's hardly
diagnostic of a bleed.

363
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:51,016
I... I really don't think
the scan is necessary.

364
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,573
You should discharge him.

365
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,595
Is there a problem?

366
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,362
No.

367
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:07,154
I just have to
get this to the lab.

368
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,485
More suction. Got it.

369
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,054
Are you gonna
stick tie the bleeder?

370
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,322
No. Too close to the bone.

371
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,241
All right, let me get 0
silk on a Keith needle.

372
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:16,442
What are you doing?

373
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:19,495
Kennedy maneuver.
Transmural hemostatic suture.

374
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,363
Second unit's in. Hang another.

375
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,432
And autotransfuse
from the cell saver.

376
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,751
Take the superior
and the inferior,

377
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:27,853
and tie them tight
on the outside.

378
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:29,505
Dry as a bone. Nice.

379
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,772
New seizure in 2.

380
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,957
I should get this.

381
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,342
You okay, Peter? Mm-hm.

382
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,044
Check the BP.

383
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,812
How about another crit?

384
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:37,880
Yeah, fine.

385
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,415
Luka, let's go
talk to the mother.

386
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,483
All right.

387
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,967
Pressure's crashing.

388
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,185
The chest is dry.

389
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,320
Ultrasound. Check
the belly again.

390
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,157
She dropped her pressure.
She must still be bleeding.

391
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,176
You're right.
Belly's full of blood.

392
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,193
It's the liver.

393
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,360
She blew the capsule.

394
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,829
We should have
checked the belly.

395
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,448
Hang two units, get
her up to the O.R.!

396
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:56,920
Let's move now!

397
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,217
What is it?

398
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:01,119
We're taking her to surgery.

399
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:02,120
This is her mother.

400
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,323
Come with us. Come on.

401
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,757
Dr. Kovac, you've done enough.

402
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,359
Why don't you let
us take it from here?

403
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,128
I want to stay with
her. She's my patient.

404
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:10,432
No, no. Not anymore.

405
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,700
Why don't you go
home, get some sleep?

406
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,084
You think I'm going to sleep?

407
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,393
Luka.

408
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,974
That's hilarious. Oh, my God!

409
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:23,742
I can't believe
it. That's great.

410
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,878
Oh, wait, we gotta go. Bye.

411
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,880
Sorry, we were just
talking to some friends.

412
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,732
Terri, I need to talk
to Andrea privately.

413
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,400
Is she all right?

414
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,352
Uh, could you just go
wait in Chairs, please?

415
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:34,876
Hey, it's okay.

416
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:40,782
Thanks.

417
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,301
Andrea, we got
your test results.

418
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,451
They found some abnormal
cells in your Pap smear.

419
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,975
You might have cervical cancer.

420
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,973
We need to do a
biopsy just to make sure.

421
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,441
Cancer?

422
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,427
Was it caused by having sex?

423
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,229
Well, you get it from
an infected partner.

424
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,597
It's called HPV.

425
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,933
Human Papilloma Virus.

426
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,617
But not everybody
with HPV has cancer...

427
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,507
No, you can't tell my parents.

428
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,608
Andrea, if you have this,

429
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,643
you need to be
admitted to the hospital.

430
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,512
Anyway, they're in Europe.

431
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,814
And you said everything I
told you was confidential.

432
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,817
If you're not treated,
you could get very sick.

433
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,122
We also have to
inform your partner.

434
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,462
Andrea...

435
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:33,178
I don't know who it is.

436
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,468
I mean, which one.

437
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:37,137
Well, how many have you had?

438
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,573
Not sure.

439
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,994
We, um... We have these parties.

440
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,096
Peter, I want to scrub in.

441
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,131
No.

442
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,498
Why not? You're not a surgeon.

443
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm not asking to
operate. Let it go.

444
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,569
I'll call you as soon as
I'm finished. Let's go.

445
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:58,753
She'll be all right.

446
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,442
Coming back down to the ER?

447
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,310
In a minute.

448
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,334
Come with me. I'll show
you where you can wait.

449
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,801
And then there was Mrs.
Saltzman in for shoulder pain

450
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,069
and you sent her out for an MRI.

451
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,705
And you were right.
C5-6 herniated disc.

452
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,575
And, uh, Mr. Blandeleau,
chest pain.

453
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,244
Ruled in for an MI,
had angioplasty.

454
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,379
And, uh, he's doing okay.

455
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,570
That's it.

456
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,650
Thanks.

457
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,674
No problem.

458
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,520
Are you doing Lucy's cases too?

459
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,144
Told Weaver I didn't mind.

460
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,894
How was the memorial service?

461
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,352
Okay. It was nice.

462
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,988
A little weird.

463
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,455
How's everything
else downstairs?

464
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,390
Ah, same old thing.

465
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:53,492
How are you doing?

466
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,949
I'm doing fine.

467
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,132
I know everybody who works
here. People drop by all day.

468
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:01,600
I bet.

469
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:03,302
Even my grandmother came by.

470
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:05,387
I thought you didn't
talk to her anymore.

471
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,689
Well, there's nothing like
a near-fatal stab wound

472
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,658
to put a different
spin on things.

473
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,962
Hey, I'm gonna be back
to work in a couple weeks.

474
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,565
Get rid of this bag.
Maybe take up skydiving.

475
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,167
Hm, you do that.

476
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,586
All right. Get out of
here. I need my rest.

477
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,072
All right. Um...

478
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,323
You need help back on the bed?

479
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,390
No. I'm good. Okay.

480
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,725
Well, catch you tomorrow.

481
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,948
Yep.

482
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:33,065
Oh, uh, John,
uh... Are you okay?

483
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,554
Yeah, fine.

484
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,303
Listen, take it easy, okay?

485
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,060
Yeah. Thanks, Deb.

486
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,586
Dad.

487
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,300
You're late.

488
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,103
Three minutes.
Appointment was 11:45.

489
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,705
I didn't know how long it would
take to drive back from the lake

490
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,474
and I was worried you might
have fallen through the ice.

491
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,777
Yeah. Very funny, Mark.

492
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,811
Like you don't know.

493
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,079
Just having a little fun.

494
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,848
Which is apparently
what you were doing.

495
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,118
I don't think Elizabeth
was too amused.

496
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,653
I'd say that's pretty accurate.

497
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,255
Yeah, I suppose it's wrong,
being in her place and all.

498
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,790
Oh, don't worry about it.

499
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,224
We'll go to a hotel tonight.

500
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,459
What?

501
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,961
It'll be easier for everyone.

502
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,063
So it's kind of
an ongoing thing?

503
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,882
What do you think?
This is a one-night stand?

504
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:25,751
I don't know. I...

505
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,469
What floor is this
pulmonologist on?

506
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,592
Fifth floor.

507
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,507
I like her, Mark. She
makes me happy.

508
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,510
Now, I'm sorry if that
makes you unhappy.

509
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,145
I didn't say that, Dad.

510
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,147
But she'll be back in
London in a couple of weeks

511
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,648
and I'll be back
on your sofa bed.

512
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,655
Then we can both be unhappy.

513
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,271
How many has she slept with?

514
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,505
I don't know.

515
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,507
Both girls have been
going to these sex parties

516
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:52,077
at schoolfriends' houses.
Oh, my God. At their age?

517
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,845
I promised her I
wouldn't tell her folks,

518
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,180
and legally I can't.

519
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:58,550
W-wait. She... She's a
minor and she needs surgery.

520
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:01,086
Well, maybe I can talk her
into letting me tell her parents.

521
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,755
Carol, I understand you don't
want to break confidentiality,

522
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,257
but this is a public
health issue now.

523
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:09,427
At least one of those
boys is spreading HPV.

524
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:10,796
And the girls at those parties

525
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,465
all need to have pelvic
exams and Pap smears.

526
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,590
So whatever she says, you
also need to call the school.

527
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,316
Hey, Malik, have you seen
a girl in a school uniform?

528
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,085
I saw two of 'em.
They went out that door.

529
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:34,269
Oh, damn it!

530
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:41,026
Excuse me?

531
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,579
Uh... yeah?

532
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,465
My name is Barbara Knight.
I'm looking for Dr. Greene.

533
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,550
Uh, he was here
just a minute ago.

534
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,253
Or maybe Dr. Weaver?

535
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,855
And she was here
just a minute ago too.

536
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,279
It looks like right
now, I'm all you got.

537
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,976
Actually, I just need to
find your lounge area.

538
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,011
Can I help you? We
don't usually let people

539
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,351
wait in the lounge area.

540
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,856
No. No, I just need to
check my daughter's locker.

541
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,522
Um, uh, sorry. Your name?

542
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,913
Barbara Knight.
I'm Lucy's mother.

543
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,383
I don't have the combination.

544
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,985
Oh, it... It's okay.

545
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,587
The med school gave it to me.

546
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,143
All right. Good.

547
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,416
Uh-oh. Oh, it's just...

548
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,852
Thank you.

549
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,389
I've checked into
the Ritz-Carlton.

550
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,557
So I won't be needing that.

551
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,592
Mother, this is
completely unnecessary.

552
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,094
They have a lovely
view of the lake.

553
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,829
If you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

554
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,097
Oh, stop it.

555
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,999
Just being practical, dear.

556
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,468
At our ages, there's no reason
for mothers and daughters

557
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,769
to be living together.

558
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,061
You say that as if we
ever really lived together.

559
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,042
I love you, Elizabeth,

560
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,412
but I swear, at times
you can be insufferable.

561
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,580
Me? I can be insufferable?

562
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,583
What exactly do
you blame me for?

563
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,903
I don't blame you for anything.

564
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,772
Then stop acting as if you do.

565
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:37,175
So I wasn't the
conventional mother.

566
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,177
How much time did
your father offer you?

567
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,512
This isn't about Dad.

568
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:43,549
No. It's about what
I couldn't provide.

569
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:46,317
Fathers are rarely blamed
for working too much

570
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,975
whereas mothers are blamed
if they choose to work at all.

571
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:53,692
Should you get married
sometime and have a child,

572
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,344
will you give up your work?

573
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:58,313
I don't know. I don't know
if that's gonna happen.

574
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:02,405
Then I'm sorry I set you
such a terrible example.

575
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,988
Technetium?

576
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,189
Yeah.

577
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,991
Didn't show any signs
of bleeding, did it?

578
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,426
No. And why did you order a scan

579
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,928
that I said was unnecessary?

580
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,231
It's just a feeling that I
have. I don't know what it is.

581
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,133
Maybe it's a nursing
instinct or something.

582
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,467
But the guy does not look well.

583
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,669
Yeah, it's the middle of
winter. Nobody looks well.

584
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,538
And medical students
don't order tests

585
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,939
when they're told not to.

586
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,131
It's a waste of your time
and his money. Cut him loose.

587
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,148
Abby, if Benton calls
down can you get me?

588
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,651
I'm going across the street to
grab something to eat, okay?

589
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,852
I thought you weren't on.

590
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,676
No... I-I'm not.

591
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,719
Have you called the police?

592
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:54,743
What?

593
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,639
Hey, hold on, man.
I'm not done yet.

594
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,706
Call them now!

595
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,642
I'm not done yet.
Get out of my way!

596
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,344
You're not leaving!
Leave me alone!

597
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,746
Wait, now. Hold up, man.
What the hell is wrong with you?

598
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,415
Get off of me! You
just left her there!

599
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,716
I don't know anything.

600
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,918
You hit her and then
left. Malik, call Security.

601
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,620
I don't know what
you're talking about!

602
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,489
Yes, you know. I saw
you, and I can identify you!

603
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,974
It was an accident. Yeah?

604
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,809
And you just drove
off? Hit-and-run?

605
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,711
I was scared, okay?
I wa... I was scared...

606
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,313
So was that little girl!

607
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:22,980
I-I panicked, all right. I...

608
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:24,266
I had a couple of DUIs. But...

609
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,101
But I wasn't
drinking today, okay?

610
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,502
I just... It all
happened so fast.

611
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,904
I-I didn't know what to do.

612
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,689
Yeah, but you knew
enough to run away, huh?

613
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:33,224
D-did you bring her here?

614
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,409
Is she all right?

615
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,033
You don't have the right to ask.

616
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,965
All right, maybe I was
just being a hypochondriac,

617
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,533
thinking something was wrong.

618
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,168
No, you were right to come in.

619
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,604
And... And you'd be
right to come back.

620
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,908
Well, thanks. I'll,
uh, keep an eye on it.

621
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,344
I mean, say, for example,
in 15 or 20 minutes,

622
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,579
if you're feeling feverish
or sick to your stomach,

623
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,081
you might want to
get that checked out.

624
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,650
Yeah, but you just saw me.

625
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,885
Um, well, it might not
be me who sees you,

626
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,354
but somebody
would have to see you

627
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,573
and I'm sure they'd want
to examine you thoroughly.

628
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,530
Are you saying I'm not okay?

629
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,885
I'm just saying that it's been
an awfully bad flu season.

630
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,684
You wanna take a break?

631
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,685
No, I'm okay.

632
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,953
That's enough for today.

633
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,455
Well, that's...
Hang on a second.

634
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,990
You did great.
I'll get the chair...

635
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,458
I said I can do it!

636
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,482
I just wanna get
back to my room.

637
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,623
Dr. Carter?

638
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,046
What are you doing here?

639
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,382
Andrea, I need to talk to
you. You narked us out!

640
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,183
Get away! You
promised, you bitch!

641
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,485
Look, you need to come back in.

642
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,687
You said there were
rules you couldn't break.

643
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,189
I know what I said, but I can't.

644
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,423
You lied to me.

645
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,774
To both of us.

646
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,676
Look, it is a lot more
complicated than that.

647
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,279
Your health is in danger.
Other girls could get infected too.

648
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:36,543
Now everyone's
gonna know everything.

649
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:39,806
Andrea? Andrea!

650
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:49,182
So, uh, we'll have to reschedule
the bowel resection for 4:30.

651
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:51,913
Yup.

652
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:56,434
Hello. Sorry. I didn't
mean to surprise you.

653
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,386
Certainly not twice in one day.

654
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,422
You're here for
your appointment?

655
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,956
I think it's on the fifth floor.

656
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,257
I've already been.

657
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,344
Got poked and prodded
and x-rayed out the wazoo.

658
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:08,046
Damn doctors. No offense.

659
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,480
None taken.

660
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:12,650
And I'm sorry if my presence
offended you this morning.

661
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:17,355
Oh, I was just, uh... Well,
you said it. Surprised.

662
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,857
Well, I didn't mean
to make trouble

663
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,325
between you and your mother.

664
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:22,660
Oh, no. None that
wasn't there already.

665
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,295
Excuse me. And why is that?

666
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,797
I mean, why is there trouble?

667
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:28,599
Mothers and
daughters, I suppose.

668
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,802
Oh, well, you... You don't get to
own the whole ranch on that one.

669
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:35,590
Let's save a little corner
for fathers and sons.

670
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,859
Although I will admit mothers
and daughters are worse.

671
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,101
Ha. But that's just
a woman thing.

672
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,448
You know, the only
problem with children

673
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,686
is they grow up to be adults.

674
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,105
Yes, we do eventually
have opinions of our own.

675
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,612
I know. But do you
have to express them?

676
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:56,494
It's a learned response.

677
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:58,947
I'll give you that.

678
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,916
I suggest that the four
of us go out tonight.

679
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,641
You know, sort of,
bury the hatchet.

680
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:08,472
Mark thinks it's a great idea.

681
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,512
He doesn't.

682
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,160
He will.

683
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:16,781
Abby didn't discharge him?

684
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:19,784
He bounced back with
fever and abdominal pain.

685
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,385
BP's fallen 80/60.

686
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:22,787
Hang a unit on
the rapid infuser.

687
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:24,155
What happened?

688
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,457
GI bleed. I began a
rectal. He started gushing.

689
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,658
Probably a bleeding tic.

690
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,477
Type and cross four
units and call the O.R.

691
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,347
Yup, I already did. I'm in.

692
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,731
Okay, hook him up.

693
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,239
Thank God he came back in.

694
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:42,506
Chicago wasn't
even her first choice.

695
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,343
She was hoping for
something in San Francisco.

696
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,912
I took her when she was about 8.

697
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:51,883
One ride on a cable
car and it was her city.

698
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:53,974
Uh, although she
grew to love this one.

699
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,190
You don't need to hear all this.

700
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,293
No, it's fine.

701
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:04,429
I really just wanted to
stop by and thank you.

702
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,181
Lucy always talked
about you when she called.

703
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,019
About how she was first assigned
to you and... And everything.

704
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,854
She had a lot of
respect for you.

705
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,941
And I know that you
must have taught her a lot.

706
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:21,529
Well, she worked with all
the residents. Not just me.

707
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,997
I know.

708
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,821
But you're the one
she used to mention.

709
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:32,445
But she... She loved her work.

710
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:40,286
She was better than I
ever gave her credit for.

711
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,012
Um, can I ask you something?

712
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:51,749
Yes.

713
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,381
When you were...

714
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:58,566
Well, when that man stabbed you,

715
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,985
what did you think?

716
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:05,445
No... I mean,
what did it feel like?

717
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,118
Well, um...

718
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,136
It happened really fast,

719
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,772
and I didn't really know
what was going on.

720
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,930
But I didn't feel a thing.

721
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,434
No pain?

722
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:30,215
Mm-mm.

723
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,822
No pain.

724
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,552
Hey, Steve, did you
get that venogram?

725
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,187
I ordered it two hours ago.

726
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,156
I had a CT-guided biopsy.

727
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,125
You gonna be able to get it?

728
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,660
After my embolization.

729
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,928
So does that mean
sometime tomorrow afternoon?

730
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,630
With that attitude.

731
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,383
Hey, did you read a chest
CT on a David Greene today?

732
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:06,484
Who?

733
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,553
My father. He
came in for a scan.

734
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:10,422
I don't know. Check the pile.

735
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,323
That's a big stack.

736
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,558
Well, while you're at it,

737
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:15,993
maybe you can help me
out and read a few plain films.

738
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,563
Oh, yeah, or maybe you could
just work a few more hours.

739
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:20,014
Don't start.

740
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,883
ER guys come in

741
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,417
and want wet reads yesterday.

742
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,952
Here we go.

743
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,353
ICU orders portables

744
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,023
for every damn
feeding-tube placement.

745
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,359
You guys think you have
high volume in the ER?

746
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,383
I get high volume
from the hospital.

747
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,326
Hey, Mark? You okay?

748
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:49,682
That's your dad?

749
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:52,551
Yeah.

750
00:32:55,523 --> 00:32:58,491
Wow. Uh, I'm sorry.

751
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,627
So he didn't tell you
where we're going?

752
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,895
Just an address.

753
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,081
It's the "wear jeans"
part that's scaring me.

754
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,550
Not to mention I don't think
my mother owns a pair of jeans.

755
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,052
And I don't know
if I want to see her.

756
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,419
Right.

757
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:17,521
I wish you were off so we
could face them together.

758
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:18,556
Yeah.

759
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,691
Are you all right, Mark?

760
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:20,992
What?

761
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:23,260
You've limited yourself
to one-word responses.

762
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:25,697
Uh, you know,
I'm sorry. I just...

763
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:26,898
I gotta finish some cases.

764
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,349
I'm gonna have
to meet you there.

765
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,616
All right.

766
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,907
I'll see you.

767
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,721
What did the school say?

768
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,389
Oh, they said
they'd follow through,

769
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,858
but the girls saw me there.

770
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,826
I suppose they didn't
listen to you this time.

771
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,395
No, they ran away.

772
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,297
Carol, you did the right thing.

773
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,733
I'm still gonna
call Andrea later.

774
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,118
Abby.

775
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:50,722
Your, uh, hemorrhoid
patient, Mr. Perth, is in the O.R.

776
00:33:50,746 --> 00:33:51,990
They're doing a laparotomy.

777
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:54,025
Yeah, I heard he went
up. Is he gonna be okay?

778
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:57,895
Yeah, he should. He... He's
got a bleeding diverticulum.

779
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,749
You know, it's pretty lucky
that he checked himself back in.

780
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,984
Yeah.

781
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,353
I'm gonna go check on him later.

782
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,021
Good.

783
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,525
You were right. There was
something else wrong with him.

784
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,143
Just a gut feeling.

785
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,411
Hmm. I mean, he
could have bled to death

786
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:15,715
if he hadn't come back.

787
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:20,089
Well, it's a good
thing that he felt fluish.

788
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,810
That's exactly what
he said: "fluish."

789
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,414
Mrs. Williams,

790
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,505
Laura came out of
surgery very well.

791
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:41,705
The nurse will take you
now to see her, if you'd like.

792
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:42,729
Yes.

793
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,044
Thank you.

794
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,334
Both of you.

795
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,786
I was, uh, out of
line before. I'm sorry.

796
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,854
Ah, come on. I understand.

797
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:58,355
Did you repair her hepatic vein?

798
00:34:58,379 --> 00:34:59,857
Atrial-caval shunt.

799
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:02,660
It'll be a long recovery,
but she should be fine.

800
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,695
You saved her life.

801
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,362
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

802
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:08,733
You had to open her chest
in the ER to fix my mistake.

803
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:10,735
Yeah, but we would have
had to do that anyway.

804
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:13,037
The liver laceration was
a life-threatening injury.

805
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:14,706
Look, if you waited
for the ambulance,

806
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,873
she might not have made it.

807
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,742
It's impossible to know.

808
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,143
Listen to me.

809
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:22,368
You made a call.
It took a lot of guts.

810
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:31,288
What do we got?

811
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:33,391
Andrea Parks. Found
down on bathroom floor.

812
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,192
Presumed overdose.
No suicide note,

813
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,145
but a lot of bottles
in the cabinet.

814
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,514
Any narcotics?

815
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,115
No. She's lethargic,
but arousable.

816
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,316
Andrea.

817
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,952
When did she take the pills?

818
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,653
An hour or two ago.
Her friend found her.

819
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,021
Well, where is she? On the way.

820
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,207
What drugs did you
take? Leave me alone!

821
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,242
Polydrug ingestion.
What'd you take?

822
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:53,077
Shut up! MALUCCI: You know her?

823
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,996
She came in this
morning. Cervical cancer.

824
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,598
CBC, chem panel, blood
and urine tox screen.

825
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,234
On my count. One, two, three.

826
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,720
We're gonna have to pump
her stomach. I'll get an Ewald.

827
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,555
She may not need
lavage. Pill bottles?

828
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,223
Yeah, I had 'em
in a bag. They fell...

829
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,125
Well, go and find 'em.
We're gonna need them.

830
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,595
Maybe you should step out.
Did you send an aspirin level?

831
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,563
You running this?
Pulse ox is 96 on 2 liters.

832
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,321
I'll run an EKG. It
could be tricyclics.

833
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:20,471
So tonight's the jazz club.

834
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:22,339
Yeah, it's a pretty good spot.

835
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,141
A good group is
playing. Cleo knows it too.

836
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:26,243
Uh-huh. Heh.

837
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,578
What's that supposed to mean?

838
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,713
Nothing.

839
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:30,615
You're right on schedule.

840
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,249
All right, Carter.
Give it to me.

841
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,920
Well, first, there was
probably coffee in the cafeteria.

842
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,756
And then dinner in a
nice but well-lit restaurant.

843
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,124
Nothing too obvious.

844
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:43,678
Then, maybe a sporting event.
And tonight's the jazz club.

845
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,347
We all know what
happens after the jazz club.

846
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,832
When did you lose the filter
between your brain and mouth?

847
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:51,218
I think you might have taken
it out in the O.R. last week.

848
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,553
Yeah. Ah-ha.

849
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,737
Here. Let me help
you. I got it! I got it!

850
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,323
Damn it!

851
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,792
Carter. Carter. Carter.

852
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,784
Carter. Carter. Carter.
It's all right. It's all right.

853
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,587
You okay?

854
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,200
I lied to Lucy's mother today.

855
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,835
I told her that
it wasn't painful

856
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,293
to have an 8-inch knife
shoved into your gut.

857
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:20,698
Andrea! Andrea!
She's tachy at 120.

858
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:22,466
Terri, hold on. Do you
know what she took?

859
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,968
No, she was just
lying on the floor.

860
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,936
Was it something from
your medicine cabinet?

861
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,339
It was my parents' bathroom.
Do you know what was there?

862
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:31,476
I don't know. Uh, lots of
stuff. Uh, Tylenol, aspirin...

863
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,261
Any prescription medications?

864
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,229
My dad sometimes
takes pills for his back.

865
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,265
Do you know what they're called?

866
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,650
Diaz... Diaz... Diazepam?

867
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,569
Yeah. Sats down to 81.

868
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,871
She's barely responsive.
Okay, lost her gag reflex.

869
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,857
Let's intubate. Not yet.
I can bag her, okay?

870
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:47,608
She could vomit and aspirate.

871
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,460
Were there any
antidepressants? No.

872
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,945
Are you sure? Yeah.

873
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,596
Okay, any history
of seizures? No.

874
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,283
Push flumazenil, 0.2 milligrams.

875
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,085
She's hypoxic.
Intubate. Slow down.

876
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,536
Give the flumazenil a chance.

877
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,640
We have to protect her airway.

878
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,758
All right, good. It worked.

879
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,742
What...? What...?
What am I doing here?

880
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:09,428
Terri found you.

881
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,467
Do you remember
taking the pills?

882
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:13,835
What?

883
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,303
You're gonna be okay, Andrea.

884
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,705
Oh, God, Andrea.
What did you do?

885
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,980
Let's give her charcoal now.

886
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,983
Oh.

887
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,518
Oh.

888
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,488
Well... It's an
interesting game.

889
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,222
Don't worry, you'll get it.

890
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,725
A martini would help.
Do they have those here?

891
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,227
Well, that should do the
trick. Loosen you up a bit.

892
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,395
Do you want anything?

893
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,830
No, thanks.

894
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,131
What's keeping Mark, anyway?

895
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,367
He'll be here. I hope.

896
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,002
Do you know how to keep score?

897
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,303
Not a clue.

898
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,205
But you're learning
these American games?

899
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,559
One by one. At least I'm trying.

900
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,050
I think that's rather
adventurous of you.

901
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,718
That meeting I was
running off to earlier...

902
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:05,386
I missed it.

903
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,087
Must be the first
time that's happened.

904
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,823
Yes, I think it was.

905
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,925
I was appalled at myself.
Just couldn't be bothered to go.

906
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,911
Went and sat by
the lake instead.

907
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,197
I bet that was freezing.

908
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,666
The only thing colder
than sitting by that lake

909
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,340
was the conversation
we had this afternoon.

910
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:28,531
Elizabeth, I know I'm not the
mother you wish you'd had.

911
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,247
That's not exactly true.

912
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:36,884
And I keep hoping that
somehow you'll forgive me for that.

913
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,542
The problem is you
never wanted forgiveness.

914
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,746
There's the rub. Heh.

915
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,960
Mark's father thinks children

916
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,829
shouldn't express
their opinions.

917
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,598
Yes?

918
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,488
Well, he's absolutely right.

919
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,190
I'll take over, Conni.

920
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:01,514
Sure, thanks.

921
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,795
How are you doing?

922
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,018
Okay.

923
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,485
Andrea, I had to tell the school

924
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,554
so the other students
could get tested.

925
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,158
But I haven't told
your parents. Or Terri's.

926
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,259
You haven't?

927
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,816
I was hoping you would.

928
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:27,184
If something happened
to one of them,

929
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,488
wouldn't you want to know?

930
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,217
Ow! Oh, God.

931
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,285
Now, that was ugly. Do
I get penalized for that?

932
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,921
Oh, there's just
a little dent there.

933
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,174
- What do you mean?
- We can switch lanes.

934
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,409
There's no dent. I'm
kidding. Hey, hey, Mark.

935
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,011
Hey. Hey, what kept you?

936
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,597
Ah, nothing. It was
just... Hi, Isabelle.

937
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,099
Sit down. Have a drink.

938
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,367
I think my ball's stuck.
That's 'cause you broke it.

939
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,502
Oh, stop it!

940
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:02,703
Press the button.

941
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,371
We'll work you in on
the next one, Mark.

942
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,973
No problem. But
there's not gonna be

943
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,041
the boys against the
girls. It wouldn't be fair.

944
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,312
Neither one of 'em
is any good at all.

945
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,481
And by the way, I'll
be back on the sofa.

946
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,616
Isabelle's going back
to Elizabeth's tonight.

947
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,285
It's sort of a
mother-daughter fest.

948
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,587
Sure. Grab a ball.

949
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,088
All right.

950
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,790
Oh, no, no. Eliz... Elizabeth,
you're too far to the right.

951
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,459
Yeah, but last
time it fell to the left.

952
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,261
You see those marks
on the floor out there?

953
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,412
The arrows? Yeah.

954
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:31,581
Aim to the one just
on the right of center.

955
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:34,552
And pull your... Pull the
ball all the way back. And...

956
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:38,255
And don't drop it. I mean,
just let it roll on the floor.

957
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:39,723
And keep your wrists straight.

958
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,658
That's an awful lot to remember.

959
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,311
Here, let me... Let me show you.

960
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,145
I never knew he
was a surgical intern.

961
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,415
Yeah. Well, no, he was
good. He was smart, you know?

962
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,783
He wasn't really cut out for it.

963
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,151
Used to spend all of his
time talking to the patients.

964
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,286
It used to drive me crazy.

965
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,371
Morgenstern...
You don't know him,

966
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:57,073
but, uh, one time he made Carter
hold a retractor for four hours.

967
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,110
Carter never broke a
sweat, never dropped it.

968
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:02,513
He's gonna be all right, Peter.

969
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:03,514
Yeah, I know.

970
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:04,738
Tickets.

971
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,584
You sure you wanna go in there?

972
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,585
Oh, yeah.

973
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,254
We're not gonna be able to talk.

974
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,012
Let's go get some
coffee. Come on.

975
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:18,829
You're gonna disappoint Carter.

976
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:20,263
What?

977
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,264
Nothing.

978
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,999
What? Nothing.

979
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:24,690
What? Nothing.

980
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:38,649
That was fun tonight.

981
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:41,640
Uh, yeah, it was.

982
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:45,878
Dad, I need to talk to
you about something.

983
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:47,980
Sure.

984
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:53,380
I saw your scan today,

985
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,439
and you have lung cancer
which has spread to your liver.

986
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:01,894
Yeah.

987
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:09,134
That's what the doctors
in San Diego said too.

988
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,739
How long have you known?

989
00:43:15,376 --> 00:43:16,826
For a while.

990
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:22,846
Why didn't you tell me?

991
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,004
You remember old
Rear Admiral Norris?

992
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,319
Yeah, how could I...?
How could I forget him?

993
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,653
He was missing a thumb.

994
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,037
He used to scared
me to death as a kid.

995
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,847
He had cancer.

996
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:44,131
Every time I laid eyes on
him, all I could think was:

997
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:47,423
"Poor old bastard,
he's got cancer."

998
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,460
Hell, he lived another 12 years.

999
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,063
But still, every
time I saw him...

1000
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,403
I didn't want it to
define me, Mark.

1001
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,369
I didn't wanna see
it in people's eyes.

1002
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,693
I didn't want to see it at all.

1003
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:12,331
And...

1004
00:44:15,603 --> 00:44:16,802
I'm scared.
