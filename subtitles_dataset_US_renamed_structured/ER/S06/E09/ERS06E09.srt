Patient gave it to

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,505
Pretty. Yeah.

56
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,462
Lucy. Got a good case here.

57
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:22,194
Valerie Page, 24,
dilated cardiomyopathy

58
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:24,831
recent progression of symptoms.

59
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:27,033
Palpitations.
Difficulty breathing.

60
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,401
Cardiologist changed her
medication two days ago.

61
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,804
Throwing PVCs, six
to nine per minute.

62
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,889
And lift. Gently.

63
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,058
I'm on the heart
transplant list.

64
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,625
Okay, how shall we proceed?

65
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,178
Call Transplant Services.

66
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,646
One-oh-five.

67
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,447
Lucy, multifocal PVCs.
What should we do?

68
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,065
Get the vitals.

69
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,235
BP's 95/60. Heart rate's 110.

70
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,836
BP's stable. She's
not hypotensive.

71
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,022
So treat with
lidocaine? Right. Do it.

72
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,790
- She's in V-tach!
- Get the paddles!

73
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,009
No, no, no, no.
Check the vitals again.

74
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,378
BP's 95/60. Heart rate's 160.

75
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,947
Lucy? I don't know.

76
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,716
75 of lidocaine. Two mg drip.

77
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,118
With normal mentation,

78
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,120
and vital signs,
lidocaine is still

79
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,554
your first line of treatment.

80
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,789
It's not a good idea to

81
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,841
shock a patient
who's wide awake.

82
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:10,009
She's back to normal signs.

83
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,094
You feeling better?

84
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,118
Yeah.

85
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,031
I wasn't planning
on this for Christmas.

86
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,333
We'll alter your medications,

87
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,586
and maybe get you home in
time to open presents, okay?

88
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,090
Lucy?

89
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,724
Lily, draw the cardiac
labs. Chuny, order an echo.

90
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:26,726
Call me back with the results.
- Okay.

91
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,862
You do not know
enough about this case

92
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,313
to make those kind of promises.

93
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,531
Her meds were off, right?

94
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,533
Truth is, that young
lady will be lucky

95
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,877
if she makes it
through the night.

96
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:37,871
I didn't realize.

97
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,472
As a fourth year,
you've accumulated

98
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:40,673
a lot of medical knowledge.

99
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,941
Now you have to apply it.

100
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,076
Go back in there

101
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,994
and get a thorough
history, and find out

102
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,378
what you can do
for your patient.

103
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,903
Hey. What's wrong?

104
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,271
Nothing.

105
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,239
Thanks for covering
the transplant service.

106
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,575
Ah. Happy to.

107
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,777
When it means I spend
Christmas morning with Reece.

108
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,179
Well, at least someone
will be enjoying the holiday.

109
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,547
What about you? No plans?

110
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,351
Just work. Mark's in San
Diego helping his father move.

111
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,120
But with Romano
scarce till the millennium,

112
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,689
it seems like a
holiday, doesn't it?

113
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,990
Yeah, you're right. It does.

114
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,626
Dr. Corday, Detective
Cruson is on the phone for you.

115
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,496
I've got a consult in the ER.
Call me when that appy's ready.

116
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,785
Mm-hm.

117
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,589
Hello, this is Corday.

118
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,127
Yes. Yes, I just
saw Mr. Rollins.

119
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,209
I see.

120
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,511
I discharged the
otitis in Exam 3.

121
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,213
One down, 30 to go.

122
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,005
Whoa... Gee. These
lights are a fire hazard.

123
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,454
Is it always this busy
on Christmas Eve?

124
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,824
Like the malls the
day after Thanksgiving.

125
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,092
I need a break, Dr. Weaver.

126
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,326
We all need a break, Amira...

127
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,461
It's Ramadan. I gotta pray.

128
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,786
Okay. Yosh, cover
for her, please.

129
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,068
What's in your bag, Santa?

130
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,570
Secret Santa gifts,
if you've been good.

131
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,339
Hey, have I gotten yours yet?

132
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,641
It's in my suitcase. I'll
give it to you before I leave.

133
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,642
All right.

134
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,044
Oh. Thanks for organizing this.

135
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,079
Anything to help make
working Christmas Eve

136
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,680
a little less painful.

137
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,349
Did I mention I
wanted a Gameboy?

138
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,684
Yes!

139
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,919
You know, Dr. Weaver,

140
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,055
it's not too late to get
in on this gift exchange.

141
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,456
You know what, John, actually,

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,024
there's nothing
that I really need.

143
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,693
Excuse me.

144
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,518
Yes. Uh, gentlemen,
how can I help you?

145
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,234
Oh, no.

146
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,602
Oh.

147
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,026
Now you need some scrubs.

148
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,106
The cardiomyopathy was diagnosed

149
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,273
three years ago,

150
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,943
right after she got the
flu on her 21st birthday.

151
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,277
Some birthday present.

152
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,030
There's dilation
of all chambers,

153
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,032
and an LV ejection
fraction of 10 percent.

154
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,867
Her previous ejection
fraction was 20.

155
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,235
Doesn't that meet the criteria

156
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,703
to upgrade her for transplant?

157
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,872
I'll call UNOS and tell them
to move her status to level one.

158
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,141
Dr. Benton, they're
ready for you in the O.R.

159
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,910
All right. Tell 'em
I'll be right there.

160
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,178
Go over everything with her.

161
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,762
Call Cardiology. See if
they have a bed, okay?

162
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,884
Level one?

163
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,219
That means I'm a shoo-in, right?

164
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:08,421
Well, there's no guarantee

165
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:10,139
when a new heart
will become available.

166
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,363
A girl can dream.

167
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,532
You know... I almost
went to med school.

168
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:21,067
What changed your mind?

169
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:23,286
Hospitals smell.

170
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,321
I hear you.

171
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,925
I opted for a master's
in fine arts instead.

172
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,627
I'm supposed to
graduate in June.

173
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,851
Really? Me too.

174
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,788
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

175
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:43,640
If you don't get a
new heart... yeah.

176
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,314
We went to Marty's
for some eggnog,

177
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,881
and I haven't
stopped puking since.

178
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,451
Hasn't anyone ever warned you
about the hazards of raw eggs?

179
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,219
At least we got to
finish our deliveries.

180
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,421
You guys work for a charity?

181
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,088
No. Just a bunch of
Wall Street sharks.

182
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,557
Lawyers, stock traders.

183
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,526
We take gifts to homeless
shelters every year

184
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,627
to keep us human.

185
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,094
Oh, yeah. We could
use a Mrs. Claus

186
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,330
to round out the group.

187
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,298
Well, I could use a glass
of wine and a hot bath.

188
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,600
Dr. Weaver as Mrs. Claus?

189
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,837
Hold it, Carter.

190
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,740
Compazine rectal
suppositories for all the Santas.

191
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,309
And rehydrate until
symptoms subside.

192
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,928
Bah humbug.

193
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:24,596
If you don't mind me
saying, you look like hell.

194
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,799
Yup. I'm midway
through a double shift.

195
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,301
Drew the short end of the stick?

196
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,769
No, I volunteered. I
figured I'd let people

197
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,074
spend some time
with their families.

198
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,397
Chad?

199
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,229
Chad, wha...? Wha...? Chad.

200
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,230
Get off of me.

201
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,398
Take it easy. Hey, Chad.

202
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,465
Chad, it's Dr. Finch.

203
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,167
We're going to help
you. What happened?

204
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,169
He took a nasty
header down the stairs.

205
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,239
Whoa, watch... Watch
his neck. Watch his neck.

206
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,609
I think he got his foot
caught in the banister.

207
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,044
Did he ever lose consciousness?

208
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,513
Uh, I-I don't know. Maybe.
He's pretty messed up.

209
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,648
On what? On what?

210
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,716
I gotta go. Wait!

211
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,801
Hang in there, dude.

212
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,024
No, Tony!

213
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,840
Chad, do you have any neck pain?

214
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,641
Does your neck hurt?

215
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,310
I'm fine. I'm fine.

216
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,414
Get a C-spine just in case.

217
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:18,851
Pupils equal...
reactive to light.

218
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,353
No midline tenderness.

219
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,855
BP's 140/90. Pulse 68.

220
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,524
Talus shifted
laterally and rotated.

221
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:27,710
I need to reduce the deformity.

222
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,428
Okay, I need right-ankle films

223
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,663
and a non-contrast
CT to rule out a bleed.

224
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,466
Also, get a B.A.L.
and tox screen.

225
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,617
I got it.

226
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,285
And call the mom.
Name's Kottmeier.

227
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,004
Phone number should
be in the old chart.

228
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:40,206
You're hurting me.
Stop hurting me.

229
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,291
It's okay, Chad.
You're gonna be okay.

230
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,461
Ouch.

231
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,830
That is a very
delicate injury, indeed.

232
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,832
We were at the mall
waiting on line to see Santa,

233
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,400
and Tommy really had to go.

234
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,503
I always tell him look
down before you zip up...

235
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,638
but he was in a hurry.
I want to see Santa.

236
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,941
I'm afraid that we're
gonna have to cut it off.

237
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,193
What?

238
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:02,200
The zipper. I meant the zipper.

239
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,713
I'll get the IND train.

240
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,567
I wanna go back to
the mall! Okay, Tommy.

241
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,368
I have to clean the area first.

242
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:10,959
This may sting a little bit.

243
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:12,822
Ow! Whoa.

244
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,029
Hold onto him. Tight.

245
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,550
All right. Pickup and Metz.

246
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,165
Go away!

247
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,366
I can't watch.

248
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,517
Okay, Tommy,
this is gonna pinch.

249
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,636
Ouch!

250
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,437
Ow! Ow!

251
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,422
All done.

252
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:30,623
All done.

253
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:31,924
I-is he gonna be, you know,

254
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:33,292
okay down there?

255
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:36,229
Yeah, once the injury heals,
he's gonna be as good as new.

256
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:37,401
Okay. Tommy, it's all over.

257
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,399
So brave.

258
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,101
Excuse me, Dr. Benton?

259
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,468
I'm in the middle of an appy.

260
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:45,771
I can see that. But I've
been doing some research

261
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,439
on Valerie Page's condition.

262
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:48,640
Watch the sterile field.

263
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:50,509
And I ran across some articles

264
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,912
on an LVAD: Left
Ventricular Assist Device.

265
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,179
Sponge stick. What about it?

266
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,282
An implanted device could
keep the blood pumping

267
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,367
through her body until
she can get a transplant.

268
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,502
Hm. Not an option.

269
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,536
Why not?

270
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,787
No device.

271
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:03,405
County isn't using
that yet. Driver.

272
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,540
But we're about to.

273
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,442
A clinical trial starts
as of January 1st.

274
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,827
Yeah, but that's one week away.

275
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,796
I doubt that her heart
will hold out that long.

276
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,013
We can transfer her to Rush.

277
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,315
Their program's
already up and running.

278
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,051
Okay, try and arrange
it. Let me know.

279
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,686
Thanks, Dr. Benton.

280
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,788
Hey, doc. Taking me on a trip?

281
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,857
You could say that.

282
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,775
What's he doing here?

283
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,910
You're being transferred
to the jail ward.

284
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,712
This is a joke, right?

285
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,581
What, are you...? You're
getting back at me?

286
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,483
It's no joke. The police
have found evidence

287
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:31,850
linking you to another murder.

288
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,886
Wait a minute. Look, stop.

289
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,904
I said stop!

290
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,038
Put him in restraints!

291
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,039
Bitch! Look...

292
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,107
Uh! You cannot do this to me!

293
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,293
Oh, yes, I can!

294
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,461
Screw you.

295
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,862
S... Ow. Ow.

296
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,730
Okay. Spare me the theatrics.

297
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, my leg. My
leg, it's cramped.

298
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:49,868
Yeah, and I'm the
queen of England. Ow!

299
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,237
Goodbye, Mr. Rollins.
Oh. Damn it, it hurts!

300
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,238
Dr. Corday, wait.

301
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:55,341
His right leg is a little dusky.

302
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:58,810
Oh, God. It's like somebody's
jabbing me with needles.

303
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,012
How long have you had this?

304
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,746
It just started.

305
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,017
Can't feel a pedal pulse.

306
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,319
There's no popliteal
pulse either.

307
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:08,520
Want to get an angiogram?

308
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:09,754
I suppose so.

309
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,440
Would you hurry
up? It's killing me.

310
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,364
Oh, shut up!

311
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,449
Excuse me.

312
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,918
Fill out a form, take a seat.

313
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,420
Actually, I work
here. I'm Carol.

314
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,556
Ooh. It's about time you
brought those little bundles of joy

315
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,991
around for a visit.

316
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,309
Hi, Haleh.

317
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,195
It's Auntie Haleh. Yes, it is.

318
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,862
I'm... I'm actually
not visiting.

319
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,831
Look at them. Carol,
they're adorable.

320
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,200
You know... Oh, and look at you.

321
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,468
You're almost back to your...

322
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,503
Hold it. Guys.

323
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,770
Kate's not feeling well,

324
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,372
and I just wanna
have her checked out.

325
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,540
Is there an Attending free?

326
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,708
Let's find out.

327
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,445
We'll take good care
of her. Don't worry.

328
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,914
I-I... I'm not worried. LUCY:
It's the season of giving.

329
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,916
But she may not make
it through the night.

330
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,485
Yeah. Me too.

331
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,487
Rush turned you down?

332
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,590
They can't take her
until tomorrow morning.

333
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,024
No cardiac beds.

334
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,759
Christmas morning. Bummer.

335
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,829
Chuny, wait. Is it possible
to get surgical equipment

336
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,464
transferred from
other hospitals?

337
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,600
Sure. We do it between
ERs all the time.

338
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,867
What do you have to do?

339
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,859
Well, get a transfer form
and a doctor's signature.

340
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,706
The mall's closed now.

341
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,941
It's not fair!

342
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,577
One more pin should do it.

343
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,329
Ho, ho, ho!

344
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,464
Merry Christmas!

345
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:26,649
Santa!

346
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,552
Ugh. Oh. Careful down
there, little Tommy.

347
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,886
Come on up here.

348
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,622
Santa's so sorry that he
missed you at the mall.

349
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,458
But he hears that you've
been a very good boy.

350
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,360
You're not Santa. Oh.

351
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,062
Sure he is, sweetheart.

352
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:43,165
The Santa at the mall
was fat and wore glasses.

353
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,067
This is Santa's younger brother.

354
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,501
Go away! Tommy, stop it.

355
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,322
Well, Santa's got a toy
in here for you, Tommy.

356
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,190
It's... Oh-ho!

357
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:53,158
I want the real Santa!
The one at the mall.

358
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:57,295
Okay, Tommy!
Santa's gotta go now.

359
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,734
But he wants to wish you
a very merry Christmas!

360
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,301
Uh. What do we got?

361
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,670
Yo, Santa.

362
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:06,505
Carter, Taylor Sparks, 15.

363
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,373
GSW to the left shoulder
during a drive-by.

364
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:11,243
Vitals stable, BP's
140/90, pulse 100.

365
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,145
Hey, dog, get that
stuff out of my face.

366
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,279
Abdomen's benign.

367
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,981
You remember how
many shots were fired?

368
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,583
Punk-ass Lohman
emptied a clip at me.

369
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,784
All right, let's roll him.

370
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:20,519
See if there are
any other entry sites.

371
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:21,909
Trauma panel.

372
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,056
Chest and left shoulder.

373
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,025
Back looks clear.

374
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,826
Whoa!

375
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,227
Ho, ho, ho.

376
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,328
Malik?

377
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,230
Not exactly the
present I had in mind.

378
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:33,298
Hey, fool, that's mine.

379
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,400
All right. Order
a Doppler study.

380
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:37,736
If the vessels are intact,
we'll leave the bullet in.

381
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,938
Hey, give me back my piece.

382
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,639
Whatever happened
to "peace on earth,

383
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:41,907
goodwill towards men, "huh?

384
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,464
You tell us, Santa.

385
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,328
Hey.

386
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,896
You're being a
very, very good girl.

387
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,365
Temperature's 100.1.

388
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,467
It was 99.8 when
I took it earlier.

389
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,168
Mm. When was that?

390
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,536
Two and a half hours ago.

391
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,305
You wouldn't believe
how long it takes us

392
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,639
to get us out of the house.

393
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,807
She could be a little warm

394
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,009
from being all bundled up.

395
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,761
You think I'm
being crazy, right?

396
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,646
No. It's good you
brought her in.

397
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,080
I... I'm sure it's nothing.

398
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,582
But, uh, a fever
in a four-week-old

399
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,768
can be cause for concern.

400
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,269
Exactly. I mean,
it's like I know

401
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,937
all the things that
can go wrong, so...

402
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,274
Uh, if you'd like, uh, we
can do a septic work-up.

403
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,441
Is that necessary?

404
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,160
Probably not. But, uh...

405
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,262
you are the one who
needs to make that decision

406
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,402
for her own peace of mind.

407
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,984
Well, as a nurse I would say no.

408
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,551
And as a mother?

409
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,054
Um. Just wanna make
sure everything's okay.

410
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,924
How about we get
a urine and CBC,

411
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:35,177
but hold off on an LP till
we get the labs back, huh?

412
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,845
I can live with that.

413
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,398
I want you to draw her blood.
You're the best stick in the ER.

414
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:40,966
I'll be nice and gentle.

415
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,589
Okay.

416
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,421
How're you feeling?

417
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,589
My mom here?

418
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,091
Not yet.

419
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,625
Chad, is your father around?

420
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,228
Sure. Saw him yesterday.

421
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,530
Christmas photo of
him and his new family

422
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,400
vacationing in Florida.

423
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,486
I'd like to call him. Let
him know what's going on.

424
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,287
He doesn't care.

425
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,879
Me and Mom are better
off without him, anyways.

426
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,181
When can I go home?

427
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:10,463
We're still waiting
on some test results.

428
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:11,914
Come on. It's Christmas.

429
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,838
Cleo?

430
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,961
Oh, Dr. Finch. How is he?

431
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,498
Chad has a fractured
dislocation of the right ankle.

432
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,435
And we're waiting on a CT
to rule out any head trauma.

433
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,670
Oh, my God.

434
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,138
I-I don't know
how this happened.

435
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,140
I thought he was upstairs
playing video games.

436
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,374
You were home?

437
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,861
I had some people over.
A small holiday party.

438
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:43,529
Did you hear Chad fall?

439
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:47,132
There was music
playing, people talking.

440
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:48,567
Mrs. Kottmeier, your son

441
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,991
has a blood
alcohol level of 0.26.

442
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,521
Were you aware he was drinking?

443
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,545
No.

444
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:57,943
All right, I... I let
him have a beer.

445
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,177
One beer, that's it.

446
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,013
It's Christmas Eve,
he's on vacation.

447
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,465
He's had more than one beer.

448
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,266
Well, maybe he took
something from the bar

449
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,352
when I wasn't looking.

450
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:07,886
I get it.

451
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,054
You think this is my fault.

452
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:10,706
No, I'm not trying
to place blame...

453
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,891
No, you're right.

454
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,592
I... I should've known
what was going on.

455
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,010
I mean, what kind
of a mother am I?

456
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,134
Why don't you go in to see him?

457
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,424
All right, what do we got?

458
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,676
Howard Waller, 71, MVA,
on his way to midnight mass.

459
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,261
I hit Mary. BENTON: Mary?

460
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,763
As in the Virgin Mother.

461
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:53,398
He lost control of his car,
accelerated into a nativity.

462
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,800
I think I passed out.

463
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,601
Complaining of back
and abdominal pain,

464
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,602
slightly hypotensive.

465
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,404
BP is 100/60, pulse 90.

466
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:00,873
Alert and oriented at the scene.

467
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:02,007
Okay, people. Here we go.

468
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,441
Nice and easy. On my count.

469
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,944
One, two, three.

470
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,946
Trauma panel, C-spine.

471
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,581
Chest films. Spin a crit.

472
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:10,649
Uh, okay, Mr. Waller,

473
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,417
can you tell me exactly
where the pain is?

474
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:13,652
It's... It's around my belt.

475
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,821
I only wear this
suit once a year.

476
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,555
It doesn't fit me anymore.

477
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:18,891
Pulse ox is 95.

478
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,960
Let's get an ultrasound in here.

479
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,494
Find something? Yeah.

480
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,312
Ten centimeter pulsatile mass

481
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,965
on the left side below the ribs.

482
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:26,966
Could be an aneurysm.

483
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,601
Mr. Waller.

484
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,936
There's a good chance
you'll need surgery

485
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,638
to repair a leak in your aorta.

486
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:34,623
Is there anyone that
you'd like us to contact?

487
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,141
No, there's no one.

488
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:39,111
Conni, call the O.R. Tell them
to prep a room now, please.

489
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,179
There's a blockage in
your left femoral artery.

490
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,180
A clot has formed,

491
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,849
preventing blood
flowing to your leg.

492
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,085
This is a potentially
life-threatening condition

493
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:47,786
that requires immediate surgery.

494
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,422
I'm not letting you fix me up...

495
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:54,192
so they can put me on trial
for some bogus charges.

496
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,293
If the charges are bogus,

497
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,361
you'll be set free.

498
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,263
Without surgery, you could die.

499
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,233
Yeah? Well, I'll
take my chances.

500
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:03,869
Besides, you
know, I like it here.

501
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,704
Good drugs.

502
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,728
Food's not half bad.

503
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:11,431
And I get off just
looking at you.

504
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:14,763
You know, every night...

505
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:18,667
after the lights
go out, I lie back...

506
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:22,103
and think about you.

507
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,327
Mm.

508
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,027
So your answer's no to surgery?

509
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,362
That's right.

510
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,364
Well, you'll need to
sign a refusal of consent.

511
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,688
Well, bring it on.

512
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,637
Merry Christmas, Dr. Benton.

513
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:39,838
Mm, what's that?

514
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:40,839
Since I couldn't get

515
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,341
Valerie Page
transferred to Rush,

516
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,108
I had an LVAD transferred here.

517
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:45,377
That's a $50,000 device.

518
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,379
Don't be mad, but
I... signed your name

519
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:48,814
as the authorizing physician.

520
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:49,815
You did what?

521
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,282
You were in the
middle of surgery.

522
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:52,684
You should've interrupted me.

523
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,719
But there was no time.

524
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:54,986
Uh... Uh, I can't do it.

525
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,788
What do you mean,
you can't do it right now?

526
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:57,956
No. I mean, I can't do it.

527
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,958
I'm not qualified to do
an LVAD implantation.

528
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:02,444
Dr. Romano is the only one.
And he's home for the holidays.

529
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,862
But this could save her life.

530
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,836
I know. Lucy, I'm not
qualified. I'm sorry.

531
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,136
What? Nothing.

532
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,413
He's in V-tach!
Grab the paddles!

533

00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,301
And clear!

535
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:26,001
Two hundred! Come on, come on!

536
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,769
Not charged yet.

537
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,937

00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,472

merry Christmas... ♪

00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,757

542
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:37,863
He's back.

543
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:38,864
He's back.

544
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,832
I saw her.

545
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:41,850
What?

546
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,320
Edith. My wife. I saw her.

547
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,739
She's not here.

548
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:48,073
I know, I know. She's dead.

549
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,363
But I saw her.

550
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:51,932
I saw her.

551
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,963
Heard about your
Santa performance.

552
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,398
Ha-ha. First and last.

553
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,799
It's Malik's Gameboy.

554
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,901
Didn't wanna hear his
griping if he didn't get it.

555
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,636
You're a good woman, Haleh.

556
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,180
No, Mom. There's no need
to ruin your Christmas too.

557
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,376
I gotta go, okay?

558
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,610
Bye.

559
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,612
Luka. Any word on Kate's labs?

560
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,280
Yeah, I was just
looking for you.

561
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,515
Her urine is negative,

562
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,149
and white count
is basically normal.

563
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,718
"Basically." What
does that mean?

564
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,953
Uh, the differential
shows five bands.

565
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,423
But that's still within the
normal range for her age.

566
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,725
Well... can't the
lab repeat them?

567
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,960
Yeah, but that would
mean sticking Kate again.

568
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,029
Can we do a manual diff?

569
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,298
You know, I will call
the lab supervisor

570
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,833
to see if he can squeeze one in.

571
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,301
Thanks.

572
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,303
How are you holding up?

573
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,739
In all honesty,
I'm... exhausted.

574
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,073
I'm not surprised.

575
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,576
Yeah, well, you know, I can
handle 40 patients in one shift,

576
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,778
I can't handle two infants.

577
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,078
Welcome to parenthood.

578
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,047
Maybe he's out of
town. Or fast asleep.

579
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,384
Dr. Romano. This
is, uh, Lucy Knight.

580
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,319
Fourth-year medical student.

581
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:55,457
Eh... Yes, I realize that
it's almost midnight, but...

582
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,326
No, it's about a patient.
<i>It's Christmas Eve!</i>

583
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,195
Y-yes, sir. I
understand that. But...

584
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,798
<i>calling the chief
of staff at home!</i>

585
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,500
Oh, okay. If I could
just exp... Hello?

586
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,073
I want my piece back.

587
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:14,142
Your gun is now the
property of the Chicago Police.

588
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,811
That's whack. It was a
Christmas present for my little bro.

589
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,580
You were gonna give him a gun?

590
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,949
Yeah, doc. Cost me
some serious dollars.

591
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,451
How much?

592
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,152
Forty. Now give it back.

593
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,887
Hey, I gave it to the police.

594
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,657
So, what am I supposed
to give my little brother?

595
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,725
Here. It's a Gameboy.

596
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,694
Worth at least twice that much.

597
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,262
Your brother will love it.

598
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,652
Yeah, whatever.

599
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:40,903
Merry Christmas!

600
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,938
<i>I appreciate your coming in.</i>

601
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,140
I feel caught between a
rock and a hard place on this.

602
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,474
Well, how so?

603
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,643
It's obvious Mrs. Kottmeier
cares about her son.

604
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,778
But he needs more than that.

605
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,647
Listen, she's an
alcoholic herself...

606
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,583
Still her alcoholism only
factors in if it interferes

607
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,186
with her ability to provide
for Chad's basic needs.

608
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,255
What if she buys his
alcohol and drinks with him?

609
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,423
Did he say that to you?

610
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,927
No, she did, in so many words.

611
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,865
Peter, did you
consent Mr. Waller?

612
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,432
Yeah, why?

613
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,489
Better get in here.

614
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,296
Please. No surgery.

615
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,850
Mr. Waller, you have a
life-threatening condition.

616
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,885
I'm not afraid to die.

617
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,069
I saw Edith.

618
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,503
His dead wife.

619
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,072
She's waiting for me.

620
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,274
I saw her at the
end of a long tunnel.

621
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:38,509
And there was this
brilliant white light?

622
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,979
Yeah. It was so peaceful.

623
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,414
What you experienced
was a hallucination due to

624
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:46,001
an endorphin release while
under severe physical stress.

625
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,086
No. It was real.

626
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,487
If this isn't happening,

627
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,489
I have a pain consult to do.

628
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,792
Sir, if you don't
have surgery...

629
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,711
you probably won't
live through the night.

630
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,679
Ahhh...

631
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:00,766
That means Edith and I can
spend Christmas together.

632
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,355
Yeah.

633
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,442
I'm sorry.

634
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,956
I really tried. I know.

635
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,558
Trust me, if there
was anything else

636
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,145
I could do, I would
do it... Don't worry.

637
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:15,880
I plan on beating this thing.

638
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:19,618
With or without
some... stupid device.

639
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:22,487
Okay. Get some rest.

640
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:23,927
Keep your strength up.

641
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:28,016
Hey.

642
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:32,669
Merry Christmas.

643
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,572
Merry Christmas, Valerie.

644
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,009
Oh.

645
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,397
Breast-feeding was
so difficult at first.

646
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,632
I felt like this cow with
these huge udders.

647
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,034
You look like a natural to me.

648
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,468
Yeah, well...

649
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,537
being that I do it
every three hours.

650
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,539
When do you sleep, girl?

651
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,808
Oh. Sorry.

652
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,010
No, that's okay. The
kitchen is now closed.

653
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,979
And Auntie Haleh
should get back to work.

654
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,069
May I?

655
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,183
Thanks for the chair.

656
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,784
Oh, OB won't miss it.

657
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,907
Okay.

658
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,989
The manual diff came back.

659
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,092
Kate's white count is normal.

660
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,860
Oh. That's great.

661
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,161
Do you hear that, sweet pea?

662
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,329
You're gonna be okay.

663
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,464
Probably just a virus.

664
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,633
Not too surprising
this time of year.

665
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,402
I'm sorry if I've been...
What, a good parent?

666
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,461
No, I was gonna say
difficult. Yeah, same thing.

667
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:33,765
Ugh...

668
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,544
I can't believe it's 2 a.m.

669
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,447
Yeah. It's Christmas.

670
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,438
That's right. It's Christmas.

671
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,186
I admitted him to ICU.

672
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,755
Donald, I saw your
name on the board.

673
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,557
What are you doing
here this time of night?

674
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:49,858
Well, I had a gastroenteritis

675
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,928
turn into an ischemic
bowel on me.

676
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,629
Merry Christmas.

677
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,864
So, Peter,

678
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,150
shall we include Elizabeth
in on your dilemma?

679
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,153
I've got a triple-A patient
who refuses to have surgery,

680
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:02,854
because he believes
he saw his dead wife

681
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:04,422
waiting for him
on the other side.

682
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,557
That's funny.

683
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,359
I have a patient
refusing surgery as well,

684
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,926
except mine's
the devil incarnate.

685
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,395
Dean Rollins?

686
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,130
As far as I'm concerned,
good riddance.

687
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,282
And who made you judge and jury?

688
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,169
Ugh. Donald, you have no
idea how despicable this man is.

689
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:18,736
Oh, I'm sure I don't.

690
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,790
But being a doctor isn't
about your personal feelings.

691
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,825
So let's get back
to your patient.

692
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,961
Well, I tried talking
to him. He won't listen.

693
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,012
But did you listen?

694
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,264
You know, this man
is probably frightened,

695
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,866
and thinking that
he saw his dead wife

696
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,467
makes him feel less so.

697
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,435
If he thought that
<i>you</i> understood that,

698
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,205
maybe he'd be more receptive
to what you have to say.

699
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,057
But ultimately it's
the patient's choice.

700
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,491
Of course.

701
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,193
But we must offer to
do everything we can

702
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,150
to keep them alive.

703
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:47,788
<i>Okay, Gretel!</i>

704
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,186
Okay, you can stop now!

705
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,121
You've got my attention!

706
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,422
Before you say anything...

707
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,390
I've thought of at least

708
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,359
a dozen reasons why I
shouldn't be doing this.

709
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,895
Uh, not the least of
which is ruining my career.

710
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:01,880
I'd love to hear others,

711
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:03,581
but since the police
are on their way...

712
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:06,017
I have a patient, Valerie
Page, 24 years old,

713
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,753
dying of cardiomyopathy.

714
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:08,954
She's on the UNOS list.

715
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:10,889
But an LVAD could
buy her valuable time.

716
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:12,512
What makes you
think I give a rat's ass?

717
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,360
I'm sorry.

718
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,362
What was I thinking,
coming to you,

719
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,765
a seasoned doctor who supposedly

720
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:22,667
has dedicated his entire life

721
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:23,852
to helping people?

722
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,921
While I'm just a
puny medical student

723
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,955
who was stupid enough
to think that she could...

724
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,012
Miss Knight.

725
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,832
What do you want?

726
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:37,382
I want you to help my patient.

727
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,526
I want you to help me.

728
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,389
Looking for the fat
dude in the red suit.

729
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,391
There's a lot of 'em
around here. Which one?

730
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,793
The one givin' out the Gameboys.

731
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,896
Ah, Chuny. I got this. Hi.

732
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,881
We heard you was givin'
up Gameboys for gats.

733
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:54,932
Ah.

734
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:57,602
Uh... well, that's
not exactly true.

735
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:59,036
I mean, it happened once,

736
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,190
but that was sort of
a... unique situation.

737
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,697
We out of here.

738
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,601
Well, wait. Uh, does it
have to be Gameboys?

739
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,921
Hey, Vivian.

740
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,501
I'm looking for my triple-A.

741
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,802
The guy who saw his dead wife.

742
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,504
Howard Waller? Mm-hm?

743
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,568
Over there.

744
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,142
He died?

745
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,867
Coded less than an hour ago.

746
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:55,727
You miss me?

747
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,295
I'm curious about something.

748
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,465
Me too. Are you
a natural redhead?

749
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,468
I'd like to see for myself.

750
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,570
I find it fascinating
you're willing to end up

751
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:08,206
a vegetable for the rest
of your miserable life...

752
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,925
just to win a pissing contest.

753
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:13,049
Well, that's one contest
with you I'm sure I can win.

754
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:16,998
If you don't have surgery,

755
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,333
the flesh on your
leg will begin to rot

756
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,937
and become painfully
infected, probably gangrenous.

757
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,606
Ooh. You're scaring
me, doc. Next,

758
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,107
you'll go into septic shock.

759
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,976
Which will drop your
blood pressure so low,

760
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,144
you will have a massive stroke.

761
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,747
You'll wind up
drooling in your food,

762
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,203
wearing diapers.

763
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,868
Rather like that pathetic
creature over there.

764
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:39,770
Except, of course,
you'll only have one leg,

765
00:29:39,794 --> 00:29:42,354
because they'll be
forced to amputate.

766
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:46,049
But you'll have
won, Dean Rollins.

767
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,189
Now... is that really
the best you can do?

768
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,437
I'm telling you the truth.

769
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,805
If you choose not to believe me,

770
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,389
then you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

771
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,612
You do care about me.

772
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,636
Don't you?

773
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,749
As your doctor, I do.

774
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,001
No. Not as a doctor.

775
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,707
As a woman.

776
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:15,262
Say it.

777
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,931
Say it.

778
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,820
I care.

779
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,861
Then let's do it.

780
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:40,998
Crappy generator.

781
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,267
I'm gonna give that Amish
salesman a piece of my mind.

782
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:44,669
What do you need
a generator for?

783
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:47,038
T.E.O.T.W.A.W.K.I.

784
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,440
The End Of The
World As We Know It.

785
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:50,207
Ah, Y2K.

786
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:52,143
Damn computers rule our lives.

787
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,345
It doesn't take a genius
to realize we're doomed.

788
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,414
Okay. Come with me
for aftercare instructions.

789
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,983
You wanna change
that dressing in 24 hours.

790
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,686
Haven't they fixed
most of the Y2K glitches?

791
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,956
Only takes one pebble to send
ripples across an entire pond.

792
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,925
And you can bet this
place will be a deathtrap.

793
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,761
Okay, I assure you, Mr. Thorpe,
the hospital's mainframe

794
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,229
has been thoroughly
Y2K-inspected.

795
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:13,631
And they checked the interface

796
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:15,934
with your front-end terminals?

797
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,436
I... I don't know.

798
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,737
Come on. I'm gonna show you

799
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:22,321
how well you've been inspected.

800
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,759
Chad, your CT
came back negative,

801
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,394
which means no
injury to your brain.

802
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,265
Thank God. So I can go home now?

803
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,649
I'm afraid not.

804
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,935
I've made arrangements
for you to be placed

805
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,638
in an alcohol-treatment program,

806
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,939
here in the hospital.

807
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:39,940
You did what?

808
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,743
You can't make me stay here.

809
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,310
As your doctor, it's my duty

810
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,163
to look out for your
well-being and safety.

811
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:46,414
Mom?

812
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,082
Please, Dr. Finch,
don't do this to us.

813
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,501
I'll try harder, really.

814
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,536
Chad was lucky this
time. What about the next?

815
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,587
I won't get drunk again.

816
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,988
I know you don't believe me,

817
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,507
but this is for your own good.

818
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:58,043
I just wanna go home.

819
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,912
Please. Dr. Finch.

820
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,847
I'm begging you.

821
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:04,916
Don't take him away from me.

822
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,601
It's Christmas, for God's sakes.

823
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,369
Which puts Chad at
an even greater risk.

824
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,555
He's out of school, he's
partying with friends.

825
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:11,940
I promise I won't drink again.

826
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:13,942
I promise.

827
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,360
Please.

828
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:17,328
It's all right,
sweetheart. It's all right.

829
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,730
It's all right.

830
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:21,616
It's all right.

831
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,084
Now, go to the month pull-down.

832
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,087
And change it to January 2000.

833
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,656
Hit "apply." And then "okay."

834
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,857
Done.

835
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,527
Okay. Now try to
retrieve my medical chart.

836
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,330
Okay, Mr. Thorpe. I'm
sure we will convince you

837
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,031
that we run a tight
ship here at County...

838
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:41,102
"No records found for
December 25, 1900."

839
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,004
1900? What did...?
What did you do?

840
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,273
Tight ship. That's what
they said about the<i> Titanic.</i>

841
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,774
Amira, get Tech
Support down here.

842
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,309
I'm getting out of
here while I can.

843
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,777
What do you mean,
you gave it away?

844
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,079
It was for a good cause.
That was my Secret Santa gift.

845
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,548
So I'll get you another one.

846
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,116
I'm already getting
Cleo a Discman

847
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,217
and Conni a blender.

848
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,052
These guys are
taking you for a ride...

849
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,854
Hey, there's four less
guns on the street.

850
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,523
They can take me
for any ride they want.

851
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:04,292
There's a horde of troublemakers
in chairs asking for you.

852
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,394
Something about gifts
for guns. Thanks, Haleh.

853
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,962
You're still here.
Where's her mom?

854
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,564
Try Exam 2.

855
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,687
Thanks.

856
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,380
Conni? Keep Exam 2
clear for a while, okay?

857
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,849
Sure thing. Thanks.

858
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,018
Ugh, I can't
believe this hospital

859
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,586
doesn't have
24-hour tech support.

860
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,688
Romano's definitely
getting a memo about this...

861
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:34,923
It's Christmas, Kerry.

862
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:37,491
Yeah, which means that
Y2K is seven days away.

863
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,193
All the more reason
they should be here.

864
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,194
Computer problems?

865
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,663
The damn thing crashed on me.

866
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,032
I-I-I-I can't get labs, I
can't get medical records...

867
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,733
You know, I got my
start in Tech Support.

868
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,734
Mind if I take a look?

869
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,102
No. Here you are.

870
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,171
That's how I got into
trouble in the first place.

871
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,839
Well, the... terminal
looks current.

872
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,908
Uh, it's a software problem.

873
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,176
I could download a Y2K patch.

874
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,812
That ought to do the trick.

875
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,081
I guess you can't
make things any worse.

876
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,382
Mm.

877
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,353
I feel the catheter sliding.

878
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,754
There's some minor resistance.

879
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,611
I'll give you suction.

880
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:14,028
It'd be so easy
for me to just slip.

881
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,572
Oh. At least he's
gonna have to stand trial.

882
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,534
Okay, I've got the clot.

883
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,425
Shirley, check the foot.

884
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,612
911 page to O.R. 3?

885
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,811
What the hell is
Romano doing here?

886
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:30,995
I feel a pulse.

887
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:32,914
Good. Let's get
an angio of the leg,

888
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:33,998
check there are no tears.

889
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:35,333
Can you finish here?

890
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:36,668
I've come this far. Go.

891
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:39,503
How do we check for
ventricular decompression

892
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:40,871
once the device is activated?

893
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,172
With a transesophageal echo,

894
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:44,174
you should see the
bowing of the septum.

895
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:46,261
Fourth-year, huh? Not bad.

896
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,796
Well, it's nice to see that when

897
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,249
the cat's away, the
mouse still jumps.

898
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:52,250
What's going on?

899
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:53,517
I'm just teaching Ms. Knight

900
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,619
the finer points of an
LVAD implantation.

901
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:57,989
You know, from now on, I
think I'm only gonna do favors

902
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,157
for people who come
begging at my doorstep.

903
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,993
Which leads me to ask, Peter,

904
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:02,994
why wasn't it you?

905
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,195
I never even considered it.

906
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:06,781
Ah. O ye of little
faith. Dr. Romano,

907
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,283
I again just wanna
tell you how much

908
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,734
I appreciate you doing this...

909
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,436
That's enough
sucking up. Cut, please.

910
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,354
Well, that'll be all, Peter.

911
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,722
I'd like to scrub in.

912
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,590
I'm sorry, Peter, you
didn't earn this one.

913
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,975
Yeah, but I'd
still like to help.

914
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,343
Ms. Knight, what do you think?

915
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,496
I think Valerie can use
all the help she can get.

916
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,840
You heard her, Peter. Scrub in.

917
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:32,072
The '60s were from 1961 to 1970.

918
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,207
What about 1960?

919
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,109
That was the last
year in the '50s.

920
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,546
Which means the new
millennium really starts in 2001.

921
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,214
Then why am I spending
half my paycheck

922
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,883
on New Year's Eve plans?

923
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,150
You and the rest of the world.

924
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,869
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

925
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,804
Wow. God, that felt great.

926
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:48,172
How long was I out?

927
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:49,573
About four hours.

928
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:51,542
It felt like days.

929
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,710
Where are the kids?

930
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,046
Asleep in the Pedes
room. Yosh is on duty.

931
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,049
Oh, God. I so appreciate
you guys helping me out.

932
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,250
Hey, what are friends for?

933
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:02,019
Christmas cookie?
Yeah. I'm famished.

934
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,687
Carol, I heard about
Kate. Is she okay?

935
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,289
Oh, she's fine. Thanks.

936
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:06,290
Where you off to?

937
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:08,592
Indianapolis to see the family.

938
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,627
Did they take the
Kottmeier boy upstairs?

939
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,762
Few minutes ago. Okay.

940
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:13,564
Merry Christmas,
Kwanzaa, all that.

941
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,266
Bye! Safe travel.

942
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,768
I'm sorry I can't put you
and the girls in my two-seater.

943
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,203
Oh, Haleh, don't worry about it.

944
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:20,771
You have done
enough for us already.

945
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,606
Carol, I can give you a ride.

946
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,841
Since when do you own a car?

947
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:25,809
Since I sold my boat.

948
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,278
Oh. Well, thank you, but no.

949
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:28,712
The girls are
asleep, I'd hate...

950
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:30,381
Look who's up. Come on.

951
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:34,352
Oh. Come here,
sweetheart. I know.

952
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:35,953
All right. I'm gonna
go get our stuff.

953
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:38,044
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

954
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,244
Quite an arsenal.

955
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,146
Yep. After I gave away

956
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,381
all the Secret Santa gifts,

957
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,049
I started writing checks.

958
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,251
Well, call the
police department.

959
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,953
Have an officer come
by to pick them up.

960
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,588
I already did.

961
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,378
Double trauma at the back door.

962
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,695
17-year old drive-by victim.
Single GSW to the thigh.

963
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,631
BP is 130/90. Pulse 110.

964
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,733
Name is Hank Lohman.
You say Lohman?

965
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,769
Carter, take the next one.

966
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,970
Scoop and run, 7-year-old.

967
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,671
GSW to the chest and abdomen.

968
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,673
Had a pulse in the
field, lost it en route.

969
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,875
Get ET tube placement.

970
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:48,876
What happened?

971
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,278
Kid was opening up his present,

972
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:51,845
took a bullet aimed
at his neighbor,

973
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,014
guy they just brought in.

974
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:54,532
Son of a bitch.

975
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:57,001
Let's hang two units of
O-neg on the rapid infuser

976
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,235
and prep for a thoracotomy.

977
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,470
He's in fine V-fib.

978
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,906
Some sterile gloves.
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

979
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,307
All right, let's prep his chest.

980
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:05,398
Oh, my God. Where's
the blood coming from?

981
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,446
They shot him in the head.

982
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,447
How you doing?

983
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:11,081
Full traumatic arrest.

984
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:12,316
Thoracotomy tray is ready.

985
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,284
Chest is prepped.

986
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:16,788
There's gray matter
all over this backboard.

987
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:19,645
He's dead.

988
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:30,767
Okay. The pump is de-aired.

989
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,138
Decrease bypass flow
to two liters per minute.

990
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:35,940
Start the LVAD.

991
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:39,409
Uh, fixed mode, 20
cycles per minute.

992
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:40,410
The moment of truth.

993
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,412
It works.

994
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:44,048
You're surprised?

995
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,450
It's so loud. How's she
gonna sleep at night?

996
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,418
Uh, she'll get used to it.

997
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:51,556
Just like hearing the
beating of your own heart.

998
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,024
Okay. Pump is filling nicely.

999
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:56,010
Oh, Peter, isn't that
your munchkin out there?

1000
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,529
Oh, yeah. Uh... you
mind if I scrub out?

1001
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,231
Oh. First you want
in, then you want out.

1002
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,816
Yeah, yeah, I
know, it's Christmas.

1003
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,983
Go ahead. Get the hell out.

1004
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,118
Thanks.

1005
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:07,287
Miss Knight, care
to help me close?

1006
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,656
Sure.

1007
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,857
If you feel you're up to it.

1008
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,209
Absolutely.

1009
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:14,412
Hey. Look, I know I was
supposed to pick him up earlier,

1010
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,580
but this surgery came up.

1011
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,847
Hey.

1012
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:17,948
Save it, Peter.

1013
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,484
It's nothing I
haven't heard before.

1014
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:21,985
Carla, you know
it is the holidays.

1015
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:24,409
We could at
least try to be civil.

1016
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,764
You want civil? Fine.

1017
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,564
Thank you very much
for ruining my life.

1018
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,600
What is that supposed to mean?

1019
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:39,386
Roger and I aren't moving
to Germany anymore.

1020
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,654
What?

1021
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,140
When Roger asked for
time off for custody trial,

1022
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,611
his boss decided he wasn't
promotion material after all.

1023
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:49,614
Um... I...

1024
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,532
Look, Carla, I don't
know what to say.

1025
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,621
I'm sure you don't.

1026
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:55,570
Look. Okay.

1027
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,105
I'm sorry about Roger's job.

1028
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,541
But no, I'm not sorry that
Reece gets to stay here

1029
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,542
with both his parents.

1030
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,631
Whatever, Peter.

1031
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,235
You won. Merry Christmas.

1032
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:12,192
Hey.

1033
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,329
Look.

1034
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:18,809
Hey, Amira? Mm-hm?

1035
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,545
I'm expecting an
officer to stop by.

1036
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:24,103
How about, uh... that one?

1037
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,716
Hey, what happened?

1038
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,252
Yeah, one punk
shot another punk,

1039
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:29,853
took out a little
kid in the process.

1040
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:31,521
Caught this coward
fleeing the scene.

1041
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:33,324
He's got a nasty
cut on his head.

1042
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,358
It's you?

1043
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:35,659
What?

1044
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,203
You thought I couldn't
score another piece?

1045
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,996
You want a gun?

1046
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,966
Here, I got guns. Why
don't you take your pick?

1047
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,985
You like this one? How
about this one here, huh?

1048
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,469
You just pull the
trigger and<i> bang!</i>

1049
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:47,871
A 7-year-old's brains get
splattered all over the wall.

1050
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,040
Carter! Hey! What do you
think you're doing, John?

1051
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:52,544
Merry Christmas!

1052
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,603
See how long this lasts.

1053
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:01,152
They had quite a night.

1054
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:02,987
Their first Christmas ever.

1055
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:04,922
It's hard to believe.

1056
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:07,291
It only happens once. Enjoy it.

1057
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:11,445
Hm... Luka, wait. Hm?

1058
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,830
Do you have any Christmas plans?

1059
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:15,633
Uh, like those two
over there. Sleep.

1060
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:17,151
Why don't you stay
for some eggnog?

1061
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,003
It's the least I can
do, for all you've done.

1062
00:41:19,027 --> 00:41:20,270
And what?

1063
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:22,290
And end up like those
Santas? I don't think so.

1064
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,541
Come on. It's tradition.

1065
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:28,011
Oh. What's in that
eggnog exactly?

1066
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:32,300
Eggs, sugar... milk, rum... Rum?

1067
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:35,720
You know what? I... I... I
suppose I can risk it, eh?

1068
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,544
Okay.

1069
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,742
Next few days, a bland diet.

1070
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,145
Clear fluids, rice, bread.

1071
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,780
Hey uh... Your
computer running okay?

1072
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:48,082
Oh, yes. And thank you.
Thank you so much for your help.

1073
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,383
I appreciate it.

1074
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:51,451
Santa always
aims to please. Heh.

1075
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,753
Say, you wouldn't know a place

1076
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,088
to get bland food around here?

1077
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,557
Ah. Well, Doc Magoo's
is right across the street.

1078
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,594
And, uh, you can't get
much blander than that.

1079
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,862
They're open on Christmas?

1080
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,431
Yep. Always open. Just like us.

1081
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,815
Well... Sounds
perfect. Thanks. Hm.

1082
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,371
Dr. Weaver.

1083
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,841
Hm? Care to join us?

1084
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:18,145
Ooh. Ah... My treat.

1085
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,948
Um... Free bland food.

1086
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,617
Sure.

1087
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,761
Great.

1088
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:36,497
So you, uh, work
with computers, huh?

1089
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:39,733
Yeah. I, uh, own my
own software company.

1090
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,901
Just went public.

1091
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,236
Really?

1092
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,038
I'm always looking for
investment opportunities.

1093
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,062
Oh.

1094
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,659
Since we split the breastbone,

1095
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:51,628
your chest will hurt
for quite a few weeks.

1096
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,831
That's a small price to pay.

1097
00:42:53,855 --> 00:42:56,033
So... how's our lovely patient?

1098
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:57,968
She's doing great.

1099
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,504
Pressure's up, kidney
function's improving.

1100
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:03,807
Good. Well, carry on. I'm
going back from whence I came.

1101
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,142
Oh, by the way, Miss Knight.

1102
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,344
You're going to have to
come by my office sometime

1103
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:09,613
next week to discuss
suitable disciplinary action.

1104
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:12,449

have a reputation to maintain.
