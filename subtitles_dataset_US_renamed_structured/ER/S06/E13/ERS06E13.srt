1
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,966
Dad, what are you doing?

2
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,570
Thought I'd weed through
your mother's record collection.

3
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,738
The one we schlepped all
the way back from San Diego

4
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,106
along with that old turntable.

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,941
So now you can throw it out?

6
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,811
Did go through some
strange musical phases.

7
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,313
Bless her heart.

8
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:40,083
Ah. The dance
phase. Cha-cha-cha.

9
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,351
Tango.

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,088
And the lounge lizard
phase. Tom Jones.

11
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:49,025
I like a good show tune
myself. Remember<i> Oklahoma!?</i>

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,128
<i>Oklahoma!?</i> How could I not?

13
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,196
You played it for me

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,598
when I was a kid
a thousand times.

15
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,533
Then I guess you
won't mind one more.

16
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,736
As long as it means
no more "cha-cha-cha."

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,770
I gotta shave.

18
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,490
Go ahead. Don't wanna be late.

19
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:06,526
I thought surgeons were
supposed to have horrible hours.

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,227
Up very early.

21
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:11,531
We do. I was up very late.

22
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,733
I see your father's been here.

23
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:15,201
What?

24
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,170
Crown Essential Bouquet.

25
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:18,938
Oh. Over a year ago.

26
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:20,707
God, I don't think
I've even used it.

27
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:23,532
Well... I must be off.

28
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,964
Uh, what time is your
angioplasty? What?

29
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,633
You mentioned you were
doing a laser angioplasty.

30
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,719
I thought perhaps I
would come and observe.

31
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:34,187
Why would you want to do that?

32
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,607
Well... my work
with lasers is so...

33
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,359
Esoteric?

34
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:41,445
Romantic.

35
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,480
Wandering through
the atmosphere,

36
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,715
watching the stars twinkle.

37
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,035
I thought perhaps I'd come
and see the practical approach.

38
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:51,437
Hm. I don't think
it's even allowed.

39
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:54,724
Well, I'm sure as
associate chief of surgery,

40
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,326
you could make arrangements.

41
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,994
Anyway, I'll call and check.

42
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,163
Or perhaps I'll just drop by.

43
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,732
Wait. Mother. Mother,
I don't think that's...

44
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,336

00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,146

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,613
a pharmacy to
pick up some refills

50
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,349
on those prescriptions.

51
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,650
Dad, I told you I'm not gonna

52
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,852
give you any scripts.

53
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,686
Uh, I... I just need
the Combivent

54
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,687

00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,122
I've still got the Theo-Dur.

Dad, you have emphysema.

57
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,259
I haven't needed my oxygen

58
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,426
for over two months.

59
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,011
You haven't seen
a doctor in over six.

60
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,313
Okay, you need to see a
pulmonologist here in Chicago.

61
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:35,848
Damn doctors.

62
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,585
Ask a million questions, when
all you need's the medicine.

63
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,921
Hey. It's not good medicine...

64
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:44,007
For one family member
to look after another.

65
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,275

to have a son for a doctor,

you a prescription?

00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,262
It's not that I can't, Dad.

68
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,764
No, no.

69
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:52,465

She's off today.
You're tall. Hold this.

75
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,687
What's this? Hearts.
Valentine's Day.

76
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,022
You know, when you give people

77
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,290
flowers, candies, cards,

78
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,858
telling them how
much you love them.

79
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,160
Happy Valentine's Day.

80
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,662
Aw. Thank you,
Yosh. That is so sweet.

81
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,198
You see? Don't they have
Valentine's Day in Croatia?

82
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,466
Oh, yes, we do.

83
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,702
We even have these
little hearts. "Be mine."

84
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,571
I don't recommend
you eating that.

85
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,007
"Dear one." I gotta
get to Radiology.

86
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,141
"Cut-tie pie."

87
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,811
That's "cutie pie."
Oh, thank you.

88
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,180
I'm Abby Lockhart, Mrs.
Connelly. We'll help you.

89
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,115
Could you find
that young doctor?

90
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,119
He... He took care of my
husband Billy a-after the fire.

91
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,720
Oh, what was his name?

92
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,721
Dr. Malucci?

93
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,556
No. Uh, Carter.

94
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,791
Yes, that's it.

95
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,410
Okay. We'll try
to find him for you.

96
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,578
Do you have a
cough, Mrs. Connelly?

97
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,113
No. Pulse is thready.

98
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:48,681
Any pain in your belly?

99
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,949
Uh, no, no. No.

100
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,250
Any aching?

101
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:54,854
Oh, I'm 81 years old,
dear. I ache all over.

102
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,478
One, two, three. Oh.

103
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:00,059
There you go. Any
pain when you urinate?

104
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,462
Uh, no. But I seem
to go all the time.

105
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,564
Okay. Well, we're gonna
run some tests. Uh-huh.

106
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,299
BP is still low. 80/50.

107
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:08,167
And I'll see if I can
find Dr. Carter for you.

108
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,102
Oh, thank you. It's
probably urosepsis.

109
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,338
Start her on a liter of
saline, and send her to CBC.

110
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,673
A chem panel, blood cultures,

111
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:16,108
UA and a urine culture.

112
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:18,144
How about antibiotics?
Um... Uh, dip a urine

113
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,378
to confirm the diagnosis.

114
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,231
I'll see what Carter
wants to start her on.

115
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,699
Mark!

116
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,667
Hi.

117
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,669
We have to stop
meeting like this.

118
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,339
Just tell me we're going
out for dinner tonight, alone.

119
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,774
Valentine's Day?
I wouldn't miss it.

120
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,309
Fun morning with your mother?

121
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,478
Oh. She's actually threatening

122
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,679
to come visit me at work.

123
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,581
Oh, good. I'll finally
get to meet her.

124
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,149
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

125
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,719
This is the woman who
didn't even phone me

126
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,254
when she got into town.

127
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,155
Oh. So remind me again why it is

128
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,874
you invited her
to stay with you?

129
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,175
Don't go there or I'll have to

130
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,576
throw you into that snowbank.

131
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,895
Could you remind me again...?

132
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,996
Oh!

133
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,764
I can't believe... You are...

134
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,333
You asked for it!
You asked for it.

135
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,020
Paul Sobriki?

136
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,804
Yeah.

137
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:05,894
Watch out! CORDAY: Stop it! Ah!

138
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,911
Truce.

139
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,696
You promise? I promise.

140
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,046
You promise?

141
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,482
I promise. Scout's honor?

142
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,484
Scout's honor. I'm done.

143
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,374
You promise? Yeah. Yeah.

144
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,724
Ah! Mark!

145
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,375
Just the snowballs,
I guess, huh?

146
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,442
D... Sorry.

147
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:27,880
So you've got a bad
headache? Uh-huh.

148
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,216
And have you had them
before? I take aspirin.

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,218
Why don't we...? Where
exactly is the pain?

150
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:33,553
It's around my right eye.

151
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:34,953
Are you nauseated? Yeah.

152
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,789
Does light bother
your eyes? Yeah.

153
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,524
All right. Why
don't we find a room

154
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,009
and get you checked out?

155
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,662
Did you hit your head?
Let him answer my question.

156
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:44,463
He's my patient.
You weren't around.

157
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,432
I'm here now, okay?
Your face looks flushed.

158
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:47,984
This collar's pretty tight.

159
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,386
Good morning, one and
all. Who's running this?

160
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,155
I am. I am.

161
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,689
Dr. Chen, give me the bullet.

162
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,825
George Hudson, 55,
rear-ended at a red light.

163
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,827
Complains of neck
pain and mild headache.

164
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,161
Mr. Hudson, I'm Dr. Greene.

165
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,548
Actually, it's Dr. Hudson.

166
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,633
Has anybody asked Dr. Hudson

167
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,751
what his specialty is?

168
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,836
Family medicine.

169
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,339
I'm from Philadelphia.
I'm just here a couple days

170
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,073
taking a CME course.

171
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,592
I see I've landed myself a
couple of eager Residents.

172
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,345
That you have. So
far they're asking

173
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,313
the right questions.
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

174
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,281
They don't exactly wait
to hear the answers.

175
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,749
My apologies. That's all right.

176
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,701
Let them continue.
Sure you don't mind?

177
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,403
No. It's kind of amusing.

178
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,439
I was a house
officer once myself.

179
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,409
Dr. Chen, Dr. Malucci,
continue your evaluation.

180
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,913
I'll be back to go
over your workup.

181
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,331
Scream if you need me.

182
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,300
June Connelly? Her
husband a few months ago?

183
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,036
Oh. Well, I probably saw
hundreds of patients since then.

184
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,804
Do you have a minute?
Seeing a patient.

185
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,573
This won't take
long. I'll be there.

186
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,775
I have a 23-year-old
law student with two days

187
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,811
of right periorbital
throbbing headache

188
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,847
associated with
nausea and photophobia.

189
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,949
No fever, no stiff neck,
no history of migraines.

190
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,150
But this one seems classic.

191
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,285
I'm thinking six
of Imitrex, sub-q?

192
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,387
Yep. Sounds good. You
don't want to examine him?

193
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,191
No, I trust you. Let
me know how he does.

194
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,059
There. Is that a little
more comfortable?

195
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,727
Yes, thank you, dear.

196
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,362
Mrs. Connelly.

197
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,863
Yes.

198
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,567
Oh. Here you are. Ha-ha.

199
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,169
Oh. You probably
don't remember me.

200
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,305
Yes, I do. How are you feeling?

201
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,373
Well, not too bad. Uh...

202
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,975
Th... They're taking
very good care of me.

203
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,143
I'm sure they are. Uh-huh.

204
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,312
You're in very good hands.

205
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,680
Pressure's up to 85, systolic.

206
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,682
Dipped 4-plus
positive for nitrates

207
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,982
and leukocytes.

208
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,284
Which antibiotic do you want?

209
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,086
Um, I was thinking amp and gent.

210
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,287
Hm.

211
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,490
Try 500 milligrams of
Levaquin, IV piggyback.

212
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,560
It's once-a-day dosing,
and a little less nephrotoxic.

213
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,061
Um, could I talk to
you for a second?

214
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,431
Mm-hm. Mrs. Connelly? Oh, yes.

215
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,299
I'm gonna stop back
and see you later, okay?

216
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,900
Oh, yes. Thank you.

217
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,135
You're very welcome. Bye.

218
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,654
Bye.

219
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:49,922
Pressure's dangerously low.

220
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,024
Yeah, she's septic.

221
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:52,625
She has bacteria
in her bloodstream.

222
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,527
So we need to get her
pressure up using fluids

223
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,328
and inotropic support.

224
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:58,531
Are you sure that
she wants all that?

225
00:08:58,555 --> 00:08:59,932
Well, she came to the hospital.

226
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,333
We should do everything we can.

227
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,202
We should do everything
she wants us to do.

228
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,004
That may not include
machines and tubes.

229
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:08,641
Well, in OB, doing everything
was pretty much automatic.

230
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:11,766
This isn't OB. Talk to her.

231
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,349
Carter, you following
Lucy's patient?

232
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,950
Kid with migraine?
She presented it.

233
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,442
If you're gonna supervise,
do it more closely.

234
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,439
What's going on?

235
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,074
I was just coming
to get you. Name?

236
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,276
Paul Sobriki. How
are you feeling, Paul?

237
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,545
My wife doesn't like
the diner either, and I...

238
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,779
Uh-huh.

239
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,214
He suddenly started babbling.

240
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,649
Now he's puking.

241
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,617
He's altered. Why
didn't you get me?

242
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,919
I was on my way.

243
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,887
You can meet me there. Don't...

244
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,756
This could be
encephalitis or meningitis.

245
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,542
Damn it, Lucy, you
should've told me this

246
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,676
when you presented him.

247
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,796
He seemed fine. And I
was coming to get you.

248
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,164
Give him two of Ativan, IV push.

249
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,932
Lucy, check his
electrolytes, calcium,

250
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,367
thyroid panel and tox screen.

251
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,419
I'm gonna go get an LP kit.

252
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:54,787
Got your page. What have we got?

253
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,655
Insulinoma. Gretel
was having seizures.

254
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,924
Gretel? The patient?

255
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,126
Thought it neurological,
but workup was negative,

256
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,560
except for low blood glucose.

257
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:04,530
Which suggested an
insulin-producing adenoma.

258
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:06,565
CT of abdomen shows
a nodule in the pancreas.

259
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,301
I hope to God
it's not malignant.

260
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:09,735
Well, that's very caring of you.

261
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,804
Well, I am capable of
that, Lizzie, on occasion.

262
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,906
This being one of them.
Let's go. I want to see her.

263
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,107
Wait. I haven't even...

264
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,432
You can finish up
later. Come on, let's go.

265
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:20,363
She's ready for you, Dr. Romano.

266
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,948
There, there,
Gretel. There, there.

267
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,033
There, there. Good girl.

268
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,451
Robert, this is a dog.

269
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,835
Correction, Lizzie.
This is<i> my</i> dog.

270
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,390
Ativan put him right out.

271
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:33,492
Shh. Okay, draw the lidocaine.

272
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:35,745
One and four for cell count.

273
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,913
Protein and glucose in 2,

274
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,049
and Gram's stain
and culture in 3.

275
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,083
You got it.

276
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,270
Change over to a...
27-gauge needle.

277
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:45,505
I always do.

278
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,862
Very good. Okay. I'm ready.

279
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,027
Whoa. Whoa!

280
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,196
Hold him! Hold
him! What do I do?

281
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,114
Hold him! What are
you putting in? Stop!

282
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,416
Paul, relax. It's
okay. Just calm down.

283
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,818
Calm down. It's all right.

284
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,403
What are you
sticking in my back?

285
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,622
Malik, give him two of
Ativan. Lucy, keep going.

286
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:03,889
Oh. It'll be a traumatic tap.

287
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,474
We'll get blood
in the spinal fluid.

288
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,776
It's not gonna get any easier.

289
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,548
Okay. I feel some resistance.

290
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,033
Just keep advancing.

291
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:16,301
All right. I'm not
getting any fluid.

292
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:17,803
Did you feel a pop? No.

293
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:19,354
Keep going.

294
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,556
I can't.

295
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,731
Yes, you can. Stop, please.

296
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,879
You're hurting me. Please
stop. Check the stylet.

297
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,434
All right. We got it.

298
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,403
Great. CARTER: Paul.

299
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,488
Paul, just relax. Just relax.

300
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:36,956
Just relax.

301
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,076
Hey. Crystal clear. Good job.

302
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,482
Guess I have my breeds mixed up.

303
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,451
I always thought they
were wiry little runts.

304
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,586
More like that
Australian silky thing.

305
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,455
Nope, Alex. The
Bouvier is robust,

306
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,989
squarely built, well-muscled.

307
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,792
A hearty dog, then, you
could say, Dr. Romano.

308
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,260
Except for the pancreas.

309
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,329
Lizzie. Alex, how's Gretel's BP?

310
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,199
Uh, I don't know. We
don't have a dog cuff.

311
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,084
Then start an arterial line

312
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,703
and hook her to a monitor.

313
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,422
An arterial line? Just
pretend you're in dog lab.

314
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:10,739
That's what I'm doing.

315
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,525
Lizzie. I'm sorry, Robert.

316
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,011
I don't think it's proper to
be operating on your dog.

317
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,068
I'm chief of staff. Is that
proper enough for you?

318
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,366
Besides, what would
you have me do,

319
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,969
leave her to some
poodle surgeon?

320
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,543
Curved Crile to
clamp off that bleeder.

321
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,124
Dr. Hudson has
oat cell carcinoma?

322
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,360
We asked him about
previous hospitalizations.

323
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,762
Had six cycles of chemotherapy,

324
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,162
been in remission 15 months.

325
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,331
Now presents with
a mediastinal mass,

326
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,566
which is why he's flushed.

327
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,334
It's superior vena
cava syndrome.

328
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,237
The prognosis... A 25
percent one-year survival.

329
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,306
Which is why we should
blast him with radiation,

330
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,474
to shrink the tumor before

331
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,276
he gets elevated
intracranial pressure.

332
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,378
But recent literature
shows that chemotherapy

333
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,179
can reduce the tumor
in two to three days.

334
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,783
I think we should treat him
with platinum and VP-16.

335
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,440
Which does Dr. Hudson want?

336
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,305
Did you even ask him?

337
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,508
She didn't want to wait for...
I was about to, but Malucci...

338
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,443
All right, stop it, both of you.

339
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,545
Listen, I'm gonna check
in on another patient.

340
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,147
And then I'm gonna
go see Dr. Hudson.

341
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,766
I'll present him
with his options.

342
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,766
What are we gonna do?

343
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,538
You are going to watch
me and say nothing.

344
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,473
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Connelly?

345
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,575
Oh, pretty darn good here.

346
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,811
Pressure's 100/70.

347
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,145
The fluids we're giving you

348
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,379
are making you feel better.

349
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,783
Oh, no. I think it's
this young man here

350
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,352
who is making me feel better.

351
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,188
He gave me a
Valentine's Day card.

352
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,092
Oh, that's very
thoughtful of Yosh.

353
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,927
Could we get you anything?

354
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,429
Um... Well, I
am a little thirsty.

355
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,197
Okay. I'll get some ice chips.

356
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,100
Mm. Thanks.

357
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,502
Uh, I'm a little bit
chilly. Maybe you could

358
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,203
help me get my
sweater. Sweater? Sure.

359
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,294
Yes. Down there.

360
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,679
I didn't expect
a card this year.

361
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,548
What, with Barry gone. Huh.

362
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,018
I'm sorry about your husband.

363
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,520
Oh, he... He was awfully sweet

364
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,857
about these
little... celebrations

365
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,026
and anniversaries and things.

366
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,795
He always remembered. Ha.

367
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,997
Some of my lady friends

368
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,834
had to remind their
husbands. Heh.

369
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,002
I had to remind
mine he was married.

370
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,705
Oh, no. That... That's not good.

371
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,740
No, it definitely wasn't.

372
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:29,784
Well, huh... d-did
you, uh, see this pin?

373
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,232
Barry gave that to me last year.

374
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:36,001
I didn't bother to
tell him... that...

375
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:40,639
That he had given me the
exact same pin the year before.

376
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:43,025
Well, that was very kind of you.

377
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,459
Oh.

378
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,829
It's, uh... It's
lovely, isn't it?

379
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,281
Yes, it is.

380
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,604
Yes.

381
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,107
"Be still my heart."

382
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,388
Huh.

383
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:58,078
That's what Barry would say.

384
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,134
And I...

385
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,438
I still am.

386
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,271
I tried calling your wife again.

387
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:14,006
I got the machine.

388
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,008
Yeah. Well...

389
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:18,944
When she goes
sh-shopping with her friends...

390
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:22,247
I think she's getting me
something for Valentine's Day.

391
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:25,172
Paul, your spinal
tap was negative.

392
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,819
Well, you stuck me for nothing?

393
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,323
Well, we had to
rule out meningitis.

394
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,125
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

395
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,710
I have to go back to the diner.

396
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:35,810
What diner?

397
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,880
It's where I study. I
left my books there.

398
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,382
Do other students study there?

399
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,784
Sometimes. But usually
they go to the library,

400
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,935
because we had those
muggings a couple weeks ago.

401
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,055
Yeah, I think I read about that.

402
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,256
Yeah, it could happen again.

403
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,600
Someone tried to mug you?

404
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,429
Could've. It's a long
way from where I park,

405
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,815
and there are lot of
bushes that they could hide.

406
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,749
I tell you, I'd like to...

407
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:58,851
I'd like to go soon.

408
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,336
We have to do a CAT
scan of your head.

409
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,322
That... That's an x-ray,
right? Isn't that bad?

410
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:04,890
They shoot radiation
through you...

411
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,091
It's a low dose.

412
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,760
It's really not enough
to do any harm.

413
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,363
Lucy. CT's ready.

414
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,947
Okay. Thanks, Malik.
We'll be right there.

415
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,757
I did a hernia on a
gorilla once. Med school.

416
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,125
Dear God.

417
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,193
Funny. Gretel's
brother had a hernia.

418
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,829
Let me guess. Hansel?

419
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,532
Oh-ho. I'm sure you
all find it quite amusing

420
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,567
that I would care so
much about a dog.

421
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,570
There's so much about you
that we don't know, Robert.

422
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,040
What's going on?
She's tachycardic.

423
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,642
I think she's having a seizure.

424
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,009
We've lost her IV.

425
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,611
Making her hypoglycemic.

426
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,879
I can't get the line in.

427
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,181
Get me an amp of 50 percent
glucose. Get out of the way!

428
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,518
ET tube's come
out. She's hypoxic.

429
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,853
Well, tube her again, damn it!

430
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,143
She's in V-fib. Shirley,
get me the paddles.

431
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,926
Stand back, Robert. Hold on.

432
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,460
I said, stand back.

433
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,468
Clear!

434
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:08,254
Superior vena cava syndrome.

435
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,307
That gives me what? A year?

436
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,427
Radiation therapy is
the standard of care.

437
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,730
No. Chemotherapy is an option.

438
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,231
But it could take
two or three days

439
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:20,633
to resolve your symptoms.

440
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,134
And I'm worried
that the headache

441
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:23,736
you're experiencing
could indicate

442
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,038
elevated intracranial pressure.

443
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:28,541
I think it's more
likely a product

444
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:31,005
of listening to your
Residents argue.

445
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,429
That was a joke.

446
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,018
We can begin the
radiation therapy right away.

447
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,888
I had a patient
with SVC syndrome.

448
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:44,657
Went with radiation
and developed

449
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:46,641
a terrible esophagitis.

450
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,177
Pain, bleeding.

451
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,096
Couldn't eat for two months.

452
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,531
Well, If I've only got a year...

453
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:54,689
I at least want
to be able to eat.

454
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,138
I'll go with the
chemotherapy, Dr. Greene.

455
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,523
All right.

456
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,357
He had told the waitress at...

457
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,759
At the diner he was coming here.

458
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,027
Is that where you study?

459
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,996
No. We're in a group
that meets at the library.

460
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,364
But the last couple of
months, I don't know.

461
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,333
Did something happen?
He's gotten so weird.

462
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,702
I'd swear he's wearing the
same clothes all the time.

463
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,037
And what about his grades?

464
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,239
We went to college
together too. And he did well.

465
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,108
But he's been cutting classes
right and left since September.

466
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,277
So do you socialize
with him and his wife?

467
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,579
N-not so much anymore.

468
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,814
He keeps picking fights
with me about nothing.

469
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,082
Heh.

470
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,518
Keeps accusing me of
stealing his parking place.

471
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,453
Stupid stuff like that.

472
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,256
Is... Is it something serious?

473
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,891
We don't know enough yet.

474
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,425
Should I go in and see him?

475
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,849
Let him sleep. You
can see him later.

476
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,681
Yosh, what is it?

477
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,083
Pressure's down to
75. I paged Dr. Carter.

478
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:47,452
Mrs. Connelly?

479
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:49,454
Mrs. Connelly?!

480
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:50,611
What do you want to do?

481
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,704
Abby, what do you want to do?

482
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,848
Carter? Not now, Lucy.

483
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,850
Paul Sobriki, he doesn't
have a CNS infection.

484
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,953
It might be psychiatric.
I said not now, okay?

485
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,187
What happened?

486
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,122
Her pressure
dropped to 75, systolic.

487
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,390
I started her on dopamine,

488
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,658
10 mics per kilo per minute.

489
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,093
She's still not making urine.

490
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,162
You said she didn't want
any heroic measures.

491
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,130
She's in shock. I had
to get her pressure up.

492
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,932
Dopamine's a resuscitation drug.

493
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,623
She said no tubes or
machines. Dopamine's okay.

494
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,771
What if it's not enough?

495
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,140
I'm giving her more fluids.

496
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,874
She's on her
third liter of saline.

497
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,876
You'll put her into
congestive heart failure,

498
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,062
flood her lungs.

499
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,630
Then what?

500
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:33,814
You're gonna intubate?

501
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:37,002
Are you going to intubate?
I'll watch her closely

502
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,437
and stop the
fluids if I have to.

503
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,039
She'll have to be
admitted to the ICU.

504
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:42,707
Pressure's up to 90
on 10 mics of dopamine.

505
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,993
She's making some urine.

506
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,349
Good. Good, good.

507
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,903
It's working. Yeah, maybe.

508
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,405
What do you want? What
are you talking about?

509
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,074
That's enough, guys.
What's going on?

510
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,060
Paul's going off. He's
trying to mess with me.

511
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:02,561
This your patient?

512
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:04,963
It's Lucy's patient. Your
right. You're supervising.

513
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,032
He followed me down
here. No. I was concerned

514
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,934
when I heard he was here.
- Why's he up?

515
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,386
I don't know. I wanted
a... A drink of water.

516
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,905
Okay. OLIGARIO: Dr. Greene!

517
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,173
Chen and Malucci need
you. Dr. Hudson's gone south.

518
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:16,574
Go ahead. I'll
take care of this.

519
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,577
Uh, Malik, get Paul
settled back into his bed.

520
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,780
I don't want him to come.
He's not coming. Don't worry.

521
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,383
You all right? Yeah.

522
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:25,784
But I... I got to get back.

523
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,253
You'll tell that other doctor?

524
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:29,805
Yeah. Sure. GREENE:<i> Dr. Hudson?</i>

525
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,473
He's altered. Unarousable.

526
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,711
Elevated ICP. All right, Conni.

527
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,146
Get Radiation Oncology
fellow down here right away.

528
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,316
I'll call them. You're
gonna give him radiation?

529
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,784
He wanted chemotherapy.

530
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,386
He won't make it to chemo.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

531
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,555
We need to intubate. CHEN
AND MALUCCI: I'll do it!

532
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,379
Why don't I do it?

533
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,809
Feeling better, Paul?

534
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,043
I'm kind of tired.

535
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,867
Lucy? I'll be right back.

536
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,717
What is going on with
your patient? I was...

537
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,952
Dr. Greene pulled him
out of a fight with his friend.

538
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,521
Dr. Carter. Abby's
looking for you.

539
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:04,323
Thanks. He might
be schizophrenic.

540
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,008
He meets the DSM-IV criteria.

541
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,126
You page a Psych consult?

542
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,793
I was waiting to
present him to you.

543
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:10,629
Get them down
here, hand this guy off.

544
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,173
You got medical
patients waiting.

545
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:16,056
It's so hard to breathe.

546
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:19,137
How's she doing?

547
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:22,681
Pressure's down, 85/55
on maximum dopamine.

548
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:26,845
She's got rales all the
way up to the apices.

549
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,414
Pulmonary edema
from all the fluid.

550
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:29,415
You flooded her lungs.

551
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,583
She was hypotensive.

552
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,652
Still is.

553
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:34,653
Her BP's too low for

554
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:37,323
nitroglycerine or morphine.

555
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,724
You could try 40 of Lasix.

556
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:42,127
Pulse ox is down, 79
on 100 percent oxygen.

557
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,962
I'm going to intubate. No.

558
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:46,226
She has an
infection we can treat.

559
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,367
She only needs to be intubated

560
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,068
for a day or two
until it clears up.

561
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:51,092
You don't know that.

562
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,457
She's an elderly woman
with multiple organ failure.

563
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,725
You may never
be able to extubate.

564
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,094
And then what? She
spends the next two months

565
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,079
up in the ICU hooked up

566
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:02,547
to every machine known to man?

567
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,167
Yeah, I know. But I just want
to make sure that I... Hey.

568
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,891
It's not about what you want.

569
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,379
What happened when
she stopped breathing?

570
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,282
It's called
Cheyne-Stokes respiration.

571
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,083
It's associated
with heart failure.

572
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,342
Shh, shh.

573
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:34,012
You change your shirt?
Yeah. I saw four 6-year-olds.

574
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,715
I think maybe they
ate too many of those

575
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,250
little hearts you
warned me about.

576
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,585
All over me. Everywhere.

577
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,454
Welcome to the ER
on Valentine's Day.

578
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:45,324
Luka, Carol. Multiple trauma
coming in. Five minutes out.

579
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:47,548
Okay, prep the Trauma
Room. Meet you there.

580
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,813
Watch out for rebound
with the glucose.

581
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:54,049
We'll monitor her closely.
Does Gretel have insurance?

582
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,317
Ha. I think we've had

583
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,685
enough jokes for one day.

584
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,220
I wasn't joking. I understand
certain vets offer...

585
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,205
Oh, my God.

586
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:02,991
Oh, Elizabeth, there you are.

587
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,492
I visited nearly
every department

588
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,129
looking for y... Good heavens.

589
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,697
Mother, this is
Dr. Robert Romano.

590
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,083
Um... Robert,

591
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:13,251
this is my mother,
Isabelle Corday.

592
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:15,704
She's visiting from
London<i> briefly.</i>

593
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,006
Lizzie never mentioned
a thing. It's a pleasure.

594
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,574
Likewise.

595
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,644
We... This, I take it, is
not the laser angioplasty.

596
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,046
No. No, this is, uh, Gretel,

597
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,914
who has been suffering
from an insulinoma.

598
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,083
But thanks to a brilliant
assist by your daughter,

599
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,284
she's going to be just fine.

600
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,070
Yes, well, I know how
hard Elizabeth trained.

601
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:34,639
Mother, perhaps we should...
How are you enjoying Chicago?

602
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,241
I'm here for a
series of lectures.

603
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:39,027
Adaptive Optics,
Wave-Particle Duality.

604
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,746
Heh-ugh. I don't know why
you'd want to tax your mind

605
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,864
with that gobbledygook.

606
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,899
We have a wonderful
city. Great shopping.

607
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,535
I'm giving the lectures.

608
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,054
Well, I should probably get
Gretel settled in Recovery.

609
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:51,990
It was very nice
meeting you. And you.

610
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,126
Please don't ask about the dog.

611
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,462
Wouldn't dream of it.
Was it an Old English?

612
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:59,498
Bouvier. Uh... I'm
being paged to the ER.

613
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,633
Oh, I don't think
I've seen that yet.

614
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,018
Good. Good.

615
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,486
Did I hear multiple trauma?

616
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,421
Yeah. MVA. Mom,
dad and two kids.

617
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,689
Help me with this one.

618
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,291
Thirty eight-year-old woman,
front-seat passenger in MVA.

619
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,561
Ejected 20 feet from
vehicle. Pulseless and apneic.

620
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,897
Tubed her. Two liters
of saline en route.

621
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,533
Robby Edelstein, 11,
rear-seat passenger. Restrained.

622
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,867
Complains of left wrist pain.

623
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,519
Alert and oriented. No LOC.

624
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,371
BP is 110/68. Pulse, 110.

625
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,839
And we've got
Julia Edelstein, 5.

626
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,208
Also a rear-seat passenger.

627
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,044
No head trauma. No LOC.

628
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,478
Multiple facial abrasions.

629
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,981
BP is 104/60. Pulse is 96.

630
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,683
What was your name, sweetie?

631
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,551
Julia. Where's Mommy?

632
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,802
Come on, baby. Come on.

633
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,871
What is it? Multiple
trauma. MVA.

634
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,807
Hey, Peter, this is my
mother. How are you?

635
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:45,143
You better stay here.
Oh, yes, of course.

636
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,646
A-aren't they bringing my
dad? I'm sure they are, Robby.

637
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,113
Where did they take Mommy?

638
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:50,615
They're helping
her. Don't worry.

639
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:52,601
Let's go help the two of you.

640
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:56,170
All right, let's go, let's go.
On my count. One, two, three.

641
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,438
Driver needed extrication.

642
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,840
The husband? I think so.

643
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,609
Hold compressions.
Heart rate at 40.

644
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,276
No Pulse. She's in P.E.A.

645
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,112
Pulse ox, 82.
She's pretty dusky.

646
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,615
Resume compressions. Set
up for bilateral chest tubes.

647
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,183
Your wrist sore? A little.

648
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,285
Can you tell me what happened?

649
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,554
Well, A car hit us. It
was going really fast.

650
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,723
Robby. Robby.

651
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:15,991
Let's make sure you're okay.

652
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:16,992
Come back.

653
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,326
I was sitting behind Mommy,

654
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,862
and I hit my face
on a broken window.

655
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,196
We're gonna get those scrapes

656
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,197
cleaned right up.

657
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,716
Hit your head or pass out?

658
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,850
No.

659
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,719
What about you, Julia?

660
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,638
Can I go see my mom?

661
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,073
We got a 41-year-old
man, restrained driver,

662
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,142
with significant
passenger-space intrusion.

663
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,211
The fire department had to
extricate him. Lost his pulse.

664
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,798
No time to tube him. Broke the
steering wheel with his chest...

665
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:42,284
Here we go. One, two, three.

666
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,019
Anything?

667
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,755
Looks like tension
pneumo on the left.

668
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,222
Let's get a 14-gauge needle.

669
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,347
Betadine. I'll intubate.
Eight ET tube.

670
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:04,389
Why don't you sit down

671
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:05,390
so I can examine you?

672
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:06,591
No, thank you.

673
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:09,645
Ow. It's probably just a sprain.

674
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,513
And how about you? Is this sore?

675
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,949
What? Aren't they
gonna let us see Dad?

676
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,118
They'll let us know, honey.

677
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,919
I'll clean up these
abrasions with saline

678
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,154
and put on some ointment.

679
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,189
Thanks. Let's get a
left-wrist film for Robby

680
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,407
and keep him in the splint.

681
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:24,543
And order a right-knee
film for Julia. Okay.

682
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,595
My knee's okay. I
wanna go see my mom.

683
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,280
Twelve hundred cc's
out the chest tube.

684
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,483
Run in two units of O-neg
and set me up on the left.

685
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,618
Pulse ox is down to 73.
What's on the monitor?

686
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,787
V-fib. Charge the
paddles to 200.

687
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,251
Stand by with epi.

688
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,125
And clear. HATHAWAY: Clear.

689
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,928
Charge to 300. What's your plan?

690
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:45,047
Two chest tubes and
a pericardiocentesis.

691
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,748
Clear.

692
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,351
Good rush of air.
Hold on compressions.

693
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,685
I've got a pulse.

694
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,054
Let's try for a pressure.
Lily, chest-tube tray.

695
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,155
Let's prep the left side.

696
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,740
Get some sterile
gloves. Let's move.

697
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,325
Systolic, 60 palp.
That's a start.

698
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,460
Keep the O-neg coming.

699
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,362
Let's get 4 units
of type-specific.

700
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,451
Ten blade.

701
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:03,899
Call for a vent.

702
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,284
Thirty-two French.

703
00:27:05,308 --> 00:27:06,485
How are they doing?

704
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:07,675
Doesn't look so good.

705
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:10,572
Clear.

706
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,839
Just keep your elbow

707
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,108
at a right angle like this.

708
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,848
Thanks.

709
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:17,562
Ow. That hurts?

710
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:18,586
A little.

711
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,668
Hook him up now! - Peter.

712
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:25,019
Come on, people, let's move!

713
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,639
Let's start him on 100%.

714
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:29,774
AC of 14, 800 tidal volume.

715
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,209
Whoa, whoa, he's bleeding out.

716
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,293
Lost the pulse!

717
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,477
Start compressions! Julia.

718
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:36,548
Where are you going?

719
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,816
We've still gotta fix you up.

720
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,941
Why don't you come back with me?

721
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,741
Sixty cc's out.

722
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,025
Another liter out the chest.

723
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:48,543
You want to keep
autotransfusing?

724
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,632
No.

725
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,019
Hold compressions.

726
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:58,003
Asystole.

727
00:27:58,027 --> 00:27:59,371
That's it.

728
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:01,745
Time of death, 15:35.

729
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,384
Please be sure she's cleaned up.

730
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:19,958
How's he doing?

731
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:21,560
He's bleeding out
through his chest.

732
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,744
Wife's dead.

733
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,498
Should we prep
for a thoracotomy?

734
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,100
It's a full arrest
from blunt trauma.

735
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,285
Thoracotomy won't help.

736
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,070
Isn't there something
else we can try?

737
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,539
Uh, he probably tore his aorta.

738
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,963
We can't save him. You
can stop compressions.

739
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,523
Asystole.

740
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,878
Time of death, 15:37.

741
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,819
What should we do
about the children?

742
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,437
I'll tell them.

743
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,672
I'll go with you.

744
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:09,391
Lily, can you
make sure...? Yeah.

745
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,039
Both their parents are dead.

746
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:42,623
Oh, God. Uh... Well,
what are we gonna do?

747
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,825
We need to let them know.

748
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,610
Cleo. That little asthma boy,

749
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:47,729
Neal Hartford, his
sats are dropping,

750
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,431
and he's starting
to have retractions.

751
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,388
Thanks, Lydia. Um... It's okay.

752
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:56,288
Robby and Julia.

753
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:58,345
Thanks.

754
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:00,725
Hello, Robby.

755
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:02,627
Julia.

756
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,562
I'm Dr. Kovac, and, uh,

757
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,731
this is Nurse Hathaway.

758
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:07,732
I'll wait outside.

759
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:09,856
No. Please stay.

760
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:12,637
We need to talk
to you for a minute

761
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:15,423
about your mom and dad.

762
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:19,094
As you know, the
accident was pretty bad.

763
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:21,179
The car was going really fast.

764
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:22,380
Yeah.

765
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,851
We and the other
doctors worked really hard

766
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:27,986
to help your parents,

767
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,440
but their injuries were
very, very serious.

768
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:36,044
And despite everything
we tried to do,

769
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,363
we were not able to save them.

770
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:40,753
And they died.

771
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:48,006
But I know they
would be so relieved

772
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,163
to know that you're both okay.

773
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:00,641
I wanna see them.

774
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,709
Okay. Then I'll tell
you what to expect

775
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,444
when we go in the room.

776
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,845
To help them breathe,

777
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,014
we put a tube in the mouth,

778
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,066
and that will still be there.

779
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:20,138
You will see other tubes
under the collarbone

780
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:21,706
and in the arm, that we used

781
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,012
to give them medicine.

782
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,127
And they had a lot

783
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,295
of scrapes and bruises
from the accident.

784
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:56,607
Oh. Okay.

785
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:58,276
Okay, it's all right.

786
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,460
It's all right.

787
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:22,903
It's all right.

788
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,336
Mom.

789
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,154
You're early.

790
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:17,221
I didn't wanna miss

791
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,689
the Valentine's Day parties. ER?

792
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,357
Seeing as how you
missed decorating.

793
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,592
Luck of the schedule.

794
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:23,494
At least she's willing
to answer the phones.

795
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:25,296
Dr. Hudson's starting
to make movements.

796
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,563
Oh, that's a good sign.

797
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,666
Well, the Doctors Chen
and Malucci are with him.

798
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,817
Doing nothing, I hope.

799
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,402
Dr. Greene, he's
starting to make...

800
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,170
I know, purposeful movements.

801
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,572
Ahem. Dr. Hudson...

802
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,906
could you take a deep breath in

803
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,074
and then exhale?

804
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,677
Dr. Malucci. Good
NIF and tidal volume.

805
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:42,246
Okay. Dr. Hudson...
we can extubate you

806
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,581
if you're ready.

807
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,750
All right. Take
another deep breath in.

808
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,374
And exhale.

809
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:50,443
Okay.

810
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:52,857
Very good.

811
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,858
What happened?

812
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:54,859
Dr. Chen?

813
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:55,926
You had papilledema

814
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,695
and elevated
intracranial pressure.

815
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,664
We did radiation.

816
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:02,533
They'll take you upstairs
and take it from there.

817
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:04,736
I guess I owe you my thanks

818
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,371
for going against my wishes.

819
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,840
Well, it did set a bad
example for my Residents,

820
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:09,864
but you're welcome.

821
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:15,196
So looks like radiation was

822
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,497
the right call after all, huh?

823
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,865
Chemotherapy would've worked

824
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,767
if he hadn't had
increased ICP. Yeah, but...

825
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,168
Dr. Chen, Dr. Malucci, you know

826
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,503
why I only had one child?

827
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,371
Because I didn't wanna
listen to of two them

828
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,207
arguing in the
back seat of the car.

829
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,976
I know you don't know
what she looks like,

830
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,777
but I don't suppose
you've seen my mother?

831
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,045
I do know what she looks like.

832
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,546
I met her. We had
a nice little chat.

833
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,915
She's delightful.

834
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,417
And we're all going out
to dinner tonight. We?

835
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,886
Yeah, you, me, your
mother and my father.

836
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,655
Well, how did that
happen? I'm not sure.

837
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,724
She kind of has a
certain way about her.

838
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,326
But I'm going in a few
minutes to pick up my dad.

839
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,796
I think she's over at Doc
Magoo's having a coffee.

840
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,297
Mother!

841
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,034
I thought I'd lost you. No.

842
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,618
By now I know this place
like the back of my hand.

843
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,706
I met your Mark.

844
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,897
Yeah, so I understand.

845
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,377
And...?

846
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,046
He has a way about
him, doesn't he?

847
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,448
Arranging this dinner tonight.

848
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,517
He seems to want
me to meet his father.

849
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,085
Don't be silly.

850
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,855
Oh, that's all
right. I don't mind.

851
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,657
By the way, Elizabeth,
I had no idea.

852
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,892
About what?

853
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,929
About what you
do. I had no idea.

854
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,298
This coffee's a bit weak.

855
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,866
You can have some
more after dinner.

856
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,401
Oh. I'm sure by then,
I'll be on to the gin.

857
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,022
Paul, what are
you doing in here?

858
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,724
I... I wanted a cup of coffee,

859
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:34,225
and the nurse guy
wasn't around...

860
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:35,760
Let's get you back to your room.

861
00:35:35,784 --> 00:35:36,995
You're having a party here.

862
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,379
For Valentine's Day. Let's go.

863
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:40,832
Shouldn't it be bigger?

864
00:35:40,856 --> 00:35:42,000
Shouldn't it be red?

865
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,935
Come on, Dad, they are waiting.

866
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,404
I don't like being set up, Mark.

867
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:48,306
You're not being set up.

868
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,740
It is freezing out here.

869
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,509
I imagine this was
Elizabeth's idea.

870
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,111
Not that I don't like her.

871
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:54,845
Dad, it's just dinner.

872
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:57,047
Mark, this is not
my first barbecue.

873
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,016
For God's sakes, your
mother hasn't been gone

874
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,017
but for five months.

875
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,086
Okay, fine. You stay here.

876
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,287
I'm going in.

877
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:05,623
She's a Brit too, huh?

878
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:07,291
Yeah, Dad, she's British.

879
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,959
We should've had
'em over to our house.

880
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:10,761
We could have played
that Tom Jones album.

881
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,520
Would you rather just go home?

882
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,936
Lucy?

883
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,793
I'll be right back.

884
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:23,074
What happened to Psych?

885
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,775
I called them twice.
They're backed up.

886
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:26,577
You've got to pick up
some other patients.

887
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,578
I just found him in the...

888
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,980
Have you sutured
the leg lac yet?

889
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:30,348
I've got the chart here. Good.

890
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:31,615
Let Malik stay with this guy.

891
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,172
Just forget it, Carter.

892
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,272
You know, my father's
convinced that this was your idea.

893
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:38,572
My mother thinks it was yours.

894
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,441
I tell you, she was
straddling the patient,

895
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,176
pumping on his chest.

896
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,177
That's nothing.

897
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,845
Mark saved this chopper pilot

898
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,514
down in San Diego last year.

899
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,150
Kid had a tension
pneumatic something.

900
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,719
Shoved a tube right
in the side of his chest.

901
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,389
I-I saw Elizabeth put a tube
right down a man's throat.

902
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,990
I should think
that's more difficult

903
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,358
than putting it into his chest.

904
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,826
How's it going? Yeah,

905
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,095
but we're talking about a
whole corps of Navy pilots.

906
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,097
Elizabeth was trying
to save an entire family.

907

908
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,300

it as an object lesson.

Sorry?

976
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:35,926
Well, Gigi. Gigi was
in love with Gaston.

977
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,629
But Gaston only wanted
her to be his courtesan.

978
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:41,198
Now, at first she agreed,
and her great aunt

979
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:42,867
and her grandmother
gave her lessons.

980
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:44,368
But then Gigi was unhappy.

981
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:45,502
So she told Gaston...

982
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,938
Elizabeth, please, stop, okay?

983
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,073

00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,001
You know, there's
warmer places to be alone.

987
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,703
There's a furnace
room in the basement.

988
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,295
And, uh, the incubators
up in the NICU.

989
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,426
I'd like to see you in an
incubator in the NICU.

990
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,195
I'm happy to try.

991
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,320
Well...

992
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:23,623
Y... you know, all those
years as an OB nurse...

993
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,565
98% of what you
see is just pure joy.

994
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:29,046
You know, it's the happiest day

995
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,032
of most people's lives.

996
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:34,677
And, um... the
tragedy is horrible.

997
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,405
Because it's a life cut short,

998
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:40,090
and it's a mom with a baby.

999
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:41,947
True.

1000
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,011
Today was the first day

1001
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,145
I saw an old person die,

1002
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,529
and I guess I'm
just not used to it.

1003
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:51,924
Well, you want the good
news or the bad news?

1004
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,255
Give me the bad.

1005
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,923
You never get used to it.

1006
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,282
The good news is,
you never get used to it.

1007
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,084
At least, I haven't.

1008
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,183

up here to be alone...

1009
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,340
but you're not.

1010
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,841

1011
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,611

1012
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:17,979
