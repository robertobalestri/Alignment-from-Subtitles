1
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,192
Luka! What is that,
Croatian for "lucky"?

2
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,594
No. Luke.

3
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,995
You sure? Yeah.

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,097
Huh. What's the matter,
buddy? You're dragging.

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,767
I worked four shifts
in last three days.

6
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,836
We are 200 charts
behind in coding.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,271
And I haven't done
one QA in the last week.

8
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,940
Come on, man. Pull
yourself together.

9
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:32,676
Prove your mettle, and I'll
anoint you temporary chief.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,977
Or not. Anyway, listen.

11
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,411
There was a hole
in the schedule,

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,180
so I slugged you
into the midnight shift.

13
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,582
Tonight? Or tomorrow morning.

14
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,683
Depends on your view.

15
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,084
Nah, come on.
I'm not doing this.

16
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,519
Luka, Luka, Luka, listen to me.

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,320
This is important,
because no truer words

18
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,522
have ever been spoken.

19
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,106
The last four letters in
"American" are "I can."

20
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,027
All right, let me
put it another way.

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,430
Cover this, and I'll owe
you. Don't, and you're fired.

22
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,665
When is Kerry coming back?

23
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,249
Who says she is?

24
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,371
Randi, can you tell Mark
I'm running across the street...

25
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,539
Will you get me a doughnut?

26
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,974
Sixteen-year-old driver,

27
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,342
single vehicle MVA,
crashed into a guardrail.

28
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,811
Cleo, need help? I've got it.

29
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,312
Do you know where
they took the car?

30
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,414
It was still there. They'll
take it somewhere?

31
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,417
We'll find out. BP
is 130/85. Pulse 110.

32
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,921
No LOC. Complains
of abdominal pain.

33
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,105
Do you have neck pain? No.

34
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,641
Okay, I'm going to take this
off. But don't move your head.

35
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,476
I've only had my
license two weeks.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,177
This is the first time
he let me drive it.

37
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,362
Any pain here? No.

38
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,547
Okay, look at me. I'm okay.

39
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,548
Now look at the nurse.

40
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:29,699
Can I use the phone?

41
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,368
Soon as the doctor's done.

42
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,269
Neck is clear. Okay,
roll away from me.

43
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,472
And we're gonna get you
off this board. All right?

44
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,106
Pulse ox 99 on 2 liters.

45
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,408
Okay. Did the airbag deploy?

46
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,709
It's a '65 Mustang.

47
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,578
It doesn't have an
airbag, just a seat belt.

48
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,080
No shoulder strap?
No. He's gonna kill me.

49
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,382
Okay. I'm sure your father

50
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,333
is more concerned about
you than he is his car.

51
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,352
You don't know my father.

52
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,020
Chest is clear.

53
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,355
Does this hurt? No.

54
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,723
Here? Aah!

55
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,425
I-I... I think the belt
caught me there.

56
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,027
It's a good thing
you were wearing it.

57
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,146
Okay. CBC, chem
panel, UA chest x-ray,

58
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,814
abdominal CT with contrast,

59
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,282
and let's get a
surgical consult.

60
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:05,051
Hit the brakes. I-I
can't believe this.

61
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:06,319
Insurance will pay for it.

62
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,154
It's a classic.
They just can't fix it.

63
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,372
Sure they can.

64
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,075
Eli, look at me.

65
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,044
We call them
accidents for a reason.

66
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:15,779
Now, you might
think this is a big deal,

67
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,297
but it's gonna be okay.

68
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,804
Really.

69
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,151
Can I get some extra napkins

70
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,421
and more water, please?

71
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,155
Morning, ladies.

72
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,458
No offense, but
you look like hell.

73
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,226
Yeah. If you haven't noticed,

74
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,461
we're short in Attending.

75
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,262
Yeah, it's been pretty quiet.

76
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,564
For you maybe.

77
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,899
Come on, Kate. You
gotta finish, honey.

78
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,701
So you got them
into daycare, huh?

79
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,703
Yeah. They usually
don't take 'em this early.

80
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,905
I had to talk them into it.

81
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,240
Yeah. They're just
advanced for their age.

82
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,808
I couldn't afford
a nanny anymore.

83
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,028
Sweetie? Please?
Please? A couple bites.

84
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,529
I don't blame her.

85
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:51,581
What? What is that?

86
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,366
It's rice cereal. She likes it.

87
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,784
Yeah, I can see.

88
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,753
Well, she's just mad
because I fed Tess first.

89
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,988
Uh-huh. Come on,
Kate, we're gonna be late.

90
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,990
Sweetie, please. Here,
let me try. Let me try.

91
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,692
Good luck. I swear this one's

92
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,859
gonna get me gray hair.

93
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,562
Yeah, just wait till
she's 14. Oh, yeah.

94
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,799
Oh, how gorgeous. Oh, thank you.

95
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,467
Girls? Yeah.

96
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,470
Oh. They look like angels.

97
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,440
Yeah. Looks can be deceiving.

98
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,677
I don't believe
that. No, I don't.

99
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,278
Now, look. You don't
give your mommy

100
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,280
and daddy any trouble, do you?

101
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,766
Beautiful family.

102
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,073
Yes, it is. - Quit it.

103
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,241
Aidan, now, please.

104
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,077
He pushed me. MOTHER:
Wyatt, stop. Wyatt!

105
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,980
Wait. Hold on a sec. Are
these all your children?

106
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,648
Yes. No wonder you collapsed.

107
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,885
BP's a little low at
95/70, tachy at 120.

108
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,287
Wyatt, come here now.

109
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,738
There's a candy bar
stuck. I think I can get it.

110
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,858
I said, come here. Hey,
Zadro, you babysitting?

111
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:42,992
LOC in a grocery store.

112
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,661
Couldn't leave
them in the produce.

113
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,629
Here, try this. Hey.

114
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,631
Say thank you, Wyatt. Thanks.

115
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,300
You're welcome.
Where are we going?

116
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,802
Exam 2. Abrasion
to the right temple.

117
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,438
I think I hit my head on
a shelf. Mommy, mommy.

118
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,507
Have you ever
fainted before? No.

119
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,075
I was feeling a little dizzy,
but I think I'm just tired.

120
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,378
She vomited in the rig and
complains of double vision.

121
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,113
Mouth and lips are dry.

122
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,016
Is that bad? Ah, It's
probably just dehydration.

123
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,819
Whoops. Ha-ha, ha. I
think his diaper's leaking.

124
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,922
I'm sorry. He pulls
at it sometimes.

125
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,591
Look, Mom, I got two.
You have to share.

126
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,160
No, these are mine.
Share it with your brother.

127
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,763
Dr. Greene, your dad's
nurse is on the phone.

128
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,433
Okay. You got this? I think so.

129
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,335
Here. You wanna get down? Yeah.

130
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,303
I thought Tech Support
was gonna fix this.

131
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,706
I paged them twice. They're
waiting on the software guy.

132
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,841
Which line? Two.

133
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,943
Mrs. Fredriksson?
I can't get my labs.

134
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,945
Usually Dr. Weaver
calls and yells at them.

135
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,113
Look, don't worry what
he says. You work for me.

136
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,483
Mark, do you know where
the extra T-sheets are?

137
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,018
There is no abdominal pain
and no shortness of breath.

138
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,520
I don't know. It's
Kerry's system.

139
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,856
How long is this
suspension going to last?

140
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,326
Look... Uh, look, just, uh,
grab a general adult form. Okay.

141
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,128
Uh-uh. Listen, I understand
all that, of course.

142
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,466
No one is questioning
your qualifications.

143
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,968
He is? All right, let
me speak to him.

144
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,837
Someone called for
a surgical consult?

145
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,037
Dr. Finch, Trauma Two.

146
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,440
Well, tell him I
wanna speak to him.

147
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,543
All right, well, tell him
that I said to knock it off.

148
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,311
I'm... I'm sorry,
Mrs. Fredriksson.

149
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,946
Just bear with me, okay?

150
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,314
Uh... Uh, I'll be home tonight,

151
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,816
and we'll straighten
this all out.

152
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,785
Okay. Thank you.

153
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,653
Is everything all
right? Yeah, it's fine.

154
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,522
We're out of the
general forms too.

155
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,123
Okay, well, go back
to the old charts.

156
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,725
There should be a
stack in the lounge.

157
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,328
Um, do we have a
forwarding address for Lucy?

158
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,697
She got something here? Yeah,

159
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,499
the National Resident
Matching Program.

160
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,701
Oh, God. They forgot
to pull her application.

161
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,469
Yeah, so this means
some hospital thinks

162
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,137
that she's working
for them next year.

163
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,439
Somebody should call them.

164
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,007
Should we send it to her mom?

165
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,275
I don't know.

166
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,976
Well, what should I do with it?

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,311
I'll take care of it.

168
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,513
Carter, are you sure? I...

169
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,947
No, no, I got it.

170
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:45,971
All right.

171
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,591
- He's so cute.
- I can do that.

172
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,875
Really, you don't have to.

173
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,009
It's not a problem.

174
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,128
I feel a lot better already.
Ian, put that down.

175
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,266
Come here, please.
I said, come here.

176
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,068
Wow. Four kids under
8. That's very ambitious.

177
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,271
Five. The baby's
home with the neighbor.

178
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,690
I asked you to
please stop, didn't I?

179
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:12,358
Wyatt, stop that.

180
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:13,960
You're probably just exhausted.

181
00:07:13,984 --> 00:07:15,979
But we're still
gonna do a head CT.

182
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,064
Wyatt, that's enough. Please?

183
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:19,616
And I'm giving you some saline.

184
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,867
What's a CT?

185
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,902
A CAT scan. It's a
picture of your brain.

186
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,670
Good news. A volunteer
down in Pedes ward

187
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,489
agreed to watch
the kids down there.

188
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,823
I don't wanna be any trouble.

189
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,007
Oh, it's no trouble.

190
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,493
You kids wanna go play? Yeah!

191
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,129
No. OLIGARIO:
We've got Nintendo.

192
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,664
Do you have "Super Smash Bros."?

193
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,266
Oh, I don't know. They
got something with a gorilla.

194
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,568
Come on, sweetheart.
Wyatt, hold Emily's hand.

195
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,003
Help me, help me. Okay.

196
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,006
Ian, follow your
brother. Bye-bye.

197
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,007
Okay, guitar. Guitar.

198
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,574
I need the guitar. Mommy.

199
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,209
- Thank you.
- You're lucky.

200
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,153
We're gonna have a
lot of fun. Bye, baby.

201
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,565
Okay, here you go.

202
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:55,123
Ah. Let's go.

203
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:58,688
How do you do it?

204
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,256
One day at a time.

205
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,159
Good bowel sounds. Any nausea?

206
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,277
No.

207
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,412
There's no guarding or rebound.

208
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:08,514
There was rebounding before.

209
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,249
Eli, what happened?

210
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:12,318
I had an accident. With the car?

211
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,403
I lost control. Sorry.
How fast were you going?

212
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,738
I don't know! I didn't think...

213
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,256
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,008
The car is bad,
Dad. It's no big deal.

215
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,527
Mr. Emerson, I'm Dr. Finch.

216
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:22,695
What's wrong with him?

217
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,730
We may need to perform
exploratory surgery

218
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,132
to rule out any internal injury.

219
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,133
Oh, God.

220
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,634
That's probably not necessary.

221
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,752
You don't know?

222
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,387
We'll need to observe
him for a while.

223
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,323
Let's keep him NPO and
check his CBC every six hours.

224
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,225
Sure. You have a minute?

225
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,648
Yep.

226
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,231
I'll do whatever it takes to
replace it, Dad. I promise.

227
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,465
I don't care about the car.

228
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,501
I can get another car.

229
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,287
He has a lap belt injury.

230
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,889
That doesn't mean
he needs surgery.

231
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,223
Let's wait on the CT.

232
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,058
CT is only 20 percent sensitive

233
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,393
for small bowel perforation.

234
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,895
You should explore
him either way.

235
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,830
He has no peritoneal
signs. He did.

236
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,799
Well, not that I appreciated.

237
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:02,134
You asked for a surgical
opinion. I've given you one.

238
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,270
Let me know what
the CT shows, okay?

239
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,371
The ICON is positive.
She's pregnant.

240
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:07,572
The woman with all the kids?

241
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,675
Yeah. Her quant beta
puts her at eight weeks.

242
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,811
Albumin is low, and
there's ketones in her urine.

243
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,279
No time to eat, I guess.

244
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,114
I take it this wasn't a
planned pregnancy.

245
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,116
Who knows? Maybe
she wants a softball team.

246
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,350
She already go to CT?

247
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,952
Five minutes ago.

248
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,921
All right. Call Radiology
and let them know,

249
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,856
and then talk to
her about her diet.

250
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,325
Um, Carol, do we have any
Materna vitamins down here?

251
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:27,693
Try the drug lockup. Thank you.

252
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,195
Mark, can you sign
a purchase order

253
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,696
for central-line
kits? We're low.

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,798
Sure. Where? Right there.

255
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,701
Now sign out three cases,
and put two and initial.

256
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,169
It's this game I
play with Kerry.

257
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,637
I-I need two, so
I ask for three.

258
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,439
So every time...
Don't ask, Mark.

259
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,507
She gets to manage,
I get what I need.

260
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,176
Okay. Whatever it takes.

261
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,011
Thanks. Maybe
I'll have you sign off

262
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:47,146
on some crash carts too.

263
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,602
Bring it on. I'm easy.

264
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,917
Hey, Carol.

265
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,319
Patient with pyelonephritis.

266
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,720
Can you give a dose of Levaquin?

267
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:55,754
Sure.

268
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,190
Did the girls settle in? Yeah.

269
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,358
They seem to like it?

270
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,026
Well, I don't know.
They're babies.

271
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,928
Yeah. I'd worry about the staff.

272
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:05,331
You know, "The Hathaway
twins hit daycare."

273
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,465
Ross.

274
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,400
Their last name is Ross.

275
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:09,504
Right. Yeah.

276
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,287
Sorry.

277
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,822
No. Don't worry about it.

278
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,190
They're fine. They'll be fine.

279
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,491
Good. Good.

280
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,910
And, uh, run in a
lit... Liter of saline.

281
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,567
Okay.

282
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:25,034
Mr. Simpson? SIMPSON: Yes.

283
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,435
I'm Dr. Kovac.

284
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,204
You experience some chest pain?

285
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,706
Oh, it's not really pain. It
just feels tight, you know?

286
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,074
How long does it last?

287
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,542
A few seconds.

288
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,212
I tell you, I think I'm
having anxiety attacks.

289
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,015
I can't breathe, my heart
starts pounding, I get sweaty.

290
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,683
Do you have a history
of heart disease? No.

291
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,418
What brings it on?

292
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,322
My wife. I'm going
through a bad divorce.

293
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,611
Oh. I see.

294
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,193
Does the pain move
anywhere else?

295
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,395
Doc, I got aches
and pains all over.

296
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,996
I swear, she gets
up every morning

297
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,749
thinking how she can
screw with me that day.

298
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:59,836
Okay. Let's get a 12-lead EKG...

299
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,237
and draw cardiac labs.

300
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,222
You married, doc?

301
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,223
No.

302
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,541
Stay that way.

303
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,009
It's not enough
she bankrupts me,

304
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,344
and she uses my son against me,

305
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,846
she's putting me
in an early grave.

306
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,631
We'll see what we
can do about that, huh?

307
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,599
Yeah. Heh.

308
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:15,300
Yeah.

309
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,092
There.

310
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,586
Looks like a good heartbeat.

311
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,294
By the time I get one to sleep,

312
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:29,098
another one's hungry
or needs changing, or...

313
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,568
somebody's into
something he shouldn't be.

314
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,403
Do you have any help?

315
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,289
My husband works a lot of hours.

316
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:38,190
You should see our grocery bill.

317
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,260
Well... you're
gonna have to start

318
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,662
taking better care of yourself.

319
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,147
You're seriously malnourished.

320
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,815
You're gonna have
to start eating more

321
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,183
and taking prenatal vitamins.

322
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,327
I got you a starter pack.

323
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,076
Did you know you were pregnant?

324
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,641
How long have you known?

325
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,238
I don't know.

326
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,092
Have you told your husband?

327
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:11,179
No.

328
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,196
And you were fasting?

329
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,365
No. No.

330
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,033
I just don't have time to eat.

331
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:23,069
You weren't, uh...

332
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,693
starving yourself, trying to
induce a miscarriage, were you?

333
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,326
We both wanted a
big family. I just thought

334
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,012
I'd get a break before
we tried again, that's all.

335
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,881
Well, your body's always
gonna protect the fetus first.

336
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,749
But you're putting
your own health at risk.

337
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:40,035
You could develop heart
problems or kidney trouble.

338
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,551
Were you trying to
terminate this pregnancy?

339
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,457
Well, there are
safer ways to do that.

340
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:03,103
Have you considered an abortion?

341
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,301
I can't have another
baby right now. I just can't.

342
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,122
Another Webril.

343
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:18,124
Poor guy slips in the
bathtub, breaks his neck.

344
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,791
This woman falls
down an entire flight

345
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,660
of concrete steps
and cracks her wrist.

346
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,596
One of the benefits of
alcohol consumption.

347
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,499
I could do with a
margarita myself.

348
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:28,501
Between the pregnancy
and breastfeeding,

349
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,369
I don't remember the
last time I had a drink.

350
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,871
It's not the "no alcohol,"
it's the "no caffeine"

351
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,140
that I couldn't deal with.

352
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:36,409
Thanks, Mark.

353
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,577
Three-inch roll.

354
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,546
I'm thinking of weaning them.

355
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,014
It's been six
months. I don't know

356
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,383
how much longer I can deal.

357
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,385
I can't believe that
you've lasted this long.

358
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,721
So you don't think I'm
being a terrible mother?

359
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,423
If you planned on
being the perfect parent,

360
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,959
you might as well fail now...

361
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,733
while they can't remember.

362
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,502
Another three-inch.

363
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,156
You okay?

364
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:06,860
They deserve a father, Mark.

365
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,530
Doug's been seeing them.

366
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,445
He asked me to
move to Seattle again.

367
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:17,037
And, uh... I think
he's serious this time.

368
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:18,918
What did you tell him?

369
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,761
Do you have a second?

370
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,307
Go ahead. I got this.

371
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,097
Okay.

372
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,597
What's up?

373
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,066
She was starving herself,
hoping she'd miscarry.

374
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,534
"Supermom"? Yeah.

375
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,503
I may have talked her
into having an abortion.

376
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:38,637
She didn't ask for one?

377
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,573
Well, she's scared.

378
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:41,677
Come here.

379
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,776
She doesn't want
her husband to know.

380
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,412
Apparently he's
very controlling.

381
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,314
You need to refer
her to the GYN Clinic.

382
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:49,448
Well, I offered to

383
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,383
arrange things for her upstairs.

384
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,951
Uh, today.

385
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,120
What's the rush?

386
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,088
Well, this might be
her only opportunity.

387
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,257
Can't get out of the house?

388
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,791
She's got five kids under 8.

389
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,760
She needed somebody
to make it happen for her.

390
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,762
Meaning, she might not
be in an emotional state

391
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,047
to make her own decision?

392
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,167
No, she made it. She
just needed a push.

393
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:09,223
And you pushed her?

394
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:11,754
I don't know.

395
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,839
Did you give her her options?

396
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:16,875
Yeah. But adoption's not gonna
work because of the husband.

397
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,461
If she has another kid, it's
gonna push her over the edge.

398
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,030
If she's gone to this much
trouble to avoid an abortion,

399
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,254
there's a part of her
that has a problem with it.

400
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,257
Or her husband does.

401
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,855
Can GYN even do it?

402
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,657
I don't know. I
haven't asked them.

403
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,665
All right. Talk to them. It
might not even be possible.

404
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,813
Thank you.

405
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:38,919
Be careful, Abby.

406
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,672
Make sure.

407
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,890
Your surgical consult is here.

408
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,525
And who might that be? Mm.

409
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,961
How about a clue?

410
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:55,230
Um... Dr. Romano?

411
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,298
Okay. See?

412
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,233
Oh. Whatever.

413
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,290
Need a doctor to
take a look? Hm?

414
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,378
Don't worry about me.

415
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,802
I'm getting some Lasix.

416
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,550
Lap belt injury, huh?

417
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,620
Yeah, CT is clear.
But he's guarding.

418
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,924
Y-you know. Just, um,
discussing a patient.

419
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,726
I could use a good
discussion myself.

420
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,227
Maybe I should
go see the patient.

421
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,211
Good idea. Good idea.

422
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,200
Eli. Mr. Emerson.

423
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,136
This is Dr. Benton.
He's a surgeon.

424
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,237
Hey, how are you? Hey.

425
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,238
How's your belly, Eli?

426
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,773
Same. A little sore.

427
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,241
Okay. Does this hurt?

428
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,742
Only when you press real hard.

429
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,311
Any back pain? No.

430
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,430
His white count is up.

431
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:45,764
So was the other surgeon wrong?

432
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,633
What other surgeon?

433
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:48,933
Dr. Corday.

434
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,258
Could you give us a
second? We'll be right back.

435
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:56,274
So Elizabeth already saw him?

436
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,777
Sorry. I didn't get
a chance to tell you.

437
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,612
She didn't think an
ex-lap was warranted.

438
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,781
I disagreed... wanted
a second opinion.

439
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:04,616
Well, his belly
is fairly benign.

440
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,335
Uh, there's no
back or flank pain.

441
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,504
He could have a leak in
his bowel and not look sick.

442
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,927
He doesn't have a fever.

443
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,674
Delaying diagnosis and repair

444
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,143
can raise mortality
from 5 to 65 percent.

445
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,451
Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll do an ex-lap, okay?

446
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,382
Thank you, Peter.

447
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,851
<i>One, two, three.</i>

448
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,618
Oh, God!

449
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,487
Watch my back, would you?

450
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,489
How far did you fall, Mr. Fazio?

451
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,024
I don't know. Six, eight feet.

452
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,359
Coworkers said about four.

453
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,560
Four, my ass!

454
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,028
I felt something pop.

455
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,596
I think I blew out a disk.

456
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,066
Complains of leg
weakness, brief LOC.

457
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,969
I passed out.
Everything went black.

458
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,637
BP's 110/70. Pulse 81.

459
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,506
Is that bad? That's normal.

460
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,050
Why don't you press on
my hands with your feet.

461
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,128
Oh, jeez!

462
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,213
That hurt?

463
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,903
Yeah! What do you think?

464
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,853
Does your employer cover
on-the-job injury, Mr. Fazio?

465
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,455
Huh. He better. Okay.

466
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,956
I'm gonna press
down on your head.

467
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,058
Tell me if it increases
the pain in your back.

468
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,359
Here we go.

469
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,094
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Stop, stop.

470
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,495
Pain is MU.

471
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,730
What's that?

472
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,714
We're gonna check
it all out, Mr. Fazio.

473
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,370
Better get a CBC, Chem-7
and a lumbar-spine series.

474
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,039
What exactly is MU?

475
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,139
Made-up.

476
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,123
You think he's faking? Oh, yeah.

477
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,011
Hey.

478
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,363
So is it anxiety attacks?

479
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,116
I can't say for sure.

480
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,850
But your cardiac
enzymes are normal.

481
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,851
And I'm not seeing

482
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,620
any irregularities on the EKG.

483
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,821
Yeah.

484
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,590
Well, I didn't think
it was my heart.

485
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,691
You might just
be overly stressed.

486
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,711
Ha! I could've told you
that without the test.

487
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:40,679
I still need to monitor
you for another, uh,

488
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,680
six to eight hours.

489
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,766
But you said
everything was okay.

490
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,300
Damage to the
heart doesn't always

491
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,885
show up in the
blood work right away.

492
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:49,220
The way you came in,
I just wanna make sure.

493
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:50,722
Uh-huh. Heh.

494
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:52,979
I just got myself all worked up.

495
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:55,916
You see, she's, uh...

496
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,564
She's driving me crazy.

497
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:03,089
I-I-I never wanted a divorce.

498
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,323
Oh, hell... Mr. Simpson.

499
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,491
Mr. Simpson. I'm sorry.

500
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,627
E-every t-time. J-j-just...

501
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,997
It just hits me. And I-I...

502
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,481
I don't know what I'm doing.

503
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,549
I'm sorry.

504
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,834
No, don't worry. It's okay.

505
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,437
Every day...

506
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,206
Every day it's
another damn letter

507
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,046
or a phone call from her lawyer.

508
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,645
More threats, more demands.

509
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,980
I don't know what I did wrong.

510
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,875
I love my son.

511
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,862
I loved her. I still do.

512
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:44,998
I understand.

513
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,532
I'm sorry.

514
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,738
It's not your problem.

515
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,372
Maybe I can get a
clinical psychologist

516
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,440
to come down and
talk to you, huh?

517
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,264
Clinical psychologist?

518
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,679
That worse than
the ordinary kind?

519
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,284
Hi.

520
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,086
I checked on your kids.

521
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,754
They're having a great time.

522
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,457
They're gonna need to eat
soon. They're eating now.

523
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,824
It's a great thing about kids,

524
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:21,063
they don't complain
about hospital food.

525
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:26,334
Um... Are you sure
this is what you want?

526
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,037
No, it's not what I want. Heh.

527
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,276
It's what I need.

528
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,142
Okay, um... well, I
worked it out with GYN.

529
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,078
There's a doctor who
can squeeze you in,

530
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,147
but if it's gonna be
today, it has to be now.

531
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,538
You better take me up there
before I change my mind.

532
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:45,503
Yeah. Well... the thing is...

533
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:49,007
I would hate for you to
change your mind later on.

534
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,175
No, I know.

535
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,346
I meant... Forget it.

536
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,530
No, tell me.

537
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,237
I feel like such a hypocrite.

538
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,905
I know that this is so wrong.

539
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,514
I just keep telling myself
I'm doing this for my family.

540
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,845
Well, maybe you better
take some more time

541
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,197
and think about it.

542
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,765
My husband is a good man,

543
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,872
but he would never
understand this.

544
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,955
It would be better
if he doesn't know.

545
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,880
Let's just get it
over with, okay?

546
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,678
Okay.

547
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,034
Thank you.

548
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,773
This isn't easy to do alone.

549
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,422
He's had steroids. Another hour
of continuous nebs should do it.

550
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:39,724
Dr. Greene, It's that
nurse again. Now what?

551
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:41,927
Uh, apparently your
father's making racial slurs.

552
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,028
She's Swedish.

553
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,662
Well, maybe he
called her a meatball.

554
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:46,131
Well, tell her I'm on my way.

555
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,665
I'll be there in
about half an hour.

556
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:49,467
Okay, Exam 4, I put
the shoulder back in.

557
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,370
You need to check
the post-reduction films.

558
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,637
Does he have an orthopedist?

559
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:53,838
Give it to the Ortho Clinic.

560
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:54,973
Are you leaving?

561
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:56,241
I've been on since 5:30.

562
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,810
Can you take the new
altered mental status, Exam 6?

563
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,612
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

564
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,180
Can you pull the
old records on that?

565
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:03,949
You got a critical
value from the lab.

566
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:06,418
White count's 150,000.
Looks like leukemia.

567
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:07,819
What patient? Fazio.

568
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,122
The workers' comp guy?
What did he present with?

569
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,356
Guy fell off a ladder.

570
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,625
Just look at that, 95
percent blasts. Ninety.

571
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,093
Get a Hem/Onc consult.

572
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,228
Has anyone seen Carol?

573
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,362
She's upstairs. Again?

574
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,031
She's on break. She
was just up there.

575
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:20,432
Who are you, the hall monitor?

576
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,801
No. I'm a Resident whose
patient needs an NG tube, okay?

577
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:25,070
Well, do it yourself. You
gonna let this go on, boss?

578
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,539
Give her a break. I don't
think the chief would.

579
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:30,208
Well, talk to me after you've
raised two children on your own.

580
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:31,977
That was her choice.
Why should I suffer?

581
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,878
Quit whining. I'll put
down your damn tube.

582
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:34,902
Thank you.

583
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,215
Hey, where's my MVA?

584
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,683
Cleo's patient? Yes.

585
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,318
Think Benton took
him up to the O.R.

586
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:41,902
Benton? Yeah.

587
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,358
Hey. How you feeling?

588
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:49,795
Something's wrong.

589
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,963
My back's going through spasms.

590
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:54,433
Well, your x-ray didn't
show any fractured vertebrae.

591
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,268
Well, that doesn't
mean I don't have pain.

592
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,670
I'm sure that you do.

593
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:01,123
You know, doc, I
can't work like this.

594
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,192
I don't think you're gonna
be going back to work.

595
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,032
Yeah? For how long?

596
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,802
You have acute
myelogenous leukemia.

597
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:11,616
Leukemia? Wha...?

598
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,068
You mean like the cancer?

599
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,904
Yes. And it can cause bone pain.

600
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,839
Oh. Come on.

601
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,108
Get out of here! I fell
off a freakin' ladder.

602
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,677
We picked it up
on your blood work.

603
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,246
Hematology's coming down.
They're gonna want to... Whoa.

604
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,880
Admit you today and start chemo.

605
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,132
Wait a second. Wait a second.

606
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,835
I'm sorry. John,
we need you now.

607
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,420
Hey, I'll be right
back. Wait, doc!

608
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,876
I'll be right back.

609
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,793
Push 0.2 epi. We may
need an airway. What is it?

610
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,661
Ten-year-old girl in
anaphylactic shock.

611
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,030
Found on a school field
trip. No response to albuterol.

612
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,233
Allergic reaction?
Bracelet says peanuts.

613
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,034
Gave Benadryl, but
pressure's dropping.

614
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,936
Draw up 75 of
ketamine, 75 of sux.

615
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,154
Pulse ox is 82.

616
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,240
Can't wait. Rapid induction.
Number 70 T-tube?

617
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,741
No, I've got it.

618
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,114
BP's 60 palp.

619
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,248
Come on, Deb. Let's go.

620
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,499
Hold on.

621
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,868
You want cricoid pressure? Mm.

622
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,936
Mm. Cords are swollen.
I can't pass the tube.

623
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,972
Let's set up for
fiber-optic intubation.

624
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:09,440
Fifty milligrams of Solu-Medrol.
Repeat the epi in five.

625
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:11,343
Okay, Deb, out of
the way. I've got it.

626
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,000
You've done one? Two.

627
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,084
Keep gentle tension
between your hands.

628
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,569
I know. I'm feeding it in.

629
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,721
There's the epiglottis.

630
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:25,274
Ahem. What are
you doing? Come on.

631
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,643
Keep advancing. I
can't see the cords.

632
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,745
Pulse ox down to 78.
All right, pull out. Bag her.

633
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,514
No, no. I just need
to... I said, get out now.

634
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,515
What are you doing?

635
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,783
I'm gonna take over.

636
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,201
I said, get back!

637
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,653
John!

638
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:38,887
Up to 82.

639
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,111
All right. Let's go again.

640
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,629
Thank you for being
so understanding.

641
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,032
I'm sure he'll be better
tomorrow. Couldn't be worse.

642
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,696
Is she gone?

643
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,071
Yeah, okay? She's gone.

644
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,772
We'll be lucky if
she comes back.

645
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,991
Speak for yourself.

646
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:00,592
Dad, we need her.

647
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,110
Someone has to
be here if I can't.

648
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,645
That wouldn't be necessary
if I went to that hospice.

649
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,114
Yeah, well, Dad, you'd just be

650
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,582
surrounded by strangers.

651
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,418
They don't get much
stranger than Nurse von Bülow.

652
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,386
And look at... And
look at this room.

653
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,789
It's like a... A damn hospital.

654
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,624
How much is all this costing?

655
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,126
Don't worry about it.

656
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,061
And wh... What the hell is that?

657
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,963
It's a portable toilet.

658
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,166
You got me a...? A
Johnny-on-the-spot?

659
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,319
It's just for
convenience. I should...

660
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,321
I am not taking a...

661
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:31,923
A dump in your
living room, Mark.

662
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,860
God. I am not an invalid!

663
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:37,162
I can still make it to
the damn bathroom!

664
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:39,231
Okay, Dad. Sit down. Sit
down. Come on, sit down.

665
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:40,415
Sit down here.

666
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,517
Sit down and relax.
This is exactly... Exactly

667
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,153
what I didn't want happening.
You don't have to use it, Dad.

668
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,622
Relax. Take deep
breaths. I won't use it.

669
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,557
I'll get your albuterol, okay?

670
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,559
I'll take it back, all right?

671
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,727
Okay.

672
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,985
Here you go. Just
take a few puffs.

673
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,788
Nice and easy. Calm down.

674
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,660
Where is he? Blue suit.

675
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:08,493
Uh, Mr. Parker?

676
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,528
Hi. I'm Abby Lockhart.

677
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:12,297
Hi. You're the one
taking care of my wife?

678
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:16,034
Yes. She was a little
dehydrated and tired. Heh.

679
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:18,136
They said she had to be
brought in by an ambulance.

680
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,305
Standard protocol when
the paramedics are called

681
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,990
and a patient has
lost consciousness.

682
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,558
Oh, God. No, it's okay.

683
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,661
She has a small abrasion, but
mostly, she just needs to rest.

684
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,330
She overdoes it.

685
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,215
I tell her she takes
on way too much.

686
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:33,051
You might want to think about
getting her some help at home.

687
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,218
Yeah. Well, where is she?

688
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:35,504
Can I see her?

689
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,640
When she gets back. She
went upstairs for some tests.

690
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,342
What kind of tests?

691
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,609
She was anemic,

692
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,546
so we had to check out her
heart and so some blood work.

693
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,481
Why don't I take you
to see your children.

694
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,099
Yeah. Okay.

695
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,968
But I thought you said
she only needs rest.

696
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:51,770
She does. And should.

697
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:53,404
But we're just being thorough.

698
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:54,873
Okay, I should
really be with her.

699
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,608
Well, that might be difficult.

700
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:59,010
What's all this about, Peter?

701
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,612
I've got an ex-lap.

702
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:03,448
Were you planning on calling me?

703
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,750
I didn't know I needed
your permission.

704
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,586
Did your friend
bother to tell you

705
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,287
that I'd examined
this patient first?

706
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:12,023
<i>Dr. Finch</i> fully advised me

707
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,125
of your surgical opinion.

708
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:15,260
I bet she did.

709
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,962
And I made my own
clinical assessment.

710
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:19,397
That boy is completely
asymptomatic

711
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:21,383
except for a small
bruise on his belly.

712
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,268
His white count rose to 18,000.

713
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:25,270
Well, then, she
should've called me.

714
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:26,537
Mm. Well, maybe she thought

715
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,006
you already made up your mind.

716
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,408
I was observing him.

717
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,811
Now, Dr. Finch may not
be as comfortable with me

718
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,412
as she obviously is with you,

719
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:36,514
but had she disclosed
the elevated white count,

720
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:37,916
I might have changed my mind.

721
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,523
Maybe.

722
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,538
Stop scrubbing, Peter.

723
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,739
What? You heard me.

724
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,263
I said stop scrubbing.

725
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:48,577
I'm operating on that boy.

726
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,333
No, you're not. I am.

727
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,898
Elizabeth, come
on, I'm ready to start.

728
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,549
Mm. Sorry to have
wasted your time.

729
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,218
But as associate
chief of surgery,

730
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,970
it's my prerogative
to schedule cases.

731
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:02,239
Especially ones I've seen first.

732
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,583
You mean you're
pulling rank on me?

733
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,867
Absolutely.

734
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:09,214
Dr. Carter? Yeah.

735
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,598
Dan Shine, Hematology.

736
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,068
You sent me a patient named
Fazio for a bone marrow biopsy.

737
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,772
How did it go? His bone
marrow is perfectly normal.

738
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,740
Not this guy. He
had 95 percent blasts.

739
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,025
Somebody else has blasts.

740
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,310
This guy's got a normal
white count. What?

741
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,645
I had the lab cross-check.

742
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,179
They mixed up the
medical records.

743
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,404
Do you have a patient
down here named Simpson?

744
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,837
Uh, Randi, can
you find Dr. Kovac?

745
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:32,838
Just a second.

746
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:33,862
No, now!

747
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,177
Did you talk to Fazio? Yeah.

748
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,578
Uh, you might want to go up.

749
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,464
I had to stick him
with a corkscrew.

750
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,716
Then when I told him the
diagnosis might be a mistake,

751
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,385
he wasn't going to be dying
next month, he threatened to sue.

752
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,187
Oh, I'm sure that he did.

753
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:50,188
Excuse me?

754
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:51,823
They took my wife upstairs.

755
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:54,059
I just wanted to
see if she was back.

756
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,111
The last name's Parker.

757
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,314
Uh, Gynecology Clinic.

758
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,616
Wait. Gynecology Clinic?

759
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,368
I... I thought she was anemic.

760
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:05,270
I'm sorry. I didn't
take care of her.

761
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:08,005
If you want to have a seat,
you can wait right over there.

762
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,797
Call me after you talk
to the real guy. Yeah.

763
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,214
Excuse me. W-what's your name?

764
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,249
Abby. Abby, yeah.

765
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,607
It says "GYN" by my
wife's name. Is that right?

766
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,854
Mr. Parker, why
don't you have a seat,

767
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:25,256
and I'll check on her.

768
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,325
Is there something wrong
you're not telling me?

769
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,826
No, she's fine.

770
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,995
Then why is she in Gynecology?

771
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,463
Is she pregnant?

772
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:34,266
You should just wait
until she gets back.

773
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,484
Look, I don't want
to wait anymore!

774
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,220
I want you to tell me
what's wrong with my wife.

775
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,722
Uh, I can't. Why?

776
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,576
Sir. Medical information
has to remain private.

777
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,660
This is my wife.

778
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:48,163
What can't I know?
Uh, Mr. Parker...

779
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,086
She's not having
an abortion, is she?

780
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,621
Is she?

781
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:57,894
I can't say.

782
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,348
What floor is Gynecology on?

783
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:05,585
What floor is Gynecology
on?! Ninth floor.

784
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:12,237
You needed me, Carter?

785
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:13,541
Yeah.

786
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,028
Sure it's not another mistake?

787
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,552
No. We double-checked.

788
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,490
How long?

789
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,039
It's hard for me to say.

790
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,963
Ballpark. Best guess.

791
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,045
With a successful
bone-marrow transplant,

792
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,479
there is a...

793
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,863
60 percent survival
rate at five years.

794
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,953
Without one?

795
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,387
Chemotherapy alone?

796
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,025
About half of that.

797
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,526
But we'll do everything we can

798
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,128
to find you a match.

799
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,130
They'll type your entire family:

800
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,264
brothers, sisters...

801
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,155
I don't have any
brothers or sisters.

802
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,204
Are your parents living?

803
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,839
Have an uncle.

804
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,641
That's good.

805
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,014
And there's your son.

806
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,445
He's only 8. Yeah.

807
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,347
Probably the best chance.

808
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,644
Should call my wife. Hm.

809
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,216
Yeah.

810
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,383
You called for a
surgical consult?

811
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,785
Yeah. Nine-year-old with
right-sided abdominal pain.

812
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,052
I think it's a hot appy.

813
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,622
You didn't bring them
to the O.R. yourself?

814
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,623
Temp's 101.

815
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,843
I just closed Eli
Emerson's belly.

816
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:42,877
I thought Peter was go...

817
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,563
No, he was my consult,
my responsibility.

818
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:47,698
Fortunately, there
was no perforation.

819
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:48,817
That's a relief.

820
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:51,236
Pity I had to cut him open.

821
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,705
Better to know
than regret it later.

822
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:54,994
Yes.

823
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,377
Well, I know you have
special access to Peter,

824
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:00,879
but in the future
I'd appreciate it

825
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:02,147
if you'd come to me if you have

826
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,448
a problem with one of my calls.

827
00:32:03,472 --> 00:32:05,616
Obviously you agreed with
him or you wouldn't have

828
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,668
performed the surgery.

829
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,219
A simple "Yes,
Elizabeth," will do.

830
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:09,554
Do you want this appy or not?

831
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:11,411
Which room? Four.

832
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,795
Hey. What's going on, Pablo?

833
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:18,830
Oh. They took all my stuff.

834
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,164
The city swept his street.

835
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,332
Cleaned everything out.

836
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,367
Yeah? And when was
your last drink, Pablo?

837
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:26,905
Push me down. I tried to
climb up on this dumpster,

838
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:28,139
and they pushed me down.

839
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,408
Right. And, uh, how much
have you had to drink?

840
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:32,744
They took my
pillows, my blanket.

841
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,496
I had a tarp for when
it rain, you know?

842
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,997
Right. And have you been eating?

843
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:38,950
I have no money. Oh, let's
get a banana bag going.

844
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:40,468
CBC, chem panel
and blood alcohol.

845
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,336
Did you hit your
head, Pablo? What?

846
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,706
I said, did you hit your head?

847
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,924
Pablo, hold still. Ah.

848
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:47,592
No, let me go.
Hold still, Pablo.

849
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,711
No!

850
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,145
All right. Soft restraints!

851
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,098
It's okay. It's okay.

852
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:54,799
Call Security.

853
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:57,552
It was an accident.
Pablo, hold still.

854
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:58,853
What is that? Leave me alone.

855
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,054
Haldol. What? No!

856
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,272
Let me go!

857
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:02,907
Carter, what are you doing? Aah!

858
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:04,625
No. Carter!

859
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,926
What's the matter with you?!

860
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,095
He's violent. It
was an accident.

861
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,665
This is Pablo. They
don't come any gentler.

862
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,217
Are you gonna help
me, Carol? No! I'm not!

863
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,641
All right, fine. Why don't you
call me when he calms down.

864
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,683
Hey, you got any
four-by-fours in here?

865
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:29,987
Uh, let me check.

866
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,254
Xeroform, Adaptic...

867
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,089
If not in here, they're
in the suture room.

868
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,813
Hold on, Carter, I'm
still looking. Here we go.

869
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,763
What's going on with you?

870
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,164
What, you mean Pablo?

871
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,467
I mean your
overreaction to Pablo.

872
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,469
Or am I now overreacting
to your overreacting?

873
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,705
Ah, I was just
trying to be careful.

874
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,506
Maybe it was a bad call.

875
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,541
Are you okay?

876
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,576
Yeah, I think so.

877
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,744
I know what it's like

878
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,313
to have life change
up on you, you know?

879
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,650
I mean, a year ago I
was living with Doug.

880
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:06,621
Now I'm living alone
with two babies. Go figure.

881
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,645
Yeah.

882
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,558
It takes a while
to deal with it.

883
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,427
To get used to it.

884
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,931
I think you still
need to get used to it.

885
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,700
Lucy matched.

886
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,103
Oh, God. Where?

887
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:25,428
Here. Got a spot in Psych.

888
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,964
Go figure.

889
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:33,269
There's always gonna
be something, Carter.

890
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:38,975
Well, what are you gonna do.

891
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,805
Go back to work.

892
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:49,981
She's not really Swedish. What?

893
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,482
Mrs. Fredriksson.

894
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,252
She's married to a
Swede, but she's Dutch.

895
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:56,587
So you did actually talk to her.

896
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,222
No, Mark, I didn't
do the talking.

897
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,758
She yapped and
yapped and yapped and...

898
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:04,862
finally, about halfway through
watching<i> Rosie O'Donnell,</i>

899
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:08,199
I told her to stick her
damn thumb in her dike

900
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:09,600
and shut the hell up.

901
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:11,635
You didn't. Sure, I did.

902
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:15,672
You told her to stick her
damn thumb in her dike?

903
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,475
And she got what I
meant. And... And it worked.

904
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,544
Not another word.

905
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:22,735
What is this? Meatloaf.

906
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,218
It's the only recipe of
Mom's I can ever remember.

907
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,286
Where's the egg?

908
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,038
What egg?

909
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,839
Your mother used to cook it

910
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,508
with a hardboiled
egg in the middle.

911
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,631
Then you'd get a
sliver with each slice.

912
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,902
I... I didn't remember that.

913
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:45,035
I never much liked
the egg anyway.

914
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,499
I always ate around it.

915
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:52,031
Okay.

916
00:35:58,173 --> 00:36:00,373
Work was pretty decent today.

917
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,809
That's good.

918
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:09,048
So anything happen here?

919
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,246
Like what?

920
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,981
I don't know.

921
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,334
Maybe you and Mrs.
Fredriksson did something.

922
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:18,925
What the hell would we
do, Mark? Play Parcheesi?

923
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,573
Dad, forget it. Okay?

924
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,281
Ahem. I was just, uh,
trying to make conversation.

925
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,079
Yeah, okay.

926
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,503
Whatever.

927
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:37,621
Your mother used to
serve this with peas, I think.

928
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:40,205
Not... Not with string beans.

929
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:44,083
Yeah. Guess so.

930
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,607
Hey, Abby. Hey.

931
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,589
How's she doing?

932
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,124
Pretty well. She's
gonna be okay.

933
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,993
That's good.

934
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,228
I do want to apologize to you.

935
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,998
I let my emotions get
the best of me downstairs.

936
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,766
Of course.

937
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,502
Lynn let herself
get a little run-down.

938
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,493
She just got depressed.

939
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,474
I guess I didn't see it.

940
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,844
Well, it's easy
for that to happen.

941
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,445
She's resting now.

942
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,348
So I'm gonna go
check on my kids again.

943
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,805
Sure.

944
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,328
Hi. How are you doing? I'm okay.

945
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,997
I saw your husband
out in the hall.

946
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:39,066
Oh. He was pretty
upset, but he's better now.

947
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,407
He forgave me.

948
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,305
He forgave you?

949
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,313
We all make mistakes sometimes.

950
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,194
And... And what you did today,

951
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:52,513
that was a mistake?

952
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,004
He didn't call it that. Just
a moment of weakness.

953
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,652
Well, what do you think?

954
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:58,986
And he talked to the doctor,

955
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,656
and I'm going to be fine.

956
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,079
We'll be able to try again soon.

957
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,360
For another baby?

958
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,213
Ken's a wonderful father.

959
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:10,614
We both love kids.

960
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,516
We've always
wanted a big family.

961
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,942
Kids are great.

962
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,427
Why don't you try and
get some rest, okay?

963
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:23,883
Thanks.

964
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,526
Look at Kate in the
little hat. She's so cute.

965
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,195
Isn't that Tess?

966
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,398
Nope, Kate. Tess is
the one eating the hat.

967
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,001
Hey, Luka. You off? Uh... no.

968
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,937
Heading out to meet the
trauma coming in. You?

969
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,406
After I pick up the
girls. Look at this.

970
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,807
Isn't that adorable?

971
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,581
Yeah. Very beautiful.

972
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:58,830
See you. Bye.

973
00:38:58,854 --> 00:39:00,965
Has anyone seen Benton?

974
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,067
He's on call. I
think he crashed.

975
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,302
Oh, God. I just realized.

976
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:05,753
Dr. Kovac... What?

977
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:06,754
He had two children.

978
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,256
It was two, wasn't it?

979
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,412
Yeah.

980
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,315
Hey.

981
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,649
Hey.

982
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:20,218
Where are the girls?

983
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:23,221
I'm on my way up
to get them now. Mm.

984
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:24,989
How much longer you on?

985
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:29,493
If Romano has his
way, probably forever.

986
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:30,962
Listen, Luka, I just realized,

987
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:34,498
looking at those
pictures... I'd, um...

988
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:37,134
I've never seen any
pictures of your children.

989
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:38,936
You want to see one now?

990
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,320
Yeah. That'd be great.

991
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:42,529
Yeah.

992
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:53,968
Jasna. That was
her birthday party.

993
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,469
She was 4.

994
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,940
She's beautiful.
So is your wife.

995
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,879
Yeah, she was.

996
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:04,395
Can I see one of your son?

997
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:06,480
Nah, I don't have any.

998
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,115
You don't have any on you,

999
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,901
or you don't have any at all?

1000
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:11,724
No, I'm lucky to have this one.

1001
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,188
No, to see Marco I just...

1002
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,558
have to close my
eyes, and he's there.

1003
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,596
Um... Usually with
chocolate ice cream

1004
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,904
on his face and hands.

1005
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,221
I'm sorry.

1006
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:33,674
No, no. No. Thank
you for asking.

1007
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:40,847
Oh. Here I go. Back to work.

1008
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,384
See you tomorrow. Bye.

1009
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,408
Bye.

1010
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,861
What is it?

1011
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,051
It's me.

1012
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,465
Cleo.

1013
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,566
What's wrong? Nothing.

1014
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,435
Lie down. Lie down.

1015
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,337
I thought you were going home.

1016
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,241
Maybe later.

1017
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,159
This is okay for now. Hm.

1018
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,074
Dr. John. I thought
the dog got in.

1019
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,498
No, it's just me, Corrine.

1020
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,334
Couldn't sleep? No.

1021
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,481
You want me to make
something to eat?

1022
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,025
No, no, no, no.
I'm fine, thanks.

1023
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:53,754
Okay.

1024
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,778
Good night. Good night.

1025
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,296
<i>Mark!</i>

1026
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,407
Mark!

1027
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,708
Dad?

1028
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,942
Mark!

1029
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,400
Yeah. Just a second.

1030
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,682
What's wrong, Dad? I
told you this damn stuff

1031
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,250
would get in the way!

1032
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,185
Ow. What happened?

1033
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,120
Ow. I was trying to
get to the bathroom.

1034
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,556
I got tangled up in these
wires and the tubes.

1035
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,924
Damn!

1036
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,127
I'm sorry. I should've
moved this stuff.

1037
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:35,795
I should be able to get up

1038
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,499
and go to the
bathroom by myself.

1039
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:39,767
It's my fault, Dad.

1040
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,935
I should've left the lamp on.

1041
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,860
I tried. But I got
tangled up in...

1042
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,975
Oh.

1043
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,110
It's no big deal, Dad.

1044
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,414
Oh. My pajamas are soaked.

1045
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:55,382
Well, don't worry. We'll
get you a fresh pair.

1046
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,640
I haven't wet the
bed since I was 5!

1047
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,458
All right, Dad. Just
sit down here, okay?

1048
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,515
I'm gonna put the
shower on, let it warm up.

1049
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,420
You shouldn't have
to do this, Mark.

1050
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,502
Think how many
times you did this for me

1051
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,371
when I was little.

1052
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,561
Well, I'm a grown man.

1053
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,564
Whoa, whoa. Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1054
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,705
