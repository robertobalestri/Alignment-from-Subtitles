1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,621
<i>Keep it in, Dad.</i>

2
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,189
I have to cough, Mark.

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,958
Yeah, well, you
don't have to talk.

4
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,593
Put it back in.

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,227
You want me to bite down on it?

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,763
Dad.

7
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,965
End up with a
mouthful of mercury.

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,867
Dad.

9
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:24,901
All right, say "E."

10
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,202
E.

11
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,203
Once again.

12
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,404
E.

13
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,405
Last time.

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,741
E. Cripes!

15
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,543
Sounds like pneumonia.

16
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,911
We gotta get you to the hospital

17
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:35,912
and get a chest film.

18
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,515
Oh, hell, Mark, do we have to?

19
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,117
You have something
better to do today?

20
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,654
It's Sunday. I figured
we could go to church.

21
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,989
Yeah, right.

22
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,090
Temperature's 101.

23
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,815
Big deal.

24
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,631
Morning, Randi.

25
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,633
Dr. Weaver, welcome back.

26
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,801
Kerry, nice to see you.

27
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,825
Robert.

28
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,406
I hope a few weeks
off was enough time

29
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,709
for you to rethink some of
your professional choices.

30
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,910
Few weeks long enough for
you to get buried down here

31
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,278
with Mark taking extra time off?

32
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,548
Not at all. I loved being
up-close and personal

33
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,649
with my troops,

34
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,351
and you didn't
answer my question.

35
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,769
I don't intend to.

36
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:18,404
Well, I'll take the fact
that you came back to work

37
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:19,572
as a yes.

38
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,174
After all, I didn't
appoint you chief

39
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:23,342
so that you could turn
all soft and mushy on me.

40
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,311
No. I know you didn't. Mm.

41
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,513
And I'm sure you do realize
that I can un-appoint you

42
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:30,349
should you find it too difficult
to uphold the standards

43
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:31,350
of this department.

44
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,619
Yes, I do.

45
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,576
Well, then, top of
the mornin' to you.

46
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:38,246
John.

47
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,728
John.

48
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:44,186
Oh, man.

49
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,432
What time is it?

50
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:47,901
Quarter past 7.

51
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:49,903
How about some breakfast?

52
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:54,296
Um... yeah, maybe
just some toast.

53
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,932
Did you get any sleep?

54
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,803
Well, I gave up trying around 2.

55
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,420
I came downstairs and
watched a couple infomercials.

56
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,255
Hey, I ordered you
one of those machines

57
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,825
so you can make
your own beef jerky.

58
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:12,876
You didn't?

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,878
I didn't.

60
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,501
Then I came in here.

61
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:20,166
This seems to be the
only room in the house

62
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,302
where you can sleep.

63
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,854
Maybe we should
put a bed in here?

64
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,224
<i>S-somebody!</i>

65
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,084
John?

66
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:34,754
Hm? What?

67
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:39,090
I wish you'd talk to somebody
about your not sleeping.

68
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,622
I'll be fine.

69
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,490
You want a slice?

70
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,175
Absolutely.

71
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,993
You wanna shoot some hoops?

72
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,645
Wait till she's done bulkin' up.

73
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,814
Hey! I'm sorry, Cleo.

74
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:41,881
I can take it.

75
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,983
As soon as I'm done bulking up.

76
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,985
Hey, why don't you guys
go ahead? Go, go, go, go.

77
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,386
'Cause she's so
bad, it's no fun.

78
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,387
I could kick your butt.

79
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:51,191
Hey, hey. Go, go,
both of you now.

80
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:52,792
I'd like to say
excuse my children,

81
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,295
but there's just no
excuse for my children.

82
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,964
It's okay. I grew up with three
brothers. I'm used to the abuse.

83
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,765
Peter tells me you're
from Indianapolis.

84
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:00,800
That right? Yup.

85
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,601
Hm, does your family
all still live there?

86
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,803
Yeah, they do. JESSE: Mom!

87
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,072
Peter, could you go
shut them up, please?

88
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,841
Yeah, yeah, listen,
just don't grill her

89
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:10,576
with a million questions,
all right? Go, go.

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,647
So... any of your brothers
become doctors too?

91
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,582
No, a couple of
them work for my dad.

92
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:17,984
And that would be in?

93
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,185
Insurance. Hm.

94
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,270
He's in insurance.

95
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,871
It's a good line of work.

96
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,406
You didn't wanna do that? Mm.

97
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,441
Working together,
living so close,

98
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,944
family can be a little stifling.

99
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,496
I mean, not all
families, of course.

100
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,753
Of course.

101
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,066
Have another waffle.

102
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,690
Mm. Thanks.

103
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,773
Let's transfer. One, two, three.

104
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,926
Get a CBC, chem
panel and dip a urine.

105
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,961
Delia, do you remember
what happened?

106
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,664
Daddy was taking
me to Shelly's house,

107
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,166
and this car hit us really fast.

108
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,669
Mr. Chadsey, does she have
any previous medical problems?

109
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,471
She had leukemia. Do
you know what kind?

110
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,239
AML. She's been in
remission for eight months.

111
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,208
How's your arm? Uh...

112
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,043
Oh, looks like you're
gonna need sutures.

113
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,880
Uh, I... I wanna
stay with Delia.

114
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:04,881
Haleh.

115
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:05,949
We could do it right here.

116
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,016
I'll go get a chair.

117
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,084
Are you okay, Daddy?

118
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,352
Yeah, it's just a little cut.

119
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,620
They're gonna fix me up.

120
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,906
I had stitches
once. It's not bad.

121
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,241
Well, I'm gonna try to
be as brave as you are.

122
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:16,242
Okay?

123
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,410
Okay.

124
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:18,477
All I'm sayin' is

125
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:19,879
you can't go wrong with a Chevy.

126
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,647
I've gone wrong
many times in a Chevy.

127
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,182
I always admired the Subaru.

128
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,884
Yeah, I say go with
something classic,

129
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,453
like an old Mustang convertible.

130
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,022
Two babies, Randi, remember?

131
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,423
Maybe Al could get you something

132
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:31,490
from the police auction.

133
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:32,725
What do you drive, Luka?

134
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,726
An old Saab.

135
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,827
No, don't go Swedish.

136
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,495
They've got the
highest suicide rate.

137
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,830
Well, what's this all about?

138
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,899
I'm gonna go buy a new
car. I mean, a new, used car.

139
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:40,900
When? Today?

140
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,435
Yeah. My mom's
got the twins, so...

141
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,739
What time are you off?

142
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,939
About an hour? Why?

143
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,506
You should go to
the place I got mine.

144
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,526
I know the guy there.
He'll give you a good deal.

145
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,528
If you can wait a bit,
I can come with you.

146
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,329
You should definitely
take a guy with you.

147
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,398
They don't listen to
me, but they listen to Al.

148
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,299
They listen to me,
but I'm on all day.

149
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,835
Me too. You sure you don't mind?

150
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,936
No, of course not.

151
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,038
I just have a few
cases to finish up.

152
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,806
Okay, thanks. Good.

153
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,924
Dr. Corday?

154
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,693
CBC's back on Delia Chadsey.

155
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,463
White blood count of 60,000.

156
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,398
Fifty percent blasts.

157
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,766
Her leukemia's back.

158
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,135
I wonder why she never
got a bone-marrow transplant.

159
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,870
Do you want me
to talk to the father?

160
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:20,105
Uh, no, I could do it.

161
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,429
Thanks.

162
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,547
Oh, Mark, I heard
your father's here.

163
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,048
Malik's gettin' him settled in.

164
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,182
What is it?

165
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:33,419
Rhonchi, consolidation
in his right lung.

166
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,738
Wanna go check on him now?

167
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,373
I didn't wanna be here, either,

168
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,610
but my son has the last
word in most things medical.

169
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,644
Tell me about it.

170
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,246
My son's a first-year
med student.

171
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,214
Only thing worse is a
first-year law student.

172
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,515
That would be my daughter.

173
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,917
Hey, Mark, this is
Sarah MacKenzie.

174
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,755
We're, uh, kindred spirits
in being hospital hostages.

175
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,806
How do you do?

176
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,058
Nothing serious, I hope?

177
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,809
No, knocked up my
shin. Got infected.

178
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,544
Hello, David, how are you?

179
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:01,514
Well, I'm still here,
Elizabeth. Couldn't be too bad.

180
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,016
Wanna do a portable chest?

181
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,600
No, get him to
Radiology right away.

182
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,002
Get a good P.A. and a lateral.

183
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,604
And make sure he
goes over on O-2.

184
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,455
This is Dr. Elizabeth Corday.

185
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,556
She and my son are...

186
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,224
I don't know what
you call it nowadays.

187
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,325
"Friends."

188
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,494
Hello. Hello.

189
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,162
Looks like you've
got your hands full.

190
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,946
Yes. I can do that.

191
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,366
No, I got it. Five of albuterol.

192
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,667
Want me to start a saline lock?

193
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,519
I can do that too. Sure.

194
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,388
Not bad. Two doctors, huh?

195
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,957
No waiting.

196
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,425
Reece went out like a light.

197
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,227
Not only can she
eat, she can play.

198
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,331
Yeah, the kids like her.

199
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,298
Mm-hm.

200
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,432
What about you?

201
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,367
Since when do you
care what I think?

202
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,269
The question is,
do you like her?

203
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,905
I wouldn't have brought
her here if I didn't.

204
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,557
Are you serious about her?

205
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:47,360
Jackie, it's a little
early to be serious.

206
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,494
I hope so.

207
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:51,197
Because she's not
serious about you.

208
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:54,233
All right.

209
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,102
What's that supposed to mean?

210
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,670
I'm just sayin'.

211
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:58,837
She's havin' fun,

212
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,623
but that girl's not
ready to settle down.

213
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,708
Who says I am?

214
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,442
Oh, right.

215
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,578
You're not so settled
with a 3-year-old.

216
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,964
Come on, Jackie, that doesn't
mean I wanna get married.

217
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,032
She's nice, we have fun.

218
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,417
But it's not serious, you know?

219
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,152
Good. Glad to hear it.

220
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,541
Then I like her too.

221
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,641
So, what is this, your
female intuition thing again?

222
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,726
Certainly not.

223
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,344
Did she say something?

224
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,078
She had to.

225
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,264
I asked a million questions.

226
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,432
Come on.

227
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,520
Edgar's mother is
an ICU nurse upstairs.

228
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,823
She's trying to find
someone to fill in for her.

229
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,275
What are you
thinking, meningitis?

230
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,877
Fever, vomiting, headache.

231
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:39,746
I need you to help
me with the LP.

232
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,180
Is he lethargic?

233
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:42,815
A little sleepy.
Gave him Versed.

234
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,650
Can you roll him up in a ball?

235
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:45,674
Yeah.

236
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,940
All right, Edgar, don't worry.

237
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,975
Everything's gonna be just fine.

238
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,566
Okay, good position.

239
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:56,713
Okay, here we go.

240
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,520
Steady.

241
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,868
<i>Okay, I'm ready.</i>

242
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,438
Good, I'm in.

243
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,273
Okay, I feel the pop.

244
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,540
<i>Did you feel the pop?</i>

245
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,810
<i>No. Keep going.</i>

246
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,511
<i>I... I can't. Yes, you can.</i>

247
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:15,915
<i>Stop, please! You're
hurting me. Please.</i>

248
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,382
<i>Calm down! It's all right.</i>

249
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,018
<i>What are you
sticking in my back?</i>

250
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:21,420
<i>Malik, give him another two
of Ativan. Lucy, keep going.</i>

251
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,623
<i>It'll be a traumatic tap,
blood in his spinal fluid.</i>

252
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,290
<i>Don't think it's
gonna get any easier.</i>

253
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,059
To the lab OLIGARIO: Right away.

254
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,003
There you go, Edgar.
This isn't so bad, is it?

255
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,982
Your medication
will wear off shortly,

256
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,846
and you won't feel
so sleepy, okay?

257
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,743
Thanks, Carter.

258
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,477
Carter? Hm?

259
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,501
Thanks.

260
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,309
Sure... Yeah, sure. No problem.

261
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,583
Did anyone ever discuss

262
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:53,152
a bone-marrow
transplant with you?

263
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,987
Yeah, there was no
HLA-matched relative.

264
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,889
I only matched three
out of her six antigens.

265
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,691
You've been through
this before, I guess.

266
00:09:58,715 --> 00:09:59,725
Oh, yeah, bigtime.

267
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:00,993
Well, with the recurrence,

268
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,262
she's gonna need
reinduction chemotherapy.

269
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,564
Chemo again?

270
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,499
Oh, man.

271
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,618
God, we were so hopeful.

272
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,786
In about two months,
when she goes into

273
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,705
her second remission,
they can try a BMT.

274
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,590
Yeah, if they can find a donor.

275
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,654
There are no other
possibilities in the family?

276
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:20,179
Nah. Not exactly.

277
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,597
Not exactly?

278
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,467
Delia has a half sister,
but she's not been tested.

279
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,036
Why not? Daughter
from my first marriage.

280
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,604
The divorce was pretty ugly.

281
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,439
My ex-wife's not
really inclined to help.

282
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,124
Not even to save
another child's life?

283
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,543
I think that we should just
go ahead with the chemo,

284
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,345
and then just go from there.

285
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,316
Sure. And I'll check with the
National Registry in Milwaukee,

286
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,084
'cause a match with
an unrelated donor's

287
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,069
better than nothing.

288
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:45,093
Thank you.

289
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,928
Are you ready yet?

290
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,230
Uh, just about.

291
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,365
CVA is being
admitted to medicine,

292
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,933
seizure patient can go home,

293
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,237
and little Edgar Braley's LP
was negative for meningitis,

294
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,272
but we're still
waiting for his lytes.

295
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,741
And his mother had to
go back to work upstairs.

296
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,809
Okay, I'll check up
on him. Good luck.

297
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,099
Thanks. Thank you.

298
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,517
Hey, Edgar, how you doin'?

299
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,685
What's she got?

300
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,436
Why does she have that stick?

301
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,938
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

302
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:20,156
What's she going to do?

303
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,657
Nobody's gonna do anything.

304
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,860
I don't want her to touch
me. Don't let her touch me!

305
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,444
It's o... OLIGARIO:
Wait a minute.

306
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:26,495
Get her away from me!

307
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,530
Whoa, whoa!

308
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,498
It's all right. No,
get her away!

309
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,500
Hey, hey.

310
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,767
It's okay. Get her away!

311
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,436
Whoa! Get her away from me!

312
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,637
Okay. Hey... Hey.

313
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,439
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Weaver.

314
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,273
Well, I guess he's,
uh, feeling better.

315
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,675
Go. Go ahead and get him, Conni.

316
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,532
Get Malucci if you need help.

317
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:43,762
Mark.

318
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,864
Hey. Hey.

319
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:46,883
How is he?

320
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,190
Making new friends as usual.

321
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,737
Got the films back.

322
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,907
It is post-obstruction
pneumonia.

323
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:58,377
Gave him a gram of
cefotaxime, IV piggyback.

324
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,179
So are you going
to keep him here?

325
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:01,346
For a while.

326
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,048
Make sure he doesn't
have a bad reaction

327
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,917
to the antibiotics.

328
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:08,353
I'll stop in and say hello.

329
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,023
So, um, can I do
anything to help?

330
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,925
I'm just gonna
steal some supplies.

331
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,193
Don't tell anybody.

332
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,577
Well, I love
stealing. Let me help.

333
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,732
Uh, saline flushes.
Need alcohol wipes.

334
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,768
Okay, check.

335
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:27,439
Ah. Uh, two-by-twos,
extension tubing.

336
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:30,876
Extension tubing. Check.

337
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,444
Needles and syringes.

338
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,914
Syringes.

339
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,205
Syringes.

340
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,252
Mark.

341
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,622
Uh, needles and syringes.

342
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,425
I'm gonna, uh...

343
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,861
I guess I'm gonna need
to borrow some more, uh,

344
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,462
infusion bottles of cefotaxime.

345
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:53,532
My dad'll be on antibiotics
for 10 to 14 days,

346
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,400
depending on how he responds.

347
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:57,458
Yeah, of course.

348
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,775
I'm sorry. It
would've been faster

349
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,309
if I'd had my car today.

350
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,644
Oh, that's okay.

351
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,880
Unfortunately, it's
in the shop. What?

352
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:10,116
No, just a routine checkup.
Nothing wrong, really.

353
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,484
This is a good
place. You'll like Herb.

354
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,286
Herb? Yeah.

355
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,821
He and I are like
this, you know.

356
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:20,025
He's my second cousin's
wife's brother-in-law.

357
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,750
That would definitely
make you like this.

358
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:24,329
Excited?

359
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,331
About buying a used car?

360
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:28,834
No. My mom thinks I
should get a minivan.

361
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:32,104
Oh, yeah, they're very
good. You know, practical.

362
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,006
Very "my life is over"?

363
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,241
Ah, don't say that. Come on.

364
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:38,077
We'll have him put a
Porsche engine in it.

365
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,344
Really?

366
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,712
No.

367
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,449
I'm... I'm sorry. I was kidding.

368
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:46,718
I don't think bringing you
along was such a good idea.

369
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,488
No, you'll see. We'll get
you something really good.

370
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,324
Mrs. Pooler, do you
have any allergies?

371
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:52,992
Wh...? What is it?
Wh-what's wrong?

372
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:54,076
Tachy at 120.

373
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,078
Pulse ox is 91 on two liters.

374
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,913
Are you on any medications?

375
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,750
Uh, just a pill for
high blood pressure.

376
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,451
Uh, proprana... Propranolol?

377
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,585
Yeah, propranolol, yeah.

378
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,187
You shouldn't take
that with asthma.

379
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,305
That can kill you.

380
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:08,440
Who's your doctor?

381
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:09,675
Mr. Pooler?

382
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,012
I-it's my medication
for high blood pressure.

383
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:14,330
You see, Ruth has Medicare,

384
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,148
and they won't pay
for her prescriptions.

385
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:19,301
Her, uh, uh, enala... Enalapril?

386
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,704
Y-yeah, yeah. It costs $50.

387
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,773
We... We just have
our social security,

388
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,192
so we thought she
could take mine.

389
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:28,828
See, I'm in an HMO.
I-I get 'em for free.

390
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,329
Well, I don't understand.

391
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,281
Why are you in an
HMO, and your wife isn't?

392
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,183
I-I have heart trouble.
I take a lot of pills.

393
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,417
But she just has the...

394
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,586
The asthma and wanted
to keep her own doctor.

395
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,390
So, uh, the HMO won't...
Won't let her do that.

396
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,875
<i>Hey, found your runaway.</i>

397
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:43,909
Where was he?

398
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,511
Cafeteria, eatin'
tapioca pudding.

399
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,079
Says he hangs out
there with his mom.

400
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,881
Is he okay? Yeah, he
seems to be all right.

401
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:52,518
Good. His labs came back.
Elevated BUN and creatinine.

402
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,353
Also his potassium's
a little low.

403
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:57,390
Give him a saline
bolus, 10 per kilo,

404
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,591
and put him on maintenance.

405
00:14:58,615 --> 00:14:59,792
Ooh, you want me to take him?

406
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,427
I want you to spiff
him up, Malucci.

407
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:02,812
Sure thing, chief.

408
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,247
I don't think this is right.

409
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,248
Uh, no.

410
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,749
I think you would've remembered

411
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,118
if it had been across the street

412
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,886
from a major-league
baseball field.

413
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,022
It doesn't seem
like a natural place

414
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,907
for a used-car lot, does it?

415
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,710
Gee, no, it doesn't.

416
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,879
I'm hungry. Yeah, me too.

417
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,369
What do you think? A hot dog?

418
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,867
It's here.

419
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,323
Sorry about this.

420
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,391
Mr. Chadsey.

421
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:34,093
Oh, I was just getting
Delia some water.

422
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:35,660
Uh, I spoke to the
Legal department,

423
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,830
and there's nothing we can
do to make your ex-wife...

424
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,066
I didn't ask you
to check on that.

425
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,101
What are you doing?

426
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,768
Well, I-I think you
should talk to her.

427
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,770
No, I-I already told you,
she's not gonna help.

428
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:46,938
Well, then, let me try. No.

429
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,864
Mr. Chadsey... I said, no!

430
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,497
I just wanna be
with my daughter.

431
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,389
Please don't make this
harder than it already is.

432
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,122
Do ya think this is
really necessary?

433
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,657
The propranolol that you
gave her lasts for 24 hours,

434
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:06,658
so she needs to be

435
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,326
on a continuous
breathing treatment.

436
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,295
Oh, such a fuss. I'm sorry.

437
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,563
Don't worry, Mrs. Pooler.

438
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,665
The ICU will take
good care of you.

439
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:14,800
I know.

440
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:18,536
They did last time
after my operation.

441
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,905
You were here for an operation?

442
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,306
Mm-hm. CARTER: For what?

443
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,941
Oh. Oh, dear, let me think.

444
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,343
Uh, uh, wh...? What...?
What was it called, Ralph?

445
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,544
Oh, gee, I-I'm not sure.

446
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,680
It was something to do
with her, uh, stomach.

447
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:30,215
Oh, yes, that's it.

448
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,818
They took something
out of my stomach.

449
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,787
Do you think that'd
make a difference now?

450
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:37,256
Oh, I doubt it, but I'll check
her old chart just to be sure.

451
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,490
Come on, here we go.

452
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,458
Oh, thank you, doctor.
You're very welcome.

453
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,960
Randi, I'll be in
Medical Records.

454
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:42,962
Okey-dokey.

455
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:46,198
The infield fly rule

456
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:50,902
is when the
batter hits the ball,

457
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,772
and it goes way high up, and,

458
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:58,043
you know, up, like,
over the pitcher's mound.

459
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,945
Then, the runner on
2nd has to run to 3rd

460
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,613
before the runner
on 1st can run to 2nd.

461
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,416
Hm, I thought they weren't
supposed to run at all

462
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,986
on a fly ball.

463
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,290
It's complicated.

464
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:11,240
You... You don't have any idea

465
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,908
what the infield
fly rule is, do you?

466
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,132
Can we go now?

467
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,681
I mean, you may
have a new used car,

468
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,017
but I don't.

469
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,321
My first transportation
was a tractor.

470
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,388
A tractor?

471
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,058
Yeah, my grandpa's farm.

472
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,461
He let me drive when
I was about 11, 12,

473
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,564
till I took out a couple of
fences and one of his cows.

474
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,932
Was your dad a farmer too?

475
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,069
No, he was a train conductor.

476
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,305
He let me ride on his
lap when I was little.

477
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,374
Sometimes, my... My
brother and I would go

478
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,609
all the way to Zagreb with him,

479
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,279
and we'd run
through the other cars,

480
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,348
looking at the passengers,
thinking, you know:

481
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,483
"My father drives the train."

482
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,285
You spent a lot of
time with your dad?

483
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,741
Yeah.

484
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,723
Did you come here
a lot with your father?

485
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,692
Learn about baseball?

486
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,194
Why? 'Cause I know so much?

487
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,595
Yeah.

488
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,630
No, actually.

489
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,565
My dad died when
I was really little.

490
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,334
I'm sorry. I never
really knew him.

491
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,104
Yeah, so am I.

492
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,590
It must make you think
about Kate and Tess,

493
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,763
about their
knowing their father.

494
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,079
Yeah, I guess.

495
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,782
But you would know what
they're missing more than I do.

496
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,806
Yeah.

497
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,087
Are we gonna buy a car,
or are we gonna buy a car?

498
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,422
We are going to buy a car.

499
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,108
I couldn't find the
file on Ruth Pooler.

500
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:38,611
If it's been more than two
years, it's in remote storage.

501
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,245
I can get it in about
an hour. Okay.

502
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,248
Oh, but I found that other
one you wanted. Uh...

503
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:43,449
Paul Sobriki.

504
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:45,216
Psych file?

505
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,952
Well, that's the one.

506
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:48,542
Sign right here.

507
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,380
Thanks.

508
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,727
Hey, Dr. Carter.

509
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,128
Dr. DeRaad, hi.

510
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,329
How you doin'?

511
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,436
Good. Fine.

512
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,768
Yeah, just goin' over an
old chart. Asthma patient.

513
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,436
Gettin' back into work okay?

514
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,571
Yeah, pretty well.

515
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,040
I have good days and bad days.

516
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,910
Actually, today
hasn't been, uh... I...

517
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,713
Well... come on
up and we'll talk.

518
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,714
No. No, no.

519
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,337
I'm okay.

520
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,550
I know.

521
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,774
But I have time.

522
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,177
Say 3:00?

523
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,392
Sure.

524
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,416
Thanks.

525
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,818
That was a hell of a
time. That's for sure.

526
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,620
Sam did two tours.

527
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:56,921
Wanted to do a third
but I told him I'd kill him.

528
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,922
He heard me.

529
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,057
Dad, what are you doin'?

530
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:00,725
Mrs. MacKenzie
and I are talking.

531
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:02,127
Please, call me Sarah.

532
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,128
Pulse ox, Dad.

533
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:04,613
You gotta leave
it on your finger.

534
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,315
I didn't even know it was off.

535
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,517
Her husband's an
old naval man too,

536
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,784
even served in Vietnam.

537
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,086
Although later than I did.

538
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,088
Is that so?

539
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,690
He still thinks he's a Navy man.

540
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,391
Out on the lake right
now runnin' around

541
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,927
in his old powerboat,
says it keeps him sane.

542
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,929
Isn't this thing
supposed to be dripping?

543
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,599
I understand what he means.

544
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,384
Try and keep
your elbow straight.

545
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,841
I love being out on the water.

546
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:33,157
Sometimes, in the
middle of the night,

547
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,427
you'd get a storm.

548
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:38,986
Thirty-foot waves coming
in different directions and...

549
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,858
rocking and rolling like
you wouldn't believe.

550
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:46,789
Still,

551
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,880
it puts you to sleep
like a little baby.

552
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:53,178
I'd wake up at dawn,

553
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:57,983
go out to the tip
of the bow, and...

554
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,574
the water would
be clear and calm.

555
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:08,860
The ship slicing
through it like cool air.

556
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:11,402
Calmest place on
earth, I used to think.

557
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:23,731
Like the storm...
never even happened.

558
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,028
Hi, Jessamyn?

559
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,080
Yes?

560
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,498
Jessamyn Chadsey?

561
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:48,100
Yes. Jessamyn, who is it?

562
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:50,836
Hi, uh, Mrs. Lomax?

563
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,038
Yes? Uh, my name
is Abby Lockhart.

564
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,256
I work at County General.

565
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,958
Is something wrong?

566
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,915
Did something happen
to Terry? Please, come in.

567
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,580
No, no.

568
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:03,703
Um...

569
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:07,018
I've... I've been treating

570
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,520
your former husband's daughter.

571
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,972
Did he send you here?

572
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,008
No, he didn't.

573
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,726
You know about her leukemia?

574
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,695
Get out of here right now.

575
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,696
Jessamyn, upstairs.

576
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,996
No. Mom, I wanna stay.

577
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,866
Mrs. Lomax, she's a child.

578
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,452
And the closest match we
have is an unrelated donor.

579
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,486
I said, get out!

580
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,121
If Jessamyn matched,
she would have

581
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,373
a much better chance of
survival. At least let us try.

582
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:30,441
I don't care about him
or anything to do with him!

583
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:32,244
Can you understand
that? Mom, calm down.

584
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,164
Don't tell me to calm
down, Jess. Now, please...

585
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,082
leave.

586
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,618
Mrs. Lomax, if you could just...

587
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:40,886
I asked you to leave.

588
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,809
Do I need to call somebody?

589
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:49,227
'97 Camry, power
steering, power brakes,

590
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:51,496
power windows, power locks,

591
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,382
power seats, and all for only...

592
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,518
$18,000? That's outrageous!

593
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,587
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

594
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,988
Now, here we go.

595
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:04,448
Special deal. Very
low price, $3300.

596
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,262
What is it?

597
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:10,732
It's a Dodge Dynasty. 1989.

598
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,768
Excellent year and
only 90,000 miles, huh?

599
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,370
Who gets a Dodge Dynasty?

600
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,661
Okay, okay, it's not your thing.

601
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:24,246
How about the '91
Mercury Sable for... 2900?

602
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,380
What more could you want?

603
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,284
Hey, four doors,
windshield wipers, antenna...

604
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,564
Hey, Malucci.

605
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,899
Yeah, chief?

606
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,433
Come here.

607
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,070
Don't look now, but your, uh,
little runaway, Edgar Braley,

608
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,355
- is hiding down the hall.
- What's he doing?

609
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,723
I don't know. My guess
is he's spying on me.

610
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,381
Get him back to Exam 2.

611
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,115
We're treating
her with antibiotics,

612
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,918
but the oxygen level is low.

613
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,972
Pneumonia can be a peaceful
way for an elderly person to die.

614
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:09,174
We don't want her to die.

615
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,942
As the oxygen level drops,

616
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,210
she'll simply fall asleep,

617
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,878
and eventually stop breathing.

618
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:15,480
There's no pain or suffering.

619
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:17,683
Well, can't you put her
on a breathing machine?

620
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,986
Sometimes it's best to just
let nature take its course.

621
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,053
When I saw her last month,

622
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:24,106
she was sitting up
in a chair, eating.

623
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,074
Well, she stopped
eating a while ago

624
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,375
according to the nursing home.

625
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,860
She's being fed
through a tube now,

626
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,629
directly into her stomach.

627
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:33,064
We can't just let Grandma die.

628
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:34,254
We're not going to, honey.

629
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:36,968
If you'd like some time to...

630
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,170
No, we don't need time.

631
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:39,971
We need somebody
who's willing to help us,

632
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,327
and obviously, that's not you!

633
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,383
Um... if you'll excuse
me for a moment.

634
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,800
Oh, have you seen Dr. Weaver?

635
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,023
No.

636
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,114
I keep having these thoughts.

637
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:09,217
It's like I, uh, see
moments of the accident.

638
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,952
Or something reminds me.

639
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:11,953
The accident?

640
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,321
I'd say it was
more of an attack.

641
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,280
A brutal attack for which
you had no warning.

642
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,161
Right.

643
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,963
Well, that's the thing.

644
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,634
See, I assisted on the
spinal tap on Paul Sobriki.

645
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,905
And he was aggressive.

646
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,574
And he was overreacting.

647
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,678
And he'd had Ativan. And I
numbed him with lidocaine.

648
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,902
But his... His response was...

649
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,705
as if...

650
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,686
we were stabbing him.

651
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,394
In his mental state,
he thought you were.

652
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,363
I... I should've realized that
something was very wrong.

653
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,964
So should've Lucy,

654
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:59,701
but she didn't pick up
on it either, did she?

655
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,770
There's always
gonna be "what ifs."

656
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,424
What if I had gotten down there
sooner for the psych consult?

657
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,292
It'd be easier for all of us

658
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,927
if we could think
of it as an accident,

659
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:10,429
but none of us have that luxury.

660
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,898
I know.

661
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:15,350
I just want to get these
thoughts out of my head.

662
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,040
It's gonna take some time.

663
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:21,940
Have you seen him?

664
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:23,447
Paul Sobriki?

665
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,146
You know, I was just wondering
if you'd seen him or his wife?

666
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,448
No, I haven't.

667
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,734
You're curious about
what's happening with them?

668
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:37,361
No. No. I just...

669
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,309
It's a 911. I gotta go.

670
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,211
Um, thank you.

671
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,068
Anytime. Come back.

672
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:48,700
It has been a pleasure.
A real pleasure.

673
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:49,734
Come back soon.

674
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,202
Although I know
you won't need to,

675
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,004
'cause this car's
gonna last you 10 years.

676
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,306
My name is Manny. Uh,
did you get a number?

677
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,643
Oh, God, I hope I'm not
driving this car in 10 years.

678
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,846
Hey, it's a beauty. Come on.

679
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,914
Luka, it's a small
station wagon.

680
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,938
But I thank you for your help.

681
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,075
Shall we celebrate?

682
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,208
Are you stealing?

683
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,742
No, Dad, I'm borrowing.

684
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,178
I think he's stealing.

685
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:18,813
Dr. Greene, I need
your help with this family.

686
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:19,914
Uh, I'm not on today.

687
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,084
I know, but I can't
find Dr. Weaver.

688
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,628
All right, Dad, I'll be
right back. Let's hear it.

689
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,688
What happened?

690
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,523
Syncope with blunt
head trauma. Altered.

691
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,692
He took a fall while
settling his wife into the ICU.

692
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,127
Mr. Pooler, are you all right?

693
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,678
Lateral C-spine and chest?

694
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:35,480
CBC, lytes, cardiac
enzymes, repeat EKG.

695
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:36,481
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

696
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:37,849
Look out, look out, look out.

697
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,218
Let's get a head CT
after we clear the neck.

698
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,970
Where's all the
blood coming from?

699
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,672
Occipital scalp lac.
No hemotympanum.

700
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,524
Systolic's 95, pulse ox, 98.

701
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,425
All right, bolus
another 250 of saline.

702
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:49,861
Give me a gram of Ancef
and update his tetanus.

703
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,163
Here's the 12-lead
from upstairs.

704
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,297
No ST changes.

705
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,721
At least he's not
having a heart attack.

706
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,003
She can't eat.

707
00:27:58,027 --> 00:27:59,788
She has no quality of life.

708
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,756
If we intubate her,

709
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,092
they'll take her up to the ICU.

710
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:08,329
And hook her up to tubes
and wires and machines.

711
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:13,501
And she'll die in
perhaps two, three weeks.

712
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,604
If we leave her as she is now,

713
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:20,608
she'll die today,
maybe tomorrow,

714
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,199
but peacefully.

715
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:27,403
You need to think carefully
about what she would want.

716
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,409
Mr. Hemmings, your
mother is letting go.

717
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,567
And you think that's
what we should do?

718
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,734
I think you should spend
some more time with her.

719
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:49,420
Thank you, Dr. Greene.

720
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:50,711
Sure.

721
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,682
Thanks Elizabeth. I'll let you
know what the head CT shows.

722
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:01,683
Mm-hm.

723
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:02,717
How's it going?

724
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,386
All right. How are you?

725
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,153
Uh, I think I'm gonna
pack up the old man

726
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,573
and take him for a spin.

727
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:11,042
His labs haven't come back
yet and neither have his films.

728
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,143
Okay. I'll call the lab.

729
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,112
You call Radiology? Okay.

730
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,014
Oh, boy. What?

731
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:18,349
Um, do you remember that
leukemia case I mentioned?

732
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:19,483
Hi, Jessamyn.

733
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,484
Are they still here?

734
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,485
Um, this is Dr. Weaver.

735
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,620
Hi, Jessamyn.

736
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:24,922
Yes, they're waiting
for a bed upstairs.

737
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:27,158
I wanna do this. I
want to help out if I can.

738
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,259
So, what do I have to do?

739
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,327
Uh, okay. Well,
um, I don't know...

740
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,096
Did your mother drive you here?

741
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,465
No, I drove in myself.

742
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:35,750
Does she know you're here?

743
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,054
I'm old enough to
decide on my own.

744
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,623
My mom is a good person,
but when it comes to this subject,

745
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,424
there is no talking to her.

746
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,282
So she hasn't given consent?

747
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:49,569
My dad wants this. I want this.
That has to count for something.

748
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:54,102
It does. I mean, it...
I-it counts for a lot.

749
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,721
But I'm afraid the rules
are very clear on this.

750
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:58,940
This is your mother's decision.

751
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,475
She said she couldn't understand

752
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,994
how something like this could
happen with a life at stake.

753
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,162
I don't either.

754
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:06,498
I'm so sorry.

755
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:10,134
Abby, let me know
when those labs are back.

756
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,770
Um, why don't I take
you to see your father.

757
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:13,805
I don't want to see him.

758
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:15,206
Well, I'm sure it
would mean a lot

759
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,708
knowing that you
wanted to do this.

760
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,175
I don't care what he thinks.

761
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,879
I'm only trying to help Delia.

762
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,948
Good eating today.
Hot dog, hamburger.

763
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:24,949
French fries?

764
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,885
Mm.

765
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,303
Thank you.

766
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,004
I haven't been
through a drive-through

767
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,306
in I don't know how long.

768
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,441
Hey, it would've
been a pity to have left

769
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:36,928
the car all alone
on its first day.

770
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:38,051
Yes, I agree.

771
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,783
When I first came to Chicago,

772
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:45,153
I used to come out here a lot.
You know, to look at the city.

773
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,576
It's so beautiful.

774
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,791
Did you grow up in a city?

775
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,215
No, near the coast.

776
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,415
Is that where you
were during the war?

777
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:01,803
No.

778
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,061
Then we were in, uh, Vukovar.

779
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,933
A small apartment. I
didn't have much money.

780
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:18,625
We kept the children
in all the time for safety.

781
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,992
They would get crazy.
Wh-what do you call it?

782
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,176
Cabin fever. Yeah.

783
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,900
I was going to the market.

784
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,120
Not for much. Some
cheese and bread.

785
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,673
And they were
climbing all over me.

786
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,398
"Please let me
come. Let me come."

787
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:47,770
And the answer was the same
as always, "No, it's not safe."

788
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,057
My wife stayed with them.

789
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,521
Luka.

790
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,023
No, it's okay.

791
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:01,795
I was only maybe,
uh, 50 meters away

792
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,070
when I heard the
whistle in the air.

793
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,643
An artillery shell
hit the building.

794
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,488
It's all redone now.

795
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,837
People rebuilt
all during the war.

796
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,672
One day, you are
sitting at a café,

797
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,241
the next day, it's bombed.

798
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:33,316
And the day after that,
they... They begin to build.

799
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:37,802
That's what you do.

800
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:42,909
Something happens,
you rebuild, you go on.

801
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,429
We should probably go.

802
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:53,953
Your mother will think
you've gone joy-riding.

803
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:14,085
Hey, Randi, where
is, uh, Dr. Malucci?

804
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:17,305
Uh, he was with a patient
in Exam 1 a little while ago.

805
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,329
Thanks.

806
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,707
Hey, Malu...

807
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,054
Dr. Weaver.

808
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,812
Abby, uh, can I speak
to you for a moment?

809
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,694
I don't want to
hear your reasons,

810
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,495
I don't want to hear
your justifications.

811
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,298
Did you know that I
could fail you for that?

812
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,532
Yes.

813
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,701
What were you thinking?
I was just trying to help.

814
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,970
What that girl did
coming here was brave.

815
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,371
What you've done is stupid.

816
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,941
I mean, her sister's gonna be
in chemotherapy for two months

817
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,275
before the transplant.

818
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,226
You don't think the
mother's gonna find out?

819
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,462
She just wanted to help.

820
00:33:57,486 --> 00:34:01,098
Yeah, and it's our
sometimes lousy job to say no.

821
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,967
There are rules this
emergency department

822
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,520
must follow and will
follow. Is...? Is that clear?

823
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,889
Yes.

824
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,046
Make sure she's
okay to drive home.

825
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,431
Dr. Weaver.

826
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:16,689
I don't think trying
to help is ever stupid.

827
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:22,987
I'm really sorry.

828
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,989
I hope I didn't get you
into too much trouble.

829
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,491
No, I'll live.

830
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:27,792
Jessamyn, while you're here,

831
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,360
why don't you just
go see your dad?

832
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:31,295
No, I'm... I'm gonna leave.

833
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,553
Well, I... I really
wish you wouldn't.

834
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,085
Dr. Weaver, Hm?

835
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,820
I'm having a little
trouble with an HMO.

836
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,222
A 76-year-old guy with syncope.

837
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,691
They want to transfer him, I
think we should keep him here.

838
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,660
Any EKG changes or
ectopy on the monitor? No.

839
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,562
What's the health
insurance? Blue Beacon.

840
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,964
They contract with New Western,

841
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,532
we transfer their
stable patients.

842
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,234
Well, it's more
complicated than that.

843
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,602
I admitted his wife to the ICU.

844
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,803
They won't authorize that.

845
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,805
I think it would be best
if we kept 'em together.

846
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,340
They won't authorize it, John.

847
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,709
I don't think he's gonna be
stable enough for transfer.

848
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,378
He's dehydrated.
So rehydrate him.

849
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,546
Well, he's hypokalemic.
Replete his potassium.

850
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,547
He's anemic.

851
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,982
Actively bleeding? No.

852
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,951
Then it's a chronic
problem. He's ready to go.

853
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,020
He should stay with his
wife, it's what he wants.

854
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:14,022
Does he also want to
pay a $2000 hospital bill?

855
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,856
All right, well, I'm
leaving pretty soon.

856
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,059
I don't know if I'll be able
to oversee the transfer.

857
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,349
Then I'll do it.

858
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,713
They were filming this movie...

859
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:24,281
Swedish, I think.

860
00:35:24,305 --> 00:35:27,051
Near my grandpa's farm,
and they needed animals.

861
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:29,453
So you just rented out a whole
bunch of cows and chickens?

862
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:32,123
Sheep and horses
too. My brother and I.

863
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:34,658
You know, made a lot
of money for teenagers.

864
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:35,726
But it was a huge mess.

865
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:39,063
Luka? What's happening?

866
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:41,532
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna kill Herb.

867
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,700
We didn't even meet Herb.

868
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,802
Same thing happened
when I bought my car,

869
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,471
and Herb said it was a fluke

870
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:49,206
You're telling me this now?

871
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,431
Not to worry, I can fix it.

872
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,509
So you brought me to the water.

873
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,269
Good boy. Good boy.

874
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,153
It's funny, Mark.

875
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,391
You know how some years
seem to pass faster than others?

876
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,492
Yeah.

877
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,116
Well, this year has
been the fastest.

878
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,621
I was thinking how
strange things can be.

879
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,228
Do you know... that in
all the wars I served in,

880
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,233
I never watched a man die?

881
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,904
On some ships, you get lucky.

882
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,953
But I must have told
you about that time

883
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,557
we had an explosion
at the base motor pool.

884
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,992
When you were stationed in Guam?

885
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,894
Yes.

886
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,796
I was little.

887
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,031
Mom and I were at San Diego.

888
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,000
And I remember you
called and told her about it

889
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:06,984
over the phone.

890
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:10,053
We lost seven men.

891
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:13,824
I was in the Exchange
when it happened.

892
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:18,762
I was looking for some
shaving cream or something.

893
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:22,133
Everybody scrambled out.

894
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,834
I started to,

895
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:27,571
me and this lieutenant
in the aisle next to me.

896
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:31,809
The shampoo
section, as I recall.

897
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,301
Next thing I know,
I hear this crash.

898
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:39,650
I turn and all these bottles

899
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,085
had come flying off the shelf.

900
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:46,390
And this poor son of a bitch
is collapsing on the floor.

901
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:48,609
He'd had a heart attack.

902
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,644
What'd you do?

903
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,212
Well, I screamed for help,

904
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,671
but no one came 'cause they
were all over at the motor pool.

905
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,641
I got down.

906
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,846
I loosened his tie and
unbuttoned his collar.

907
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,917
He grabbed on to my hand,

908
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,421
begged me not to leave him.

909
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,490
So I stayed.

910
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,279
And I pulled him into
my arms, and I held him.

911
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,816
Just the two of us.

912
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,921
For the next four
minutes, I watched him die.

913
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:33,292
The longest four
minutes of my life.

914
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,963
But in a crazy way

915
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:42,902
four of the best
minutes of my life.

916
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:49,386
There was some kind of value

917
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,494
in just being there.

918
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,832
Thank you, Mark,

919
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:04,991
for bringing me
out to the water.

920
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,362
You're welcome, Dad.

921
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,414
Sam?

922
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,149
Dr. Greene.

923
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:21,251
Sam, uh, I'd like you
to meet my father,

924
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,886
this is David Greene.

925
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,174
Dad, this is Sam MacKenzie.
Sarah MacKenzie's husband.

926
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,376
How do you do, sir?

927
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,515
What the hell?

928
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,816
I-I know how hard Dr. Carter
tried to keep me here.

929
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,518
Yeah, it's pretty
tough with the HMOs.

930
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,087
But they'll take good care of
you at New Western, Mr. Pooler.

931
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,989
Yeah, could you get a message
to my wife? She's in the ICU.

932
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,791
I'll call as soon
as I get settled.

933
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,694
They don't have phones
for the ICU patients,

934
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,046
but if you call the main
number, they'll put you through

935
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,232
to the desk and you can
ask how's she's doing, okay?

936
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:53,701
Good, good. And thanks...
Thanks again for everything.

937
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,370
My wife and I, we
certainly appreciate it.

938
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,627
You're welcome, sir.

939
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,887
How's Paul doing?

940
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,588
He's at Chester.

941
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,012
I guess that's the
main place for Illinois.

942
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,284
They put him on medication.

943
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:26,333
What did you wanna
talk about, Dr. Carter?

944
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,568
I don't know.

945
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,170
I just keep thinking about
what happened and...

946
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,873
You're not the only one.

947
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,208
Sometimes the
thoughts in my head

948
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:39,212
seem to be as loud as the
voices Paul seems to hear.

949
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,349
I lived with him,
I slept with him.

950
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,341
I'm about to bear his child.

951
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,290
How could I not see it?

952
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,079
I don't know.

953
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,563
Keep trying.

954
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,566
I am trying. It's not starting.

955
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,637
Keep trying. It'll
start. It'll start.

956
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,555
"Keep trying. It'll
start. It'll start."

957
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:06,357
It'll start.

958
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,391
It's not starting.

959
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,925
It has been an otherwise
really nice day, huh?

960
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:29,146

967

Thank you for calling.

968
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,878
I'm sorry about all
this, Mrs. Lomax.

969
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,444
Where are they?

970
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:02,546
I think your ex-husband
went up to the cafeteria,

971
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,070
but I can take you to Jessamyn.

972
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,408
Everybody wants
this, Mrs. Lomax.

973
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,004
A lemonade stand?

974
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:03,907
Yeah. Me and my friends,
we would set up a card table,

975
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:05,676
put it on the curb,
with a sign that said:

976
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,311
"Lemonade, 10 cents a glass."

977
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,648
'Course it wasn't as lucrative
as the chicken-and-cow trade.

978
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,350
If we made $1.50
we were riding high.

979
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:15,653
But less cleanup than
the cow-and-chicken trade.

980
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:18,022
True.

981
00:43:18,046 --> 00:43:20,257
I look forward to that
for Kate and Tess.

982
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:23,160
You know, when that's the
most important thing in their world.

983
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,629
When all they think about is:
did they put in enough sugar

984
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,364
and when the next
car is driving by.

985
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:29,255
Yeah.

986
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,039
I expected the tow
truck to be here by now.

987
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:39,865
But then nothing has
gone as expected today.
