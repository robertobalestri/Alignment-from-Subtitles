1
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,075
You should be sitting.

2
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,811
Oh, that's okay. I'm fine.

3
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,714
Uh... Uh, excuse me.

4
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,951
Would you mind giving
your seat to this lady?

5
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:43,987
Didn't you hear me?
I said... I heard you!

6
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,323
It's okay, really. I can stand.

7
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,708
She's pregnant.

8
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,544
So that's, like, my problem?

9
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:53,797
All I'm saying is a little
common courtesy...

10
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,800
Sorry, Pops. I got none.

11
00:00:56,824 --> 00:01:00,392
Really, it's okay.
Thank you, anyway.

12
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,278
You okay? Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,679
You sure? Just learning.

14
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,747
Just a few scrapes.

15
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:12,916
All right. You all right?

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,940
Yeah.

17
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:26,346
Ice-blended double-mocha
mocha supremo.

18
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,482
Ice-blended double-mocha
mocha supremo.

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,585
You're a lucky
girl, having a baby.

20
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,153
How far along are you?

21
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,938
Almost six months.

22
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,507
Oh, my, you're getting big!

23
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,459
Thanks. Twins.

24
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:43,330
My niece had twins.
What a delivery that was.

25
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,365
Eighteen hours on the first one.

26
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:46,899
And the second one was breech.

27
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,169
Excuse me, ma'am. Your order?

28
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,637
Oh, just regular coffee, please.

29
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,838
For here.

30
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,675
But I'm sure
yours'll go just fine.

31
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,743
May I?

32
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:58,478
You know, I really
rather you not.

33
00:01:58,502 --> 00:01:59,612
I... Nothing personal.

34
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,281
It's just that when
you're pregnant...

35
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:05,785
I know. Everyone wants to
touch you without even askin'.

36
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,503
Although I did ask.

37
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,439
Regular coffee.

38
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,574
Thank you.

39
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,945
Hi, I'll have a tall
warm milk to go, please.

40
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,381
Nasty. SERVER 2:
Tall warm milk to go.

41
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,349
Excuse me?

42
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,885
Warm milk is nasty.

43
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,587
Really? And what are you having?

44
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,640
Double tall vanilla latte.

45
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:30,243
A latte. Didn't you know that
coffee stunts your growth?

46
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,145
That is so not true.

47
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,813
Do your parents
let you drink it?

48
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:36,315
What are you, the coffee police?
- Tall warm milk.

49
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:38,918
Thanks. You're welcome.

50
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,720
Double tall vanilla latte.

51
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,689
Double tall vanilla latte.

52
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:43,823
My balloon!

53
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,091
Honey, that's okay.

54
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,292
We've got another one. No!

55
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,227
I don't want blue! This
one is just as good.

56
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,796
No! Honey, don't make a scene.

57
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,964
I want yellow!

58
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:53,249
It's a perfectly
good balloon. No!

59
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,121
Oh, my God! Watch out!

60
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,985
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

61
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,003
Carol.

62
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,704
Carol, what happened? I'm fine.

63
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:08,341
Minor lacerations. Probable
shoulder dislocation.

64
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:09,909
Where's Kevin?
Is he already here?

65
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,744
Don't worry. I'm gonna find him.

66
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:12,745
Sure you're all right?

67
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,030
Oh, man, what a morning.

68
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,098
Lets get a trauma panel,
type and cross for four.

69
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,200
Set me up with a chest
tube. Peter, what do we got?

70
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,802
Deep lacerations to the chest.

71
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,404
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

72
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,822
BP is 100/60. Pulse, 120.

73
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,492
Come on, help me, will
ya? What's your name?

74
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,995
Screw that! I'm hurtin' here! I
wanna speak to the manager!

75
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,497
You wanted the
trauma fellowship?

76
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,264
Yeah, well, be careful
what you wish for.

77
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:34,066
All right, 1% lidocaine.

78
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,468
Did you forget your trauma gown?

79
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:36,703
Tell you about it later.

80
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,621
Pulse ox 92 on four liters.

81
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,424
You on any medications?
Do you have any allergies?

82
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,892
No, you sons of bitches!

83
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,428
Just...! You just give me
something for the pain!

84
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,147
All right, titrate four of M.S.

85
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,648
Yeah, you win, bud. Morphine.

86
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:49,804
I've seen you somewhere.

87
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,334
The coffee shop.

88
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,736
Right. And before that,

89
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,104
the El train, remember?

90
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,439
You work here?

91
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,525
She's the manager. Oh, man!

92
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,692
Thora-Seal's ready.

93
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,494
All right, hook me
up! First crit 35.

94
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,863
Pressure's down
to 70. Tachy at 130.

95
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,915
He's bleeding out.
We've got 1000 cc's...

96
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,367
Blood on the rapid infuser.

97
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,836
Give him what he's lost,
and keep him four ahead.

98
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,770
All right, Dr. Corday
just took a critical,

99
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:13,639
and I've got a ton of
lacerations in chairs.

100
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:14,707
Okay, close us to trauma.

101
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,875
Tell the patients in chairs

102
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,343
we'll get to them
as soon as we can.

103
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,945
When's that guy
coming on? What guy?

104
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:21,080
The girl in the Rollerblades
is in a lot of pain.

105
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,182
Four of morphine, one
of Versed. I'll come back.

106
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,235
The guy, you know, the
doc who's moonlighting?

107
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,802
Dr. Kovac? Yeah.

108
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,139
I don't know. Check the
board. See when he's due.

109
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,840
What's this? The
driver of the truck.

110
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,859
Call transport. Get
him to the morgue.

111
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,927
Hey, you. Are you a doctor?

112
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,362
I got one mother of a migraine.

113
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,130
We'll get to you as
soon as we can, sir.

114
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,867
Yeah, I had some Compazine
at home, you know suppository.

115
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,286
Shoved it right up my ass,
but it ain't workin'. Nothin'.

116
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,371
Have a seat. Someone
will be with you in a minute.

117
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,906
They said that 20 minutes ago!

118
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,326
Really, they will. Uh,
Dr. Weaver? Phone.

119
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,297
Peter, can you
take it from here?

120
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,698
I'm gonna go check on Elizabeth.

121
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,333
Yeah, we're just
waiting on an O.R.

122
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,735
Carol?

123
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,555
Please, you have
to find my daughter.

124
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,856
I don't know what happened.

125
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,990
I don't know where she is.

126
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:06,509
What's her name?
I'll look for her.

127
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,144
Michelle. Michelle Kinney.

128
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,381
Hm, better get that checked
out. Here, I'll take a look, Carol.

129
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,883
It's okay, Mark. Mrs.
Kinney, we'll look for her.

130
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,484
But you need to tell
me where it hurts.

131
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,521
All over my chest.
I can't breathe.

132
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,689
Any pain here?

133
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,491
No. Not really.

134
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,159
Pulse ox 88 on 10 liters.

135
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,927
Okay, poor tidal
volume. I'll intubate.

136
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,328
Four of Versed, 100 of sux.

137
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,364
We're gonna give you
some medicine, okay?

138
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,532
It's gonna make you sleepy.

139
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,866
And when you wake up,

140
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,369
there's gonna be a tube
helping you to breathe.

141
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,372
Get X-ray down here.
And I need an ultrasound.

142
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,458
Dr. Corday? I'm in.

143
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,660
Uh, this man's here to see you.

144
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:43,963
Charles Cameron from Rush.
We were gonna have coffee.

145
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,933
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.
Um, I'm a bit involved here.

146
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,551
Mind if I hang out?

147
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,788
Oh, sure, sure, that'd be fine.
Dr. Cameron, Dr. Mark Greene.

148
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,840
Hey.

149
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:57,643
Well, um, let me
just check this page.

150
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,917
I'll be right back.

151
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,047
I've completely forgotten.

152
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,850
We'd set up a coffee,

153
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:06,018
you know, for an
interview at Rush.

154
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,019
An interview for?

155
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,654
Cardiothoracic.

156
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,707
I though you had that
sewed up with Romano.

157
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,743
Yeah, that's just it, the
prospect of Romano.

158
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,744
Seemed like a good idea

159
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,296
to check out
other opportunities.

160
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,915
You're right. Probably
is a good idea.

161
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,100
I'm really sorry, Mark. I
thought I mentioned it.

162
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,585
You don't have to tell me.

163
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,838
I'm looking for a little girl,
about 5, Michelle Kinney.

164
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,807
Not here. Got a Rollerblader.

165
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,542
I'm looking for him
too. Is he all right?

166
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,761
If the lavage is positive,
we'll take him to the O.R.

167
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,979
I'll tell the girlfriend.

168
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:34,847
Dr. Anspaugh,
the phone's for you.

169
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,266
Revisions on the Jayco report?

170
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,935
They call in the middle
of a trauma. My God.

171
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,572
The mind-numbing
day-to-day detritus of this job.

172
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,773
You okay finishing the DPL?

173
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,708
Oh, yeah.

174
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,776
Yes?

175
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,777
You gonna ask him?

176
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,312
Ask him what?

177
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,581
About the rumor he's
quittin' as chief of staff.

178
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,582
What?

179
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,116
Going back to general surgery.

180
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,002
I haven't heard anything.

181
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:57,837
Residents are out of the loop.

182
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,872
Why would he do that?

183
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,173
I don't know. Something about

184
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,875
that day-to-day
whatever of his job.

185
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,710
How are we doing, Carter?

186
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,095
All right, prep for transfer.

187
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,764
How tough is it to get
somethin' for the pain?

188
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,267
Sorry, sir, we've got a
lot critical cases right now.

189
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,970
And this jackhammer
in my head ain't critical?

190
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,072
What kind of
bush-league joint is this?!

191
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,074
Randi, can you kill that
guy with the migraine?

192
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,308
Happily.

193
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,210
Did a little girl come
in with this accident?

194
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,879
About 5? Michelle Kinney.

195
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:23,880
I didn't see her.

196
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,881
She might be on her way.

197
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,082
Just got off the MICN.

198
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,251
They're sending two
more criticals. Ten minutes.

199
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,451
W...? What do you mean?

200
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,254
I thought I told you
to close us to trauma.

201
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,156
I know but Dr. Romano
told me to keep us open.

202
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,390
And who asked him? I did.

203
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,759
It's a protocol thing.
He is acting chief.

204
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,761
Get back on the radio,
and tell them go to Mercy.

205
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,229
And, you, get
Romano on the phone.

206
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,630
What the hell's he thinking?

207
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,800
We're barely keeping our
head above water as it is.

208
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,251
Pressure's down to 75.

209
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,418
Another two units of O-neg.

210
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,787
No bleeding in the belly.

211
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,757
Chest x-ray shows diffuse
bilateral pulmonary contusions.

212
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,091
No signs of blood loss.

213
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,394
Pulse ox falling to
80 on 100% oxygen.

214
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:56,262
Let me check the heart.

215
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,963
Could be a tension pneumo.

216
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:00,233
Fourteen-gauge needle
on an open syringe.

217
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:01,684
Crit's 42.

218
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,341
There's no pericardial effusion.

219
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,907
No tension pneumo.

220
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,360
But she's got a
terrible ejection fraction.

221
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,412
Must be a cardiac contusion.

222
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:14,530
She's bruised the hell
out of her heart and lungs.

223
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,500
Another five of PEEP.
Pressure's down to 60.

224
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,168
Okay, mix up dopamine.

225
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,169
Should I book an O.R.?

226
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,704
Nothing to repair surgically.

227
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,539
Right you are, unfortunately.

228
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,540
What do we do?

229
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,042
Pressure and
ventilatory support.

230
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,260
That's about it.

231
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:28,327
Wait, hold on a minute.

232
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,095
Run up to the O.R...
Just try something.

233
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,131
Run up to the O.R., bring
down bypass machine.

234
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,298
Cart down tray now.

235
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,351
Prepare the groin
for bypass catheters.

236
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,703
Put her on bypass?
That's pretty gutsy.

237
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,138
It's worth a try.

238
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,807
Betadine and sterile drapes.

239
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,509
Well, well, well, this
is quite a convention.

240
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,361
Charlie Cameron. Still at Rush?

241
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,146
Rocket. Haven't seen you in...

242
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,648
Oh, gosh, who really cares?

243
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,821
So what brings
you to our fair land?

244
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,419
Coffee, actually. Oh.

245
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:55,488
I hear it's the best
in the city. Mm-hm.

246
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:59,125
Well, there's enough
cooks in this broth, I think.

247
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,795
I'll go and inspire
the rest of the troops.

248
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,796
O.R.'s ready.

249
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,431
Pulse ox 99 on 100%.

250
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:07,900
Peter, what's goin' on here?
Penetrating chest trauma.

251
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:10,202
1000 cc's out of the chest.
Taking him to the O.R.

252
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,705
Uh-huh, and what's his
pressure? 95 systolic, up from 70.

253
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,590
Whoa, whoa, keep him here. What?

254
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,759
Check another pressure.
He needs a thoracotomy.

255
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,861
A liter of initial
chest tube output

256
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,563
is an indication to go the O.R.

257
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,764
Nah, it's borderline.

258
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,315
How much blood?
Two units of O-neg,

259
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,985
1000 cc's, autotransfuse.
What's in the Thora-Seal?

260
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,937
Hundred cc's. Uh-huh.

261
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,273
And the pressure? 105/74.

262
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,875
Okay, so, Peter, let's review.

263
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,443
His pressure's in
the normal range,

264
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,312
and chest tube output
has slowed a trickle.

265
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,747
Now, as a surgeon, I
would say he's forming a clot.

266
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,466
As a trauma fellow,
you would disagree?

267
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,734
Maybe. Maybe.

268
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,436
If we're gonna crack
a kid's chest open,

269
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,455
expose him to the risks
of general anesthesia,

270
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,623
and put him through a
painful six-month recovery,

271
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,959
let's make sure "maybe"
is not a part of the equation.

272
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,405
<i>Chest pain, has a history of
hypertension and diabetes...</i>

273
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,389
Hi.

274
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,392
What's your name?

275
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,363
My name is Luka. It's
a funny name, isn't it?

276
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:13,971
Can you say it? Luka.

277
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,708
Does your arm hurt?

278
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,550
I'm a doctor, you know.

279
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,799
I want my mom.

280
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,985
I can help you.

281
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,472
So you want to come out now?

282
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,076
In that case, do you
mind if I come in?

283
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,580
Yes, of course, Lucy. I'd
be happy to mentor you.

284
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,782
I'm dying here! Any
of you putzes care?

285
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,684
I really want to focus
on emergency medicine

286
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,653
for my final year, and I
think it would be great

287
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,020
to have that one
person to go to.

288
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,523
I know that it will. I
had a great mentor.

289
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,624
What's it take, huh?

290
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,193
I gotta get run
over by some truck?

291
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,745
Yeah, I finished that DPL and
sent the head trauma to CT.

292
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,947
Thank you, Carter.

293
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,165
Have you heard rumors
about Dr. Anspaugh quitting?

294
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,001
No, where'd you hear that?

295
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,335
I heard a scarier one.

296
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,254
Not only is
Dr. Anspaugh quitting

297
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,356
Dr. Romano is the
front-runner to take his place.

298
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,677
Romano as chief of staff?
Carter, take this sheet.

299
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,878
Oh!

300
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,263
You okay?

301
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:18,797
Stand by with paddles.

302
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,499
Get ready for
chest compressions.

303
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,067
I'm in. Hook this up. - Mark.

304
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,336
Mark, when you have a
moment, I need to speak with you.

305
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,354
Sure.

306
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,658
Run of nine.

307
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,380
Charge to 200.

308
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,948
Start the bypass.

309
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,497
She's stabilizing.

310
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,831
All right.

311
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,966
Want to go in here?

312
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,134
Wean off the dopamine.

313
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:56,438
BP 120/80.

314
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,038
I just heard Anspaugh's
stepping down

315
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,473
and Romano's in
line for the chief's job.

316
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:04,076
I don't buy it. Anspaugh
would've said something us.

317
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,745
You're right. It's probably
just crazy rumor-mill stuff.

318
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,247
Yeah. I'll... I'll go upstairs
and, uh, talk to him about it.

319
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,683
Good idea.

320
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,484
Whoa, it's the fire
alarm! What the hell?

321
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,319
Please, tell me this is a drill!

322
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,421
Okay, you better prep
your patient for transfer.

323
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,123
I'll cover the main hall!

324
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:19,491
Where is it? I don't know.

325
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,560
But start moving patients
to the ambulance bay.

326
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,428
Are we gonna have to
move? Maybe. Be ready.

327
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,097
Dr. Benton, he's crashing!

328
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,187
Carter! Get in here now!

329
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,002
Paddles! Charge to 200.

330
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:32,604
Another 1500 in the Thora-Seal.

331
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:35,262
Thoracotomy tray!
Let's move! Come on!

332
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:39,544
Scalpel. Let's
squeeze in the blood.

333
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,846
Should I page Romano?

334
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,870
No time. Rib spreader.

335
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,154
Oh, man, there's, like,
a gallon of blood in here.

336
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:51,498
Come on, come on,
come on. More suction!

337
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,126
Please don't run.

338
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,829
Everybody move slowly and
quietly to the ambulance bay.

339
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,765
Three's clear. Where
the hell's the fire?

340
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,701
I don't know. Can you
clear exam one and two?

341
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,936
I got four units
of type-specific.

342
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,470
Hang it now.

343
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:08,340
Carter, come take over
the internal compressions.

344
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,976
Internal paddles are ready.
What about the fire alarm?

345
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,212
Let's save his life
first. Come on... I got it.

346
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:15,114
There! There, you
see? There's the bleeder.

347
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,116
All right, 2-0 Vicryl
and pickups. Let's move.

348
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,884
- You want FFP?
- Yeah. Two units

349
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,352
and a gram of Ancef.

350
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:23,622
Still in fib. Good femoral
pulse with compressions.

351
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,858
All right. Mammary
artery is ligated.

352
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,626
All right, paddles.
Charge to 20.

353
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,794
Everybody clear!

354
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,378
Clear.

355
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,233
Don't tell me you
just pulled that thing?

356
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:35,889
Maybe now I'll
get some attention.

357
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,004
He pulled the damn alarm!

358
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:41,857
Get back to admin. Let
people know it's a false alarm.

359
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,881
And you, stay down!

360
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,412
You move, and
I'll let her at you.

361
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,380
Everyone, please
listen! It's a false alarm!

362
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,749
You don't have to
evacuate! There is no fire!

363
00:14:58,914 --> 00:14:59,891
Normal sinus.

364
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,660
BP's 80 systolic.

365
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,829
His oxygen tank is almost empty.

366
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:06,215
All right. Carter, go get
another cylinder. Let's move.

367
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,850
All right, everybody.

368
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:08,951
Let's get him up to the O.R.

369
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,390
Carter, let's move!

370
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,472
Go, people! Go!

371
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,496
Watch it!

372
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,524
Out of the way!

373
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,559
Have you ever
been to the circus?

374
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,927
No.

375
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,183
You have now.

376
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,885
So, all you have to do is
break off the little valve?

377
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,687
You can rent it and
take it to a party.

378
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,959
Lily, find Mr. Migraine.
Give him six mg of Imitrex.

379
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,093
And then call the police

380
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,861
and report him
for inciting a riot.

381
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,863
Excuse me, uh, which
room is open for Michelle?

382
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,331
Oh, thanks, Dr. Kovac,

383
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,900
but we have a pediatric
resident who can take her.

384
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,568
Uh, Cleo's not on yet.

385
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,072
She's due shortly. Why don't
you set her up in the Pedes room?

386
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,306
She wants to see her mother.

387
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,975
Yeah, that's probably
not a good idea.

388
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,243
The mother's been
intubated, and she's on bypass.

389
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,512
But we got plenty of other
patients who need suturing.

390
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,148
Sure. Anything is fine.
Um, I'll check the board.

391
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,850
Good. Kerry, I'm
gonna run upstairs

392
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,185
and try and find Anspaugh.

393
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,486
Dr. Weaver, the films are
back from the Rollerblader.

394
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,955
Okay.

395
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,524
Dr. Weaver, one last critical
coming in from that accident.

396
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,226
Someone they found
under the rubble.

397
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,295
At the back door. Okay.
Lucy, follow me on this.

398
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,864
Carol! Got another
lac for Dr. Kovac.

399
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,154
Got it.

400
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,337
<i>I'll give you two or
three articles a week</i>

401
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,505
and then we can go over them.

402
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,173
Okay, great. Good morning.

403
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,776
Hey, Cleo, I'm glad you're here.
I've got a Pedes case for you.

404
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,478
If you need help,
you can pull Carter in.

405
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,479
Sounds good.

406
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,848
Dr. Finch, do you
always jog to work?

407
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,415
It's only four miles.

408
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,685
Kind of makes you want
to dislike her, doesn't it?

409
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,521
This little tube right here,

410
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,090
that's for giving your mother
medicine to make her better.

411
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,459
And what's that?

412
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:02,531
That's a machine that helps
her take really deep breaths.

413
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,800
You know, like when you
go underwater to swim,

414
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,536
you take deep breaths.

415
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,638
I'm not allowed
to go underwater.

416
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,340
I have to wear wings.

417
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,541
Wings?

418
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,110
It's kind of like a life
jacket for little kids.

419
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,112
Oh.

420
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,282
They gave my mommy some
medicine to makes her sleepy.

421
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,317
That's right, but she's
gonna wake up soon

422
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,974
and be very happy to see you.

423
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,389
And now we're gonna
go find the doctor

424
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,724
who will look at your arm.

425
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:29,758
Okay.

426
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,193
Okay.

427
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,228
Well, Peter, I am impressed.

428
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,197
We're 10 minutes in on
this teenager of yours,

429
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,800
and I haven't heard you so
much as whisper an "I told you so."

430
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,702
Okay, we're ready for
the second chest tube.

431
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,004
Let's make it a 36 French.

432
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,873
All right. Another
liter of irrigant.

433
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:47,475
By the way, you've met Charles
Cameron, haven't you? From Rush?

434
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,879
Uh, yeah, he has
privileges here.

435
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,747
Uh, cardiothoracic, I think.

436
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,851
Yeah, that's the, uh, same
specialty that, uh, Elizabeth...

437
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,110
Uh... Uh, Dr. Corday is,
uh, still interested in, isn't it?

438
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,690
I wouldn't know.

439
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,427
Oh. Hasn't mentioned much
about that, huh, lately, huh?

440
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,362
No, not to me. ROMANO: Oh.

441
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,432
Not to me either. Which is
odd, considering I sponsored her.

442
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,867
Why do you think that is?

443
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,402
I only ask you that because I
know you two have been friends.

444
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,572
You obviously know
her much better than I do.

445
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,741
Dr. Romano, do all
our conversations

446
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,965
have to revolve
around Elizabeth?

447
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,651
Well, Dr. Benton, perhaps
you and I don't need to have

448
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,042
any further
conversations at all.

449
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,258
Okay.

450
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,526
Some number two Dexon,
please, for the intercostals.

451
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,450
And, uh, I will close.

452
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,399
Is this the last one
from the accident?

453
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,101
Yup. Probably
ruptured her aorta.

454
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,469
Bled out in a matter of seconds.

455
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,870
Got a minute? Sure.

456
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,072
Lucy, good work.

457
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,941
Why don't you stay
and write the death note?

458
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,325
Okay. I'll get the death kit.

459
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,401
I talked to Anspaugh.
The rumors are true.

460
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,748
Both of them?

461
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,984
He's quitting and Romano's
gonna be chief of staff?

462
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,452
Donald is leaving the job,

463
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,221
but he's gonna stay at
County, do general surgery.

464
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,723
He wants to spend more
time with his daughter.

465
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,294
And Romano taking
over is a possibility.

466
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,796
We gotta do something, Mark.

467
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,798
I got Anspaugh to
agree to a meeting.

468
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,733
We can weigh in on whether
we think Romano is the right guy.

469
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,917
Yeah, he's not
the right one for us.

470
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,738
I don't get this.

471
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,439
You're a regular, old doctor.

472
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,575
Yes. But you don't work here.

473
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,377
No, I do work here, but
only when they need me.

474
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,914
I'm, uh, what they
call a "moonlighter."

475
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,116
Because you're
from another country?

476
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,754
No, because I only work
here from time to time,

477
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,289
when they need me.

478
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,924
And they needed you today
because of the truck crash.

479
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,864
No, uh, I'm here because
one of the regular doctors...

480
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:53,035
I thought you said you were
one of the regular doctors.

481
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,139
I just fill in when
someone else is absent.

482
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,296
Oh, I get it. You're like a sub.

483
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,577
A sub.

484
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,380
Yeah, yeah. I'm a sub. Yeah.

485
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,803
What kind of accent is that?

486
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,039
Thick.

487
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,654
Neighbors heard the baby
crying for a couple of days.

488
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,056
Finally called us in to police.

489
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,456
Broke the door
down. What a mess.

490
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,626
Any known relatives?
Neighbors didn't think so.

491
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,128
Mom lived alone with the boy.
They also think she has AIDS.

492
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,696
What about the baby? Don't know.

493
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,632
Need anything else?
No, we got it from here.

494
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,035
Tachycardia, pulse
thready, hypoxic,

495
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,171
or possibly fulminant
pneumocystis.

496
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,006
Let's get her
started on Bactrim,

497
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,708
three amps IV, 125
mgs of Solu-Medrol.

498
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,845
Make sure the O-2 is cranked
up to 10 liters. She's not moving.

499
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,346
You want a CBC and lytes?

500
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,515
Yeah. Check with the
ICU. We need to get a bed.

501
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,516
How's that baby?

502
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,717
Temp's 102.

503
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,053
He's dehydrated.
I started an IV.

504
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,889
Rales bilaterally on the bases.

505
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,058
I think there's a
consolidation on the right.

506
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,559
I need a complete blood
count and a chest film.

507
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,761
I'll get the portable.

508
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,761
Pneumonia?

509
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,264
It would be a pretty safe bet.

510
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,631
Want an HIV test?

511
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,567
Can't test the baby without
the mom's permission,

512
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,036
which is not gonna happen.

513
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,570
Pretty likely he's positive.

514
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,206
Yeah, but we either
wait for the mom

515
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,408
or the court to allow the test.

516
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,409
Now we'll start him on Cefurox.

517
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,512
HIV-positive, goes
ahead and has a baby.

518
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,750
No sign of any support.
What was she thinking?

519
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,085
Dr. Finch, films are back

520
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,786
on that little girl
with the broken arm.

521
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,954
Thanks, Eli.

522
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,589
Go ahead. I'll
fill out the labs.

523
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,656
Okay. Thanks.

524
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,559
Eli, can you get these
to the lab for me?

525
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,229
Oh, sure. Thanks.

526
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,030
Oh, wait a second, I forgot.

527
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,933
Add an HIV test
to, uh, this one.

528
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,335
Carlos Ortega? Right.

529
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,536
No problem.

530
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,127
Okay.

531
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,577
Am I interrupting?

532
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,279
No, no. Not at all.
Please, come in.

533
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,547
We are done here.

534
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,483
Hey, Vanilla Latte. I
wondered about you.

535
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,985
Glad to see you're doing okay.

536
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,553
You're the warm-milk lady.

537
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,223
That's right. I work here.

538
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:57,159
Yeah, but does that
mean you really work here?

539
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,426
Don't answer that one.

540
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,761
You're done. Feel okay?

541
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,496
Yeah. I feel fine.

542
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,864
On your way.

543
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:03,888
Thanks.

544
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,638
Oh, my God. That
boy is relentless.

545
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,641
I think his parents feel
quite exhausted, huh?

546
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,811
It seems like I
need some stitches.

547
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,068
I already irrigated.

548
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,817
I heard you were at,
uh, that coffee place

549
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,251
when the accident happened?

550
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,154
I had just left 10
seconds earlier.

551
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,023
I don't even want
to think about it.

552
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,660
Still, it seems like most
people came out of it okay.

553
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,295
Miraculously.

554
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,631
So you took that little
girl in to see her mother?

555
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,200
Yes.

556
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,801
Even though Dr. Weaver
and Dr. Greene

557
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,970
didn't think it was
such a good idea.

558
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:45,474
Oh, mostly they're not
sure if I'm a good doctor.

559
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:46,942
Why do you say that?

560
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,878
This is, like, the second or
third time you've worked here.

561
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,515
Yeah. Enough time for them
to stop calling me Dr. Kovac.

562
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,450
You know, when
people are not sure,

563
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,274
they tend to keep
things more formal.

564
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,156
I hope you will be happy
enough with your sutures

565
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,280
to call me Luka.

566
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,762
I took the girl in

567
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,831
because, uh, children
need to know, need to see,

568
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,266
even if what they
see is not good,

569
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,503
it's still better than being
in the dark, you know?

570
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:17,127
Having... that kind of fear.

571
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,475
You sound experienced
in these things.

572
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,579
Well, whatever experience
I have with children

573
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,437
didn't help me with that boy.

574
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,287
Carol, are you busy?

575
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,888
No, I just got sutured.

576
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,191
Their mother was
in that accident.

577
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,625
Massive blunt chest trauma.

578
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,027
They'd like to view the body.

579
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,851
Sure, no problem. Thank you.

580
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,132
Hello, I'm Carol Hathaway.

581
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,201
I'm very sorry for your loss.

582
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,468
Thank you.

583
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,171
Would you like
me to show you in?

584
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:50,460
Yes, please.

585
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:20,218
Did I hear Romano's
gonna be chief of staff?

586
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,820
You are gonna
fight this, aren't you?

587
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:23,388
Dr. Weaver and I
have an appointment

588
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:24,723
with Dr. Anspaugh,

589
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,791
and we're supposed to
give our honest opinions.

590
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:28,226
So you are gonna fight it. Good.

591
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,729
That baby boy, Carlos Ortega,
needs to get up to Pedes.

592
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:31,863
Sure. I can go with him.

593
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,364
We already sent
the mom to the ICU.

594
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,355
I'll call you. Great.

595
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,169
Awfully long cup of coffee.

596
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:39,370
Oh, he got paged.

597
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,439
Had to leave, but he came
back for a bite of lunch.

598
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:42,440
How'd it go?

599
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,108
Oh, who ever knows
with interviews?

600
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,610
I'm late for a lap choly.

601
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,679
I'll take that back pain in 4.

602
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:49,280
Sure. Do you need some help?

603
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,616
I think I'm okay,
but thanks anyway.

604
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,552
Mark, I don't mean to pry.

605
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,754
How... How are things
going with you and Elizabeth?

606
00:24:55,778 --> 00:24:56,755
Okay.

607
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,322
You guys are still
going out, right?

608
00:24:58,346 --> 00:24:59,758
Yeah, a little.

609
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:01,626
Am I gonna have to
beg for information here?

610
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,695
Carol, I'd hate to see you beg.

611
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,830
No, everything's okay,
really. You know, I ju...

612
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,399
Eh, I may have
backed off a little bit.

613
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,201
Which means she's backed off.

614
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,670
These things just kinda have

615
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:14,094
a life of their own, don't they?

616
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:17,042
If that's not enough,
you're gonna have to beg.

617
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,111
MVA, BMW vs. a Toyota.

618
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:21,345
Vital to stable,

619
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,114
but she's complaining
of some neck pain.

620
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,482
She didn't wanna come to the ER,

621
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:26,150
but she's been
very polite about it.

622
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:28,853
What's MVA? Motor
vehicle accident.

623
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:32,791
It was a little fender-bender.
I'm completely fine.

624
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:35,359
Elaine Nichols? Yes.

625
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:36,766
Ha! I'm John Carter.

626
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:39,481
Douglas' cousin.

627
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,351
Oh, yes, of course.

628
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,386
Well, seeing as we're
practically related,

629
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,670
could I get out of this thing?

630
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:47,322
Sure.

631
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:51,326
You just have to hold
still while I examine you.

632
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,761
Can't believe you're old
enough to be a doctor.

633
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,846
Oh, yeah.

634
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,148
No midline tenderness?

635
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:59,050
Turn your head to the right.

636
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,585
And the left.

637
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:03,154
Full range of
motion. You're clear.

638
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,938
Can I get up? Mm-hm.

639
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,728
Is that better?

640
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:12,814
Oh, I guess you are old enough.

641
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,616
Yes.

642
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,967
So no neck pain?

643
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,235
It's my little finger, actually.

644
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,555
Think I jammed it when
they stuck me on this gurney.

645
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,530
Let's just check them all out.

646
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:29,914
Yeah, that's the one.

647
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,372
Hand x-ray? I'll go order it.

648
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,686
Thank you, Chuny.

649
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,572
Yeah, we'll wanna make sure
that you don't have a fracture.

650
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,992
Oh. I guess I'll be
staying here for a while.

651
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,016
If that's all right.

652
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,500
So I can't really think
how long it's been.

653
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,552
Let's see, I...

654
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,276
divorced your cousin
Douglas three years ago.

655
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:55,240
Huh.

656
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,558
I remember your wedding.

657
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,477
Oh, I didn't realize
you were there.

658
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:00,579
Oh, yeah. I...

659
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:04,215
Douglas looked nervous as
hell, and you looked incredible...

660
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,851
ly calm.

661
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,189
Well, that must have been
the calm before the storm,

662
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,413
given the way our marriage went.

663
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,533
Ancient history.

664
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:21,154
But...

665
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,470
Divorce suits me.

666
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,588
Yeah. So I'm assuming
you were driving the BMW,

667
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:27,927
and not the Toyota.

668
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,130
What makes you think that?

669
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,797
X-ray confirms pneumonia.

670
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,233
Pneumocystis?

671
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,501
Looks more bacterial.

672
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,202
Is this the Ortega baby?

673
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,870
Yes. I'm Jeanie Boulet.

674
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,139
I brought him up from the ER.

675
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,306
Robert Martin, DCFS.

676
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,509
Any idea how long he'll be here?

677
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,611
Needs IV antibiotics.
At least a few days.

678
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,078
Well, the longer the better.

679
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,597
Give us time to
find a placement.

680
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:54,165
Any ideas where?

681
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:56,134
No.

682
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:57,468
The cases like this are a mess.

683
00:27:57,492 --> 00:27:59,037
Mother with AIDS
on her deathbed,

684
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:01,139
probably have to go to
court to get the boy tested.

685
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:02,407
And if he's positive?

686
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,308
Then we need a foster family

687
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,045
willing to take on a
child of color with HIV.

688
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,229
Not exactly a dime a dozen.

689
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,654
Yeah.

690
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,088
You're late.

691
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,757
Dr. Benton, Chris Honegs,
Family Counseling Services.

692
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,158
Hey, how you doing?

693
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,327
Fine, thanks. But you
are a little late, so let's...

694
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:24,495
Let me get right to it.

695
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,231
This, as you know,
is a, uh, mediation,

696
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:29,034
in which we hope to
negotiate an agreement

697
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:30,635
regarding the
custody of your son.

698
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:31,636
Now, I am not a judge.

699
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,972
And this session
is confidential.

700
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:37,108
Nothing said here can be
used as evidence in court, okay?

701
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,476
Why can't we just go to court,

702
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,760
present the evidence?

703
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,946
Because this is

704
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,097
a court-ordered
mediation, Carla. Yeah.

705
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,917
Because you got
a restraining order

706
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,201
put out on me and Roger.

707
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,970
No, a restraining
order on you and Roger

708
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,972
taking my son to Germany,
where he has no chance

709
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,724
of developing his
language skills.

710
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:53,774
Dr. Benton.

711
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,959
My son is deaf.

712
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,244
Our son. And he knows that.

713
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,312
It's on the form.

714
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,596
And Reece would do just fine

715
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,415
with an American
sign-language tutor.

716
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,432
Okay, Ms. Simmons.

717
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:03,335
You have this tutor? I will.

718
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,519
And what if you don't?
Dr. Benton, please.

719
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,855
The purpose of this session

720
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,440
is to talk about
your child's needs.

721
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:10,892
He needs to be with his mother.

722
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,794
And he needs to
be with his father.

723
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,296
Yeah. So what? You gonna
bring him home from work

724
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,297
and put him in a bed

725
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,500
on the sofa in your living room?

726
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,619
He doesn't have his own room?

727
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:21,686
O-o-of course he does.

728
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,471
Since when?

729
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:27,141
We moved in with my
sister Jackie and her family.

730
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,628
So that, uh, you know,
Reece could have much more

731
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:33,832
of a, um, uh, complete,
you know, family unit.

732
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,572
As he would with us.

733
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,904
His black mother and
his black stepfather.

734
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:41,589
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

735
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,924
What... What is that, Carla?

736
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,628
Because I went out
with a white woman?

737
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,597
I'm just saying...

738
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,282
You know what, I
can't... I can't do this.

739
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:52,517
Oh, yes, you can.

740
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,840
Court-ordered, remember?

741
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,015
So, what's the prognosis?

742
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,279
What are you doing in here?

743
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,032
You said to wait in
chairs, so I found one.

744
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,751
Ha. I didn't even
know we had a chair.

745
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,202
Is that me?

746
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,258
Yes.

747
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,757
Not much of a
measure of a hand, is it?

748
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,111
I mean, of what a hand can do.

749
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,843
Looks too spindly.

750
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,911
Well, at least
there's no fracture.

751
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,447
Well, that's good.

752
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,648
So I'm free to go?

753
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,517
I'll walk you out.

754
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,786
So do you need a ride?

755
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,990
I'll be taking cabs
until my car gets fixed.

756
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,458
I guess I was
hoping for something

757
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,093
a little more dramatic.

758
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,595
You know, a cast
or a sling, maybe.

759
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,396
Something to get me
out of this fundraiser

760
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,998
I promised I'd go to tonight.

761
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,000
Oh, don't tell me. That's right.

762
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,702
The Carter Family Foundation.

763
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:04,839
Even in divorce, Gamma
still has her claws into you?

764
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,941
How come I never see you
at any of these functions?

765
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,044
Oh, I managed to
get myself declawed.

766
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,646
So, what is it tonight?
Save The Lake?

767
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,548
No, no. It's, uh,
Children's Library?

768
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,216
Close. Children's Art League.

769
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,283
Ahhh.

770
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,119
Randi, can you call a
cab for Miss Nichols?

771
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,143
Sure.

772
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,356
So thank you, Dr. Carter.

773
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,025
You are welcome. You're welcome.

774
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,528
And I'll be thinking
of you. You will?

775
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,896
I mean, tonight, mixing it up

776
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,065
with the rest of the Carters.

777
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,609
Well, then I'll just have
to be thinking of you.

778
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,071
It was nice to see
you again, Elaine.

779
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,095
John.

780
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,945
Hope Anspaugh hasn't
already made up his mind.

781
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,947
Look, if enough of us
come down against Romano,

782
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,615
how Anspaugh go
ahead and appoint him?

783
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,483
Will there be enough?
That's the question.

784
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,885
You mean, if it's
just you and me?

785
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,453
Don't even think about that.

786
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,656
We all know he's eager, if
not downright breathless.

787
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,459
So I can find no compelling
reason not to support him.

788
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,496
Although, as head of
Radiology, I would like to point out

789
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,332
that no head of Radiology
has ever been considered

790
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,700
for chief of staff.

791
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,836
But perhaps that's a
topic for some other day.

792
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,305
No wonder it takes so
long to get our x-rays read.

793
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,007
Thank you, Steve. Carl?

794
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,326
Up in Psych we pretty
much run our own ship.

795
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,213
It was six months before I
knew Donald had taken over.

796
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,932
Seeing as this won't
rock my world much,

797
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,201
Dr. Romano's fine with me.

798
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:24,852
How about you, Jack?

799
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,105
Oh, God knows
I'm like you, Donald.

800
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:29,724
I've had more than
enough bureaucratic crap.

801
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:32,227
I already had one heart attack.

802
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:35,335
You find a guy willing to take
that stuff on, I say book him.

803
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,072
Mark.

804
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,972
Well, I... hate to be
the voice of dissent.

805
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,975
And it certainly isn't
personal, Robert,

806
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,095
but, uh, I feel I
should be honest.

807
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,759
Absolutely.

808
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:58,669
As, uh, acting chief of the
ER for the past few months,

809
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:01,339
Dr. Romano has...

810
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,509
Well, there hasn't been,
uh, a great deal of support.

811
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:10,898
His management
style is, I guess, abrupt.

812
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:16,504
And, uh, several members
of our, uh, staff have, uh...

813
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:20,180
Well, they've even
found it offensive.

814
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,349
Go on.

815
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,484
Well, I guess I'd have
to say that, uh, I'd worry

816
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,470
if Dr. Romano was to
have the responsibility

817
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:36,295
of the entire staff and faculty.

818
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,302
Well, thank you,
Mark, for your candor.

819
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,588
Kerry?

820
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:49,470
As any of us who've
been in management know,

821
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,140
it's never easy taking
over another department,

822
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,259
and I agree with Mark.

823
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,977
There have been a
few bumps in the road.

824
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:59,630
But I feel Dr. Romano
has succeeded

825
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:03,634
in stabilizing the situation,
and is now providing

826
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:08,490
some genuine leadership in
the Emergency Department.

827
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,975
So you would support
him as chief of staff?

828
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,593
I think it's only fair
that we give him

829
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,737
all the support that we can.

830
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,853
You hung me out to dry, Kerry.

831
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,121
Mark, I'm sorry.

832
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,925
But it was obvious Romano
was gonna get the job.

833
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,893
Imagine how he would
have taken it out on the ER

834
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,295
if we'd both gone against him.

835
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:32,480
It just seemed
politically smart.

836
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,449
Oh, I see. So you were
being smart while I was

837
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,434
sticking out my neck
being stupid and honest.

838
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,852
Oh, stop it.

839
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,988
I was only trying to
protect the department.

840
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,357
Well, you may believe
that, Kerry, don't ask me to.

841
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,808
Donald throws the dullest
meetings, doesn't he?

842
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,962
No wonder we all need
a little kick of java, huh?

843
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,019
So? What do you think?

844
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:52,816
Gave it the old
Remington heave-ho.

845
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,624
New look for a new job, huh?

846
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,154
Oh, well, back to work.

847
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,123
Oh, uh, actually, Kerry,
if you have a minute,

848
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,147
there's something I
wanna discuss with you.

849
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,037
Hey, did I leave my
sunglasses at your place?

850
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:14,405
Not sure. We can check later.

851
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:16,206
Right. So go on. What
else did the guy say?

852
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,208
Just that Carlos would
be really hard to place.

853
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:19,777
Because he's HIV-positive.

854
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,479
Right. And I couldn't
even tell them

855
00:35:21,503 --> 00:35:23,080
that I ordered
the test illegally.

856
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:24,798
Well, you'd think
they'd wanna know,

857
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,550
get him the cocktail. I know.

858
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:28,052
Anyway, I realized
that I would be

859
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:30,838
the perfect foster
mom for this baby.

860
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,423
I certainly know
how to deal with HIV.

861
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:34,125
I think you're right.
You'd be perfect.

862
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:35,626
That's not what the
DCFS would say,

863
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,145
considering my HIV status.

864
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,296
You're healthier than
half the people in the city.

865
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,633
Yeah, but I'm
not married... Yet.

866
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:45,253
So there's no support
system in place for the baby

867
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,704
if something were
to happen to me.

868
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,722
Yet.

869
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:48,789
Reggie.

870
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,741
We can take care
of that part right now.

871
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:53,144
I've gotta get back to work.
Let's just drink our coffee.

872
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,979
Uh-uh. Not till you
say you'll marry me.

873
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:57,015
Reggie. You don't
think I'm serious?

874
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,138
I think you're crazy.

875
00:35:58,923 --> 00:35:59,923
Uh-huh.

876
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:03,943
Jeanie Boulet...

877
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:06,913
..will you marry me?

878
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,631
Good job, Dr. Greene.

879
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,900
What's this all about? Your
meeting with Anspaugh.

880
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,135
How'd you know?
Nurses know everything.

881
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,504
You fought the good fight.

882
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:20,505
Thanks, Mark.

883
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:21,606
Lot of good it did us.

884
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,407
Mark, do you have a minute?

885
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,575
I was just heading out.

886
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,444
You know, um... I
think that we should talk.

887
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:29,113
I think we've talked
enough, Kerry.

888
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,070
This is about something else.

889
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:34,686
30-year-old woman,
pregnant, MVA.

890
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,888
T-boned with passenger
space intrusion.

891
00:36:36,912 --> 00:36:38,556
No pulse. Traumatic full arrest.

892
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,475
Ten minutes down.
Couldn't intubate.

893
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:41,809
One, two, three.

894
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,410
Oh, man, she's
gotta be full-term.

895
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,779
Chuny, take over CPR.

896
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,848
I need an 8-0 tube now.

897
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,683
See if you can give
me some suction.

898
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,551
And set up a central
line. Four units O-neg.

899
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,252
Somebody get
another doctor in here.

900
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,054
Haleh, check for
fetal heart tones.

901
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,322
Asystole on the monitor.

902
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,724
Okay, cricoid pressure.

903
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,793
IV's blown.

904
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:02,396
I'm in. Give me an amp
of epi to put down the tube.

905
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,800
Blood's here. Hang
it on the rapid infuser.

906
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,635
She looks full term.
Fetal heart rate?

907
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,619
Can't find it.

908
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,054
What's the mother's rhythm?

909
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,956
Asystole. We got her intubated.

910
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,824
Any pulse in the field?
Paramedic said no.

911
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:14,842
Down time?

912
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:15,927
We're at 12 minutes.

913
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:16,927
The mother is dead.

914
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,129
Wait, why can't we try a...?

915
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,114
No, she's dead. We need
to get the baby out now.

916
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,499
All right, subclavian's
in. Go with the O-neg.

917
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:24,235
Chuny, keep up compressions.

918
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:25,653
I need retractors.

919
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:26,988
Get a baby warmer in here!

920
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,472
Open a cutdown tray.

921
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,296
No time. Give me your hands.

922
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:34,478
Hold it open like this.

923
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,822
All right, chest
tube, 32 French.

924
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,855
I'm opening the uterus.

925
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:42,119
Bandage scissors.

926
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:43,443
Bulb suction.

927
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:55,155
It's a girl.

928
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,842
Come here.

929
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,551
Shhh.

930
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,893
Okay, okay.

931
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,731
Left chest is full of
blood. Hold compressions.

932
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,385
Still asystole.

933
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,453
Okay, let's rally
here. One more try.

934
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,621
Give me an amp of atropine.

935
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,590
Repeat the epi,
and continue CPR.

936
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,893
Heart rate is, uh, 140.

937
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,194
She's pinking up.

938
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:43,614
One-minute Apgar,
eight out of 10.

939
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:44,649
She's gonna be fine.

940
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:46,072
Yeah, I think so.

941
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:50,410
Time of death, 18:48.

942
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:11,024
How's he doing?

943
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,896
Better. Fever's down.
He's resting comfortably.

944
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,781
Good. Any news on his mom?

945
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:21,074
No. I didn't realize she
has end-stage AIDS.

946
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,026
Yep.

947
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:28,964
Let's get him started
on the triple cocktail.

948
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,412
He hasn't even been tested yet.

949
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,052
Get him started, Kit.

950
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:34,588
Okay.

951
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,288
Hey, Randi, have
you seen Dr. Greene?

952
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,789
Uh, he left for the night.

953
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,258
Hey, Carter, do
you have a minute?

954
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:45,292
Yeah, sure.

955
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,493
Hey, so I heard it was true,

956
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,395
the rumor about
Romano becoming chief.

957
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,763
Yes, and although I haven't

958
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,465
made an official announcement,

959
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,968
he's appointed
me chief of the ER.

960
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,669
While they keep up
their endless search

961
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,071
for somebody permanent?

962
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,939
No. Actually, I
am the permanent.

963
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,107
Hey, wow!

964
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,110
Hey, congratulations!
Thank you, thank you.

965
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,644
Thank you. For letting me know.

966
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,713
But what I wanted
to mention to you is...

967
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,016
You know, I'm not
so sure it's appropriate

968
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,185
for you to continue to rent
my basement apartment.

969
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,386
What?

970
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,288
Well, it just feels like
whoever's down there

971
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,256
should be from
outside the department.

972
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,742
You asking me to move out?

973
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:20,206
Well, take your
time. A week or two.

974
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,131
Looking for something?

975
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,723
Oh, no, just putting
back this suture kit.

976
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:31,489
I know you don't
keep the opened ones,

977
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,174
but, uh, the scissors haven't
been used, the forceps.

978
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,283
You know, seems such a
waste to throw them away.

979
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,097
Are you okay?

980
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,899
Oh, you mean after that trauma?

981
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:43,551
Yeah. I feel pretty lucky.

982
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,352
Good.

983
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,938
You know, Luka,

984
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:49,323
whatever Greene
and Weaver think...

985
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:50,796
You're a good doctor.

986
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,633
Thank you.

987
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,709
What was it you said?

988
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,478
"I'll be thinking
of you tonight"?

989
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,901
I guess I meant it.

990
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,815
Ha.

991
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,290
So how do you like
Jeeps? It's not a BMW.

992
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,371
Well, it's also not a cab.

993
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,773
I like Jeeps.

994
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:25,014
I was thinking maybe we'd
go get a drink or something.

995
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,051
I don't really want a... drink.

996
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:35,319
Oh, Dr. Weaver, can
I talk to you? Yeah.

997
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:37,388
I checked on the
anaphylactic shock in four,

998
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,289
and her respiratory
rate and pulse are down,

999
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:40,590
so I think she'll be fine.

1000
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:42,592
We're admitting the
hematuria up to Medicine,

1001
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:44,995
and we're ready to discharge
the contact dermatitis.

1002
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:46,130
Excellent.

1003
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:48,032
And I was just wondering
if I should be doing

1004
00:41:48,056 --> 00:41:49,866
any extra reading
or anything tonight?

1005
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,668
Oh. Lucy, I'm afraid
I'm not gonna be able

1006
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,803
to continue mentoring you.

1007
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:55,906
I've just been appointed
the new permanent chief

1008
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,508
of the Emergency Department.

1009
00:41:57,532 --> 00:41:59,743
But that's good, isn't it?

1010
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,180
Yes, but I'm afraid it
would seem like favoritism

1011
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:05,349
if I mentored one
student over another.

1012
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:06,750
You should talk to Dr. Greene.

1013
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,052
He might have some time.

1014
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:10,254
Dr. Weaver, Randi's
got a call for Dr. Greene.

1015
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,640
Well, take a message. He's left.

1016
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,041
I think you need
to take this one.

1017
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,542
It's his father.
He said that, uh,

1018
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,046
Dr. Greene's mother has died.

1019
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,455
Hello, this is Kerry
Weaver. Can I help you?

1020
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,797
So this what American males do

1021
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,821
to vent their anger
and frustration?

1022
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,436
I figured a Romano/Weaver

1023
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,820
double homicide was overkill.

1024
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,275
How'd you find me?

1025
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,633
I have my sources.

1026
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,314
I heard what you did in
the meeting with Anspaugh.

1027
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,972
What I did was
commit career suicide.

1028
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,188
Opened the door for
Kerry to become chief.

1029
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,090
Speaking your mind
in front of Romano

1030
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,591
took a lot of courage.

1031
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,526
For what it's worth,
I'm really proud of you.

1032
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,683
You did the right thing.

1033
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,820
Thank you.

1034
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,969
So, what is all this
"hitting the baseball" thing?

1035
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,193
Doesn't look that tough.

1036
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,939
Ha!

1037
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,096
It doesn't, huh?

1038
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,475
Well, you seem to be doing it.

1039
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,882
Wanna give it a try?

1040
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,997
Come on.

1041
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,420
Okay.

1042
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:31,973
All right. Like... Like this?

1043
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,726
Nice! Whoa!

1044
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:37,463
Is that one? Smack it.

1045
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:39,566
Ooh!

1046
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,703
Ooh. Whoops.

1047
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:46,416
I'm doing okay.

1048
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,773
You've got a good eye.

1049
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,504
<i>Keep your eyes on
the ball. Here it comes.</i>

1050
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,506
<i>Oh!</i>

1051
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,130
<i>Very good.</i>
