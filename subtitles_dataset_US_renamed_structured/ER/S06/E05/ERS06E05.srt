1
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:17,009
Move it or lose it! Whoa.

2
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,514
Sorry, boss, I, uh,
didn't realize it was you.

3
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:23,182
Malucci, as an ER resident,

4
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,884
you should know
enough to wear a helmet.

5
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,886
Don't worry, I got a
melon like a wrecking ball.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,088
Been hit three times,
nothing worse than road rash.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,290
Let me ask you something,
you always been at County?

8
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,092
Gosh. Going on 10 years.

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,962
Damn. Guys kill their entire
families don't get 10 years.

10
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:37,764
It's not a prison, Dave.

11
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,366
I don't know about that.
Dr. Weaver acts like a warden.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,901
Hey, what's with the leg?

13
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:43,670
She lay her Harley
down in traffic?

14
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,254
I don't know. I never asked.

15
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:47,774
So you wanna lift?

16
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,709
On your bike? Yeah, why not?

17
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:50,977
Never ride double before?

18
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,244
Not since I was 8 years old,

19
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:54,246
had a sissy bar
and a banana seat.

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,381
A what?

21
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:57,283
Forget it. Before your
time. Thanks anyway.

22
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,741
All right, suit yourself.
See you in the trenches.

23
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:03,912
Watch out!

24
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:05,825
You're such a good boy.

25
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,027
Jeanie.

26
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:09,150
Daddy's home.

27
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:12,495
There you go.

28
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,634
Hey. Hi.

29
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,268
Sorry I'm late. I got held up.

30
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:18,270
It's okay. No problem.

31
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:19,806
Better get going,
you'll be late.

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,907
How's my buddy?

33
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:23,309
Say goodbye to Mommy, Carlos.

34
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,878
"Bye, Mommy. Bye, baby.

35
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,779
Daddy and I are gonna
watch some ESPN."

36
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,432
Oh, hey, the med schedule is...

37
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,433
On the fridge.

38
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,834
Don't forget to wear gloves...

39
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,386
Jeanie, don't
worry. We'll be fine.

40
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,855
Okay. Love you.

41
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,242
Love you too. Have
a good day. Okay.

42
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,712
We don't have this department.
You have to go to the V.A.

43
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,180
No, no, no.

44
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,215
I've gotta get to work,

45
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,550
and I can't cross
the kids safely

46
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,019
if I can't hold up my sign.

47
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,921
Why can't you
hold it in that hand?

48
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,611
That's my whistle hand.

49
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,194
Here. Problem solved.

50
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,685
Randi, can you help
this gentleman, please?

51
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,802
You better not have parked
your bike in the lounge again.

52
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,204
It's not. There's a rack
in the ambulance bay.

53
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,705
I know. My bike's
not in the lounge.

54
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,243
Take Jesse Keenan, Curtain
1. Severe abdominal pain.

55
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,745
Hey, how you doing,
Jesse. I'm Dr. Dave.

56
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,153
I'm not feeling too well.
Well, what's the problem?

57
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:20,817
Oh, that's colorful.

58
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,319
All right.

59
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,387
Lucy, meet Jesse.
Not my patient.

60
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,488
Come on, he is now.

61
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,989
I gotta get my bike
out of the lounge

62
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,542
before Weaver shoots
me. Hey, isn't that your bike?

63
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,446
Hey!

64
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,415
Ooh, that's gonna leave a mark.

65
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,519
He is so cute. How's
Reggie like being a dad?

66
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,057
He's loving it. Who took
Mr. Opotoski's chart?

67
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,825
Every time I turn
around one of the nurses

68
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,193
is taking my chart.

69
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,594
You left this in
the suture room.

70
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,930
I wasn't in there.

71
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,566
- You're welcome.
- Dr. Lawrence.

72
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,234
Dr. Carter.

73
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,104
A grateful patient gave
me two Blackhawks tickets.

74
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,506
Right behind the penalty
box, you interested?

75
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,908
Trauma on ice. Who could say no?

76
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,210
What do we got here?

77
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,579
Guy slashed with a knife.

78
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,514
Looks pretty clean
and superficial.

79
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,783
Uh-huh. Check this
out. This is Dermabond.

80
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,069
Been using it since
January. It's pretty nifty stuff.

81
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,539
Like medical Super Glue.
Army had that in the '60s.

82
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,174
Come on. Yeah, really.

83
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:13,145
Took the FDA 30 years to
approve it for civilian use.

84
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,914
Probably better
update his tetanus.

85
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,583
Gabe, did you work up the
woman with the dog bite?

86
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,485
Is there a problem?
I can't read the chart.

87
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,986
It's illegible.

88
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,188
You're not supposed to
read a physician's writing.

89
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:24,924
Didn't I teach you
that in med school?

90
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:28,227
Ha! You were a
student? All right. Look.

91
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,195
Admit it. Hey, you
can't even read that.

92
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,365
That's for security purposes.

93
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,401
Why not put your
orders into the computer?

94
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,970
Because the computer
crashes. My notes don't.

95
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,473
I'll help with the computer.
Great idea, Carter.

96
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,141
Haven't you heard the saying:

97
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,943
"You can't teach an
old dog new tricks."

98
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,633
You're not old. Just stubborn.

99
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:50,917
Hi. Hello.

100
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:53,553
Elaine. John.

101
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,621
Dr. Gabe Lawrence,
this is Elaine Nichols.

102
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,723
Nice to meet you.

103
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,359
Have you got a minute,
John? Would you excuse us?

104
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,783
Yeah, certainly.

105
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,297
Hey, Dr. Lawrence. Dr. David.

106
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,566
It's just Dave. Listen.

107
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,334
You're an old friend
of Weaver's, right?

108
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,402
She ever tell you about her leg?

109
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,271
Not that I can recall, why?

110
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,661
Just curious.

111
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,978
Don't look at me. Ask
Carter. He lived with her.

112
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:21,147
Really? Mm-hm.

113
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,882
I'm doing everything
by the book.

114
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,051
I even gave up caffeine.

115
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,955
Are you getting plenty
of rest? I'm trying.

116
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,875
I'm really sorry about
the cafeteria thing,

117
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,994
but I got a new job at
the Big-T Pharmacy.

118
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:36,896
And I, um...

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,666
I gave them your name as
a reference, if that's okay.

120
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,823
Uh, sure.

121
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,256
I told them I've known
you for a couple of years.

122
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,963
Just in case they call.
But I doubt they will.

123
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,301
Something wrong with my eyes?

124
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,339
Are you taking any medications?

125
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,438
Just, um, prenatal vitamins.

126
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,462
Good.

127
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,430
Okay, I'll be back.

128
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,950
Why don't you take
a break? I'll cover.

129
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,653
Aw. Thanks.

130
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,854
Could you send this up to
the lab? UA and a tox screen?

131
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,638
Sure thing. Thank you.

132
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,727
Taking a breather?

133
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,061
My breathing's fine,

134
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,332
but my ankles are
about to explode.

135
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,100
I wonder if I could
wrap them in duct tape.

136
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,568
Don't think that's recommended.

137
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,538
Is this our MVA?

138
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,308
Yeah, Benjamin
Hearn, 16, with CF.

139
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,910
Auto versus pedestrian,
blunt trauma to the right side.

140
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,244
How you feeling, Ben?

141
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,479
Hurts to breathe.

142
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,063
Tachy at 130, BP's 110/72.

143
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:51,737
Did you take his temperature?

144
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,939
Okay. Call me if
you need me. Bye.

145
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,576
Okay, there's no
sign of a fracture.

146
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,065
Did his blood work come back?

147
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,247
Jeanie? Yeah?

148
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:03,382
Blood work? Oh.
No, it isn't back yet.

149
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,219
Is everything okay? You
seem a little distracted.

150
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:07,286
Yeah, I'm sorry.

151
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,355
Carlos was a bit
off this morning,

152
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,157
and Reggie's still getting
used to the dad routine.

153
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,627
Well, why don't you call and
make sure everything's okay?

154
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,395
I did. Everything's fine.

155
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,481
I just hate being away from him.

156
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,116
What do we got?

157
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,986
Rib fractures,
possible liver laceration.

158
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,855
When were you last
hospitalized for cystic fibrosis?

159
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,189
About a year ago. Ow!

160
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,275
Rebound and guarding,
right upper quadrant.

161
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:32,478
Let's get a CBC, type and cross
for four, chest, and a C-spine.

162
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:33,812
Okay, let's get ultrasound.

163
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:36,014
Carol, call up for an
O.R., tell 'em hold on.

164
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,151
And let's get Genetics down
here for a pre-op consult.

165
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,169
Oh!

166
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,904
Carol? Carol, you okay?

167
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,639
I think I'm having
a contraction.

168
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,841
Okay, why don't you step out.

169
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,276
No.

170
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,812
It's gone. I'm fine. Must
have been a Braxton Hicks.

171
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,747
Carol, go sit down. If
you have another one,

172
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,850
you're going on a monitor.

173
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,518
Soft, mild tenderness.

174
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,786
No rebound.

175
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,157
Let's get a tox
screen, CBC, Chem-7,

176
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,425
liver panel, and a lead test.

177
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,660
Coming right up.

178
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,331
So, Jesse, how much
paint did you eat?

179
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,934
I don't know. Like,
half a tube, maybe.

180
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,569
And do you do this very often?

181
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,371
Just this once.

182
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,373
I had a pretty bad day.

183
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,374
You depressed?

184
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,944
Creatively challenged.

185
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,047
So you're an artist? No.

186
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:28,173
Francis Bacon, William
Blake. Those guys were artists.

187
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:32,805
You know, I'm actually
feeling pretty good now...

188
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,406
I don't know. No.
You gotta stay.

189
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,675
We need to run some tests,

190
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:38,061
and I wanna check
the toxicity of the paint.

191
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,005
You must think I'm
pretty stupid, huh?

192
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,970
Eh. Creatively challenged.

193
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,853
Dr. Benton, Roger
Julian, Genetics.

194
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,153
This your CF patient?

195
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:50,456
Yeah, 16-year-old needs
a laparotomy for a liver lac.

196
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,625
I'd like you to sign off
on general anesthesia.

197
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,227
What are his room-air
sats? 97 percent.

198
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,296
How's his x-ray? No infiltrates.

199
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,331
Okay. Uh, give me five minutes.

200
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,166
Let's set up for
bedside spirometry.

201
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,168
His father's here.
I'll be right there.

202
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,832
Peter, you got this? Yeah, go.

203
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,009
Hey. Any more contractions? No.

204
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,512
Perhaps you should go home
and get off your feet for a while.

205
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:13,980
I'm fine, Mark.

206
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,949
As long as these guys stop
using my bladder for soccer.

207
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,051
Still, maybe you should
back off the big traumas.

208
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,620
You know? Slow
things down a little.

209
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,121
I don't need you
worrying about me.

210
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,990
Somebody's got
to worry about you.

211
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:25,079
I've gotta pee.

212
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,412
Ultrasound showed a
tear in Benjamin's liver.

213
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,913
Is he gonna be okay?

214
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,666
He has an excellent
chance of survival,

215
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,785
but he's gonna need
surgery to repair the damage.

216
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,519
Should we donate blood?

217
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,921
We have to operate immediately.

218
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,123
We'll use a cell saver to
give him back his own blood.

219
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,408
If he requires a transfusion,

220
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:45,227
I can assure you our blood
supply has been screened.

221
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,912
No, I don't want
Benjamin getting blood

222
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,447
from some stranger.

223
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:51,016
Okay. Chuny, would you type
and screen Mr. Hearn and his son?

224
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,285
They want to be designated
donors to Benjamin Hearn.

225
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,076
Sure. You wanna follow me?

226
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,925
I'm sorry I didn't
return your calls.

227
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:01,994
And I apologize
for standing you up.

228
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,229
It's okay.

229
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:09,690
I guess I just needed
time to sort things out.

230
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,444
And have you?

231
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,949
I think so.

232
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,333
You don't have to worry
about me anymore, John.

233
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,677
I'm... I'm gonna be okay.

234
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,959
And your follow-up?

235
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,743
I'm seeing a plastic
surgeon on Wednesday.

236
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,433
And after that, um...

237
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,182
I'm thinking about
going to Europe.

238
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,350
For how long?

239
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,934
I don't know. Couple months.

240
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:46,227
Just do a little soul searching.

241
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,981
So this is goodbye.

242
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,119
This is thank you.

243
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,822
For everything.

244
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,665
Will you give me a
call when you get back?

245
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,123
I'll send you a postcard.

246
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,195
Hey, Carter. Uh...

247
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,232
Is true you lived with
Weaver? In her basement.

248
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,667
She kept you in the basement?

249
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,270
She was my landlady. Okay. Sure.

250
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,441
So when your landlady
was collecting rent,

251
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,676
you must have
seen her leg, right?

252
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,210
Go away, Dave.

253
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,847
Come on... Hey, Lucy.
I'm not talking to you.

254
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,849
Why's everybody so
grumpy around here?

255
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,718
Unit contacting County
General, meet me on one-alpha.

256
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,589
<i>County from Rescue 43
at a multi-victim incident.</i>

257
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,690
<i>How many can you take?</i>

258
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,426
Two and eight. Two
major, eight minor.

259
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,746
Page Benton and Corday.
Let's prep Trauma 1 and 2.

260
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,914
Kidney failure, liver damage,

261
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:06,518
your red blood cells
could literally explode.

262
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,242
Okay, okay, you made your point.

263
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,724
I won't eat any more paint.

264
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:14,348
And what about the cocaine?

265
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,824
Your urine tested positive.

266
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,699
Okay, so on occasion I...

267
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,568
I have used some
mind-expanding chemicals

268
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:25,188
to facilitate my
creative process.

269
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,722
I'm not the first
artist to do so.

270
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,146
But you've been using
them the last few days.

271
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,245
I wanna put you
in a rehab program.

272
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,830
I appreciate your
concern, but I'm really cool.

273
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,566
I've been under a lot of
stress lately, my work sucks.

274
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,030
Maybe your work suffers
because you're using cocaine.

275
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,429
Jesse, you came here
for help, so let me help you.

276
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,978
Do they let you paint
in these programs?

277
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,846
I'm sure arrangements
could be made.

278
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,265
What do you think?

279
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:55,968
I don't know. I can't
promise anything.

280
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,853
I'll check it out though. Great.

281
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,722
Explosion in a
high-school science class.

282
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,023
I told them we could take
two major and eight minor.

283
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,859
Feeling generous, were you?

284
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,728
Victor Sutherland,
52-year-old teacher.

285
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,613
Altered LOC,
respiratory distress,

286
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:10,733
BP is 90/60, pulse,
120. What's he saying?

287
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,535
HAZMAT said it was chlorine gas.

288
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,787
It's okay, don't try to
speak. Lungs are wet.

289
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,322
Tube him. Any other criticals?

290
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:18,457
He's the worst.
Gabe, triage the others

291
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,361
and watch the
residents. No problem.

292
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,296
What is this? What
do we got here?

293
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,998
Ken Kranics, 17. Blunt
head trauma with LOC.

294
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,034
Tubed him for a
respiratory rate of four.

295
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,169
BP, 124/86. Pulse, 74.

296
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:31,387
Get a head CT,

297
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,755
call Neurosurgery. I'm on it.

298
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,306
Call me if you need
me. Need a hand?

299
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,147
No, there's more
on the way. Malucci?

300
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,962
What's going on?
Science room explosion.

301
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,014
There's a dozen more
coming in. This is Quinn.

302
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,582
Looks like partial
thickness burns

303
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:44,783
to the head, face and hands.

304
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,885
Nothing circumferential.
She's wheezy.

305
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,504
16-year-old Leanne Lawler,
penetrating abdominal injury.

306
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,273
Not sure how deep.
BP, 95/65. Pulse, 110.

307
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,908
We gave her a
liter in the field.

308
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,444
Pull this thing out of me.
We will. Hang in there.

309
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,678
Right over the spleen.

310
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,613
We need an ultrasound
before we go to O.R.

311
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,249
What's open? Trauma 1.

312
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,052
Looks like a Colles' fracture
with an overlying laceration.

313
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,686
That's a Grade 1 open fracture.

314
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,888
The bone punctured the skin.

315
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,856
Should I set up for
an open reduction?

316
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,359
Only if there's more than 20
degrees of dorsal angulation.

317
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,361
You want something for
the pain? No, I'm okay.

318
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,096
Gram of Ancef.

319
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,132
Stop it! You're not helping
any! You have to let me irrigate.

320
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,468
How we doing here? He's
already had 10 of morphine.

321
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,069
Glass injuries to
the eyes and face...

322
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,571
Dr. Lawrence?

323
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,374
Should I give this guy mannitol?
It's tricky. I see papilledema...

324
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,976
What do you mean? Slower.
My head trauma patient.

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,779
He hasn't blown a
pupil, but his GCS is nine

326
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,748
and disc margins are blurred.
Do you think he needs mannitol?

327
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,650
Has he blown a pupil? No, no.

328
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,686
They're 4 mm,
equal and reactive.

329
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,821
No, hold off. Wait
for the head CT.

330
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,023
What were you saying? Huh? What?

331
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,425
Thin cuts...? Yeah, yeah.

332
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,593
Thin cuts through the
orbits. Ophthal consult.

333
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,195
Titrate some Ativan.

334
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,831
I-I can't see anything.
You're in good hands, son.

335
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,054
In good hands.

336
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,787
Dr. Lawrence,
Janet Gunderson, 17,

337
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,255
chest hit the edge of a desk.

338
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,359
Complains of pleuritic
pain. Pulse, 100, BP, 132/74.

339
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,660
What's open?

340
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:04,463
Try Curtain 3. Chest
x-ray and an EKG.

341
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,566
Dr. Lawrence, we got a
finger amputation here.

342
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,801
Is the finger on ice?

343
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,803
He gave it to a friend,
who seems to have lost it.

344
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,371
All right, give him
a gram of Ancef,

345
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,107
an aspirin suppository and
call the reimplantation service.

346
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,692
Don't worry...
Something for pain?

347
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,527
Ten of lidocaine.
I'll do a wrist block.

348
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,030
Dr. Lawrence, we could use
you. What...? What patient?

349
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,132
The girl with the hand
burns and the facial burns.

350
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,733
Malucci's worried
about her lungs.

351
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,502
What are you putting on
me? It's just antibiotic ointment.

352
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,405
Did you call the burn team?
Yep, 8 percent body area.

353
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,357
Second degree
burns. Dr. Lawrence.

354
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:33,959
Vancomycin okay for my patient?

355
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,462
What patient? Hand injury.

356
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:39,230
The amputation?
No, the wrist kid.

357
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,600
You said Ancef, but
he's allergic to penicillin.

358
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:44,102
Fine. What room
is he in? Exam 4.

359
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,104
All right, all right, I'll
be there in a minute.

360
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,239
Should I give steroids?

361
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:51,109
Steroids? Yeah.
For the wheezing.

362
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,511
No, I wouldn't.

363
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,680
Why not?

364
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,883
It... It's not good. Just
don't do it. Trust me.

365
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,691
How you doing?

366
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,181
All I did was puke.

367
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:10,629
You weren't in the explosion?

368
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:13,520
No. Is that what happened?
Sounds pretty crazy out there.

369
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,290
Yeah.

370
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,355
Take slow deep breaths, okay?

371
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,948
Haleh, you got the drug
key? I need 10 of morphine.

372
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:43,664
Thanks.

373
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,394
Coming through! Coming through!

374
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,741
HAZMAT... MAN
2: Let's run the tests.

375
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,511
Dr. Lawrence, we
need you in here.

376
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm in. Bag him.

377
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:01,914
Kerry, what's up?

378
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,933
Ah, I could use an
extra pair of hands.

379
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,201
His lungs are full of fluid.

380
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,338
It's the pulmonary
edema from the chlorine.

381
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,106
Still hypotensive
after decompressing

382
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,908
a tension pneumo.

383
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,743
32 French right here.

384
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,045
Better check the belly.

385
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,230
10 blade. Let's get
ultrasound in here.

386
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:21,200
It's tied up in the other
room. I'll do a DPL.

387
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,567
Uh, Dr. Lawrence? Yeah.

388
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,904
My EKG. Um, my patient
may have a sternal fracture,

389
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,206
with the QRS voltage.

390
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,290
I'm afraid of tamponade.

391
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,358
So do a cardiac
echo. Okay, but...

392
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,663
Do it... Just do the damn echo.

393
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,949
What the hell is this?
Peritoneal lavage kit.

394
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,418
It's a percutaneous kit.

395
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,775
Use the Seldinger technique.

396
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,591
No, I want to do an open lavage.

397
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,226
No, it's a new kit.
They work well.

398
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,682
Where's the drug box?

399
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,931
Just get me a scalpel,

400
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:54,671
couple of towel clips, a
pair of rakes, and a... And a...

401
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,392
A cur...

402
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,689
- You know, a cur... What?
- A hemostat?

403
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,690
Hemostat? Yeah, yeah!

404
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,576
Come on! Hurry up.

405
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,777
Come on, come on.

406
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,030
It's fairly easy to use, Gabe.

407
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,249
You just spread the guide-wire

408
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:12,050
through the thin-wall
needle, and then...

409
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:13,419
These are unreliable!

410
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,688
Half the time you wind up
in the preperitoneal space.

411
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:18,262
I think if you tried...
I said no, damn it!

412
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:23,429
I always do an open
technique. It's the gold standard.

413
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:25,813
That's what I'm gonna
do. These are crap!

414
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,161
Dr. Lawrence. Yeah.

415
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,298
The finger amputation is
ready for his wrist block.

416
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,388
Right.

417
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,239
You seem to have everything
under control here, Kerry.

418
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,979
Another patient needs me.

419
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,572
I'm sorry, Kerry.

420
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:10,759
That was unprofessional
and totally uncalled-for.

421
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,211
Do you wanna talk about it?

422
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,579
There's nothing to talk about.

423
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:16,215
I... I screwed
up. I lost my cool.

424
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:20,319
It's been a while since I've
had multiple casualties like that.

425
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:23,272
If you were in trouble, you
should have asked for help.

426
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,807
You had your hands full.

427
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,242
I... No, I was... I was
overloaded, that's all.

428
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,062
It happens to the best of us.

429
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,622
You remember that time,
you were third year, I think.

430
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,621
A double-decker
tour bus hit a bridge

431
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,090
and sheared off the
top, you remember that?

432
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:44,693
That was an insane trauma.
That was a little hectic.

433
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:45,911
A little hectic?

434
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,947
There were three
gurneys in every space.

435
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,883
Everybody lost it.

436
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:52,389
But you kept your cool.

437
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,004
I don't know if I should
be telling you this...

438
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,584
What is it, Gabe?

439
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,767
There were times
when you drove me nuts.

440
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,854
You were like having
10 other students.

441
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,989
I swear to God, you...

442
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,597
You asked more questions than
I thought was humanly possible.

443
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,779
But it paid off. I'm
proud of you, Kerry.

444
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,583
Chief of Emergency Medicine.

445
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,785
You were great in there.

446
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,720
Damn, I was a good teacher.

447
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:31,423
You were and you still
are, according to Carter.

448
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,991
Yeah, well...

449
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:35,794
I think you're making a big
mistake with these lavage kits,

450
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,028
but I'll use 'em.

451
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,819
It's your ER now.

452
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,568
For the record, my
way may be older,

453
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:46,171
but it's still
faster and better.

454
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:47,394
Kind of like me.

455
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,320
Are you taking any
pain medication?

456
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,955
No. Why?

457
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,780
Your urine tested
positive for opiates.

458
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:10,329
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.

459
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,430
You're taking drugs,

460
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:13,248
which means your
baby is taking drugs.

461
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,806
What is it? Codeine?
Heroin? I'm not using drugs.

462
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,087
If you're sharing needles,

463
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,689
you're putting both
you and your baby

464
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,924
at risk for hepatitis,
HIV, endocarditis...

465
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,565
I'm not sharing needles.
But you are using.

466
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:33,652
Meg, I know you
care about your baby.

467
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:36,277
I do. I do care.

468
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,747
You don't want
to hurt it, do you?

469
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,277
No.

470
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,248
Then you have to
stop. I'm hardly using...

471
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,449
Just...

472
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,785
Just a little. Just
so I don't get sick.

473
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,708
You can't use at all.

474
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,958
Let me put you
into a detox program

475
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,262
and help you get clean.

476
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,403
Okay.

477
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:05,753
I'll see what I can do.

478
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,708
You're putting him
on a psych hold?

479
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,077
No, it's voluntary admission.
He's willing to come in.

480
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,541
I'll call down when
the bed's open. Thanks.

481
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,786
So did I pass the audition?

482
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,777
Yep. You should
go up within the hour.

483
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,708
They won't let me paint.

484
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:32,277
I'm sorry. It's okay.

485
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:33,581
They said I could sketch.

486
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:36,481
Thanks.

487
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,239
For helping me.
I really needed it.

488
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,091
Dr. Myers. Carol.

489
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,176
Hi.

490
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,743
I have, uh, an expectant mother

491
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,744
in need of a rehab bed.

492
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,979
Any way you could see her?

493
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,515
I just gave our last
spot to a guy in Exam 1.

494
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,983
She's pregnant.

495
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,652
I'm sorry. We only
have so many spots.

496
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,854
I can sign her up for an
outpatient program now.

497
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,190
Any chance to sign the guy
up for an outpatient program?

498
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,576
We're talking about the
welfare of an unborn child here.

499
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,778
Let's see what we
got. Where is she?

500
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,045
Thanks. In here.

501
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,133
Hey.

502
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,825
Hey, uh, how's it going?
Have you spoken to Ben yet?

503
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,840
No. Is he doing okay?

504
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,344
Uh, you know what?
Uh, let's talk in here.

505
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,518
Is something wrong with
Ben? No, no, he's gonna be fine.

506
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:33,187
It's just that when I
screened your blood, uh...

507
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:36,079
you tested, um... HIV positive.

508
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,383
You should have told me.

509
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,787
I didn't know for sure.

510
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:45,857
Until now.

511
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,741
Well, I-I... I'm sorry.

512
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,010
I figured this would
happen sooner or later.

513
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,445
You didn't practice safe sex?

514
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,280
Apparently not.

515
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,115
You know, I could
send you to a clinic.

516
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,684
You could start treatment.

517
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,419
The sooner the better.

518
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,220
You're not gonna tell
my parents, are you?

519
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,758
No, that's your
choice. But... Listen.

520
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,626
You know, family
support is very important

521
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,394
when you're dealing with HIV.

522
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:17,232
Support? Are you kidding?
My old man would disown me.

523
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,234
You know, I-I tried
telling him once.

524
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,319
I did the whole:

525
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,754
"I've got this
friend who's gay."

526
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:24,255
He freaked.

527
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,693
He said that if I ever
brought a fag to his house,

528
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,494
he'd kick my ass.

529
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:32,030
It would be easier
for your treatment

530
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,532
if your family knew the truth.

531
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,789
No.

532
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:39,203
No, forget it. I...

533
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,996
Every family has their
secrets anyway. Right?

534
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,697
Could you see a
possible CVA in Exam 2?

535
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,600
No, ask Carter. I gotta
finish these charts.

536
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,401
You took my spot. What?

537
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,069
My patient's detox spot.

538
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,038
Oh, Dr. Meyers said he
could be an outpatient.

539
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,373
After you convinced him.

540
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,842
Yeah, well, we needed the
spot for a pregnant woman.

541
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,344
If she doesn't get off heroin...

542
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,112
You can't do that.
You're a nurse, and I...

543
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:07,649
You're a what?
You're a med student!

544
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:11,119
I didn't know he was yours.
I'm sure he'll be admitted soon.

545
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,063
That's easy for you to
say. You got the bed.

546
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,894
Did you find Lawrence?

547
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,728
Yep. And?

548
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,830
And... what?

549
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,133
Practically had a meltdown
in the trauma room.

550
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,202
That's a little melodramatic,
don't you think?

551
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,338
I don't know. I,
uh... Come on, Mark.

552
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,173
Gabe is not the first
doctor to lose his temper

553
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,274
in the heat of the moment.

554
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,993
Over a lavage kit?
You know what?

555
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:38,663
He's been doing
this for 30 years.

556
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:41,233
He's set in his ways.
Doesn't like newer equipment.

557
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:42,867
I know you two are close.

558
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:44,369
What are you
trying to say, Mark?

559
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:48,407
He's acting a bit strange.
Not setting a good example.

560
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:50,141
Yeah, he's eccentric.

561
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,527
He's also one of the best
doctors I've ever worked with.

562
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,579
Don't get defensive. I'm not.

563
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,914
You don't like
that I hired Gabe.

564
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,204
But I did, so deal with it.

565
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,639
I repaired Ben's
liver. He's doing well.

566
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,140
Any complications?

567
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,877
He lost blood in the operation,
so we gave him a transfusion,

568
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,079
but, uh, I expect him
to make a full recovery.

569
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,947
You gave him our blood, right?

570
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,491
Well, just yours. I... I
couldn't use Aaron's.

571
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,622
Why not? Well, it
wasn't a good match.

572
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,591
Nurse said that we all
had the same blood type.

573
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,775
Yeah, yeah, I know,

574
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,177
but Aaron's blood
has different antigens

575
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:28,361
that could have caused
a transfusion reaction.

576
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:31,199
I'm sorry.

577
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,617
It's not your fault.

578
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:36,270
The important thing is
that Ben's gonna be all right.

579
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,374
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hm.

580
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,306
Thanks.

581
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,435
Thanks.

582
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,983
<i>Most of your friends were
brought in an hour ago.</i>

583
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,941
Where were you hiding?

584
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,858
I wasn't hiding.

585
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,059
I just didn't think
it was so bad.

586
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,929
How's my teacher,
Mr. Sutherland?

587
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,498
I haven't heard.

588
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,789
What kind of experiment
were you guys doing?

589
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,706
The wrong one.

590
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,068
What does that mean?

591
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:13,797
Nothing.

592
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:18,151
Do you know what
happened today, Howie?

593
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,919
If you have any information
about the explosion,

594
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,454
I think you should let me know.

595
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,911
It might help us
treat Mr. Sutherland.

596
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,544
Do you promise to
keep this between us?

597
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,536
Like, doctor/patient
confidentiality and all that?

598
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,851
All I can promise you

599
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:43,054
is that you're gonna feel a lot
better if you tell me the truth.

600
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,489
The right eye is
going to be fine,

601
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:47,792
but the glass sliced
through the left eyeball

602
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:49,583
and displaced the lens.

603
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:51,896
Well, uh...

604
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,731
How long before
they can fix that?

605
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,167
It'll be a difficult repair job.

606
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:58,231
Can I see? I... I
don't think that...

607
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,405
Jeez...

608
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,108
Dad? What...? What
is it? What's wrong?

609
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:05,376
Everything's okay, Nathan,

610
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,645
we just have to wait
for the specialist.

611
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:08,813
Is everything okay, Dad?

612
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,648
Mr. Perez, would
you come with me?

613
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:13,317
- Dad? Where's he going?
- He needs to sign some...

614
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:16,638
They can't fix that.
I'm not a specialist, sir.

615
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,590
The ophthalmologist...
His eye is gone.

616
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,124
He's gonna be blind.

617
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:23,011
We don't know that. His other...
He has an athletic scholarship.

618
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,680
I understand. He's
the first to go to college.

619
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,932
Mr. Perez... He worked hard.

620
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,017
Mr. Perez. Now
he's lost everything.

621
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,436
Please.

622
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,394
What's important right now is
that you're here for your son.

623
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,846
He needs you.

624
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,051
Okay?

625
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,010
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine,<i> mijo.</i>

626
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,234
Jeanie. Reggie's on
Line 1. Says it's urgent.

627
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,447
Thanks.

628
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,570
Reggie?

629
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,540
For how long?

630
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,455
Okay. Okay, I will. Bye.

631
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,057
Is everything
okay? Carlos is sick.

632
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,659
I think his pneumonia might be
coming back. I need to get home.

633
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,895
You do. Go on. Thanks.

634
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,031
Did they bring in a patient
named Howie McMurtry?

635
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,665
I don't know. Why?

636
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,001
Tell her.

637
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,153
Howie's the one that
caused the explosion.

638
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,657
The jocks talked
me into doing it.

639
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:28,626
I switched the chemicals.

640
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,664
It was only supposed to be
a small exothermic reaction.

641
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,333
A little smoke and a
few bubbles, that's all.

642
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,235
But Mr. Sutherland
changed the experiment,

643
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,938
and I didn't have a
chance to warn him.

644
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:44,676
This wasn't supposed to
happen. It was just a joke.

645
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,229
You little son of a bitch.

646
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,480
I'm sorry, sir?

647
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:49,948
My son is blind because of you.

648
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,516
It wasn't my idea, Mr. Perez.

649
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,201
Nathan and his
friends told me to do it.

650
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,185
You have to leave.

651
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,987
You're a liar! Hey. Hey.

652
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,356
Get out of the
way. Hey... Security!

653
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,140
It was an accident!

654
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,929
Hey! HOWIE: Stop it!

655
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,149
Get off of him! Get
off of him. Get away!

656
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,173
Get off of him!

657
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,171
You okay?

658
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:14,673
Yeah.

659
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:17,092
Sir. Sir!

660
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,461
He's not breathing.
We have to intubate?

661
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,430
No. Let's get him
to the bed. Okay?

662
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,631
Let's get him in here.

663
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,266
Go. All right.

664
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,885
Go, go, go, go, go!

665
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,652
Let's get him out.

666
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:30,055
All right, give me
an 8-0 ET tube.

667
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,357
I need suction.

668
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,109
Thanks for pulling
him off of me.

669
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,944
Just get the tube in, Carter.

670
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,529
Is he okay?

671
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:39,314
Let's get him on a pulse ox.

672
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,400
All right.

673
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,522
I'm in. Let's bag him.

674
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,158
No breath sounds.
He's not pinking up.

675
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,622
It was good intubation,
I saw the cords.

676
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,563
Aw, man, he's blowing
up like a balloon.

677
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,082
Subcutaneous emphysema.

678
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,050
You broke his larynx?

679
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,985
Let's prep his
neck, I'll do a crike.

680
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:03,237
No, uh, the injury could
be below the cricoid.

681
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,390
We're gonna have to trach him.

682
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:06,391
What about the tube?

683
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:07,842
Pull it out. It's useless.

684
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,744
Pulse ox is falling to 81.

685
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:10,934
Heart rate's down to 50.

686
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,481
Amp of atropine.

687
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,672
Carter, blow some
oxygen down there.

688
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,855
I'm not seeing his chest rise.

689
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,379
Pulse ox, 76.

690
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,360
Run of five.

691
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,761
I see it. Need a crash cart.

692
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,065
Okay.

693
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,057
I'm in. Bag him.

694
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,380
I'm getting breath sounds.

695
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,213
Pulse ox up to 85.

696
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,536
That was a nice save.

697
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,639
Yeah.

698
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,192
Good news, Quinn, I spoke
with the plastic surgeon,

699
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,317
and he said that your burns
shouldn't leave much scarring.

700
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,301
Right. Well, um...
I'll check on you later.

701
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,692
If you need anything,
just hit the buzzer.

702
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,444
I'm gonna have scars?

703
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,962
The new skin may have
irregular pigmentation.

704
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,997
But it's only temporary.

705
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,021
How temporary?

706
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,023
Six months to a year.

707
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,305
The plastic surgeon
will give you the details.

708
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:29,796
I might look like
this for a year?

709
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,227
No, no.

710
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:36,097
Um, it will take up to
a year for you to heal,

711
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,534
but you... You may, in
fact, heal much faster.

712
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,618
Okay?

713
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,142
How much faster?

714
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:45,623
I don't know.

715
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,815
It will get a little
bit better each day.

716
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,881
You know...

717
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,216
You were lucky, Quinn. It
could have been much worse.

718
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,218
You think this is lucky?

719
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,226
I look like a hideous freak.

720
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,741
No. No. You... No.

721
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:06,010
You look like, um...

722
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:08,179
Like a girl who was
fortunate enough

723
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,469
to survive a dangerous accident.

724
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:16,125
I'd rather be dead
than look like this.

725
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,953
You okay?

726
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,821
Peachy.

727
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,590
You were trying to
protect the patient.

728
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,191
You did the right thing.

729
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,994
Something tells me Mr. Perez
is gonna feel differently.

730
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,261
I was a witness.

731
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,566
Mark. We need to talk.

732
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,697
Howie, you all right?

733
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,345
Yeah.

734
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,530
How's Mr. Perez?

735
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,865
He's gonna be okay.

736
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:03,222
But not Mr. Sutherland, huh?

737
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,209
I don't know.

738
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:11,004
A lot of kids thought
he was a geek.

739
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:14,879
Sometimes he'd mess
up the experiments,

740
00:34:14,903 --> 00:34:18,182
but I think he
did it on purpose,

741
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,766
just to make class
a little more fun.

742
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,243
He was a really good teacher.

743
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,311
There's still a chance
he might recover, right?

744
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,815
Like, a long shot or something?

745
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,504
Like, one in a million?

746
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,910
Yeah.

747
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,981
I told him.

748
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,218
I told my father I
was HIV positive.

749
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,467
Good for you.

750
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,257
He kicked me out.

751
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,105
Well, you know,
he might just need

752
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,373
a little time to deal with it.

753
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,845
He no longer
considers me his son.

754
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,202
Mm.

755
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,286
I'm sorry.

756
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,087
At least he knows the truth now.

757
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,558
Screw him if he can't handle it.

758
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,859
And it might be a few days

759
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,762
before I can get you
into the detox program.

760
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,063
Should have called ahead.

761
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,932
I'm sorry. But in the
meantime, I can get you

762
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,199
into an outpatient program.

763
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,868
Don't sweat it.
Jesse, you need help.

764
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,303
I need a real job.

765
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,673
I watched you here
today, running around.

766
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:34,742
You, the doctors,
the cops, paramedics.

767
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,544
Everybody's doing
something important,

768
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,979
helping people, saving lives.

769
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,847
And I'm in here for
eating paint. Pathetic.

770
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,616
Why don't I get someone
for you to talk to?

771
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,917
I don't need a shrink to tell me

772
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,986
I need to get my act together.

773
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,721
I'll see you around, Lucy.

774
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,823
Hey, could you, uh, speak
with one of my patients?

775
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,925
No, go away, Dave. I don't
want any more patients.

776
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,326
Why not? By the looks of things,

777
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,695
you fixed that last guy up good.

778
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,896
Yeah, real good.

779
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,864
But this one's
different, all right?

780
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,901
I got a teenage girl who
burned her face in the explosion.

781
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,236
She's really depressed,

782
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,271
and nothing I say seems
to be the right thing.

783
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,190
Really?

784
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:07,558
About the hockey game tonight,

785
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,126
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cancel.

786
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,527
But you go, you go without me.

787
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:12,596
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah. Everything...

788
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,765
Ah, just something came up.

789
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:15,833
So I can see.

790
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,268
What?

791
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:21,638
Well, mood swings, haggard brow.

792
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:22,840
Inability to concentrate.

793
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:25,344
Classic signs of woman problems.

794
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,311
Is it that obvious?

795
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,780
Only if you've been married
as many times as I have.

796
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,481
Plus, I met her today, remember?

797
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:33,584
I never forget a pretty face.

798
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,552
You got any professional advice?

799
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:36,620
What? From me?

800
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,489
I can diagnose a
million diseases,

801
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,792
but I still can't
figure out women.

802
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:43,861
I guess that's what
makes them so irresistible.

803
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,362
Yeah.

804
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:46,864
But I do know...

805
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:49,967
life's too short to... To...
You know, to waste on regret.

806
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:51,902
Hm.

807
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,604
I'll see you tomorrow.

808
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,305
Dr. Lawrence. Yeah.

809
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:56,707
I've got your ankle films.

810
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,777
Has anyone seen Meg Corwin,
the pregnant woman in Curtain 3?

811
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,778
No, sorry.

812
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,446
I think she left.

813
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,350
She was supposed to go to detox.

814
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,550
How's he doing?

815
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:07,818
Oh, chest is clear.

816
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:09,620
Satting at 98 on two liters.

817
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,222
I'd, uh... I'd give him
albuterol treatment Q4.

818
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:13,691
And, uh, I'll stop by tomorrow.

819
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,493
Thanks.

820
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:17,595
Hey, Dr. Julian, I
wanted to ask you

821
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:19,129
a question about DNA testing.

822
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,464
What about it?

823
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,566
Sometimes pregnant
teenagers, single mothers,

824
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,568
they have questions
about paternity testing.

825
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:26,136
I was wondering
if there's anything

826
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,305
that we could, you
know, use down in the ER.

827
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,408
Yeah, we've, uh... We
got a test kit you can use.

828
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:32,042
Just, um, call my office,

829
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,844
they'll give you the
name of the supplier.

830
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,234
Okay, great. Thanks.

831
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:40,601
He said my skin
would be discolored.

832
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,705
The new skin will be
sensitive to UV rays.

833
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:46,010
So you have to be very
diligent about using sunscreen.

834
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,910
So much for my tan next summer.

835
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,745
Ah, your skin will
be healthier for it.

836
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,496
And you'll look younger.

837
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,765
There will come a day, Quinn,

838
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:54,766
when younger is better.

839
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,790
Trust me.

840
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,886
What about my hair?

841
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,973
It'll be thinner, maybe
a little patchier at first.

842
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:03,140
But it'll grow back.

843
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:04,475
How long does that take?

844
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,477
Does your hair grow fast?

845
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,811
No. Heh.

846
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:10,714
Well, then, uh, you might
have to wear a wig for a while.

847
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:11,849
A wig?

848
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,617
You could try being a blond.

849
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:15,286
It's true what
they say about us.

850
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,122
But just be patient, okay?

851
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,357
And if you have any questions,

852
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,194
call me or Dr. Dave. Okay?

853
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,498
Thank you.

854
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:32,870
Wow, you're good.

855
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:33,871
Thanks.

856
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,039
No, I mean really good.

857
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,273
You're welcome, Dave.

858
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:37,808
Dr. Malucci.

859
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:38,809
Chief.

860
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:41,078
Heard you, uh,
wanted to see me. No.

861
00:38:41,102 --> 00:38:44,303
No? Hm, I heard you had
a question about my leg.

862
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,818
Me? Uh, no. Not... Not me.

863
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:49,920
I mean, I... I had a...

864
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:51,588
A patient with a bad ankle.

865
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:54,892
But someone must have
misunderstood what I was asking.

866
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,661
Oh. I see.

867
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:59,764
Well, you know, if you
do ever wanna know,

868
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:02,133
you should just ask.

869
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:03,467
No problem.

870
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,936
Yeah, but it's really none
of my business, right?

871
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,494
No. No, it's not.

872
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,061
Well, well, well, if it isn't

873
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,397
the lean, Greene,
fighting machine.

874
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,598
It was an accident, Robert.

875
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,600
Supposed to treat
accidents, not cause them.

876
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,468
It was self-defense.
Oh, he attacked you?

877
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,703
No, he attacked Carter.

878
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,772
But Carter didn't
crush the guy's throat.

879
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,340
Okay, what do you want from me?

880
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,542
A formal apology to
Mr. Perez and his family

881
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,844
would be a good place to start.

882
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,378
Fine. Something else?

883
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,915
Well, hey, hey. Look, I
didn't bring this on, Markie.

884
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,783
I'm gonna do as much
damage control as I can,

885
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:36,951
but I can't make promises.

886
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,719
This guy's family's
gonna be coming at us

887
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:39,954
with both barrels blazing.

888
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,889
They're gonna look
for a sacrificial lamb,

889
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:45,215
and I have to tell you, you
are looking pretty woolly.

890
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:49,831
ER. Hey, Jeanie. How's Carlos?

891
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:50,832
Good.

892
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:54,702
No, no, Kerry left
already. Mark?

893
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,060
Yeah. He's right here, honey.

894
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,676
Hi, Jeanie, it's Mark.

895
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,944
Sorry that I had to rush
out in the middle of my shift.

896
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,148
Yeah, he's better, he
was just a little wheezy.

897
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,850
Would you tell Kerry that I
might be a little late tomorrow?

898
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,351
Thanks, Mark.

899
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,043
Okay. Gotta go. Bye.

900
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,490
Hey, you.

901
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,225
Hey, big boy.

902
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,161
Hey, big boy. Oh!

903
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:23,798
How's my favorite
little man? Hm?

904
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:26,055
How's my favorite little man?

905
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:29,587
John. Hi.

906
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:31,510
What are you doing here?

907
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,246
Can I come in?

908
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,060
If you want me to
leave, just say so.

909
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:09,716
I don't want your sympathy.

910
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
I know.

911
00:41:58,466 --> 00:41:59,460
Gabe?

912
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,484
Hey, Kerry.

913
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,620
Everything all right?

914
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,852
I think somebody stole my car.

915
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:09,141
What?

916
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:11,605
I never leave it unlocked.

917
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,207
I thought maybe
I did. I don't know.

918
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,109
I left the house in such
a hurry this morning.

919
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,144
And are you sure
you're on this level?

920
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,479
What?

921
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,031
Did you park on this level?

922
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,632
Oh, yeah, yeah, I...

923
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:23,350
Every day I park on four so...

924
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,486
You know, so I wanted
to fight for a space.

925
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,909
This is three.

926
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,950
What an idiot.

927
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:37,402
You know, after a while
they all look the same.

928
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:41,506
I swear, I... I'd forget my
head if it wasn't attached.

929
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,339
Do you want me
to help you find it?

930
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,758
No, no, no, no, no. Thanks.

931
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:49,159
Please. I'll see you tomorrow.

932
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:50,827
Okay, good night, Gabe.

933
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:51,984
Yeah, good night.
