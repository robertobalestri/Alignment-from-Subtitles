What happened? Did
you have a bad dream?

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,724
Huh?

23
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,668
Oh, man, Tess.
You're killing me.

24
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,996
Abby?

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,631
Abby.

26
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,999
Yeah?

27
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,101
Paramedics are bringing
in a 22-year-old woman,

28
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,903
pelvic pain.

29
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,170
Okay.

30
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,338
You getting up?

31
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,140
Yep.

32
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,565
You want me to wake Malucci?

33
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:19,299
Nope. I'm up.

34
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:20,455
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,069
How long was I out?

36
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,904
About 20 minutes.

37
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:27,340
Oh, well, that must be
why I feel so refreshed.

38
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,946
So is this some
med-student hazing thing

39
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,581
or do you guys just hate me?

40
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:38,151
You're younger than us, prettier
than us, and skinnier than us.

41
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,419
We hate you.

42
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,523
Thanks for the candor.

43
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:45,080
Anytime.

44
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,562
Cold out here. I should
have brought my jacket.

45
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,163
So go back in.

46
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,921
We don't need you to
help us push in a gurney.

47
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,436
You know,

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,805
I never actually thought
I'd even get into med school.

49
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,674
I was just looking for a change.

50
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:04,199
You really wanna stop talking
before one of us hits you.

51
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,647
Do I tell you that enough?

52
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,569
I love you.

53
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,491
Hey.

54
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,092
Hey.

55
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:01,794
I didn't know you
played basketball.

56
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,463
I don't, heh.

57
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:04,964
Hello, Tess.

58
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,799
Did you let your mommy
sleep for a change?

59
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,056
No, she did not.

60
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,573
Did I make you angry?

61
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:15,875
The flowers on your birthday?

62
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,711
No. They were beautiful.

63
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,415
They weren't animal
crackers, huh?

64
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,172
You heard about that, huh?

65
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,755
Are you still in love with him?

66
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,523
I don't know. You know,

67
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,626
I think I'm still too angry
with him to think straight.

68
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,960
I would think so.

69
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,217
Why?

70
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,064
No, it wasn't like that.

71
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,768
Doug didn't know I was
pregnant when he left.

72
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,553
He didn't come back
when he found out.

73
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,956
Well, it wasn't all Doug.
I could've gone with him.

74
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,091
He asked me to.

75
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,481
Why didn't you?

76
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,500
Pride.

77
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,682
I wanted him to
stay here for me.

78
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:59,436
I thought I should be at
least that important to him.

79
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,292
I still love my wife.

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,630
But it's time to
get on with my life.

81
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:11,748
Hey, let's help your
mommy get inside, huh?

82
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,417
Oh, yeah, here we go.

83
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,551
Like a cowboy.

84
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,855
♪ Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh ♪

85
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,712
Slide your bottom
down a little bit.

86
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,547
God, I hate these.

87
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:30,149
How many sexual partners
have you had in the past year?

88
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,217
One.

89
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:33,085
Do you use condoms?

90
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:34,854
Most of the time.

91
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,188
Do you think I'm pregnant?

92
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:38,772
No. The urine test
came back negative.

93
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,328
Wow, that didn't hurt at all.

94
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,530
Warm water. I know a few tricks.

95
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,466
I thought you guys
kept these in the freezer.

96
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,735
I gotta remember to
tell my gynecologist.

97
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,736
Cultures?

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,037
GC and chlamydia?

99
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:54,206
You think I might
have chlamydia?

100
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,943
We check everybody for
sexually transmitted diseases.

101
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,111
There's a purulent
discharge around the cervix.

102
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:01,331
I've been with my
boyfriend for over a year.

103
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,998
If he gave me
syphilis or something,

104
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,167
I'm gonna kill him.

105
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,335
We haven't made a diagnosis yet.

106
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,759
Okay, speculum's coming out.

107
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,926
I'm gonna move your
cervix. Tell me if this hurts.

108
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,380
Sorry. There's no
other way to do that.

109
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,644
I'll try to be gentle when
I examine your ovaries.

110
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,204
Okay, you can
put your legs down.

111
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,524
Everything seems
fine. It's probably PID.

112
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,791
PID?

113
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,493
Pelvic inflammatory disease.

114
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,695
We'll give you a shot
of antibiotics, some pills

115
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,697
and I'll throw in something
for the pain, okay?

116
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,749
You can go ahead
and get dressed.

117
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:40,319
Two-fifty of ceftriaxone
IM, a gram of Zithromax PO,

118
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,555
and 550 of Anaprox. Hang
on to her for 30 minutes.

119
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,657
Make sure she doesn't
have an allergic reaction.

120
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,259
You want me to get
Malucci to sign off?

121
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:48,361
I've seen more of these
than he has. Let him sleep.

122
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,395
I could find Weaver.

123
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:50,429
I wouldn't go there.

124
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:51,631
Her second double this week.

125
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,198
Been here since
yesterday morning.

126
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,168
Weaver's upstairs.
They had a code in CCU.

127
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,703
I heard Mark's
coming back today.

128
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,872
Thank God. If Weaver
gets any nastier,

129
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,558
I'm gonna have to
call Animal Control.

130
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,276
Amira.

131
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,477
Amira!

132
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:05,578
Frank.

133
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:06,745
Where's Amira?

134
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,014
Got off at 7.

135
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:09,082
Who are you?

136
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,749
Frank. Personnel sent me down.

137
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,285
Do you have any
experience, Frank?

138
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,120
Twenty-six years
as a Chicago cop.

139
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,455
In medicine?

140
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,256
Had my knee replaced
about six months ago.

141
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,425
What the hell are all those
people doing out there?

142
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,860
Sick, I guess.

143
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:23,662
Oh, thank you for that astute
and penetrating observation.

144
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,331
Why aren't they
being seen by doctors?

145
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:26,899
I don't know, I just got here.

146
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,718
No docs. Abby's down in Sutures.

147
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,919
Dr. Malucci's here.

148
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,521
I think he's asleep in Exam 1.

149
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,505
What about Kovac?

150
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:33,590
Foreign guy? Yes.

151
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,091
He and some nurse
came in together,

152
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,893
they took her babies
upstairs to daycare.

153
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,360
Dr. Chen? Dr. Carter?

154
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,930
Some people came in when I
did, I think they're in the lounge.

155
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,832
Okay, it's five after 7.
Is there some kind of

156
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,434
natural disaster that I'm
unaware of? An earthquake?

157
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,071
Or half of Chicago's
swallowed up by a giant seagull?

158
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,106
Could you stop yelling
at me? I was here on time.

159
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,208
Oh, Mark Greene called,
said he'd be in before 10.

160
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,676
Had to go by the mortuary.

161
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,479
Okay, hey, Lydia, do you still
have that rape whistle thing?

162
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,848
Get on the phone to everybody
who's supposed to be here,

163
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,050
and scream on their
machines that they're late,

164
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,920
and if they answer,
tell them they're fired.

165
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,121
Rise and shine!

166
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,923
Patients are waiting!

167
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,192
Dr. Malucci, if I don't see
you standing over a sick patient

168
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,678
looking compassionate and
engaged in the next 30 seconds,

169
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,229
you're gonna spend the next week

170
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,132
doing disimpactions
and yeast infections!

171
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,500
I'm up, chief. I'm up. I'm good.

172
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,068
I get called upstairs
for 20 minutes

173
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,603
and this whole
place goes to hell.

174
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,737
They're in the lounge?

175
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,761
Uh-huh.

176
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,451
She uses a whistle?

177
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:33,966
You okay, John?

178
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,267
Yeah. I'm fine.

179
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,769
You look terrible.

180
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:37,793
Thank you.

181
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,164
Dr. Carter, what
time do you have?

182
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,995
Five minutes after 7.

183
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,363
So why are you
two in the lounge?

184
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,131
The 7:00 shift starts at 7:00.

185
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,534
That means you're here in
time to be seeing patients at 7.

186
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,552
Is that clear?

187
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:53,686
Move it!

188
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,672
County's not paying
you to drink coffee.

189
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,475
Ooh, somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the coffin.

190
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,811
Today oughta be a lot of fun.

191
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,813
Chen, weak and dizzy in Exam 2.

192
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,115
And abdominal pain in Curtain 1.

193
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,917
Malucci, bleeding
hemorrhoids in Exam 8.

194
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,118
Oh, come on, chief.

195
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,287
Hemorrhoids in 8 and a
boil that needs lancing in 5.

196
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,588
Terrific.

197
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,057
I hope that tone of voice was
one of unbridled enthusiasm?

198
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,292
I can't wait.

199
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,361
Okay, and keep an eye
on your med student please,

200
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,296
for a change. Wh...?
Where is Abby?

201
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,864
PID down in Sutures.

202
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,966
You're supervising,
Malucci? Uh, yeah.

203
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,336
Carter, take the
pyelo lady in Curtain 3.

204
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,670
Kovac, rule out MI

205
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,939
or a nail through the
hand still waiting in tears?

206
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,140
Both.

207
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,042
EMS is bringing in a
terminal cancer patient

208
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,043
five minutes out.

209
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,211
Okay, that'll be us, Carol.

210
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,446
Let's get cracking people,

211
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,448
there's plenty more
where those came from.

212
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,848
Butt boil and hemorrhoids,

213
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,617
this is what I went
to medical school for.

214
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,653
Could've been worse. There's
an explosive diarrhea up there.

215
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,355
You okay, hoss? You
don't look so good.

216
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,657
So everybody keeps telling me.

217
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,526
I'm having trouble sleeping.

218
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,861
Well, try reading the<i>
Annals</i> at bedtime. That...

219
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,763
That usually puts me right out.

220
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,066
Hey, you want me to
dip a urine on our pyelo?

221
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,101
Yeah. Yeah, in
fact I'll be right in.

222
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,936
I just gotta use the bathroom.

223
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,371
You on all night?

224
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,873
I was supposed to be off today,
but I, uh, swapped with Cleo.

225
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,275
She's taking my Saturday night.

226
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,577
I got tickets for Rage Against
the Machine, my friend.

227
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,645
Right in the pit, baby.

228
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,879
Hey, lucky you.

229
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,614
I think Weaver's
got it in for me.

230
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,051
I don't know what I ever did
to Festus to get her so pissed.

231
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,452
Maybe it was calling her Festus.

232
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,796
Well, never to her face.

233
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:39,742
How's it going?

234
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:40,965
All right.

235
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,228
<i>I couldn't wake her up.</i>

236
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,997
<i>BP is 85/60. Tachy at 122.</i>

237
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,250
Mr. O'Brien says she hadn't
eaten in a couple of days.

238
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,251
Any fluids?

239
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,519
Little ginger ale.

240
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,987
She was operated on for a
bowel obstruction last month.

241
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,942
They said the tumor spread
to her liver and diaphragm.

242
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,277
She could be encephalopathic
from liver failure.

243
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,712
What does that mean?

244
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,114
Your wife's liver isn't
removing toxins from her blood.

245
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,451
That might explain
why she isn't waking up.

246
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,719
Okay, here we go. Gently now.

247
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,155
And one, two, three.

248
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,091
Carol, get a CBC, lytes,
liver panel and a PT.

249
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,761
Her resps are down to eight.

250
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,329
Mr. O'Brien,

251
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,197
your wife's breathing
is very slow.

252
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,800
We may have to decide
whether or not to intubate.

253
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:38,967
Oh, God.

254
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,753
Does she have a
do-notresuscitate order?

255
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:42,988
Yes. She doesn't
want any machines.

256
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,924
Is there any way
you can help her?

257
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,358
We'll give her some IV fluids

258
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:48,778
and see if that makes her
more comfortable, all right?

259
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,230
Carol, could you show
Mr. O'Brien and his family

260
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:52,548
to where they can wait please?

261
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,734
Sure. Let's go see
if we can find you

262
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:56,903
some crayons and some
coloring books, okay?

263
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:58,526
Bye-bye, Mommy.

264
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:03,659
Come on, sweetheart.

265
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,128
I brought her things.

266
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,414
That's my job when
we go to the hospital.

267
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:11,222
She likes to have
her things with her.

268
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,786
Okay.

269
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,339
There isn't anywhere to put
them in here, so do you think

270
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,663
you could hold on to
them for a little longer?

271
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,667
All right, sweetheart.
All right. Come on.

272
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,824
So Mrs...?

273
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,493
Wyatt. Wyatt.

274
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,396
How long have you been
experiencing the burning?

275
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,564
Couple of days.

276
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,566
It usually clears up
with cranberry juice.

277
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,567
Any fever?

278
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,868
101.4.

279
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,304
Open your mouth for
me, would you please?

280
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,889
Weaver sent you a
present: a wheezer.

281
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,931
Would you excuse me?

282
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,748
A history of asthma?

283
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,983
Since I was a kid.

284
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,885
Get him into bed. Give
him five of albuterol.

285
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:03,919
Be right back.

286
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,221
Could you sit up for me, please?

287
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,089
I want you to tell me
if this hurts you at all.

288
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,590
Oh! Oh! Yeah.

289
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,559
Looks like you've
got pyelonephritis.

290
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,561
Is that serious?

291
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,728
You're gonna be fine.

292
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,630
Frank said you had two
patients, need a hand?

293
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:15,831
No, no. I got this.

294
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,200
Have you ever been on steroids?

295
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,269
Last year. For a few weeks.

296
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,104
Give him 60 of prednisone.

297
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,174
Set him up for continuous
nebs after this one.

298
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,275
When was your last period?

299
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,410
About a month ago.

300
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,212
You sure? I'm just
waiting on labs.

301
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,952
I got 'em. Thanks anyway though.

302
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:33,416
Any allergies?

303
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,468
I get hives from sulfa.

304
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,336
Can you tell me what
inhalers you're using?

305
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,721
Ventolin and Vanceril.

306
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,323
Any chance you're pregnant?

307
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,758
No, definitely not.

308
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,250
You believe this
guy? Not you, you

309
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,717
I got scared when I couldn't
wake her up. Called 911.

310
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,219
You did the right thing
calling the paramedics.

311
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,721
She's dehydrated.

312
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:58,757
I tried to get her to drink
more, but sh-sh-she's so weak,

313
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:01,993
she can't swallow. She
can hardly hold a straw.

314
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,250
Labs are back.

315
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,254
Her liver isn't making
clotting factors.

316
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,922
What does that mean?

317
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,112
It's a sign of
severe liver failure.

318
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,812
Is there anything you can do?

319
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,313
No, not really. We...

320
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,705
We can only make
her comfortable now.

321
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,524
So this is it?

322
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,911
I think probably so.

323
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,802
Oh, boy.

324
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,401
W-where are my girls?

325
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,142
Oh, one of the nurses is
taking care of them in the lounge.

326
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,679
Do everything you can.

327
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,869
I-I-I don't want her
to suffer. Please.

328
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,522
'Course not.

329
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,204
Come back if you get a fever
or experience any vomiting.

330
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,472
And if you wanna wait a minute,

331
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,574
I can get you a list of
clinics that treat STDs.

332
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,576
Can I wait outside?
I'm dying for a cigarette.

333
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,680
Sure, but you are going
to quit really soon, right?

334
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,036
Absolutely.

335
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,884
Hey.

336
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,385
22-year-old with PID.

337
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,988
Gave her 250 of ceftriaxone,
a gram of Zithromax.

338
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,156
Need you to sign the chart.

339
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,058
Benton on? Kovac
has a hot belly.

340
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,859
No, Benton traded
with Corday again,

341
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,761
and Cleo just
happens to be off too.

342
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,697
Shocking. Mm-hm.

343
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:31,667
This date is wrong. Today's
the 11th, not the 10th.

344
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,435
No, I thought
tomorrow was the 11th.

345
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,338
Today's the 11th, all day.

346
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,605
Oh.

347
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,574
I was expecting today
to be a really awful day,

348
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,075
but it seems to be
turning out okay.

349
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,877
Venus out of alignment
with the ninth moon

350
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,045
of Jupiter or something?

351
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,630
No, nothing like that.

352
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,365
Ah, Jupiter only
has eight moons.

353
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,600
You want me to name those?

354
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,218
Who is this guy?

355
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,986
Ah, Frank. He's temping.

356
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,388
Eh, let's see. Ah, inner moons:

357
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,308
Metis, Adrastea,
Amalthea and Thebe.

358
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,777
Thank you. I believe you.

359
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,378
Your hemorrhoid
guy's complaining.

360
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,013
Says the suppository
isn't helping.

361
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:04,817
Outer moons: Io, Europa,
Ganymede and Callisto.

362
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:07,069
What's he going on about? Moons.

363
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,671
Saturn has 18 confirmed moons.

364
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,838
Do you want me to name those?

365
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,990
No.

366
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:12,992
Abby, your PID girl
collapsed in the bay.

367
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,444
What happened?

368
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,913
She's breathing, but I
can barely feel her pulse.

369
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,815
She needs a couple
of large-bore IVs,

370
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,182
two liters of saline, wide open.

371
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,552
Kathy. Kathy, wake up.

372
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,686
Maybe it's an ectopic?

373
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,987
No, the ICON was negative.

374
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,973
BP is 70 palp. Who's her doctor?

375
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,541
Malucci. I'll get him.

376
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,109
Mix up dopamine,
get an ultrasound.

377
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,862
Let's get her on the gurney.

378
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,482
One, two, three.

379
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:38,416
Pressure's 85 after two liters.

380
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,818
Up the dopamine to 12 mics.

381
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:41,793
HemoCue's 14.1.

382
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,691
Right adnexa's normal.

383
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:49,361
Left side.

384
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,997
There's a mass and
free fluid. Damn it.

385
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,749
What is it?
Tubo-ovarian abscess.

386
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,451
When they rupture
they get septic.

387
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,752
Want me to page GYN?

388
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,838
Uh, no. Dial 7614,
give me the phone.

389
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,706
Temp's 102. It's the infection.

390
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,525
Got 'em.

391
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,261
Hey, who's this?
Paula, it's Abby Lockhart.

392
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,995
I need to redline
a ruptured TOA.

393
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,181
Set up the O.R. and page
the chief resident, thanks.

394
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:10,949
What the hell is going on?

395
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,685
My patient had a
syncopal episode.

396
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:13,719
Dropped her pressure.

397
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:14,720
What patient?

398
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:15,938
Abby, what patient?

399
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,640
The PID I just
had you discharge.

400
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,309
Pressure's up to 100.
Good, let's move her.

401
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,061
Maybe it's a
hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.

402
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:24,852
No, crit's fine, mass is
loculated. She spiked a fever.

403
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,485
You picked up a
loculated mass? Yeah.

404
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,787
No kiddin'. I wouldn't know
one if it bit me on the ass.

405
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,925
♪ Da, da-da, da-da, da-da ♪

406
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,984
♪ Da-da, da-da-da Da, da-da ♪

407
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,366
You haven't gotten
your antibiotics yet.

408
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,990
I don't think so.

409
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,637
Sorry, I've been busy.

410
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,672
I wrote the order
45 minutes ago.

411
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,741
Yeah, you also wrote
for continuous albuterol

412
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,842
and steroids for this guy.

413
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,910
When can you do it?

414
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,144
When I'm finished.

415
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,202
Forget it. I'm gonna get
your antibiotics myself.

416
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,535
Hey, when did you get back?

417
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,238
Uh, 20 minutes
ago. Still holding.

418
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:09,341
Mark, I'm so sorry
about your dad. Thanks.

419
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,509
Are you okay? I tried
calling you a couple of times,

420
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,778
left messages, I wanted
to see if I could do anything.

421
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:15,213
I appreciate you calling.

422
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,482
Rachel ended up coming
up and we're just hanging out.

423
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:20,652
Yes. No, I'm trying
to find out how to get

424
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:24,123
my father into a VA cemetery.

425
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,058
Transferring me to
yet another department.

426
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,258
Didn't he want to be buried

427
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:28,677
next to your mother
in San Diego?

428
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,111
I don't know what he wanted.

429
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,247
He said he didn't
want to be any trouble.

430
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,216
Suggested I put him
out with the trash.

431
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,217
Oh, that was helpful.

432
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,518
Threw in a couple of harangues

433
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,188
about mortuary vultures too.

434
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,955
Another recording
telling me to hold.

435
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,942
You look beat.

436
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:46,078
Yeah, well, Tess
hasn't been sleeping.

437
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,246
Teething, probably.

438
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,864
Yeah, that's what Luka said.

439
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,649
Well, he sees them
enough to know.

440
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:53,585
Hey, don't give me a
hard time about that.

441
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,371
I'm struggling enough
with this as it is.

442
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,539
I think it's great.

443
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,641
I want you to be happy.

444
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:03,245
So why do I still
feel so... unsure?

445
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,746
Maybe you're just afraid of

446
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,348
making yourself
vulnerable again.

447
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,519
Carol, she's waking up.

448
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,288
Let me know if
you need anything.

449
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,305
Thanks.

450
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:16,241
Conni, could you
get Weaver for me?

451
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:17,642
Where am I?

452
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,878
You're in the
hospital, sweetheart.

453
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,747
No. No, I don't want that.

454
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,117
Mrs. O'Brien.

455
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,020
I'm Carol Hathaway. I'm a nurse.

456
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:29,855
We're giving you
fluid through an IV

457
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,456
because you stopped drinking.

458
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,058
That's why you
didn't wake up today.

459
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:35,393
I want to go home.

460
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,196
Please.

461
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,431
Honey, we need
to get you admitted

462
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,266
to the hospital so
you could feel better.

463
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,836
No. I want to go home.

464
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,526
Mrs. O'Brien?

465
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,145
You want to go home?

466
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,378
And you don't want to
be put onto any machines?

467
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:53,712
No.

468
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:56,048
Please, no machines.

469
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,849
Honey, they can help
you if we stay. No.

470
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:00,135
They'll give you
something for the pain. No.

471
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,388
Mr. O'Brien? Home.

472
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:03,772
Mr. O'Brien.

473
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,897
Conni, please start
her on a morphine drip.

474
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,913
I think that we should
explore home hospice care.

475
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,450
An ambulance could take
her home as long as someone

476
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:18,153
was there to take care of the
IVs and the pain medication?

477
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,355
It's clearly what she wants.

478
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,324
She's dying, she doesn't
know what she wants.

479
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,982
I think she does.
She was very clear.

480
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,213
Don't you think
she deserves to die

481
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,015
where she wants to, at home?

482
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,740
With her family? In her own bed?

483
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,322
All right.

484
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,725
Good.

485
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,526
Why don't you go tell her?

486
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,951
I think it'll help
calm her down.

487
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,555
Carol.

488
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:52,904
Oh, God, I really
didn't need this today.

489
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,505
Why don't you call
Social Services.

490
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:55,774
Maybe the husband's right.

491
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,176
And we could admit her for
a day or two, get her buffed...

492
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,577
No, Carol, please, not today.

493
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,179
She would go home eventually.

494
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:04,515
The woman wants to go.
We can't keep her here.

495
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,351
She wants to die.

496
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,418
I know it's not pleasant,

497
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:09,087
but we have to
respect her wishes.

498
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:11,256
Yes, but she is in
excruciating pain

499
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,592
and we didn't even try to
explain the options to her.

500
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:16,950
Just call and set it up.

501
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:28,574
All right.

502
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,076
This should take
about 20 minutes.

503
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,512
And you should start feeling
better in a couple of days.

504
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:34,813
I'm gonna have the nurse come in

505
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:36,582
and give you your prescriptions.

506
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,183
How are you feeling,
Mr. Papazian?

507
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,352
Are those steroids
and albuterol helping?

508
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:41,520
Yeah, I feel much better.

509
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:42,721
Yeah, it's amazing stuff.

510
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,141
You okay, Mrs. Wyatt?

511
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,878
Hard... Hard to breathe.

512
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,146
Are you having any chest pain?

513
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,547
No.

514
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,249
Has this ever
happened to you before?

515
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:58,320
When I... When I got Bactrim.

516
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,454
Bactrim?

517
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,190
I told you I was
allergic to sulfa.

518
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,066
Feeling dizzy...

519
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:12,750
Okay, just lie down. Lie down.

520
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:14,219
You need some help?

521
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,953
No.

522
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,444
Everything's under control.

523
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,942
How you doin', Mrs. Wyatt?

524
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,265
Not too good.

525
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,079
What happened?

526
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,080
Nothing.

527
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,548
Somebody hit the call button.

528
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,212
I did.

529
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,587
What? She was
having trouble breathing!

530
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,005
What happened?

531
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,240
Uh, she was
complaining of hives.

532
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:36,792
So, I gave her a subcu epi.

533
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,294
Where's all the
blood coming from?

534
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,796
She must've pulled out her IV.

535
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,797
Why would she pull...?

536
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,061
How the hell would I know that?

537
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:50,022
I want you to
start another line.

538
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,224
Just, uh, give her
50 of Benadryl,

539
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:54,459
125 of Solu-Medrol.

540
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,733
You just nodded off for a
second there, Mrs. Wyatt.

541
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,082
Good pulse, good respirations.

542
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,366
You want any fluids?

543
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,957
Yeah, why don't you
run a liter over an hour.

544
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:26,313
This isn't gonna be pretty.

545
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:33,131
Why was a critical patient like
this discharged from the ER?

546
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:34,899
She wasn't critical at the time.

547
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:36,969
Her vitals were stable.
I thought it was PID.

548
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,971
You didn't appreciate
the mass on exam?

549
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:40,172
No, I didn't.

550
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,307
Who was supervising?
You, Dr. Malucci?

551
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:44,642
Didn't you appreciate anything?

552
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,644
Uh... Uh, no. I... I didn't.

553
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,381
What were you
wearing? Oven mitts?

554
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,517
Actually, Dr. Malucci
never had a chance

555
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,786
to examine the patient.

556
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,254
I think you two
need a moment alone

557
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:57,522
to get your stories straight.

558
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:58,523
He didn't examine her

559
00:24:58,547 --> 00:24:59,992
because I never called him in.

560
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:01,559
Have you recently
and unexpectedly

561
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,912
graduated from medical
school, Ms. Lockhart?

562
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,314
I thought my experience
in OB/GYN qualified me.

563
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,699
Obviously, I was wrong.

564
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:10,953
So you signed a discharge
order for a patient you never saw

565
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,122
who was examined and treated
only by a medical student?

566
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,757
This woman could have died!

567
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,359
And you're years away from
having the necessary experience

568
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,427
to make these decisions.

569
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,429
I know.

570
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:21,453
Oh, good!

571
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,176
I'd like a moment alone
to speak with Dr. Malucci.

572
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:38,063
Can I... Can I say
something? I, uh...

573
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,865
I think your cause
would better be served

574
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:41,588
by keeping your mouth shut.

575
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:53,245
When Residents arrive
here, we size you up.

576
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,813
We... have great hopes for you.

577
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:57,282
We want you to succeed.

578
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,051
But gradually, over time
and through interaction,

579
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,803
we form opinions.

580
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:05,440
Do you want to know
the staff's opinion of you?

581
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,726
You're lazy, sloppy.

582
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,328
And your careless attitude

583
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:11,363
towards your
responsibilities as a physician

584
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:14,037
endangers patients'
lives, as witnessed today.

585
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:16,034
In other words,

586
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:18,498
none of us thinks
you're much of a doctor.

587
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,223
Carter's all over the
place emotionally.

588
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,426
Depressed one
moment, elated the next.

589
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,794
Have you talked to him about it?

590
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,529
Yeah, I tried to ask
him how he's doing,

591
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,364
but he isn't very forthcoming.

592
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,232
Do you know if he's
he seeing anyone?

593
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,590
Let's get out of the hallway.

594
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,160
Haleh, can you give us a minute?

595
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,242
You mean a
therapist? I don't know.

596
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,644
Well, don't you think he should?

597
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,612
I'm not a psychiatrist.

598
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,515
Look, I know you think
it's none of my business.

599
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,916
But I got out the the DMS IV...

600
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,385
Oh, so now you're
a psychiatrist?

601
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,286
He has violent mood swings.

602
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,788
Sometimes he's deeply depressed

603
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,890
other times he's
manic and elated.

604
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,459
So you're suggesting
he's bipolar.

605
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,729
Do you know if
there's a family history?

606
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:02,464
He was almost killed.

607
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,932
He feels partially
responsible for Lucy's death.

608
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,769
My moods would be
all over the place too.

609
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,338
But are you sure
that's all it is?

610
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,439
Look, Dr. Greene,

611
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,409
I may be wrong,
but what if I'm right?

612
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,877
If we care about him,

613
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:19,335
don't we owe it to him to
at least try and find out?

614
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,218
How's she doing?

615
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:26,587
Breathing's agonal.
Resps are seven.

616
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,124
So she's not getting any better?

617
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,859
No. I'm afraid not.

618
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,861
We're doing what we
can to rehydrate her,

619
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,966
and we called Social Services
to help set up the hospice care.

620
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,334
Where are your daughters?

621
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:40,468
Down in the cafeteria,

622
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,338
getting something to eat
with some of the nurses.

623
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,873
She's been sleeping
so peacefully.

624
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,943
You should have
seen her two years ago.

625
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:51,413
She was so beautiful.
Alive and vibrant.

626
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,415
Always laughing.

627
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,200
I wish I could have it back.

628
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:57,691
The time I missed with her.

629
00:27:58,828 --> 00:28:00,594
Traveling for work.

630
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,324
Late nights at the office.

631
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,183
All the weekends I
was prepping for trial.

632
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:11,071
When she was first diagnosed

633
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,441
I kept working.

634
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,660
Can you believe that?

635
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,241
Instead of spending time
with her, I kept working.

636
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,305
I'm gonna call
Social Services again,

637
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:34,545
find out what's keeping them.

638
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,958
Thanks.

639
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:40,867
She's not breathing.

640
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,798
Oh, God!

641
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:44,999
Shelagh?

642
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,143
Shelagh! Please,
the girls aren't here.

643
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,973
I-I-I didn't think it was
gonna happen this fast.

644
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,308
Conni, can ya help me?

645
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,043
Carol, she's a DNR.
That doesn't mean

646
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,561
we can't stimulate
her breathing.

647
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,346
Please, they didn't
get to say goodbye.

648
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,480
You want me to get Weaver?

649
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,900
No, I want you to get
Kovac. Tell him I need him.

650
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:04,385
And then go downstairs
and get the daughters.

651
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,089
Come on, Shelagh. Shelagh.

652
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,241
Come on, Shelagh Please, God.

653
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:10,525
Not yet. Please.

654
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,692
What happened?

655
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,446
End-stage ovarian cancer.
She stopped breathing.

656
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,447
Why are you bagging her?

657
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:17,032
Let's intubate. We can't.

658
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,116
She's a DNR.

659
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,951
Then let her go.

660
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:23,155
The daughters are downstairs.
They haven't said goodbye yet.

661
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,372
Please.

662
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,676
I-I thought we had more time.

663
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:28,710
Can't we use a nasal trumpet?

664
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,812
The children haven't had
a chance to say goodbye

665
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:31,797
to their dying mother.

666
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:33,698
It's not a ventilator.

667
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:35,255
Please?

668
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:39,037
Where are the trumpets?

669
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,476
I'll get it.

670
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:57,777
I'm in.

671
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,897
She's breathing.

672
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:15,991
What's going on in here?

673
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,092
We put in a nasal trumpet.

674
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,010
She's DNR. We didn't intubate.

675
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,145
We're helping keep the...

676
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:21,985
You resuscitated her.

677
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,232
She's your patient?

678
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,684
Yes, Dr. Kovac,
she's my patient.

679
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:28,658
Her daughters weren't
here to say goodbye.

680
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,329
Mr. O'Brien, will you
excuse us for a moment?

681
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,581
You deliberately
violated a patient's wishes.

682
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,983
No, I did what I
thought was best,

683
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,251
under the circumstances.

684
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,852
That's not your
decision to make!

685
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:45,837
I'm sorry, Kerry.

686
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:47,104
Damn right! You should be.

687
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:49,007
You're a senior member
of this staff, Carol.

688
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:51,176
We discussed this
earlier. We disagreed.

689
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,577
I listened to your
point of view.

690
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,412
I told you exactly
what I wanted done.

691
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,913
If you can't
respect my authority

692
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,897
then you shouldn't
be working here!

693
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,453
If she codes again,

694
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:04,189
I don't want either
of you to touch her.

695
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,190
Is that clear?

696
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:06,214
Yeah.

697
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,283
I'm sorry, Luka.

698
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:13,102
Luka, don't just walk...

699
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,341
Hey, Mark

700
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:25,210
Hey, what are you
doing down here?

701
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:27,445
I thought you were
stuck upstairs all day.

702
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,847
I came down to talk
to Kerry about Malucci.

703
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:31,383
What did he do this time?

704
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,451
I've just been through
the whole thing with her.

705
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,319
Can I tell you later? Sure.

706
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:37,255
Did you get your dad sorted out?

707
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,190
Yeah.

708
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:41,159
Where is he now?

709
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:44,150
He's, uh, actually,
in the trunk of my car.

710
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:48,021
I-I didn't have time to go home.

711
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,385
Where's Rachel?

712
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,849
Jen's parents,
being spoiled rotten.

713
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,658
I thought you might
like these back.

714
00:31:56,682 --> 00:32:00,928
I don't feel comfortable
keeping them.

715
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,664
My father gave them to you.

716
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:06,468
Yes, and it was very sweet
of him but I just think it...

717
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,225
It's a bad idea.

718
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:11,506
I really think you should
give them to Rachel.

719
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,730
I was 12 once. I know
what they'll mean to her.

720
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,928
Hey.

721
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:18,885
Don't read too much into this.

722
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:21,132
Do I do that?

723
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:23,551
You do it regularly.

724
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,454
Mark, we've got an
acute MI coming in.

725
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,838
All right, I'll be right there.

726
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,027
Well, are you, uh,
still coming by tonight?

727
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,029
Where will Rachel sleep?

728
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,897
On the pullout
in the living room.

729
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,616
I don't get off till 12.

730
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,920
I'll leave the light on.

731
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:40,308
Okay.

732
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,391
You had no right to
put me in that position.

733
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,392
I know.

734
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,160
Kerry is my
superior. I work here.

735
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,512
I don't wanna lose my job.

736
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:09,397
You have every reason to be mad.

737
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,565
You took advantage of
our personal relationship.

738
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,934
I did what I thought was right.

739
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,235
Yeah, damn the consequences!

740
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,603
In this case, yes.

741
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,907
You had every right to make
that decision for yourself,

742
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,780
but not to make it for me.

743
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:24,529
You're really mad.

744
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,364
Yes, I am!

745
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:27,866
Why are you smiling?

746
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,752
I guess I thought I was immune.

747
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,125
Well, you are not.

748
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,614
Luka, I'm sorry.

749
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,297
Yes?

750
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,550
Really. It will never
happen again.

751
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:47,519
Good.

752
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:48,920
And thank you.

753
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,188
For what?

754
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:53,324
For helping her.

755
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:54,715
You're welcome.

756
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:14,048
What?

757
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:17,336
Nothing.

758
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,868
You sure?

759
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,492
Yeah.

760
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,950
"Good night, little house,
and good night, mouse.

761
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,286
Good night, comb.
Good night, brush."

762
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,355
Now can you see the mouse?

763
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,273
There's the mouse.

764
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,808
Hey, guys.

765
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,749
Your mom's ready to see you now.

766
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:49,814
Frank, could you take Jennifer?

767
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,815
Sure.

768
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,399
We'll be in in a minute.

769
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:59,071
Don't you want to see your mom?

770
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,968
She's going to die, isn't she?

771
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,336
Yeah.

772
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:13,560
It's not fair.

773
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,564
No, it's not.

774
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,469
I don't wanna only have a dad.

775
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,792
I wanna be a family...
like we used to be.

776
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,101
Come on. We should go.

777
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,390
You ready?

778
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,768
Hi, Mommy.

779
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,407
Hi, there.

780
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,910
How's my girl?

781
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,956
What are you doing?

782
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,061
Uh... just gathering
my thoughts.

783
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:45,263
Haleh said you'd been
in here for a while?

784
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,631
Yeah, I finished up
some sutures, and, um...

785
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:49,967
It seemed like a quiet
place to hang out.

786
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:51,035
Is that a problem?

787
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:53,037
No.

788
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,761
Some of us are just a
little worried about you.

789
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:58,764
Well, you don't need to be.

790
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:01,834
How are you? Fine.

791
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,272
You seeing anybody? Therapist?

792
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,292
No.

793
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,008
Need a referral?

794
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,627
Sure.

795
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:16,794
Yeah?

796
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,452
'Cause, uh, Nadio
gave me some names.

797
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,172
Yeah, that'd be great.

798
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,585
Might help.

799
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,576
Yeah, you're right. I'll go.

800
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:31,647
Okay.

801
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:58,635
Did Social Services
get your patient home?

802
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:00,259
No. She died.

803
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:03,007
I'm sorry.

804
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,064
She was end-stage.

805
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:08,579
I'm off in a couple of hours.

806
00:38:08,603 --> 00:38:10,098
Would you like to
get some dinner?

807
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,488
Sure.

808
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,156
We don't have to.

809
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,273
Ah, no, that would be nice.

810
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,341
Excuse me, Miss Hathaway?

811
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,981
I'll find you when I get off.

812
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,684
I just wanted to thank you

813
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,141
for everything you
did for us today.

814
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,656
You're welcome.

815
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,351
Do you believe that
we have soul mates?

816
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,487
You know, that there's only...

817
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,936
one person we're
supposed to find?

818
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,277
O-Only one person
we can really love?

819
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,065
I didn't used to.

820
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,614
But I-I-I do now.

821
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:04,351
Sh-She was the love of my life.

822
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,443
And I'll never love anyone
again the way I loved her.

823
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,353
Carol, I need
some more atropine.

824
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,554
Carol!

825
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:41,656
Hey, Haleh, where's Mark?

826
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,190
Carol, is everything all right?

827
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,625
Where's Mark?

828
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,015
Exam 1.

829
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,632
Mark, I gotta go.

830
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,500
Tell Kerry I won't be
in tomorrow, okay?

831
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,635
Twins okay?

832
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,170
I'm gonna drop
them off at my mom's.

833
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,738
What? I'll call you
from the plane.

834
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,140
Plane?

835
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,142
Hey, Malik, where's Kovac?

836
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,832
Curtain 3.

837
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,246
Luka,

838
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,816
I can't have dinner
with you tonight.

839
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,106
Okay.

840
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,559
I'm so sorry.

841
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,395
For what?

842
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,250
I have to go find out.

843
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,237
Find out what?

844
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:27,240
If he's still in love with me.

845
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:32,857
Because... I'm still
in love with him.

846
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:34,292
I am.

847
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:37,316
I've been in love with him
since I was 23 years old.

848
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:43,534
He's... He's everything to me.

849
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:46,337
He's my life. I feel
complete when I'm with him,

850
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,895
and I feel empty
when we're apart.

851
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:55,835
He's the father of my children.

852
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,606
And he's my soul mate.

853
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,388
You'll find someone,
Luka. You will.

854
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,325
You're such a wonderful man.

855
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:08,926
She's out there, I know she is.

856
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,867
Someone who'll love you
the way your wife loved you.

857
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,591
You'll find her. You will.

858
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:26,899
You will find her.

Right here.

880
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,024

Yeah.

00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:52,396
Listen, I have to go to
San Diego next week

883
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,165
to, uh, bury his ashes
next to your grandmother's.

884
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:57,401

Yeah. I do.

888
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:14,384
It's kind of funny.

889
00:43:14,408 --> 00:43:15,688
Why?

890
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:21,993
We didn't like each other
much for a very long time.

891
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,049
How come?

892
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,420
I can't remember now.

893
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:31,941
Probably mostly my fault.

894
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,960
I have somethin' for you.

895
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:39,382
These were your grandmother's.

896
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,796
Do you like them?

897
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,532
They're beautiful.

898
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:45,866
Can I put 'em on you?

899
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,156
'Kay, turn around.

900
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:52,912
Okay, let's see.

901
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:01,365
You... You look lovely.

902
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,689
Thank you.

903
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:09,256
Promise me you won't
grow up too fast, okay?
