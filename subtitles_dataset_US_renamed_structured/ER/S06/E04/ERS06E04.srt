1
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:12,205
I said the lap-chole at 11,
the gastric bypass at 3:30.

2
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,428
Yeah.

3
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:16,810
Have you seen my earring? Nope.

4
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,795
Well, look, why don't
you try to get hold of him

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:19,796
and then call me back?

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,097
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,598
You're already dressed?

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,202
My schedule's all
jumbled up. I need to get in.

9
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,961
Besides, Romano's got
me buried in paperwork.

10
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:33,048
Oh, there they are.

11
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,779
Oh, come on.

12
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,751
You're going to cover
me in shaving cream.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,221
Hi. Did you get him?

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,491
Uh, y-yes, um, hello.

15
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,026
Yes. Uh...

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,362
Oh, he's... He is. He's
right here, actually.

17
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,763
It's your father.

18
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:54,797
Oh. I'm sorry.

19
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,533
Hi, Dad.

20
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,235
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, calm down. What?

21
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,372
Wh...? Wh...? What happened?
Wa...? Was anyone hurt?

22
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,473
Is everything all right?

23
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,208
Oh, well, that's good.

24
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,646
Yeah, um... So
this was last night?

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,914
Mm-hm.

26
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:12,915
You need me to stay?

27
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,418
I'll catch you later. Okay.

28
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,421
So, Dad? D-dad, okay, fine.

29
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,291
Look, i-it's just a fender.

30
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,027
Okay, a fender
and a cypress tree.

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,595
Oh, you know what?

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,198
Um, just cornflakes and a
small orange juice, please.

33
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,333
That's it?

34
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,101
Yeah, there's just
no room left for food.

35
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,004
I'm eating like a horse.

36
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,439
Well, twins. They're
squishing my stomach.

37
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,374
I just have one
squishing more than that.

38
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,110
Meg, I can't read
this. What's this say?

39
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,712
Two over medium.

40
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,781
Large coffee to
go, please. Sure.

41
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:45,849
Hey, morning, Carol.

42
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:46,873
Hi.

43
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,436
What?

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,538
I think you have shaving cream

45
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:52,556
on your earlobe.

46
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,157
Oh.

47
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,659
Thank you.

48
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,226
How is Mark?

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,279
Clean-shaven.

50
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:02,181
That's twice in one
morning. Oh, I'm sorry.

51
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,700
Just clean it up.

52
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,568
And get this guy another order.

53
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,170
How are you managing
without coffee?

54
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,205
Oh, you know, it's not so bad.

55
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,640
It's actually the, uh, growing
out of my maternity wear

56
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,826
that's starting to worry me.

57
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,394
Not to worry.
You'll drop a couple

58
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,697
of those pounds breast-feeding.

59
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,232
See you later. Thanks. Bye.

60
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,890
Here. Oh, thank you.

61
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,004
Not easy maneuvering, is it? No.

62
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:27,257
Do you know what
you're having? No.

63
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,427
Nothing on the ultrasound?
I... I haven't had one.

64
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,962
Oh, you really should.
It's important for the baby.

65
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,264
Who's your OB?

66
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,832
I gotta pick up an order.
You do have an OB?

67
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,653
My boss is gonna
yell at me again, heh.

68
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:42,338
Can I borrow your
pencil and your pad?

69
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,940
I'm a nurse at County. Mm-hm.

70
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,675
I'm gonna write down my name.

71
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,376
You should come
by after your shift.

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,330
We'll examine you
and check out the baby.

73
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:53,166
I... I don't know. I... I don't
have insurance or anything.

74
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,630
It's okay. Where I
work, you don't need it.

75
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,373
Morning.

76
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,375
Hey, the celebrity herself.

77
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,676
Beg your pardon?

78
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,345
Dr. Corday, right?

79
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,013
Yeah, what are
you talking about?

80
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:08,181
"Prescription for Danger:

81
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:10,350
Are You Safe at County General?"

82
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,806
Good picture.

83
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:16,139
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,725
Stop it! Stop it! Get
that thing away from me!

85
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,961
Leave me alone! Let go!

86
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,664
Robin, calm down.
This isn't so bad, is it?

87
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,832
I hate you! Robin!

88
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:16,833
Yosh?

89
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,804
Do you like koala
bears, Robin? Why?

90
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,006
Because I have a special
bear that wants to meet you.

91
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,524
It's Mr. Koala Bear.

92
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,509
- I hate bears!
- Robin, stop it.

93
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,063
Maybe you could you
hold her, Mrs. Bourke?

94
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:31,130
If you're good,

95
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,649
I'll take you to
the toy store. No!

96
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,184
When did she start vomiting?

97
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,186
This morning, right
after she drank her juice.

98
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,487
Mommy, make them stop!

99
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,239
We had Chinese takeout,

100
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:40,857
my husband has an
upset... I hate you!

101
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,859
Any diarrhea?

102
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,193
A little.

103
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,780
Childhood illnesses?
Uh, just a few colds.

104
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:49,082
And prescription medicines,
keep those out of reach?

105
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:51,618
Yes, our home is
childproof. Okay, okay, okay.

106
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:53,286
She probably has food poisoning.

107
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,838
I'll give her
Compazine... Let go.

108
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,090
For the nausea.
Robin. I'm sorry.

109
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:59,509
And observe her for a
couple of hours, okay?

110
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,776
Honey, did you hear that?

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,879
We're gonna stay here so
they can take care of you.

112
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,099
I hate it here!
Oh, wait... Okay.

113
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:07,800
You were looking
for me? Yo, Dr. Pete.

114
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:08,934
I definitely was.

115
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,270
I've got one seriously
hot appy here for you.

116
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,272
Hot appy? Ready to
be sliced and diced.

117
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:15,174
Well, then why don't
you call for a consult?

118
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,742
I told you. Thought
you'd want him.

119
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:19,212
He can't do general surgery.
I don't do general surgery.

120
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,513
Told you. Thank you, Conni.

121
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,680
You're welcome, Dr. Dave.

122
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,082
You know what,
I don't blame you.

123
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,484
Hernias, appys, gallbladders...

124
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:26,152
It's boring. Am I right?

125
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,587
I think you're like me, man.

126
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,688
You like the guts, the
glory, the bright lights.

127
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,023
We're cut from the same cloth.

128
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,691
Know what "skating
on thin ice" means?

129
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,494
Okay, this is me backin' off.

130
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:37,630
That's good. Stay up
there as long as you can.

131
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:38,953
You're doing great.

132
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,885
Kerry, hi. Morning, Gabe.

133
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,021
How much longer?

134
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,639
Uh, the expulsion of flatus

135
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:48,975
marches to its own
drummer, Mr. Rineberry.

136
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:51,094
And the more I fart,
the better I'll feel?

137
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,595
Yeah, well,

138
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,530
to put it somewhat
indelicately, yeah.

139
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,516
I... I'll be back.
Stay with her.

140
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,183
Keep your eye on him, okay?

141
00:05:58,207 --> 00:05:59,752
I was just gonna
grab a cup of coffee.

142
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,086
Great, I'll join you.

143
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,488
So you're starting off your day

144
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,624
with a splenic
flexure syndrome, eh?

145
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,125
Guy didn't want to
stand on his head

146
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,094
until I reminded him gas rises.

147
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,397
That seems like you're
settling in well, huh?

148
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,566
Oh, yeah, everybody's
been terrific. Great.

149
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,701
Mark Greene is still
pissing on trees a little...

150
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,403
Do you want me to
say something to him?

151
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,071
Dr. Lawrence? Yeah, Lily? Yeah?

152
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,272
Uh, it's Lucy. Lucy Knight.

153
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,473
Lucy. Sorry. That's okay.

154
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:23,142
Did you wanna
order the, uh, Oxacillin

155
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,443
for the cellulitis in Four?

156
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,445
Cellulitis in Four. Yeah,
he should have some.

157
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,848
You just didn't sign for it. Oh.

158
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,750
Easily fixed.

159
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:32,351
Here you go. Thanks.

160
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,407
Sure.

161
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:37,657
Is it just me, or are
medical students younger

162
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,959
than they used to be?
It's definitely the students.

163
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,594
I... I haven't felt this old

164
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,563
since your class
graduated from med school.

165
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:44,997
My class? Yeah.

166
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,567
I remember your mom came up to
me and she was thanking me for...

167
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:48,768
You know, for inspiring you

168
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,770
to go into emergency medicine.

169
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,405
And the whole time she's
talking to me, all I can think is:

170
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,641
"My God, we're
practically the same age."

171
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,143
Oh, no, she had a year
or two on you anyway.

172
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,212
How is she? How is she
doing? She passed away

173
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:01,547
a couple of years ago.

174
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,716
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's rough. Yeah.

175
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,085
Yeah, it is.

176
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,386
How is your family doing?

177
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,390
Oh, all my ex-wives
are alive and living well.

178
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:14,427
And your son was going
into medicine too, wasn't he?

179
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:17,931
No, that was my dream,
not his, as he would say.

180
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:21,301
Of course, he doesn't say
much of anything to me anymore.

181
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,486
Families, huh? Go figure.
- Get away!

182
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,521
Get away from me!

183
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,056
Get away from me!

184
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,693
Get away from me!
Sorry. Excuse us.

185
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,927
Get away from me!

186
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,080
Think I'll have
more cream. Sure.

187
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:35,782
I certainly never
meant to convey

188
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,450
any deficiency at County.

189
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:39,452
I could hardly anticipate
a shootout. Mm-hm.

190
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,520
And not everything in
the account was negative.

191
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,990
I particularly enjoyed the
description of Dr. Carter

192
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:46,926
clamping off his first aortic
rupture in an 8-year-old.

193
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,696
Yeah, which, as the account
clearly states, was successful.

194
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,098
Do you remember, Lizzie,
the point of this article?

195
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:53,199
To toot County's horn.

196
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,167
Actually, it was
to toot my horn.

197
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:58,838
Which is why you understand
that I am disturbed at, uh...

198
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:00,840
Not only at getting heat
on this from upstairs,

199
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,108
but at, uh, finding my picture

200
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,676
in a sidebar next
to the obituaries.

201
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,612
I'd gladly give
up the front page.

202
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,684
Lizzie, when I appointed
you Associate Chief,

203
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,052
it was for two reasons:

204
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,722
One, to serve. Two, to
protect my needs, my interests.

205
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,456
But I have sensed
some reluctance.

206
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,457
To what?

207
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:19,876
Corralling Benton, for one.

208
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,016
We've settled that. Oh, have we?

209
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,415
So I haven't made a
mistake in appointing you?

210
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,817
No, Robert, you haven't
made a mistake. Good.

211
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,686
Oh, by the way, there's
been some slop-over

212
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,254
from the Anspaugh
administration.

213
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,757
It seems Donald is still
scheduling his own surgeries.

214
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,258
Speak to him about
that, would you?

215
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,427
You can't be serious.

216
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,994
It's interfering
with my schedule.

217
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,180
I am completely serious.

218
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,934
Dr. Corday. Carter.

219
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,936
Is Elaine Nichols'
path report back yet?

220
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,988
You'll need to speak
to her about that.

221
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,155
Right, of course.

222
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,241
I will when she comes
in to have her sutures out,

223
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,343
which generally is about
a week after surgery?

224
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,279
Generally. And in Elaine's case,

225
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,698
that could be sometime
today. This morning even.

226
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,900
Carter. Or perhaps
this afternoon?

227
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,757
Carter. Yes?

228
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,021
There's some chance it'll be

229
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,541
this afternoon,
say, around 3:00.

230
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:11,682
Thank you. By the
way, loved the article.

231
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,216
Tommy Stevens. Attempted
suicide by hanging.

232
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,585
Yeah, that makes one
nasty rope burn, huh?

233
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:20,586
What?

234
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,689
Finish up, Dumar. Vital signs.

235
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,891
BP 80 palp. Pulse
thready. Shallow resp.

236
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,160
I didn't want to intubate
in case he broke his neck.

237
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:29,261
Okay, everybody, nice
and easy. On my count:

238
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,731
One, two, three.

239
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:34,283
He's gettin' dusky.
We need to tube him.

240
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,451
Be a tricky intubation.
Tricky's my middle name.

241
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,353
And potentially
dangerous. Like I said,

242
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,454
Danger is my middle name.

243
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,455
Pulse ox down to 84.

244
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,324
Okay, let's get in there.

245
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,126
I'm gonna give you
inline stabilization.

246
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,579
Whatever you do, do
not extend the neck.

247
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:50,299
I'm as gentle as a kitten, sir.

248
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,801
BP's still 80.

249
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,635
All right, run
another liter of saline.

250
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,805
Too much edema. I
can't see the cords.

251
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,725
We need to crike him.
Whoa, hold on. Let's bag him.

252
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:01,511
Get his sats up. We need
a fiberoptic laryngoscope.

253
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,379
I'll get it.

254
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,064
Fiberoptics. That is cool.

255
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,767
You ever done one?
I've certainly seen them.

256
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,435
So that's a no, huh?

257
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,521
But, you, Dr. Greene,
could change all that.

258
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,322
I'll give you one
shot. Then it's mine.

259
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,440
Yes.

260
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:16,275
Yeah, it doesn't look too bad.

261
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:18,144
Not very deep.

262
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:20,688
Probably just need
a couple of stitches.

263
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:24,652
Did the paramedics bring you in?

264
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:27,603
Would you get us some
more four-by-fours?

265
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,506
We're running a
little low here, okay?

266
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,843
So your parents weren't with
you when this happened, huh?

267
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,178
No.

268
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,103
This is liable to sting
a little, Becky, okay?

269
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,773
How'd it happen?

270
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,625
He wasn't outside.

271
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,306
Who...? Who wasn't
ou...? Outside?

272
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,231
Tommy. M-my boyfriend.

273
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,396
Did he do this? Did he cut you?

274
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,870
I didn't even know
they had a basement.

275
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:00,002
I saw a light bulb
hanging down there.

276
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,288
And there he
was, right next to it.

277
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:04,157
Tommy was in the basement?

278
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:06,075
He tied the rope around a pipe.

279
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,701
So I ran back up to the
kitchen and got a knife.

280
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,383
And you used the
knife to cut the rope?

281
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,936
He just fell down.

282
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,088
I couldn't hold him or anything.

283
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,156
That's when the knife slipped.

284
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,513
And you cut yourself.

285
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,262
Is he gonna be okay?

286
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,930
Did the paramedics bring him?

287
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,432
They wouldn't let
me come with him.

288
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,799
I came in a different ambulance.

289
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,268
If you wait here, I'll go check

290
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,435
and see what I can find out.

291
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,571
Okay.

292
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,373
Tell me when
you're at the cords.

293
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,725
We are about to make contact.

294
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:40,726
I'm there.

295
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,094
Okay, advance into the trachea

296
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,412
and slide down the tube.

297
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,180
Yup, the eagle has
landed. Let's bag him.

298
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,016
Okay. Let's get X-ray down here.

299
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,835
I need a portable
chest and a C-spine.

300
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:51,270
Good breath sounds
on both sides. Nice work.

301
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,538
Thanks, boss.

302
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,941
Pulse ox up to 91.

303
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,043
This the suicide? Tommy? Yup.

304
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,594
How's he doin'? Great.

305
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,296
Neck is swollen up like a blimp.

306
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,914
Couldn't even see the cords.

307
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,582
Dr. Greene here let
me do a fiberoptic.

308
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:06,006
I passed that baby through
like I was threadin' a needle.

309
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:07,920
How's he doing?

310
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,454
He's pinking up.

311
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,356
But with the prolonged
oxygen deprivation,

312
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,025
I'm not sure about
his neuro status.

313
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,593
Come on, he was
too blue for too long.

314
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:17,280
We might be lookin'
at veggie burger.

315
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,947
Dr. Greene.

316
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,016
Oh, God.

317
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,385
Tommy! GREENE: Haleh.

318
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,452
Come on. Tommy, Tommy.

319
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,920
Let's get you outside.

320
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,455
Tommy! Is he all right?

321
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,623
Help her out.

322
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,708
What does he mean?

323
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:31,226
Is he gonna be all right?

324
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,912
You a resident? Yeah.

325
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,614
Well, you still need to learn
that every patient in here

326
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:40,452
is somebody's boyfriend,
girlfriend, father, mother, son.

327
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,321
They don't exist simply
for you to learn new

328
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,557
and interesting
procedures. I didn't see her.

329
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,491
Well, next time open your eyes

330
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,182
before you open your mouth.

331
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,617
Jeez, what's with the new guy?

332
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,385
Oh, which new guy
would that be, Malucci?

333
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,008
Dr. Lawrence or you?

334
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,863
He never said anything
about killing himself.

335
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,333
It's not your fault, Becky.

336
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,635
Be thankful you found
him. He's got a good chance.

337
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,371
I almost didn't go back inside.
I was gonna be late for school.

338
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,091
But I don't know. I just did.

339
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,326
Were his parents there?

340
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,828
No. At work.

341
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:25,397
His dad. His mom
lives in Florida.

342
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,516
You know where? Where...?
Where his father works?

343
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,852
Some kind of construction.

344
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,892
I don't really know him.
He's not around much.

345
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,859
Are you sick? You
don't look good.

346
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,661
She's just a little tired.
Who do you belong to?

347
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,231
Here, I'll make you
better. Say "ah."

348
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,116
Thank you, but this
patient has a doctor.

349
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,418
No, let go of me!
Okay, whoa, hold it.

350
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:47,453
Hold it. Robin!

351
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:50,089
Wait a sec... One
s... One second.

352
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:51,390
I want my mommy! Your... Wait.

353
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,726
Your mommy is right
over here. No! Let me go!

354
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,296
I'm so sorry, Dr. Lawrence.
No, that's quite all right.

355
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,514
I have that effect on women.

356
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,648
My mommy. No... Okay.

357
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,139
May I have my
stethoscope back, please?

358
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,924
When?

359
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,125
Twenty minutes ago.

360
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,927
He started triggering
the vent on his own.

361
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,530
Tommy, my name's Dr. Greene.

362
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,499
You're in the hospital.

363
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,085
Your girlfriend found
you and cut you down.

364
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,153
And the paramedics
brought you in.

365
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:22,405
What's his PO-2?

366
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,658
Ninety-eight percent
on an FIO-2 of 21.

367
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:29,378
Tommy, we have this tube down
your throat to help you breathe.

368
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,247
But we can take
it out now, okay?

369
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,348
You extubating him?

370
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,016
Yeah, he's got
good tidal volume.

371
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,635
You gave us a
scare there, Tommy.

372
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:37,636
I got it.

373
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,104
Thanks.

374
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,072
So, Tommy, what I want you to do

375
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:43,708
is take a deep breath
and then blow out

376
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:47,479
as hard as you can when
I pull out the tube, okay?

377
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:48,913
All right, take a deep breath.

378
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:52,317
All the way in.
Good, good, good.

379
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,486
And blow.

380
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:56,578
Good job.

381
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,614
Okay, it's gonna
be a little tender.

382
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:04,413
Don't try and speak right away.

383
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,614
Where's Becky?

384
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,499
Becky's here. She's fine.

385
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,085
She's worried
about you, of course.

386
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,453
Told me your mom's in Florida,

387
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,288
so I guess we'll call your dad.

388
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,041
You know his number at work?

389
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:17,793
I could talk to him
for you, if you want.

390
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,897
Pager number?

391
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:25,551
Here. Look, why don't
you write it, okay? Here.

392
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,269
Okay, okay. All right.

393
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,526
When you're ready.

394
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,608
Dr. Lawrence, you have a second?

395
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,943
Yeah, sure.

396
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,833
Tommy, I'll be right back.

397
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,530
What are you doin'?

398
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,631
Getting his father here.

399
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:40,732
Yeah, we're working on it.

400
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,268
Chicago P.D.'s working on it.

401
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,204
Don't pimp the kid. He
just attempted suicide.

402
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:46,538
Calling a psych consult?

403
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,002
Yes. Good.

404
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,695
Do you think I should
find out the sex?

405
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,997
Well, everyone's different.

406
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,582
Some people like to
know, some people don't.

407
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:58,617
What are you having?

408
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,802
I don't know.

409
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,805
Oh, come on. You know.

410
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,424
You're a nurse. So?

411
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,977
Seems like you'd
know. That's all.

412
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,945
Well, I figure there are few

413
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,747
really true surprises in life.

414
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,350
This is for your scrapbook.

415
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,539
Thanks.

416
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,320
Everything okay?

417
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,923
Fine. Little small for 32 weeks.

418
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,192
We'll put you on
some prenatal vitamins.

419
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,096
It's not too late for that?

420
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,167
Meg, are you smoking?

421
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,673
No.

422
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,459
I mean...

423
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,257
not a lot.

424
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:40,709
You know, it's really
bad for the baby.

425
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,778
It can cause prematurity,
low birth weight.

426
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,281
I know. I know.
I know. I'm just...

427
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,885
I'm really stressed. You
know, I lost that stupid job.

428
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,886
At Doc Magoo's?

429
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,389
I didn't move fast enough.

430
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,580
Excuse me, you know,
I'm seven months pregnant.

431
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,413
Well, you know, I could
call a social worker,

432
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,449
see if they could
get you some aid.

433
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:06,257
How about here? Do
they need people here?

434
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,776
Maybe the cafeteria?

435
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,659
I don't know. I... I
could check, I guess.

436
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:16,717
That would be great. Thanks.

437
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,602
If you promise to stop smoking.

438
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:22,585
Deal.

439
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,286
Well, Dad, just have
the insurance guy

440
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,455
call me here. Hey, Mark.

441
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,523
Mark, we got a double
trauma coming in.

442
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,993
Can you take it? Romano has
called this emergency meeting

443
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,327
for spin control... Look,

444
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,697
Dad, if you want to
handle it... Where's Benton?

445
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,665
He took up some MVA.
Okay, page Corday then.

446
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,567
You can't catch me! Hey!

447
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,302
You can't catch me!

448
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,303
You can't catch me!

449
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,705
No running. You can't catch me!

450
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,807
Hey, no running! Stop!
You can't catch me!

451
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,142
And that stuff is expensive!
You can't catch me!

452
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,111
I don't care! My daddy's rich!

453
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,646
I'm gonna call Security.

454
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,647
Brat.

455
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,115
Dad, I'm gonna call you back.

456
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,216
What's up?

457
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,018
Oh, my dad, he got
his insurance canceled.

458
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,686
Don't ask. So can you take it?

459
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,288
Because all the
department heads have to go

460
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,790
to this public
relations meeting.

461
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,358
This newspaper
thing is a disaster.

462
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,160
I don't know what
Elizabeth was doing.

463
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,462
- What newspaper thing?
- Right here.

464
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,563
Anybody seen Lawrence?

465
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,165
I got the neighbor
of the suicide kid.

466
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,299
He's got the dad's number.

467
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,068
Calling Lawrence?
That's what he said.

468
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,491
Yeah, I'll take it.

469
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,905
Hello, Dr. Greene here.

470
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,108
Thirty-one-year-old male
in parachute accident.

471
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,408
Bilateral tib-fib fractures.

472
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,877
Alert and oriented. Good vitals.

473
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,946
Your chute didn't open?
My lines got tangled.

474
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,681
Barely had time to
open the auxiliary.

475
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,250
Four dead at the scene.
What...? What about Larry?

476
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,284
Head... Head trauma.

477
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,053
What do you mean, head trauma?

478
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,658
Fifty-one-year-old male,
blunt head and chest trauma.

479
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,425
Intubated for
agonal respirations.

480
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,195
Blown pupil. Dropped
his BP to 90 over 60.

481
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,263
Flip you for it. What?

482
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,132
Well, the other guy
just has leg fractures.

483
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,299
Gee, Dave, that's too bad.

484
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,884
Come on, call it.
It's your lucky day.

485
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,352
Set up O-neg on
the rapid infuser.

486
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,821
I look at you, I think,
"Rocky, you can't lose."

487
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:52,257
I'm not callin' it, Dave.
Pulse ox has dropped. At 90.

488
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,925
But you're the man.
It's you're world.

489
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,428
Come on, call it. Heads.

490
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:57,796
Ouch, tails. Sorry, buddy.

491
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,398
Stay away from
the blackjack tables.

492
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:01,299
Get me a portable
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

493
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:04,035
Send off a trauma panel.
Type and cross for four.

494
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,270
Okay, on my count.

495
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,272
One. Two. Three.

496
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,273
Talk to me, Carter.

497
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,742
We got a fall from height.

498
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:11,527
Hypotensive severe head injury.

499
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,229
Regular rate and rhythm.
Tracheal shift to the left.

500
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,198
Survey says: chest tube.

501
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,133
Ten-blade. Thirty-two
French. Let's go.

502
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,035
Dave's your man. I got
a couple leg fractures

503
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,537
waitin' on me.

504
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,872
Pressure's down to
80. He's non-responsive.

505
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,008
Okay, pupils fixed and dilated.

506
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,243
GCS, five.

507
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,378
Brave son of bitch
for an old guy, huh?

508
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,180
He's 51.

509
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,599
He was probably trying a canopy.

510
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:34,666
It's a thing of beauty

511
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,068
when it's done right, actually.

512
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,053
I'm in. Thora-Seal.
You need me, Mark?

513
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,689
Uh, I think we're okay.
We just gotta get him to CT.

514
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,558
Horizontal mattress,
Dave. Yeah, I know.

515
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,127
Where's Peter?
He took up a hernia.

516
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,745
A hernia? Don't worry,

517
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,113
Evel Knievel's in good hands.

518
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,447
Excuse me.

519
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,417
How 'bout I throw
in a subclavian?

520
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,984
I don't think so.
Pressure's good.

521
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,120
We've got good
access. Hm. Art line?

522
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:57,305
How about a thoracotomy
while you're at it?

523
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,624
Really? Dave!

524
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,793
Oh.

525
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,861
Chest is clear. He's
gonna need a tetanus

526
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:03,962
and 3 grams of Unasyn.

527
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:05,530
Apply traction with dorsiflexion

528
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,266
to disengage the talus.

529
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,967
Like this? Yeah, perfect. Good.

530
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:12,537
Now I apply anterior
pressure to the posterior calf.

531
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:14,439
I felt a pop. Okay,
good. That's good.

532
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,241
You guys okay in
here? Got it and covered.

533
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,443
Pedal pulse is stronger.
Good. Nurse, call X-ray.

534
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,112
We'll get a post-reduction film.

535
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,346
You got it.

536
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,948
Ever do the wick
catheter technique?

537
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,749
Read about it. Today
you're gonna try it.

538
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:25,818
Cool, can I help?

539
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:28,353
Yeah, yeah, get a
pressure monitor.

540
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,689
Dave, I need you to
take this guy to CT.

541
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,358
Well, can't you get
a nurse to do that?

542
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:34,693
The guy's critical. I need
a doctor to stay with him.

543
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,245
But I was gonna help these guys.

544
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,512
We got it covered, Dave.

545
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,615
Listen, I want a neuro
check every five minutes.

546
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,082
And tell me if his
pressure drops.

547
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,117
All right.

548
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,585
You won him fair
and square, Dave.

549
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,586
Oh, and, Gabe? Yeah.

550
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,920
My patient, the kid?

551
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,989
The neighbor called, and
I got the dad's number.

552
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,458
Okay? Thanks. Oh, good.

553
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,009
I'll go get the transducer.

554
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,011
Urine dip is four-plus,
positive for blood.

555
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:54,129
Get a cystogram.

556
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,213
And let's get X-ray in here

557
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,682
for a post-reduction film.

558
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,684
I heard you the first time.

559
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,841
Right, okay, um...

560
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:05,474
Where was I? Uh,
wick catheter technique.

561
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,741
Oh, right, yeah.

562
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,311
All right, grab two
pieces of aught Dexon...

563
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,180
All right.

564
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:15,050
I've opened the peritoneal sac.

565
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,952
Can you see the fascial ring?

566
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,237
Almost.

567
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:20,239
Well, I'm glad our
schedules synced up, Peter.

568
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:21,907
It's been a long time

569
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,409
since we operated together.

570
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,176
Yeah.

571
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,645
All right, there
are no adhesions

572
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:27,984
to the anterior wall.

573
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:30,833
Oh, there's another defect.

574
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,919
We'd better do a
Gore-Tex repair.

575
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,220
Okay. Metz.

576
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,810
Hey, Elizabeth.

577
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:40,558
Interesting article in
the paper this morning.

578
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:41,559
Excuse me, Donald.

579
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,679
Peter, would you
please step out?

580
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,781
Heh. I'm in the middle
of operating here.

581
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,733
I'm sure Dr. Anspaugh
can handle it.

582
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,768
Please step out.
What is going on?

583
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,236
Peter's a trauma fellow.

584
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,837
He should be down
in the ER, not up here

585
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,239
covering elective hernias.

586
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:56,158
Right, but this patient
needed surgery.

587
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,694
And I was called down to
cover your multi-victim trauma.

588
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,696
I was down there all
morning. As you should be.

589
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,453
Now for the third
time, Please, step out.

590
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,764
Dr. Anspaugh, would
you, uh, take over, please?

591
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,459
Hey, I saw you touch that.

592
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,693
Barely.

593
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,894
Can't you make up your mind?

594
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,262
Nothing looks good.

595
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,864
How 'bout a grilled
cheese sandwich?

596
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,632
Looks less than a
day old. Mark, please.

597
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,102
Here, this. It's on me.

598
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,371
I'm not gonna eat that.
You've gotta eat something.

599
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,472
I have a mother. Thank you.

600
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,540
She calls every Sunday
for weekly weigh-ins.

601
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,574
Well, that's nothing.

602
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,977
My dad called four
times this morning,

603
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,479
obsessing about
this cypress tree

604
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,080
that he crashed into last night.

605
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,215
Is he okay?

606
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,782
Well, his pride's
a little wounded.

607
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,551
Front fender's
extremely wounded.

608
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,820
And apparently, the
neighbor's 100-year-old

609
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,589
cypress tree is
circling the drain.

610
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,291
Here, how about some Jell-O? No.

611
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,644
Come on, everybody
has room for Jell-O. No.

612
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:07,479
Got your employee discount card?

613
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:08,480
Oh, yeah.

614
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:10,148
And, um, I need to
speak to the manager.

615
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:11,283
Is someone around?

616
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,984
Viola Simpson.

617
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:15,821
Actin' like she be the
big boss, right over there.

618
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,990
Great. Thank... I saw
you eatin' that carrot.

619
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:19,496
Gotta pay for it.

620
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,078
Okay.

621
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,246
She's kept down the juice

622
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,148
and she doesn't have
any abdominal pain.

623
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,283
So she'll be fine at home.

624
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,151
Just give her some
fluids and come back

625
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,004
for vomiting or fever.

626
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:34,006
Thank you, Dr. Finch.
And you too, Yosh.

627
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,273
Oh, you're welcome.

628
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:38,877
She's been a completely
fascinating patient.

629
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,979
Muffin, muffin,
we're going home.

630
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,182
You wanna thank the
nice doctor and nurse? No!

631
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:46,268
Okay. All right. Hold my hand.

632
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,237
I don't wanna hold your
hand! Thanks again.

633
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,440
Wait! Robin! No, no,
no! Don't go outside!

634
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:55,477
Okay, Mr. Raybush. Here
we are. Back, safe and sound.

635
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,811
How was the CT?

636
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,281
Ugh, like someone scrambled
his brain with an eggbeater.

637
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,116
Is it a subdural?
Wanna take a look?

638
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,985
No. Mostly diffuse
swelling, microhemorrhages.

639
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,154
Nothing we could fix. Have
you seen Dr. Lawrence?

640
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,956
I think he's in the lounge.

641
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,324
All right, hyperventilate him.

642
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,543
Call Neurosurgery.
Get an ICP monitor.

643
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,478
Then I'll check and
see what else is in.

644
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:14,846
Track down his family.

645
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,765
He's wearing a ring.
He must have a wife.

646
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,267
Well, shouldn't a nurse do that?

647
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,211
Only if you fail.

648
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,238
Elaine?

649
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,791
John.

650
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:40,739
How are you feeling?

651
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:42,140
Lighter.

652
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,466
Sorry. That's a stupid joke.

653
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,870
May I sit down?

654
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:51,538
Yeah.

655
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,888
I tried calling you.

656
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,190
Dr. Corday said
the tests are clear.

657
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:02,009
My cancer hasn't spread.

658
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,512
That's... That's great news.

659
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,481
Yeah, that's what
everybody says.

660
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,665
But you don't feel that way?

661
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,436
I don't know what I feel.

662
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,640
Well, I think that's...
probably normal.

663
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:18,243
I think most people
probably... John.

664
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,845
Sorry.

665
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:22,319
I'll spare you the platitudes.

666
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,769
You waiting for Dr. Corday?

667
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:31,673
Yeah, I'm, uh... early, heh.

668
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,431
Well, maybe we
can get together later.

669
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,697
Go for a walk,
get a drink or talk.

670
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:40,799
Talk?

671
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,534
About anything other
than your surgery

672
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,002
and my miserable
life as an ER resident.

673
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:46,605
And what would that leave?

674
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,390
Sports.

675
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:52,193
Or music, or art, or Y2K thing.

676
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,029
Oh, yeah. The Y2K thing.

677
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,898
Yeah, I'm grasping
at straws here.

678
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,819
Yeah, I... see that.

679
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,626
But I'm not giving up.

680
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:17,790
Well... I guess I'm...
probably free at 7.

681
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,390
Mrs. Raybush, the
parachute accident

682
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,093
was extremely
serious, and he's...

683
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,217
H-he's in a coma.

684
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,633
I think you need to get
here as soon as you can.

685
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,268
You're in Dallas.

686
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,437
Dallas. Right, um, of
course. Three-hour flight.

687
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,805
Uh, I need to be
honest with you.

688
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,107
There's a good chance he won't

689
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,374
be able to hold out that long.

690
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,999
I'm very sorry.

691
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,002
Excuse me?

692
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,150
You wanna dictate a message
and have it read to him?

693
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,788
Um, I don't think I... Do it.

694
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,424
Of course I can do
that, Mrs. Raybush.

695
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,592
Yeah, I have a pen.

696
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,127
Doc Greene, it's your dad.

697
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,495
All right.

698
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,496
Hey, Dad. What is it?

699
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,865
Okay, go ahead.

700
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:07,157
He wants a replacement cypress.
Well, that seems reasonable.

701
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,053
How much?

702
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:11,523
Well, I know it's a
100-year-old tree, but...

703
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,591
And decided to kill himself.

704
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,861
Conni, who's that
talking to Dr. Lawrence?

705
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,447
It's the father of that
kid, Tommy Stevens.

706
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,881
Listen, Dad, I gotta go.

707
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,616
Don't worry, we'll
work somethin' out.

708
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,284
Hold on here. No,
I'll call you later.

709
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,086
Yeah, I will. Bye.
I'm working two jobs

710
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,721
just to keep our
heads above water.

711
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,823
Well, that's a hell
of a lousy excuse.

712
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,025
I took extra projects.
We need money.

713
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,827
What...? What, more
than you need your son?

714
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,429
No. Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.

715
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,463
Can I be of some help?

716
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,864
Yeah, get this
guy out of my face.

717
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,233
He hasn't even
let me see my son.

718
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,868
Tommy is in a very fragile
state right now, Mr. Stevens.

719
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,770
I'm not sure that it's
good for him to see you.

720
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,273
What the hell?!
I...! I am his father!

721
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,275
What...? What, you mean,
like, for an hour a day?

722
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,511
Okay, Dr. Lawrence, just
a minute. Just a minute.

723
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,479
Mr. Stevens, yes, as a father,

724
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,947
you do have a right
to see your son.

725
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,750
Haleh, can you take Mr. Stevens
down to Curtain Area 3?

726
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,385
This way, sir.

727
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,021
What was that all about?
Shows up and expects to waltz...

728
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,322
He is the father. Yeah.

729
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,224
Somebody oughta
give this guy a talking-to!

730
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,825
Not your job. The
hell it isn't, man.

731
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,417
You don't know the details.
Yeah, I know enough!

732
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,616
<i>And, uh, what did you
say her name was?</i>

733
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,418
Viola Simpson. She
said she was glad

734
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,486
you had food experience.

735
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,488
And was she glad to
hear I was pregnant?

736
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,591
Well, glad's an overstatement,
but she didn't seem to care.

737
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,858
Your appointment's at 5:30.

738
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,260
Oh, that gives
me plenty of time.

739
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,061
I can pick up the rest
of my stuff at Magoo's

740
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:26,864
and still get home
and... And change.

741
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:28,032
Thanks, Mrs. Hathaway.

742
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:30,034
Oh, it's Carol. And
you're welcome.

743
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,569
Let me know how it goes. Okay.

744
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:33,704
Hey, and stay
off the cigarettes.

745
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,390
Scout's honor.

746
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,709
No. Not a retraction really,

747
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:40,628
just simply the other
side of the story.

748
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,064
Yeah. Well, think about it.

749
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,432
Elizabeth, you wanted to talk?

750
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,566
Please.

751
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,368
Yes, thank you.

752
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,570
Um, if it's not a bad time.

753
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,639
No, not if you don't
mind my scrubbing.

754
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:52,943
Not at all.

755
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,048
Has this mirror
always been there?

756
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,151
I believe it is a recent
Rocket addition.

757
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,753
Whatever for?

758
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,755
One can only imagine.

759
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,457
God, I hate these caps.

760
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,109
I look like a Yorkshire pudding.

761
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,543
Elizabeth?

762
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:13,645
Yes...

763
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,547
Um, I did need to
talk to you, Donald.

764
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:18,433
I'm sorry to even
have to mention it.

765
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,201
Don't apologize.

766
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,686
Someone has to
do the devil's work.

767
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,555
Well, I'm relieved
you see it that way.

768
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,191
And it is not easy
managing colleagues.

769
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,792
Yeah, I'm beginning
to realize that.

770
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:29,244
When I was doing my rotten job,

771
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,163
much of which you've
recently taken on,

772
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,366
I always tried to get
to the core of the issue.

773
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,005
Right.

774
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,886
Ask yourself this:

775
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,927
Do you believe Peter
Benton is a good surgeon?

776
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:43,858
Peter Benton? Mm-hm.

777
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,844
Yes, of course, he's
an excellent surgeon.

778
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,278
Ah, even better.

779
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:48,362
Now ask yourself this:

780
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,064
Should County have
excellent surgeons

781
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,432
working on its staff?

782
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,851
Absolutely.

783
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,804
Then don't you think
we should all want Peter

784
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,228
to practice surgery
whenever he can?

785
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,010
Yes.

786
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,078
I... I do, actually.

787
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,019
Um, I don't agree
with Dr. Romano.

788
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,785
Now, one thing to keep in
mind in your new position:

789
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,588
If you don't agree
with the dirty work,

790
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,623
don't do it.

791
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:25,316
Hey, Malooch. I've got a
gnarly split kneecap in Exam 2.

792
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,517
Ah, you're teasin' me.

793
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,720
No, it's a disgusting
mess. Your kind of case.

794
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,088
I'm sorry, but I got a
little readin' to catch up on.

795
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:32,412
Sure you do.

796
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,029
What happened?

797
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:40,030
He coded.

798
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:41,332
Dr. Benton called it.

799
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:43,151
Wait, you called it?
Wh...? BENTON: Yeah.

800
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,775
That's usually what I
do when a patient dies.

801
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,958
Oh, man.

802
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:53,361
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

803
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,662
This a 4-year-old?

804
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,931
Back from this morning.
- I remember.

805
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,499
- I - couldn't wake her up.

806
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,600
Finch said she'd be okay.

807
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,002
Found her in V-fib,

808
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,004
unresponsive to
defibrillation times three.

809
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,706
- Epi and lidocaine.
- Get Cleo.

810
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,607
She's been down
at least 30 minutes.

811
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,209
Do something!

812
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,878
We will, Mrs. Bourke,
everything we can. Here we go.

813
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,816
On my count. One,
two, three. Gently.

814
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,017
What happened?

815
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,519
Cardiac arrest at home.

816
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,753
Any problems this morning?

817
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:21,088
Thought it was gastroenteritis.
Hold compressions.

818
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,891
- Check rhythm.
- Still in V-fib.

819
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,193
Paddles. Charge to 30.
Is she gonna be all right?

820
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,377
Clear! WOMAN: Clear.

821
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,980
Oh, my God!

822
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:31,316
Procainamide, 17 per kilo.

823
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,050
Could she have
ingested anything?

824
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,553
Just the Chinese food. I
already told Dr. Finch that.

825
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:38,073
What about drugs,
antidepressants, insecticides?

826
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:39,207
No.

827
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,891
Gasoline, cleaning
fluids, bleach...

828
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,577
Cleo, are you running this?

829
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,245
Yes. Charge to 50.
Think, Mrs. Bourke.

830
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,714
We need to know.
Uh, iron tablets,

831
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,483
detergents...? No.
Uh, we keep vitamins

832
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,068
on the kitchen table.

833
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,836
Vitamins with iron? Yes.

834
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,838
It's iron poisoning. Clear!

835
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:55,540
- Clear. MRS.
- Oh, God!

836
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:56,741
She's asystole.

837
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:58,593
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

838
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,332
High-dose epi!

839
00:32:05,574 --> 00:32:06,935
Conni, move her out.

840
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,270
No, no, no. I want to stay.
- Come on.

841
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,443
I want to stay.

842
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:12,690
Oh, my God.

843
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:14,091
I want to stay!

844
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,427
No, I want to... Please.

845
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,685
It's all right. It's all right.

846
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:30,041
Dr. Finch, you want atropine?

847
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:32,566
Do you want atropine, Dr. Finch?

848
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,522
No.

849
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:52,246
We got a case number
from the coroner's office.

850
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,014
Why don't you see if
you can you track down

851
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,738
the family pediatrician?

852
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:03,129
The nurses can do that.

853
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:06,799
I wanna do it. Ahem.

854
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,549
I'm sorry.

855
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,335
You know there'll
be an M and M, and...

856
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,937
there could be
medical legal issues.

857
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,505
Do you mind if I
look over your notes?

858
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,978
Chart's on the counter.

859
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,590
Now, what was your
discharge impression?

860
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,898
Food poisoning.

861
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,184
Or a mild case
of gastroenteritis.

862
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,319
Okay, did you ask
about household poisons?

863
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,055
Mom said the house
was childproofed.

864
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,056
Prescription meds?

865
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,191
Out of reach.

866
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,495
Did you ask about iron?

867
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,410
No.

868
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,754
I'm not sure I
would have either.

869
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:46,000
Okay, the chart looks good.

870
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,119
Everything you did was
within standard of care.

871
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:50,583
Risk Management
won't have a problem.

872
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,112
Is that it?

873
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,844
Cleo, you saw the child

874
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,547
in the second phase
of the overdose.

875
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,716
But she looked and
felt completely normal.

876
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,269
You did exactly what any
one of us would have done.

877
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,554
I should have asked.
Iron is on the differential.

878
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,945
So are 200 other
things. I should've asked.

879
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,294
You did everything you could.

880
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,197
No, I didn't. She's dead.

881
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,832
Malucci, did you
call Public Health

882
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,034
about that bat bite? Huh?

883
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,237
The guy in Exam 3, he's
gonna need a rabies series.

884
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,622
He died on me.

885
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,708
Yeah, the parachute guy.

886
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,794
Suffered massive head injuries.
Didn't stand much of a chance.

887
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,764
I wrote down everything his
wife wanted to tell him on this box.

888
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:35,216
But he died before I had
a chance to read it to him.

889
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,652
You took the message
more for her than for him.

890
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,654
Yeah, I guess.
It just feels weird

891
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,390
throwing it away now. Mmm.

892
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,760
She said some
really nice things.

893
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,095
Private things.

894
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,097
I've got a bad nosebleed.
Can someone take him?

895
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:50,181
If we had any beds.

896
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,717
Hey, why is that
rhinitis still in Four?

897
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:54,585
I don't know. Ask Dr. Lawrence.

898
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:56,890
Here, let me. I think
I know where he is.

899
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:03,945
I used to work all the time.

900
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:07,481
Hell, I even volunteered
for the shift at Christmas.

901
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,050
Didn't mean I
didn't love my kids.

902
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,184
Dads are like that.

903
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,457
How you feelin', Tommy?

904
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,838
Okay.

905
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,507
His blood gas is
back. Good PO-2.

906
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,075
Good. Thanks.

907
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:21,078
Tommy's father had to leave.

908
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,430
Back to work.

909
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,203
There was a problem at the site.

910
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,852
Were you able to
talk to Dr. DeRaad?

911
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,220
The shrink?

912
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:31,422
I know it's hard talking to
somebody you don't know.

913
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:34,025
But they're here to... You
know, they're here to listen.

914
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,559
I'm not crazy.

915
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,145
I didn't say that.

916
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:41,015
I just... I know
you think it's stupid.

917
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,283
But I love her.

918
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,819
I mean, I really love her.

919
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,404
Who? Your girlfriend?

920
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:50,291
And she loved me. And
then suddenly she didn't.

921
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:54,495
How can somebody love you
that much and then just stop?

922
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,047
When did she
tell you about this?

923
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,537
I didn't believe her
until this morning.

924
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,845
Lizzie. You talk to Anspaugh?

925
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,980
Yes. And how'd he take it?

926
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,749
He didn't. I didn't
discuss it with him.

927
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,151
What, you didn't get
around to it or what?

928
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,919
I hope when you
offered me this position,

929
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,888
you did it because,
my surgical skills aside,

930
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,156
you trust my judgment.

931
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,091
Naturally. Now, if
I'm here to protect

932
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,693
your interest, then
I have to tell you

933
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,295
it's in your best interest to
keep Donald Anspaugh happy.

934
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,832
Not only is he a great
asset to the surgical staff

935
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:34,168
and to you, but he's also
on special consideration.

936
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,169
Now, if this interferes

937
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,738
with your tennis
lessons in anyway,

938
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,139
then I'm sorry... I
don't play tennis.

939
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,810
Well, whatever. The point is, if
you want to push Donald out...

940
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,278
You'll have to
do it by yourself.

941
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,047
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who
said anything about pushing him out?

942
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,522
Well, I assume this
is just the first step.

943
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,004
Lizzie, when you "assume,"

944
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,428
you make an "ass"
of "u" and "me."

945
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,759
What? Whatever.

946
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,112
Look, I... I just
wanted Fridays off.

947
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,947
I thought you
could talk to Donald,

948
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,199
but if you're
uncomfortable, I understand.

949
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,767
Oh.

950
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,768
Okay?

951
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,112
Yeah, that's all right. Mm-hm?

952
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,277
You're feeding it wrong.

953
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,278
What?

954
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,846
Try folding it longways.

955
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:23,151
And then flip up the
corners, and fold it flat.

956
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:26,421
Or you can just tell me
to mind my own business.

957
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,422
Go ahead.

958
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,157
No, I'm kidding.

959
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:31,559
I use quarters myself.
What do you want?

960
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,327
Uh, Coke.

961
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:37,098
Caffeine, the ER
doc's best friend.

962
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,233
Tommy went up to Medicine.

963
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,536
DeRaad put him on a hold.

964
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,837
You don't have to fill me in.

965
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,174
I jumped to
conclusions about Dad.

966
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:47,442
I wan... I wanted to help.

967
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,777
Wanna sit down?
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

968
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,447
Well, kid's in trouble.

969
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:55,583
You know, you go
to the parents first.

970
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,885
Dad was still an ass
for going back to work.

971
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,037
Yeah.

972
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,906
You have a family?

973
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,874
A daughter.

974
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:05,515
Are you divorced?

975
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:10,180
Get to see her a lot?

976
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,904
She lives in St. Louis.

977
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:15,553
You know, when I was...

978
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,309
When I was about your age...

979
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,425
my son was brought into the ER.

980
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:24,362
He'd... He'd, uh...
He'd fallen out of a tree.

981
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:28,204
They patched him up,
you know, good as new.

982
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:31,602
And it wasn't
till later I realized

983
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,786
he had jumped out of the tree.

984
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:36,896
He wanted to come see me.

985
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,462
- But that was then...
- Dr. Lawrence?

986
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,530
A Mr. Henderson is
on his way to the O.R.

987
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,099
I just need you
to cosign his chart.

988
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,051
I can do that.
Thanks for the Coke.

989
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,419
You bet.

990
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:49,804
Did you check a second crit?

991
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,807
Thirty-eight, um, and
the EKG was normal.

992
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,741
I reviewed the
films with Radiology.

993
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,761
And you were right.
Comminuted tib-fib.

994
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:59,730
Nondisplaced calcaneal fracture.
And the cystogram was normal.

995
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,449
Cystogram? Why'd
you get a cystogram?

996
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:04,819
You ordered it when the
urine tested positive for blood.

997
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,487
He had microscopic hematuria.

998
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,506
I ordered an IVP.

999
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,824
No, you said cystogram.

1000
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,025
I wouldn't order a cystogram

1001
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,860
for 30 red cells. You did.

1002
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,246
Lucy, I've been
treating trauma patients

1003
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,264
for 30 years.

1004
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:18,299
I think I know what I ordered.

1005
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,284
Get an IVP before he goes up.

1006
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:21,536
He's already on his way.

1007
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,637
Then catch him and
get him into Radiology.

1008
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,145
He's not going to
surgery without an IVP.

1009
00:39:31,753 --> 00:39:33,897
Sutured the scalp lac
in One. I'm outta here.

1010
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,266
Did you sign out your patients?

1011
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,590
Yep. Oh, hold on. Forgot this.

1012
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:45,560
Hey, Dad. It's Mark.

1013
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:49,330
No, nothin'. I was just
callin' to see how you're doin'.

1014
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,464
I'm sure it's a mistake.

1015
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,099
See you, Mark.

1016
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,334
You takin' off?

1017
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,869
Yeah, I gotta go
home, soak my feet,

1018
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,638
and the rest of my body.
- Carol?

1019
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:59,473
Meg, how did it go?

1020
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,375
I screwed up. What happened?

1021
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,443
I missed the interview.

1022
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,212
I... I thought you said
6:30, but it was 5:30.

1023
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,648
And I... I blew it.

1024
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,217
Well, it's not true.

1025
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,985
I... I couldn't go
through with it.

1026
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,709
Why not?

1027
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:18,825
No one wants to hire
a pregnant woman.

1028
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:19,927
And I can't blame them.

1029
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,596
I mean, why should
I waste their time?

1030
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,366
It's not like I'm not gonna
quit in a month, anyway.

1031
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,000
Meg, stop.

1032
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,071
We're gonna go there together
and work something out, okay?

1033
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,939
Okay. WEAVER: Coming through!

1034
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,208
Ben Sessa. Six years old.
Two-day history of fever...

1035
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,544
Carter, I need your
help! I'm off in 15 minutes.

1036
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:37,545
I got it. Thank you.

1037
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,413
Pulse 140. BP 60.

1038
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,115
What is it? MAN:
Couldn't get an IV.

1039
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,983
Cleo, you don't
have... What is it?

1040
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:43,984
Altered with fever.

1041
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,053
Could be sepsis,
maybe meningitis.

1042
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,623
On my count:
One, two, three, lift.

1043
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,381
CBC, blood cultures, chem panel.

1044
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,796
Okay, let's get
a line in this kid.

1045
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,598
He's dry as a bone.
Let's get a fluid bolus.

1046
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,433
No response to painful stimuli.

1047
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,218
He's got no veins.
I can't get a draw.

1048
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,886
Call Surgery for a cutdown.

1049
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,287
I'll try a central line.

1050
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:06,857
That's gonna be tough. His
veins are completely collapsed.

1051
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,275
Prep the ankle.
If I don't get it,

1052
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,609
Surgery can do the cutdown.

1053
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,412
Systolic's down
to 50. Pulse 145.

1054
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,897
Okay, do it.

1055
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,098
Cutdown tray now.

1056
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:15,516
Spike two liters of saline,

1057
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,835
one at the ankle
and one at the head.

1058
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:19,086
Pulse ox 92.

1059
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,354
Got it. Here's your blood.

1060
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,689
Get a crit. Get an Accu-Chek.

1061
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,190
Stand by with
saline. I want a bolus

1062
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,659
of 20 per kilo, about 400 cc's.

1063
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,995
Run in a gram of
ceftriaxone and cath a urine.

1064
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,263
I'm in. Let's go.

1065
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,732
Dr. Weaver, I have
Robin Bourke's

1066
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,255
pediatrician on Line 2.

1067
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:35,836
Cleo, you got this?

1068
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,705
Yeah, I got this.

1069
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,206
Send up a UA and
culture after that.

1070
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,675
I'll do an LP.

1071
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,342
Carter, do you have a second?

1072
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,577
Not really.

1073
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,579
Did you hear Dr. Lawrence
order that cystogram

1074
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,114
for Mr. Henderson? No.

1075
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,382
Did he have gross hematuria?

1076
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,450
No, just microscopic.
Then you don't need one.

1077
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,352
That's what I thought.
He told me to order it.

1078
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,722
You must have heard
wrong. No, he said cystogram.

1079
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,490
Dr. Lawrence wouldn't
order a cystogram

1080
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,325
for microscopic
hematuria. Right.

1081
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,459
It seemed strange to me,

1082
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,128
but I figured he knew
what he was doing.

1083
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,362
He does know what he's doing.

1084
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,286
You ordered the wrong
test. See you tomorrow.

1085
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,581
"I love you, Larry.
The girls love you.

1086
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,666
"You have been the best
husband, the best father,

1087
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,651
"the love of our lives,
the light of our lives,

1088
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,769
"our true north.

1089
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,143
"You could never leave us...

1090
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,308
"because you'll be
with us and in us.

1091
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,731
We'll love you always."

1092
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,150
So, what did you tell him?

1093
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:41,819
That I spoke to the adjuster,

1094
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:45,623
and they agreed to
accept the late payment.

1095
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,626
Except they cancel
his policy. Ahem, right.

1096
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,360
So who pays for
the cypress tree?

1097
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,830
You're lookin' at him.

1098
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,766
The dutiful son.

1099
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,301
Yeah, well, duty
comes at a price.

1100
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,937
You're gonna have
to buy me dinner.

1101
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:00,971
Whatever you want.

1102
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,239
Oh, good. 'Cause I'm hungry.

1103
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:03,807
What have you got there?

1104
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,927
What have you
got? Mark! What is it?

1105
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,429
Quit grabbing! Quit grabbing.

1106
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:09,463
I'm gonna grab.

1107
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,499
All right, I got it
framed for your office.

1108
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,000
You've just lost dinner, mister.

1109
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,001
What?

1110
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,202
Hey, Dr. Lawrence.

1111
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,576
Oh, please, it's Gabe.

1112
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,457
You off? Almost.

1113
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:22,459
Uh, we're getting a bite
to eat. Care to join us?

1114
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:23,827
No, thanks, I still have some...

1115
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,362
You know, some dictations and...

1116
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:27,731
Well, we're just going across
the street to Doc Magoo's

1117
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:30,000
if you change your
mind. Right. Thanks.

1118
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,024
Have a good night.
Yeah, you too. Good night.

1119
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,406
It's not everybody
who gets to be

1120
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,276
on the front page
of the newspaper.
