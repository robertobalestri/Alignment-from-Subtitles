1
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,987
<i>You can't be serious.</i>
GREENE:<i> Why not?</i>

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,055
<i>Barbecuing in January?</i>

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,723
Yeah, you just
freeze your butt off

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,125
for, like, 10, 15 minutes.

5
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,528
No, you freeze your butt
off for 10 or 15 minutes.

6
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,163
Is this a San Diego ritual?

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,565
Dad and I did barbecue a
couple of times last week.

8
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,666
Well, I'm game if you are.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,767
Let's stop by after work.

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,768
Pick up some steaks.

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,072
Sounds good.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,373
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

13
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:32,775
You're, uh...? Uh, Andrew.

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,477
And you'd be Doctors
Greene and Corday?

15
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,079
Yeah. Messages for both of you.

16
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,047
The first of which is
that I'm looking for you.

17
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,816
Actually, the first
one for Dr. Greene...

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,817
What's your name again?

19
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,018
Andrew. Andy, yeah.

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,920
I think you might wanna
answer those phones.

21
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,187
Thank you. Yeah, good kid.

22
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,189
Few more years of
training, and he might cut it.

23
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,324
What do you need, Robert?

24
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,059
We have a new ER
resident starting today

25
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,228
named Jing-Mei
Chen or Sling-My...

26
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,697
Uh, anyway, uh, I need
you to say howdy-doody.

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,832
Starting in January?

28
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,900
Apparently, her program
in New York fell apart,

29
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,802
and, uh, she's got a
daddy with deep pockets.

30
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,771
Sounds like deep
donation to County General.

31
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,339
Let's keep that
amongst ourselves.

32
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,074
You got a minute? Sure.

33
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,110
Uh, that message I
wanted to give you earlier.

34
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,646
Your father's disappeared
from his retirement home.

35
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,847
What?

36
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,782
I'm sensing it's more
of a runaway thing.

37
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,784
I don't believe they're
suspecting foul play.

38
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:15,952
I feel better already.

39
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,238
What's open? Oh,
uh, uh, Curtain 2.

40
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:20,005
And now another
case has come up.

41
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,826
A girl, Jenny Cordova,
missing about six weeks ago.

42
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,728
We found her car abandoned.
Dean Rollins' prints were on it.

43
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,081
You haven't found
the body yet? No.

44
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,450
And you want me to
ask him where it is?

45
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:31,835
Yes.

46
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,969
For better or worse,

47
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,776
you've developed a
relationship with him.

48
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:39,292
You talked him into telling
you where the other body was.

49
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,728
You talked him
into having surgery.

50
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,072
This family needs your help.

51
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,516
He's a cold-blooded
son of a bitch.

52
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,260
I don't think he'll tell me.

53
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,604
I'll ask.

54
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,857
But I can tell you
now, it's hopeless.

55
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,524
The Cordovas don't
have any option,

56
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,988
so hopeless is
better than nothing.

57
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,114
Five of Haldol?
I just itch, okay.

58
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,916
Cassandra, ma'am.
Can you do something?

59
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,618
Are you taking any medications?

60
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:06,352
Have you seen a dermatologist?

61
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,621
Whoa. Security!

62
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:09,055
Stop, stop, stop.

63
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,056
We need security!

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,691
Oh, come on, now.

65
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,692
Get her off!

66
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,661
All right, that's enough.

67
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:15,685
John?

68
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,666
Oh, my God.

69
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,717
Deb.

70
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,469
Yeah, it's me.

71
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,338
I'm surprised to
see you down here.

72
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,440
Thought you'd get a
surgical residency for sure.

73
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,541
I did. I gave it up.

74
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,042
Deb Chen? You're
the new resident?

75
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,344
Oh, that's right, Dr. Greene.

76
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,578
Oh, but it's Jing-Mei now.

77
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,580
Actually, it always
was. Right. Sorry.

78
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,183
Carter, listen, I might have to
fly to San Diego this morning,

79
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,551
so if you could show, uh, Deb...

80
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,652
Jing-Mei. Jing-Mei

81
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,454
the, uh, ropes, okay? Sure.

82
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,789
Hey, is everything okay?

83
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,890
My father's barricaded
himself in our old house.

84
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,058
No heat, no electricity.

85
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,727
He's running around
in his underwear,

86
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,429
so actually,
everything isn't okay,

87
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,164
but thanks for askin'. Yeah.

88
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,766
Yeah, I'm actually
pretty surprised

89
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,767
to see you around here.

90
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,869
I, uh, thought you
dropped out of after...

91
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,137
I almost killed that patient

92
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,706
by leaving a guide
wire in his chest?

93
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,474
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to bring that up.

94
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,743
Oh, yes, you did,
John, but that's okay.

95
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,278
And let's face it. It
was kind of a low point,

96
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,980
but it did force me
to face the truth.

97
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,349
I was being way too aggressive,

98
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,517
way too competitive, too
much of an overachiever,

99
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,319
always trying to
show people up. Well...

100
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,621
And way too successful at it.

101
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,789
I'd left the patient
out of the picture.

102
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,425
Oh, it looks like your wrestling
partner tired herself out.

103
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,627
Hi, I'm Yosh Takata.

104
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,062
Hi, Jing-Mei Chen.

105
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,480
Much better with the Haldol.

106
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,047
This is Cassandra
Harper. Gloves?

107
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,783
She came in extremely agitated

108
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,034
With intense pruritus.

109
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,320
Called for a psych consult.

110
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,654
Dr. Myers'll be down shortly.

111
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,722
Do you think it's a
psychiatric disorder?

112
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:24,990
I do, yes.

113
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,425
Either severe OCD,

114
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,411
or a body dysmorphic disorder.

115
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,280
Yes, but, um, did you see these?

116
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,314
What?

117
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,716
Burrows, papules.

118
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,586
I think there's a good
chance it's lindane toxicity.

119
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,627
She's got body lice.

120
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,591
Classic symptoms.

121
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,860
Applied lindane for the
lice, scratched herself,

122
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,696
and the lindane
entered her bloodstream,

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,632
thereby causing her
altered mental status.

124
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,851
But I guess we should
wait for doctor, uh...

125
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,603
Myers. I'll give him a call.

126
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,911
Right.

127
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:57,991
Uh, taxi'll be here

128
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,325
in five minutes, Dr. Greene.

129
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,294
Sorry about no barbecue.

130
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:03,562
Don't be ridiculous. I'm
worried about your father.

131
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:06,099
Should be worried. I may
have to kill him for pullin' this.

132
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,468
You know how hard it
was to get him in there?

133
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,370
Yes, I believe you have
shared that with me.

134
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,537
Wish you were coming.

135
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,905
Yeah, so do I.

136
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,807
I'm off to see
Dean Rollins next.

137
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,309
I'll be glad when
you're rid of him.

138
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,443
Makes two of us.

139
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,078
Hey, call me when you get there.

140
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,614
I will. Okay.

141
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:22,932
Oh, Andrew!

142
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,684
Yeah.

143
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,736
Uh, can you give
that to Yosh Takata?

144
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,555
Dr. Weaver'll be
here any minute,

145
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,441
and, uh, in the meantime,
you're in charge.

146
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,059
What if there's an emergency?

147
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,682
Call a doctor.

148
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,366
There's one!

149
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,734
We need a doctor. Wh...? Wait...

150
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,952
Wh...? What's the problem?

151
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,371
Smile. GIRL: We're
on a scavenger hunt.

152
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,939
We have to find a
doctor a policeman,

153
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,640
a bridegroom and a polar bear.

154
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,243
Thanks. Bye.

155
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,496
Mr. And Mrs. Sumpter,
this is Dr. Chen. Hi.

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,499
Mr. Sumpter slipped on
his roof a couple weeks ago.

157
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,751
No big deal at the
time, but the pain

158
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,752
kept getting worse?

159
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,753
That right.

160
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,388
It's the last day or so.

161
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:05,275
Well, it could be a torn
meniscus or an ACL.

162
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,976
I actually already
told them that, Deb,

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,977
but thank you.

164
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:08,978
An 18-gauge needle

165
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,763
and a 50 cc syringe, please.

166
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,182
You sure? Won't that hurt?

167
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,449
Oh, it should be fine.

168
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,068
Dr. Carter's gonna
insert the needle

169
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,936
into the joint and
aspirate the blood,

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,139
which should relieve the
pain almost immediately.

171
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,529
Here we go.

172
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,214
That is gross.

173
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:31,951
Definitely bacterial. Hm.

174
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,052
Looks like you picked up

175
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,004
a bit of a staph
infection after your fall.

176
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,506
As soon as we get the results,

177
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,107
we'll start you on
some antibiotics,

178
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,459
and you'll be better in no time.

179
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,793
Thank you. Thank you.

180
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,794
You're very welcome.

181
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,929
Yeah, we'll be back.

182
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:44,597
Dr. Carter, Dr. Chen?

183
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,716
Yosh mentioned lindane toxicity?

184
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,686
Oh, just a crazy guess.
Hi, I'm Jing-Mei Chen.

185
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,721
Pretty good crazy
guess. Good pickup.

186
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,155
Paul Myers, Psychiatry.

187
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,659
Thanks for thinki"
of us, Carter.

188
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,723
Feels good to be back.

189
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,297
Need a trauma surgeon?

190
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,199
Uh, no, just a fender
bender. I can handle it.

191
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,168
The patient doesn't
meet trauma criteria.

192
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,654
Well, I'm here. Might
as well have a look.

193
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:08,988
And lift.

194
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,657
What's your name? Tamara Davis.

195
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,876
All right, let's
take a look here.

196
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,212
Pupils are equal and reactive.

197
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,214
Do you know where
you are? The hospital.

198
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,500
I have a basketball
game tonight. Can I play?

199
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,334
Let's finish the exam first.

200
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,803
Now, how did the
accident happen?

201
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:25,605
I was driving and the
next thing I remember

202
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,006
is being put into the ambulance.

203
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,642
Ouch! Point tenderness
at the snuff box.

204
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,561
My shooting hand.
We'll need to get

205
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,728
some x-rays of your wrist.

206
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,931
Make sure you do a
cone-down of the navicular.

207
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,065
Thanks, Peter.

208
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,209
What would I do without you?

209
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,321
Oh, hey, John, Gram stain's back

210
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,756
on that knee
patient, Mr. Sumpter.

211
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,924
Is it staph?

212
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,693
In his dreams. Try gonorrhea.

213
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,496
Ouch. More like his nightmare.

214
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,331
You gonna tell them?

215
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,966
I'll tell him.

216
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,168
Legally, we can't tell her
without his permission.

217
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,670
Hopefully he'll
tell her himself.

218
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,172
Yeah, but we still
have to report it

219
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,272
to Public Health, right?

220
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:01,758
They can follow
up, tell the wife.

221
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,792
Kind of doubt it.

222
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,093
Between syphilis and HIV,

223
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,595
they kind of have
their hands full.

224
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,680
Yeah, what if Sumpter
doesn't tell his wife?

225
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,703
Then he doesn't tell his wife.

226
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,652
Good morning.

227
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,687
You lied to me.

228
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,539
You turned my life into pain.

229
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,875
I didn't lie to you, and I'm
sorry for how you're feeling,

230
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,144
but you fractured your pelvis

231
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:40,330
you tore up the nerves
and arteries in your leg,

232
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,832
and it's going to be
a long recuperation.

233
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,083
Give me something.

234
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,286
Give him 10 of morphine. Ten?

235
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,488
Dean, I want to talk to you.

236
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:51,841
Ten is a joke for what I got.

237
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,149
What are you trying to do to me?

238
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,430
Believe it or not,
I'm trying to help you.

239
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,649
Well, I don't believe it,

240
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,403
and I want you outta here.

241
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:05,176
Get her outta here!

242
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,274
You're fired.

243
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,738
I want a new doctor.

244
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,834
Get out.

245
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,204
Excuse me, is there a pay phone?

246
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,538
Andrew.

247
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,240
Pay phone? Uh, yeah.

248
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,808
Uh, pay phone.

249
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,211
Pay phone is, uh...
Over by Chairs.

250
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,179
Okay, I know he's
Andrew, but who are you?

251
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,815
Oh, Jing-Mei Chen, new
resident starting today.

252
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,217
Hey. Dr. Dave Malucci.

253
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,218
Did you say today?

254
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,220
I'm Kerry Weaver,
chief of the ER.

255
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,755
And why are you
starting in January?

256
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,191
Um, could I speak to you alone?

257
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,327
Of course.

258
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,928
Now, as chief, I
think you should know

259
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,663
my father bought my
way into the program

260
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,531
by giving County a
huge amount of money.

261
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,433
I'm not proud of
it, but I am grateful.

262
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,870
I'm not a bad doctor,
but, uh, as a med student,

263
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,438
I did almost kill a
patient in this very ER.

264
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,439
I'm more competent now,

265
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,141
so hopefully, this
will all work out.

266
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,977
Hopefully it will.

267
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,145
Andrew, could you, uh,
dig out the yellow pages?

268
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,781
My car broke down
across the street.

269
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,916
Say no more, Dr. Weaver.

270
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,517
Automotive repair
is my middle name.

271
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,752
I'm sure you have patients.

272
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,587
No, I'm not even on yet.

273
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,922
I'm just in doin' paperwork.

274
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,291
Okay, I hope I
don't regret this.

275
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,126
Give it a shot.

276
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,995
Stopped, I couldn't
get it started again.

277
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,932
And remember, it's
broke. It's not dead.

278
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,701
Andrew, since you're
not looking up car repair,

279
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,936
could you find me the number

280
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,437
for the Public
Health Department?

281
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,928
Sure.

282
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,091
My wife went to use the phone.

283
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,260
That's okay, actually.
We don't need her for this.

284
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:38,581
Uh, Mr. Sumpter, the Gram stain
shows that you have gonorrhea.

285
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,882
What?

286
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,751
You tapped my knee.
I... I don't get this.

287
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,619
The bacteria's carried
through the blood.

288
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,254
It happened to
settle in your knee.

289
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,090
Have you had any
discharge during urination?

290
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,926
Couple weeks back. It went away.

291
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,761
Had sex with anyone
other than your wife?

292
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:52,929
What the hell's going on?

293
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:53,930
Mr. Sumpter, you have

294
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,882
a sexually transmitted disease.

295
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,484
Have you had sex with
anyone other than your wife?

296
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:01,087
Stop. Stop.

297
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,271
One time, okay?

298
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,375
Me and the guys, we were
out celebrating a new contract...

299
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,776
I don't need to
know the details,

300
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,729
but I think that you
should tell your wife.

301
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,697
Oh, man!

302
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,956
Mr. Sumpter, I would
encourage you to...

303
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,912
You son of a bitch!
You lying, conniving...

304
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,547
Come on, come
on... Mrs. Sumpter!

305
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,149
Mrs. Sumpter! Carter! Chen!

306
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:31,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

307
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,301
You know, I can walk.

308
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,936
I'm sure you can.

309
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,237
I can walk.

310
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,605
It's okay, Jake.

311
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,440
But I can walk.

312
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,009
Did you drive here by yourself?

313
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,243
Yeah.

314
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,378
I can drive. I want to learn.

315
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,014
Not right now, Jake, all right?

316
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,015
Okay, let's take a look.

317
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,839
I want you to sit here.

318
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,273
Hey, no, Jake.

319
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,777
Let him do it, all right?

320
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,379
She was not supposed
to tell the wife.

321
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:02,681
I did not tell the wife.

322
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:03,716
I held out the phone

323
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,517
so that Public Health
could tell his wife.

324
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,487
Okay! Okay, hey, nobody's
done anything wrong. All right?

325
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:09,788
Next time let's just keep it

326
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,056
from becoming a slugfest.

327
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,126
Carter, Sumpter's your
patient. Clean it up. Chen?

328
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,928
Yes. I've got a
Jane Doe in Chairs

329
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,295
with Officer Grabarsky.

330
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,519
Check it out.

331
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:22,134
Hi, I'm Jing-Mei Chen.

332
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,158
Jing what?

333
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,854
This Jane Doe?

334
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,255
Yeah, she's a probable runaway.

335
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,690
She won't give us her real name.

336
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,025
She was panhandli" under the el.

337
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,595
She got some frostbite
and a bad lac on her forearm.

338
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,613
I'm fine.

339
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,398
Hey, look, it's warm in here.

340
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,500
They feed you.
They let you sleep.

341
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,536
My advice: take the day off.

342
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,837
She's all yours.

343
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,373
Thanks. Yeah.

344
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,491
Hi, come on.

345
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,877
So you were cooking
breakfast, huh?

346
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,879
Yeah, it's no big deal.

347
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,047
I like French toast.

348
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,082
Oh, so do I, Jake,
with maple syrup.

349
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,300
I like French toast.

350
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:55,501
That what you were cooking?

351
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,036
I'm sorry, Dillon.

352
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,221
I'm sorry.

353
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,672
Jake, shut up and sit down.

354
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,340
Don't be mad. I'm sorry.

355
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,009
Jake, I'm not mad. Just shut up.

356
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,677
It's okay. He can talk.

357
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,395
Was it grease that burned you?

358
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,231
What the hell
difference does it make?

359
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,682
I mean, just put
some stuff on it,

360
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:10,983
and we'll be outta here.

361
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,686
And you were having a
kind of late breakfast, huh?

362
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,710
Yeah.

363
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,906
Did you miss school?

364
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,108
I'm 18. I'm out of school.

365
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,242
I'm sorry, Dillon.

366
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,244
What about Jake?

367
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,696
I wanted French
toast. I'm sorry!

368
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,498
I'm sorry! Shut up, Jake!

369
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,333
I'm sorry, Dillon! I'm sorry!

370
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,835
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm...

371
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,337
Jake! No, I'll get him!

372
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,671
I'll get him. Take it easy.

373
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,474
Hey, it's okay. It's
okay. He'll be fine.

374
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,781
Hey, Dave, what are you
doing, stealing Weaver's car?

375
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,282
Just takin' a look.

376
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:46,918
Couldn't get it started.

377
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,554
So, uh, Carter,

378
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:52,158
did you know this new resident,
Jing-something-or-other?

379
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:54,493
That's good, screw up her
name. That'll impress her.

380
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:56,661
I heard she was a
medical student here.

381
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:57,663
Is that right?

382
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:59,365
Yes, she was. Yes, I knew her.

383
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,251
And? And... nothin'.

384
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,418
Ah, it didn't work out, huh?

385
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,004
Dave, I did not
try and go through

386
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,005
every medical student.

387
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:08,257
Oh, yeah? Why not?

388
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,892
I'm just kiddin', my friend.

389
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,794
You want me to back
off, you just say so.

390
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:15,431
No, I think you guys
would be great together.

391
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,432
Go for it.

392
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,933
Consider it done.

393
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,869
So Jake was the
one cooking, huh?

394
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,170
I had some business to handle,

395
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,440
so I didn't get
home till like 2.

396
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,374
So I slept in.

397
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,743
Jake wanted some French toast,

398
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,278
so he started fixin' it himself.

399
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,065
Damn. Half that
kitchen caught on fire.

400
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,900
And he knows better than that.

401
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,637
Don't you, Jake?

402
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:39,638
You can talk now.

403
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,457
I'm not mad no more.

404
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,059
He hates it when he think
he's done something wrong.

405
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,499
Just goes all quiet.

406
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:47,830
Where are your parents?

407
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,164
They don't ask about us,

408
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,633
we don't ask about them.

409
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,135
Can't even remember
when Pops left.

410
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,470
Mom is on the streets.

411
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,171
We see her every now and then,

412
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,057
but we move around a lot.

413
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:01,260
Must make it hard for Social
Services to keep up with you.

414
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:02,261
They got enough to do

415
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,479
without worryi" about us.

416
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,947
Yeah, maybe they could help you.

417
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,015
Or maybe we just
keep helpin' ourselves.

418
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,118
Can you? Yeah, I
do okay, all right?

419
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,653
Jake works around the complex,

420
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,822
sweepin' up and stuff.

421
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,623
People pay him.

422
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,941
We do fine.

423
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,493
I do my job.

424
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,660
You do, man.

425
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,917
You do a good job.

426
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:26,123
We do just fine.

427
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,305
You can't force me to do this.

428
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,740
We're not forcing you.
We are helping you.

429
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,109
That's the deal. You get to
lie about your name and age.

430
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,411
But you do not get to sit around

431
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,712
in these stinky clothes.

432
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,914
Maybe I can find you
something in lost and found.

433
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,182
Thanks, Haleh.

434
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:44,286
So... Jane Doe, huh?

435
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,321
My parents weren't very clever.

436
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,441
Maybe not, but I
bet they miss you.

437
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:49,596
I wouldn't know.

438
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,428
So, Jane,

439
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,447
how did you get these
other marks on your arms?

440
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,866
I don't recall.

441
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,434
You are just a fountain
of information, aren't you?

442
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,603
Yep.

443
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,572
Dr. Chen, you have a call on 5

444
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,639
out here at the desk.

445
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,242
Uh, could you take
a message, please?

446
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,210
Uh, no, it's the
lab calling about

447
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,611
the little boy with meningitis?

448
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,749
Little boy with meningitis?
They said it was urgent.

449
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:18,421
Okay, um... I'll be
back. Don't run away.

450
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,223
Very funny.

451
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,591
Haleh, I don't know about any...

452
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,927
Wallet. Found it
in her coat pocket.

453
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,228
Name's Alyssa Adams.

454
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,152
Address and phone number.

455
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,116
We're still waiting
on your x-rays,

456
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,585
but in the meantime, we're
going to put you next door.

457
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:34,920
I can't just walk?

458
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:38,256
I'm sure you can, if it
weren't for the damn rules.

459
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,925
So where were you
drivin' this morning

460
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:41,359
when you met up with that pole?

461
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,427
Late to school.

462
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,295
I guess I fell
asleep at the wheel.

463
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,731
At 9 in the morning?

464
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,465
Pulled an all-nighter.

465
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,300
Chemistry mid-term today.

466
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:50,702
School pretty tough?

467
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,638
Sometimes.

468
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,439
Have you been feeling
depressed about it?

469
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:57,342
Wouldn't you, if you were
getting a C-in chemistry?

470
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:01,212
Depressed enough to
do somethin' about it?

471
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:04,182
You're thinking I meant to
drive into that telephone pole

472
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,717
like suicide or somethin'?

473
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,318
Did you? God, no.

474
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,188
My parents would
kill me if I ever did that.

475
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,606
Not to mention my coach.

476
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,607
Especially today.

477
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,608
That's right.

478
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,692
Basketball game tonight.

479
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:14,926
Against Union,

480
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,728
who we haven't beaten
in like three years.

481
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:18,030
Except this year they suck.

482
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,837
I used to shoot a few myself.

483
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,817
You played?

484
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,819
High school and college.

485
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,237
Although, track was my thing.

486
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,605
I do track in the spring.

487
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,374
I run the 100 and the 4-by-1.

488
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:29,408
I was more distance.

489
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,076
The 800, the two mile.

490
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,594
Oh, Tammy, there you are.

491
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,229
We were worried sick about you.

492
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,864
Sweetheart, are you okay?

493
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,182
Mom, Dad, I'm fine.

494
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,001
Mr. And Mrs.
Davis, I'm Dr. Finch.

495
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,036
Is she going to be all right?

496
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,471
Will she be able
to play tonight?

497
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,340
We're still waiting
on her wrist x-rays.

498
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,644
I'll check back.

499
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,210
I called Coach Avery,

500
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,945
and he's agreed to
keep you on the roster

501
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,079
until he hears from us.

502
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,247
I can talk to him, Dad.

503
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,716
And I'm gonna call Mr. Williams.

504
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,402
See about you taking
chemistry in summer school.

505
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,203
You paged me. Yeah, yeah, um...

506
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:02,073
Detective Cruson was unable
to persuade Rollins to talk.

507
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,575
I didn't think he'd
have much luck.

508
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,578
Perhaps you could try
again. I already tried.

509
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:07,079
Besides, he wants
another doctor.

510
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:09,615
Well, I think you should try
and talk him out of that too.

511
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,539
I don't want to ever
talk to him again.

512
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,454
The Cordovas. Yeah.

513
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,189
Mrs. Cordova's
other daughter, Jenny,

514
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:21,126
was only 19 years old.

515
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,862
This is not fair of you, Robert.

516
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,732
You and I both know I
am capable of a low blow.

517
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:30,658
However, I rarely use it
to such purity of purpose.

518
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,978
What's up? Jason Bender, 11.

519
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:40,579
Shortness of breath
during Phys. Ed.

520
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:43,065
Also complaining of mild
pain to the upper left chest.

521
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,734
I got hit yesterday
with a hockey stick.

522
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,536
I get hit all the time,
usually in the head.

523
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,304
Squeeze my hand.
That why you're trying

524
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,606
to take a car apart in the snow?

525
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,108
We'll get you fixed up
good. You call his parents?

526
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,376
Mom's on her way. All right.

527
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,544
How's that boy who
broke the light box?

528
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,913
He's okay now.

529
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,982
He lives with his
older brother, right?

530
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,116
There's no parents?

531
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,117
Right.

532
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,152
Hm, have you called DCFS?

533
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,054
I think the older
boy needs a job

534
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,622
more than he needs
Social Services.

535
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,624
Well, are either one
of them in school?

536
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,426
They've been
moving around a lot.

537
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,560
Yeah.

538
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,330
Look, I mean, we see
a lot of kids like this.

539
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,132
It's rough, but if they
get an education,

540
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,134
they have some kind
of chance at a future.

541
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,904
Call DCFS, see if you
can get 'em some help?

542
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,171
Sure.

543
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,439
Mrs. Adams?

544
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,209
Yes, hi, this is Dr. Chen
from County General.

545
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,044
I'm calling about
your daughter, Alyssa.

546
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,913
Uh, Dr. Weaver,
there's a phone call

547
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,281
for a Carol Hathaway?

548
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,383
Yeah, she's on maternity
leave for another week.

549
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,418
Take a message.

550
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,842
Are you a doctor?
We need a doctor.

551
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:43,959
Yes.

552
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,860
E-excellent. Can
we take your picture?

553
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:46,884
Yes.

554
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:49,931
Thanks. Thanks, man.

555
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,469
Your fingerprints were
found all over her car.

556
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:56,105
They want to know
where the body is.

557
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,772
You know, sometimes I feel

558
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,360
everyone just wants
a little piece of me.

559
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:04,229
Will you tell them?

560
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:08,534
No, I don't recall this girl.

561
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,836
What is the point, Dean?

562
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,638
You've already been
charged with murder.

563
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,122
Why cause more needless grief?

564
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,126
Needless grief
is what I do best.

565
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,566
Oh, fine, then.

566
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,532
W-wait! Wait! Wait! I...

567
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,967
Look, I don't know...

568
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,908
If I talk, will you
still be my doctor?

569
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,978
Yes. Then I will, but...

570
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,147
only to the sister.

571
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:41,716
Well, I don't think
they'll allow that.

572
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,352
Why don't you just tell me?

573
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,354
Mm-mmm. I wanna do it.

574
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,212
But I don't wanna have
to look at the mother.

575
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,911
Take a deep breath.

576
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,313
Okay, let it out.

577
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,782
How long you been
short of breath?

578
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:58,850
Couple of days. Yeah.

579
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:00,118
Any fever?

580
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,120
Well, he had a mild
temperature a few days ago.

581
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:03,388
I thought it was just a cold.

582
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,657
Mm, and have you
been tired lately?

583
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,126
Yeah, I get up at 5 every
morning for hockey practice.

584
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,661
Okay, lie back down.

585
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,097
Jason has a consolidation
in his left lung.

586
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,098
And what does that mean?

587
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:14,399
Ah, he probably has pneumonia,

588
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:16,334
which would account
for the chest pain

589
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,368
Is that bad?

590
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,037
We call it "walkin' pneumonia."

591
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,438
Because you're such a tough guy,

592
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,340
it doesn't stop you
from playin' hockey.

593
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,643
Low voltage,
otherwise normal EKG.

594
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,612
This machine's total bull.

595
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,680
You know, why don't we,
uh, find another one, uh,

596
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,082
and run it again? Sure.

597
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,950
In the meantime, I'm
gonna get a chest x-ray

598
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:33,685
and start Jason on antibiotics.

599
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,687
Who's your favorite
hockey team? The Bruins.

600
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,990
The Bruins? Oh,
man, you're in Chicago.

601
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:38,991
You're killin' me.

602
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:40,659
B-hawks, baby, B-hawks.

603
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:41,660
Adele.

604
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:42,661
Hey, Kerry. Hey.

605
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:44,195
Were you able to help that boy

606
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,298
with the burned arms and
hi...? His younger brother?

607
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,399
It's not ringing a bell.

608
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,636
Two brothers,
Dr. Kovac's patient.

609
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,671
No, he didn't mention anything.

610
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:54,773
Oh, well, uh, you'll
need to see them.

611
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:56,942
I'll check on it. All
right. Well, I'll be around.

612
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,177
Peter, we've got a
rule-out appy in Four.

613
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,846
I know it's not
trauma, but Mark's off.

614
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,881
Could you take it? Yeah, sure.

615
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,315
All right, she
looks clear to me.

616
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,252
Yeah, except scaphoid fractures
can be pretty difficult to see.

617
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,254
Well, that's why we
have multiple views.

618
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:10,722
I wasn't impressed
with her exam.

619
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,924
She can come back, and
we'll take a look at her again.

620
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:14,192
Well, you fill in the parents.

621
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,016
I'll go talk to her. Sure.

622
00:22:17,787 --> 00:22:19,765
Good news. You can
get out of this joint.

623
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,366
No fracture.

624
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,367
Oh, really?

625
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,069
So does that mean
I can play tonight?

626
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,653
Well, if you're feelin' up
to it, I don't see why not.

627
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,366
Hey.

628
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,636
What's goin' on? You okay?

629
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,471
I have a chemistry
exam I'm about to flunk,

630
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:43,722
and all I do is practice.

631
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:47,814
Three mornings a week,
every day after school.

632
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,161
I live it, you know.

633
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:52,531
I really do.

634
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:55,667
I'm just tired right now.

635
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:57,435
Let's do this, okay?

636
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,103
Why don't you hang
out here for a while,

637
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,694
and I'll get the radiologist to
take a look at these x-rays?

638
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,660
You said there was no fracture.

639
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,696
I'll get an expert's
opinion. You get some rest.

640
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,880
What do you say?

641
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,754
The doctor was Chinese,
or the nurse, she was black.

642
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:16,755
I need to speak to them.

643
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:17,989
I'll try and find them...

644
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,891
Could you tell me where
the lost and found is?

645
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:21,927
I need clothes. Hey,
what's going on here?

646
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:24,295
Alyssa, what are you doing
here? What did you call me?

647
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,296
I need to get out of here.

648
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,598
No, no, Alyssa, wait, wait...

649
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,066
Look, you stole my clothes,

650
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,067
and you stole my coat.

651
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:30,234
You're trying to trick me.

652
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:31,870
We didn't steal anything, okay?

653
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:33,271
And we'll give
it all back to you.

654
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:34,839
You know, you're
not going anywhere

655
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:36,140
until I sew up that laceration

656
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,508
and you tell me what's going on.

657
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,643
Please, let me help.

658
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,579
You can't, okay? Yes, I can.

659
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:41,680
No, you can't! No... No...

660
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:43,081
Sit down. Sit down. Fine, fine.

661
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,516
Just listen for a
minute, will you?

662
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,953
Okay, you are
safe here. Now, ju...

663
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:50,288
Who tricked you?

664
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,090
Y...? Your parents?

665
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,358
Yes, they...

666
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:56,327
To get me into this
treatment center.

667
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,929
That's where I ran away from.

668
00:23:57,953 --> 00:23:58,997
Okay, treatment center.

669
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,732
Like for drugs or alcohol?

670
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:02,333
No.

671
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,069
For gender identity.

672
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:05,670
What?

673
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,805
My parents sent me away

674
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,740
because they think
I'm sick and confused.

675
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:11,175
I keep telling them,
"Mom, Dad, get over it.

676
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,299
All I am is gay."

677
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,766
Ultimately, it's
your own decision.

678
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,101
Mom, I can do it.

679
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,103
I don't want you near him.

680
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,505
I'll be just outside,

681
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,407
and Rollins is
still in restraints.

682
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,475
Since the accident,

683
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,276
he's no longer able
to get out of bed.

684
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,345
He can't hurt anyone.

685
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,603
He killed my daughter.

686
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,424
Mrs. Cordova...

687
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,894
I don't understand this
man, and I don't care to.

688
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,730
But right now, you
have nothing to lose.

689
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,182
If Lindsey asks
him, I think he might

690
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,273
just tell her where
your daughter is.

691
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,988
And if he doesn't?

692
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:58,144
We may never find her.

693
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,776
Please?

694
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,117
Mom, I have to know.

695
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,187
I'll be in there with her.

696
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,297
Dave, do you have a sec?

697
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,165
What a mess. What?

698
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,834
Weaver's car. I got it started,

699
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,136
but these spark
plugs are ridiculous.

700
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,838
I never should have
opened my big mouth.

701
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,106
You oughta to look at this.
Hold on, I'm almost done.

702
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,842
It's your 11-year-old
with pneumonia.

703
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,410
Since when do you
pull x-rays for me?

704
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,668
Radiology flagged it.

705
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,881
Whoa, what the hell is that?

706
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,483
Mediastinal mass.

707
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:42,584
Around the heart?

708
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,619
Flint suspects lymphoma.

709
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,822
No wonder the EKG
showed low voltage.

710
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,724
Looks like infiltrates
through both lung fields.

711
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,661
It's inoperable.

712
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,413
This boy is dead.

713
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,415
They call this place a
treatment center, John,

714
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,682
like they're gonna cure her.

715
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,718
Her parents sent her
away for deprogramming?

716
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:01,420
Yeah. They granted
them guardianship.

717
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:03,087
Get her outta here
before they show up.

718
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,556
I didn't tell her I called them.

719
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,591
She needs help, and
I don't want her to bolt.

720
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:08,326
Call Social Services.

721
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,728
What are they gonna do?

722
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:11,430
I'm assuming
this place is legal.

723
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:12,764
It shouldn't be. Right.

724
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,534
Dr. Chen, we have
a situation here.

725
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:17,319
Huh? ALYSSA: Get off me!

726
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,020
I'm not going back!

727
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,588
Calm down, Alyssa.
Don't touch me!

728
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,956
Call Security! Hey, hey, hey.

729
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,057
You got it.

730
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,826
No need for that.
I'm her legal guardian.

731
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,294
You called my
parents? You bitch!

732
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,295
Dr. Ramsey, principal

733
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,996
of the Second Turn
Treatment Center.

734
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,498
Second Turn? Her
parents call me,

735
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,534
asked me to pick her up.

736
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,402
Leave me alone. CHEN:
We can't allow that.

737
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,571
I have temporary
custody. She's not ready.

738
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,473
Why not? 'Cause we
need to do further tests.

739
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,364
For what? She's pregnant.

740
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,129
Pregnant? Yes,
lab work confirms it.

741
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:47,048
I bet. Unfortunately, for you,

742
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,417
this means Alyssa is now
an emancipated minor.

743
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,969
She can decide
where she wants to go.

744
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:52,871
Look, I don't know
what this girl has told you

745
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:54,806
about the center, but
this is a load of bunk.

746
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,342
And frankly, an obstruction
of parental rights.

747
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,944
Well, Alyssa, do
you wanna stay here

748
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,714
or go with Mr. Ramsey?

749
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:04,616
I wanna stay here.

750
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,751
We all know she
can't be pregnant.

751
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:09,387
She's a healthy young
woman of childbearing age.

752
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:11,756
You might talk to some of
the male members of your staff.

753
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,957
I wanna see this lab report.

754
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,292
Oh, records are confidential.

755
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:16,244
Confidential? You just told me.

756
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,497
You're right. I shouldn't have.

757
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:21,454
Fine. I'll be back
with a court order.

758
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,085
I'll be praying for you, Alyssa.

759
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,671
Don't bother.

760
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,645
Dr. Corday.

761
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,380
Mr. Rollins.

762
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,449
This is Lindsey Cordova.

763
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:39,217
Hi, Lindsey.

764
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:44,406
I'd, uh... I'd shake
hands, but...

765
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,740
So how can I help you?

766
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,514
I wanna bury my sister.

767
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,029
Please, just tell
me where she is.

768
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:53,331
Were you close to her, Lindsey?

769
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:55,522
Yes, I was.

770
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,315
I didn't have
brothers or sisters.

771
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,592
I mean, all my life, I've never
known what that was like.

772
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:07,963
You know, to be
part of a family.

773
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:17,455
I have done terrible
things, Lindsey.

774
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,457
I've done evil things.

775
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:20,775
I know.

776
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,200
But I am paying for them now.

777
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,717
We don't want you to suffer.

778
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,626
We just wanna
know where Jenny is.

779
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,490
You're a good person.

780
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,093
More forgiving than most people.

781
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,928
Do you know that
maybe if I had met you,

782
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,631
Jenny would still be alive.

783
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,655
What do you mean?

784
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,875
If only I'd met you, Lindsey.

785
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,740
I know it now.

786
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,044
You're warm...

787
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,445
and loving.

788
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,064
If only I'd met you.

789
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:01,733
I could have had you instead.

790
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:04,919
What? Jenny
screamed all the time.

791
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,155
I was glad to get
rid of her, Lindsey.

792
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,774
Oh, God. You bastard!

793
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:12,494
Hey, what's her problem?!

794
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:13,962
I pulled his medical records.

795
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,530
He had lymphoma two years ago.

796
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,965
Chemo put it in remission.

797
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,066
The mother didn't
mention cancer?

798
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,369
Well, she said she must
have blocked it out of her mind.

799
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,137
It never affected
his breathing before.

800
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,506
Are you doing a thoracentesis?

801
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,141
As soon as the mom
figures out a way to tell him.

802
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,476
Well, she says she can't so...

803
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,244
Yeah, then you should.

804
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,380
I paged Oncology.

805
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,048
No, you... You tell
him. You tell him.

806
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,917
Well, wait a minute.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

807
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,519
Wait, wait. Don't
you think Oncology

808
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,894
would be better at that?
No, no, you're his doctor.

809
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,975
Dillon! Just keep walking.

810
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:44,976
Dillon, wait.

811
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,143
He's calling you. I know.

812
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,144
Where are you going?

813
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,480
Not your problem.

814
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:49,981
Your brother needs
a tetanus shot.

815
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,215
Yeah, sure, he does.

816
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,984
I don't understand.
Wha... What's wrong?

817
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,251
Yeah, Dillon, what's wrong?

818
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,053
He gave us up. Gave you up?

819
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:57,755
Gave us up? Shut up, Jake.

820
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,957
You called a social worker.

821
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,358
I didn't call the social worker.

822
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,826
Right, I'm sure
she always come by

823
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,795
and visits all the
retards. I'm not a retard!

824
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:06,163
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant, okay?

825
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:08,065
I swear... I swear I
didn't call anyone!

826
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:09,334
That was a mistake.

827
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:10,752
But you guys need help.

828
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,554
I've been taking care
of him for two years.

829
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:13,972
We do just fine. Yeah?

830
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:16,507
He doesn't go to school.
You have no job, no money.

831
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:17,908
God knows where you live.

832
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:20,478
Yes, you've got everything
under control. We get by.

833
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:22,480
Yeah, but sometimes
not very well.

834
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,382
You... You're
burned. Jake is cut.

835
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,417
Just, please, hey, let me...

836
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:29,854
Let me figure
something out, huh?

837
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:31,656
Then he said he was
gonna get a court order.

838
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,023
Have you heard from the parents?

839
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,759
No, and she's
really not pregnant.

840
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,126
Yeah, I assumed that part.

841
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,028
And I assume you didn't
write it on her chart?

842
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:39,430
No. Did you? No.

843
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,666
Okay, there's a gay and
lesbian center on Wabash.

844
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,033
Andrew can get you the number.

845
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:44,535
Get her in a cab.
Get her over there.

846
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,104
Then call her parents. Let
them know that she's okay.

847
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:50,341
Okay. Right. Thank
you. Hey, Dr. Chen.

848
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:51,893
As a rule, we don't lie

849
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,712
about our patients'
medical conditions.

850
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:57,231
Yeah. Ah, it's her first day.

851
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,432
I better get back to work.

852
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,668
Good idea.

853
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,904
Excuse me? Are
you a doctor? Uh, yes.

854
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,639
Can I take your
picture? Wh-what?

855
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,940
I'm on this scavenger hunt...

856
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,709
Who's cleaning auto
parts in Trauma 1?

857
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,276
I know it's not
sterile, but come on.

858
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,544
Oh, Malucci.

859
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,747
Can I take your picture?
I'm on this scavenger hunt.

860
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,716
What? Go away.

861
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,184
Dr. Benton, I thought you
said her wrist was all right.

862
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,252
Yeah, just a little sore.

863
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,787
Yeah, but can she play? Yeah.

864
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,956
Then why is the other
doctor putting a cast on?

865
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,020
What?

866
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,759
Dr. Finch?

867
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:26,894
Dr. Benton.

868
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,997
She says it's some
kind of cult fracture.

869
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,098
It's hard to see.

870
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,301
Occult. And yes, it
can be hard to see.

871
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,403
Radiology couldn't rule it out.

872
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:36,937
I thought you
looked at the x-ray.

873
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,206
Uh, yeah, I did.

874
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,774
Um, Dr. Finch, do
you have a minute?

875
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,143
Sure.

876
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,312
I'll be right back, Tamara.

877
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,314
I mean, it feels okay, right?

878
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,116
You think you can play?

879
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,284
Yeah. It's important
that she plays.

880
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,308
It's important that
she stays healthy.

881
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:55,757
What are you doing?
Casting her wrist.

882
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,158
I told her parents she was fine.

883
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,626
I ran it by Radiology.

884
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,895
They couldn't say for
sure that it wasn't fractured.

885
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,197
The chances of her having
a fracture are negligible.

886
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,966
I'd rather be safe.
She's an athlete.

887
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,768
She can push too
far, really hurt herself.

888
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,970
Well, then tell her not to.

889
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,138
The girl's under way too
much pressure to perform.

890
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,240
She needs a break.

891
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,742
Did she ask you
to put a cast on?

892
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,444
She's emotionally and
physically exhausted.

893
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,312
She can always decide
not to play, you know.

894
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,881
That girl hasn't made a decision

895
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,249
for herself since she was 11.

896
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,718
Everything she does revolves
around pleasing her coach,

897
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,320
her parents, her
teammates, her teachers.

898
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,422
I'm trying to give her

899
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,223
a bit of time to rest.
Did she ask you?

900
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,692
You don't understand. She can't.

901
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:32,694
You're controlling
her? I'm protecting her.

902
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,452
I'm sure that's what her parents
thought they were doing too.

903
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,286
That's why my chest
has been hurting?

904
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,670
It's spread
throughout your lungs.

905
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,363
So more chemo?

906
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,860
Well, that's an option.

907
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,330
We can try to shrink
it, but... But what?

908
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,170
The cancer is
surrounding your heart.

909
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,110
Am I going to be okay?

910
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:04,175
I don't think so.

911
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,311
Dr. Malucci. Not right now.

912
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:08,815
Did you leave something
of...? Dr. Weaver, I'm busy.

913
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,988
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

914
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,159
Dad?

915
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:24,829
Dad, you there?

916
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,631
Dad... Oh, it's you.

917
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:29,433
So you, uh, changed the locks?

918
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:30,602
What are you doing here?

919
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:31,970
Worried about you.

920
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:34,272
No one could find you.
You weren't answerin'.

921
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:35,806
The damn realtor keeps calling.

922
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,841
I don't know how many
times I have to tell her

923
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,065
the house is off the market.

924
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,597
Can I come in? Oh, sure.

925
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,567
You don't wanna search me first?

926
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,486
<i>Kerry, what did you hire me for?</i>

927
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,021
What? I'm not here to simply

928
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:51,122
perform procedures.

929
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:53,191
I'm an experienced
emergency physician.

930
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:54,525
You have to trust my judgment.

931
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,260
Is this about that disabled boy?

932
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,895
Yes, you called DCFS.

933
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,597
Yes, I thought we
agreed you would.

934
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,965
If you didn't intend to,

935
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,933
you should have said
so. But they walked out.

936
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,535
Your social worker
scared them away.

937
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,803
They're gone?

938
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,872
Yeah, I convinced the
older brother to come back

939
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,173
so I could try to help him.

940
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:11,109
Please, just let me...
Let me handle it.

941
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,643
All right. See that you do.

942
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,445
Okay. Who is...? Who
is the social worker?

943
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,335
Neuman. Adele Neuman.

944
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,967
Your parents left?

945
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,469
They went to get the car.

946
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,739
We gotta go. My coach
makes you sit if you can't play.

947
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,241
You can play, Tamara,

948
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:28,075
if you really want to.

949
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,332
It's not broken?

950
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,498
We can't be absolutely sure.

951
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,832
But probably not.

952
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:35,950
So I don't need this?

953
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,754
I was hoping it would
slow you down a bit.

954
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,089
But it's your choice.

955
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,925
I can't slow down right now.

956
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,628
Things'll get better once
we get through this season.

957
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:50,898
You don't want to start
resenting your talent.

958
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,154
Don't let it get to that.

959
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:54,151
Play for you.

960
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,541
It's not that simple.

961
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,141
I know.

962
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,165
Promise you'll try?

963
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,383
600 South Stone.

964
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,818
Okay, 8:30.

965
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,486
Yeah, he'll be there.

966
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,056
Oh, did you wanna
talk to Dr. Kovac?

967
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,057
Okay.

968
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,092
Thanks. Bye.

969
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,160
My landlord said yes.

970
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,878
Yes? Good. Yeah.

971
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,145
He owns a bunch of buildings.

972
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:23,547
He's always looking for a super,

973
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:24,916
and he'll interview Dillon.

974
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,651
Lucy, thank you.
Sure, no problem.

975
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:30,088
And what exactly is a "super"?

976
00:35:30,112 --> 00:35:32,056
Collects rent, keeps
the building clean.

977
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,658
Good. Good.

978
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:36,361
It gives them somewhere
to live, some cash.

979
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,429
If DCFS sees that Dillon...
- Dillon!

980
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:39,797
He can apply for guardianship.

981
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:42,634
Dillon! Dillon!

982
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,540
It's all right. Excuse me.

983
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,305
Hold still.

984
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:48,323
Don't touch him!

985
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:49,524
Where are you taking him?

986
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,159
Stop!

987
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,527
Hey, don't do that!

988
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,946
Let him go! You are scaring him!

989
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,415
Adele Neuman, DCFS.
We need to take Jake

990
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:58,800
to an emergency intake center.

991
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,168
You're not takin' him nowhere!

992
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,086
I'm not...! I'm
not releasing him!

993
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,520
The boy has been neglected,

994
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,089
and it's my
obligation to protect

995
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:06,290
his safety and his health.

996
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:08,092
I never neglected
him! He's my brother!

997
00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:10,094
I'm getting him a
job. They'll be fine.

998
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,013
Hey, I said let him
go! Hey, stand back.

999
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,548
I don't wanna
have to arrest you.

1000
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,683
I have to put him
in protective care.

1001
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,219
All right! All right!

1002
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,604
Just let me go with him.

1003
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:21,272
I'm sorry. Don't leave me.

1004
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:22,940
Don't be scared, Jake.

1005
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:23,975
Don't be scared.

1006
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:30,269
Watch your head.

1007
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:33,039
I'll be right behind you, okay?

1008
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,553
Okay? You can't do this.

1009
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,155
Those two only have each other.

1010
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,257
I'll find you! I know that,

1011
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,892
but I have to. Don't
be afraid, Jake!

1012
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,461
I'll be right behind
you, all right?

1013
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,863
I'm gonna find you, okay?

1014
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:46,881
Okay?

1015
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,750
I'll be right behind you!

1016
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,351
I'm gonna find you. I promise!

1017
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,620
Don't let me go!
Don't be afraid, Jake!

1018
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,971
Don't be afraid!

1019
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,224
Don't be scared!

1020
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,948
Don't be scared, Jake!

1021
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,262
Don't worry.

1022
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,952
We'll get him back.

1023
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,796
You wanted to see me?

1024
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:15,743
I'm sick.

1025
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,278
No more games, Dean.

1026
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,746
What is it that you want?

1027
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:24,340
The games... they're
no fun anymore.

1028
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:28,384
Not even that last one.

1029
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,482
Dr. Corday...

1030
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,790
that day on the road,

1031
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:44,510
you should have let me die.

1032
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,330
That's what I want.

1033
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:54,214
Shannon Murphy, 26.
Slipped down a 15-foot incline

1034
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,382
into a polar-bear pit.

1035
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,051
Polar bear? Yeah, at the zoo.

1036
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,452
He was really gentle, actually.

1037
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,454
He licked my face.

1038
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,655
Everybody else got a picture

1039
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,656
of the polar bear.

1040
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,957
I got one with the polar bear.

1041
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,659
This that stupid scavenger hunt?

1042
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,794
Don't call it stupid.
I just won $1000.

1043
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,729
Yeah, you also just
broke both your ankles.

1044
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,130
And a forearm fracture.

1045
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,500
Started an IV. And
gave her 10 of morphine.

1046
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,768
Hey, Cleo, you want this one?

1047
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,536
No, I've done enough
casting for one day.

1048
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,537
Yup.

1049
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,805
Could someone take this lady

1050
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,307
who burned her
butt in the bathtub?

1051
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,392
She will not stop. SHANNON:
You're not a doctor?

1052
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:23,127
I won't tell anybody
if you won't.

1053
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:24,629
Oh, my God! Where's my camera?

1054
00:38:24,653 --> 00:38:26,029
Did you bring my camera?

1055
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,698
Somebody, I need
a picture of a doctor.

1056
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,067
Somebody get me a
camera! It's worth $1000!

1057
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,224
Make her split it with us.

1058
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:38,242
Luka, I heard about
what happened.

1059
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:39,243
I'm sorry.

1060
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:41,084
Don... Don't apologize.

1061
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,964
It might not always
make sense to us,

1062
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,367
but when there's a
difficult family situation,

1063
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,401
we call DCFS,

1064
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,837
because they have
expertise in this area.

1065
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,139
We have to defer
to their judgment.

1066
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,091
You don't break up families.

1067
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:55,760
Sometimes we
do. It's complicated.

1068
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:56,784
No.

1069
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,091
My wife and kids were taken.

1070
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:10,614
In the war?

1071
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,578
Yeah.

1072
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,235
And then killed.

1073
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:21,026
You don't break up families.

1074
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,410
So much for the
retirement community, huh?

1075
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,478
I gave it a try, Mark.

1076
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,813
You were only there a week.

1077
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:37,218
Yeah, the longest
week of my life.

1078
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,652
What are you gonna do now?

1079
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,954
I'll get by.

1080
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,623
Don't trouble yourself.

1081
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,325
It's no trouble.

1082
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:48,462
Yeah, like hell.

1083
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,497
You move in with that girl yet?

1084
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,399
Elizabeth?

1085
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,925
No, not yet.

1086
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:58,922
Actually, I've been
thinking about it,

1087
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:01,392
and, you know, we
never really talked about it.

1088
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,936
Maybe you should come
live with me in Chicago.

1089
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,347
For a while.

1090
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,603
Why would I do that?

1091
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,300
I don't know.

1092
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,736
The weather could be better,

1093
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,788
but it's a great city.

1094
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,756
You'd be closer to Rachel.

1095
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,457
You'd be closer to me.

1096
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,459
For a while?

1097
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,378
As long as you like.

1098
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:23,047
I'm not selling
this house, Mark.

1099
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:25,115
How could you?

1100
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:26,717
Answering the door
in your underwear

1101
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:28,981
tends to scare off the buyers.

1102
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:32,573
I suppose so.

1103
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,597
Chicago, huh?

1104
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,545
You are not one
to get your tune-ups

1105
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,913
done on a timely basis, are you?

1106
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,815
Did you get it
started? Sorry, yeah.

1107
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,584
It's not gonna break
down on the way home?

1108
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,052
Nope, I can at least fix cars.

1109
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,354
What? Nothin'

1110
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:47,455
You're good to go, boss.

1111
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,655
Thanks, Dr. Malucci.

1112
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,458
My pleasure.

1113
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,226
Hey, so how was your first day?

1114
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,195
Everyone treat you
all right? Uh, yeah,

1115
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,296
feels like I never left.

1116
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,964
You guys wanna go
get something to eat?

1117
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:57,965
Oh. Nah.

1118
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,166
I don't think so. Okay.

1119
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,667
Hey, you workin' tomorrow?

1120
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,668
Me? Yeah.

1121
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,669
Uh-huh.

1122
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,905
Oh, what a coincidence! So am I.

1123
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,908
See you, Carter.

1124
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,210
Do I have to warn you about him?

1125
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,145
Oh, please!

1126
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,846
So how was your first day?

1127
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,983
Uh, well, I wish I could
have done more for Alyssa.

1128
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,184
At least you did somethin'.

1129
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,286
Yeah, I guess so.

1130
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,088
Why did you come back?

1131
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,189
I told you.

1132
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,558
Uh, my program
in New York closed.

1133
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,094
No, no, I mean, uh...
I mean to medicine.

1134
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,429
Oh, oh. Um, well...

1135
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,099
four months after I quit,
I was on the subway,

1136
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,401
and this guy, pretty
young, in his forties,

1137
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,370
went into cardiac arrest.

1138
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,671
He was dying, and everyone

1139
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,940
was just standing
there staring at him.

1140
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,610
So I suddenly realized,
"Hey, I know what to do!"

1141
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,379
Jumped in, saved his life.

1142
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,881
It's a great feeling.

1143
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,349
Yeah, it can be.

1144
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:52,186
Then I figured, I'm
pretty good at this.

1145
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,820
Why waste it?

1146
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,655
Deb, you haven't changed a bit.

1147
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,458
It's Jing-Mei.

1148
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,895
Well, good night, Jing-Mei.

1149
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,129
Good night, John.

1150
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:06,222
Oh, and, Deb, welcome back.

1151
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:13,179
Morphine.

1152
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:18,595
A hundred milligrams
injected into your bloodstream.

1153
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,548
You'll simply drift away.

1154
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,250
Won't even hurt.

1155
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,754
Is that an offer?

1156
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,364
You'd have to tell
me where the body is.

1157
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,331
Why do you care so much?

1158
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,312
Were you serious or not?

1159
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,398
Won't you get into trouble?

1160
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:40,467
The Hippocratic Oath and all?

1161
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,319
You're worried about
me now, are you, Dean?

1162
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:44,788
No.

1163
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,273
But I know you.

1164
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,675
As soon as you
get what you want,

1165
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,544
you'll just... You'll stop.

1166
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,530
I won't.

1167
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:54,353
But how do I know?

1168
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,001
What, are you
going to promise me,

1169
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:58,190
Dr. Corday?

1170
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,656
Believe me, you'll know.

1171
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,963
You'll feel yourself going.

1172
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,780
I just hope you have
breath enough to tell me.

1173
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,766
Well, what if I don't?

1174
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,901
Then I'll crack open your chest

1175
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,238
and bring you back to life.

1176
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,262
Okay.

1177
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,780
Let's do it.

1178
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,314
Are you sure?

1179
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,616
Yeah.

1180
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Are you?

1181
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:39,799
I'm glad it's you, Elizabeth.

1182
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,070
Where is she, Dean?
