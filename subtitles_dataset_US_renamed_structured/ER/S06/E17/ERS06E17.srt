1
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:15,492
Discharged the rule-out MI.
Last enzymes were normal.

2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,494
And, uh, admitted the
pneumonia to Medicine.

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,128
Sounds good. Morning, ladies.

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,598
I understand we have a double
trauma coming in. Need help?

5
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,399
Just two minors,
Robert. We can handle it.

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,901
Well, while I'm
flipping burgers,

7
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,837
might as well flip
these too. Excuse me?

8
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,438
Ray Kroc. Started McDonald's.

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,974
Once a year he'd make
shakes, fry the fries, you know,

10
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,142
get back in the trenches
with the little people.

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,178
Ah, so today you're
working in the trenches.

12
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,379
With us, the little people.

13
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,047
Wanna make sure
the ship is shipshape.

14
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,817
Son of a bitch! You
started it! You started it!

15
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,151
The hell I did, boy!

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,120
Hey, cut it out!

17
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,204
Whoa, let's break this up!

18
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:46,790
That's enough. WEAVER: Hey, hey.

19
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,941
Get away from him.
That's enough. Hey!

20
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,495
Get your hands off
me, dumb-ass punk!

21
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,663
Dumb-ass punk. WEAVER:
Malucci, get out here.

22
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,248
What's open? Curtain 2!

23
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,249
I'll sue your ass!

24
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:57,801
Kiss my ass! You ran into me!

25
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:58,785
You cut me off!

26
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,670
You're crazy! Enough!

27
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,871
Settle down, bud.

28
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,975
Who you callin' "bud"?

29
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,592
Hey, that's enough!

30
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:07,693
Get off me, man.

31
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:09,062
You, actually, bud.

32
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,063
What happened here?

33
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:11,348
Road rage led to an MVA.

34
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,650
Which led to a fistfight.

35
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,351
Terry Waters, 46,
multiple abrasions,

36
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,520
bad lac to left arm. BP, 120/80.

37
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,691
Janes, 25. Multiple abrasions,
head lac. BP, 110/70.

38
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,410
Get soft restraints.

39
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:24,427
I didn't start it.

40
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,428
Tried to sideswipe me.

41
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,429
Settle down!

42
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,831
We need to treat you.

43
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,366
Thanks for
rear-ending me, moron.

44
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,470
That's it! Hey!

45
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,538
Call Security! Hold it!

46
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:35,789
You're the moron!

47
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,345
You son of a bitch!

48
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,723
Oh, my God!

49
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,180
Get him.

50
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,349
Down on the bed, Mr. Waters!

51
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,051
Oh, man! This is nasty!

52
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,085
Do something!

53
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,887
Hey, just settle
down. Settle down.

54
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,423
Is this what you mean
by "flipping burgers"?

55
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,447
Very funny.

56
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,844
Seems to be under control.

57
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,379
If you don't need any
of the little people...

58
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:02,983
Thank you, Kerry,
I'm sure I can handle it.

59
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,717
Shall I just, you
know, yank it out?

60
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,687
No, no. We gotta check for
damage to the facial nerve,

61
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,591
not to mention damage to my pen.

62
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,992
Worrying about your pen?

63
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:13,743
Oh, shut up.

64
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,284
Put it back on, Dad.

65
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:12,741
I don't need it.

66
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:16,912
It makes me want to sneeze.

67
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:22,061
And I don't need
you waiting around.

68
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:23,946
I don't wanna worry
about you taking it off.

69
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,449
You better get used to it
because I've made up my mind.

70
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,953
I'm not going to be doing
my dying in your cramped,

71
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,122
thin-walled,
second floor walkup.

72
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,689
Maybe we oughta
think about moving.

73
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,714
Stop, Mark, you
know what I mean.

74
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,269
Even if I stay in Chicago, I
want to get my own place.

75
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,450
How's that gonna work?

76
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,552
Well, I'll...

77
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,420
get somebody
to help if I need it.

78
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:50,223
No. You'll just ignore it,
like you have the last year.

79
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,291
I know you. No, you don't!

80
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,695
Y-you might know this disease,
but you don't know what I want.

81
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,230
I don't wanna have
this conversa...

82
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:58,853
Then don't.

83
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,956
<i>Chest x-ray's clear.</i>

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,860
Labs are normal.
Hematocrit of 32.

85
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,562
What's my potassium?

86
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,664
4.2. It's fine.

87
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,332
I figured it would be.

88
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,968
I just had that
dialysis yesterday.

89
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,036
So, what is it? A
man or a woman?

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,555
I believe it's a man.

91
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,023
What happened to him?

92
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,558
I don't know.

93
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,060
Must have been
an accident, right?

94
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:28,694
Isn't that usually the deal?

95
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:30,329
Yep. I think it was.

96
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,431
In Minneapolis.

97
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,332
They'll fly the
kidney in from there?

98
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,434
Yeah.

99
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,535
Our surgeon, Dr. Corday,

100
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,853
he's gone to procure the organ.

101
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,355
Yeah, they put it in a
cooler. That whole thing.

102
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,857
Man, I didn't ever think

103
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,859
I would make it to
the top of the list.

104
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:43,860
Yeah, you are lucky.

105
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,246
If I was lucky, I
wouldn't need the kidney.

106
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,947
But seeing as you do...

107
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:49,365
Yeah, yeah. I'm hungry.

108
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,252
I'm afraid you can't
eat or drink anything.

109
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:54,003
I've cleared you
for the surgery.

110
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,955
We just have to wait
till the kidney gets here.

111
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,695
I'm not going anywhere.

112
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:00,894
The kid was the
one that started it.

113
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:02,679
Then he rammed into my damn car!

114
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,169
I know, Dad, you
said that already.

115
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,918
Ah, damn it!

116
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,520
Mr. Waters, it's all right.

117
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,354
No, it's not all right.

118
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,389
I hate being clumsy.

119
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,858
It's no big deal.

120
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,327
Let's just finish
your sutures, huh?

121
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,562
No, you... You
need to hold still.

122
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,196
I think I know that. Okay?

123
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,737
Dad?

124
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,142
I'm sorry. It's just
been a crappy day.

125
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,308
Listen, can I get...?
Get some more water?

126
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,415
Yeah, sure. I'll go.

127
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:37,897
I'm, uh, just gonna
hit the ladies' room.

128
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,387
I'll be right back, okay?

129
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:43,669
What's going
on? Is he all right?

130
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,938
Well, I think he's a little
upset by what's happened.

131
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,940
I've never seen
him like this before.

132
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:48,975
Running into some car.

133
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,610
And h-he stabbed
somebody with a pen?

134
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,612
Has he always had
a temper? No. Never.

135
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,380
But this week, since
I've been visiting,

136
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:55,681
he just seems off.

137
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:58,450
He loses his balance
sometimes, lashes out at people.

138
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:01,453
Has he ever had seizures
or bad headaches?

139
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,723
Not that I know of. Is
something wrong with him?

140
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,258
Well, I wanna run some
tests and get a head CT.

141
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,426
Then we'll know more.

142
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,795
Um... Oh, ladies'
room is down there.

143
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,130
Thanks.

144
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:12,965
<i>He's taking codeine
for his back pain.</i>

145
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:14,634
Now he has increasing
abdominal pain.

146
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,669
Positive surgical
history for an appy.

147
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,071
I'm concerned about
a bowel obstruction.

148
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,524
Has my kidney gotten here yet?

149
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,759
I don't know. I'm Sorry.

150
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:23,760
Well, I'm still hungry.

151
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,762
I could've eaten.

152
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,398
Good bowel sounds. Any fever?

153
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,399
No.

154
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:30,383
Vomiting?

155
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:31,951
Nope.

156
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,453
No guarding or rebound.

157
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,855
Did you get an abdominal series?

158
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,989
Yeah, it just came back.

159
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,474
Excuse us one minute, please.

160
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,614
Mm.

161
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:48,133
Okay.

162
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,670
Well, no obstruction,
just a lot of stool.

163
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,338
So he's constipated
from the codeine?

164
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,606
Mm-hm.

165
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,174
I'd have him cut
back on his pain meds

166
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:56,576
and give him a laxative.

167
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,714
Also, have the pharmacy
give him bisacodyl,

168
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,416
10 megs a day.

169
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,318
Sorry. I thought it was serious.

170
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,638
Well, to him it is.

171
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,939
She's had trouble breathing.

172
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:10,940
Any fever?

173
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,541
Up to 102. Lots of secretions.

174
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,176
I suctioned her,
but she got worse.

175
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,078
She was diagnosed
with Sanfilippo Syndrome

176
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,814
when she was 2.

177
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,284
She has a seizure
disorder, G-tube, PICC line.

178
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,920
She's on O-2 at home
and BiPAP at night.

179
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,921
Can Angie talk?

180
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,755
No, she's severely retarded.

181
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,624
She recently lost her hearing.

182
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,826
She can't even feed herself.

183
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,377
What medications is she on?

184
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,447
Oh, Lasix, albuterol,
Robinul, Valium.

185
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,982
Phenobarb, cisapride, Bactrim.

186
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,851
Okay, she has rales bilateraly.

187
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,018
It's probably pneumonia.

188
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,621
She was in about a month
ago with pseudomonas.

189
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,123
Temp's 102.

190
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:45,424
Culture her PICC line?

191
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,793
Yeah, order a portable
chest, CBC, lytes,

192
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,228
sputum and peripheral cultures.

193
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,365
The doctors usually give
her Ceftaz and mucomist

194
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,366
when she has pneumonia.

195
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,867
We'll do the same.

196
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,703
I'm gonna run back home and
get her some dolls and things.

197
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,205
I-I think it makes
her feel better.

198
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,374
Don't worry, we'll
take good care of her.

199
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,444
Oh, um, is it possible
to get a TV and a VCR?

200
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,029
She loves to watch the<i> Muppets.</i>

201
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,864
Sure. We'll bring one in.

202
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,987
Thank you.

203
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,734
<i>What do we got?</i>

204
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,436
Eddie Bernero,
12. Two days of flu.

205
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,037
His dad found him
barely responsive.

206
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,872
Where's Dad?

207
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,006
Coming in his own car.

208
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,959
BP 90 palp, pulse 120, resps 28.

209
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:21,193
Not much response.

210
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,128
Could be encephalitis
or meningitis.

211
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:24,129
He's been in before.

212
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,130
Then pull the old chart.

213
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,632
Dr. Finch, the
nurse signed us out.

214
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,233
You said I need medicine.

215
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,602
Right. Go ahead, I'll be there.

216
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,937
Help them transfer that boy?

217
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,204
Sure.

218
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,507
Is the Grunwald prescription
back from the pharmacy?

219
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:35,942
Yeah, right here.

220
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:39,250
Once a day till the
constipation resolves.

221
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,880
All yours. Thanks.

222
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,417
Okay, let's get a CBC,
lytes and dip a urine.

223
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,551
He's tachy at 150.

224
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:46,852
Pressure's dropping, 70 palp.

225
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,789
He could be septic,
going into shock.

226
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,390
Mucous membranes
are as dry as a bone.

227
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,725
He's severely dehydrated.

228
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:55,227
Urine's positive for
glucose, no ketones.

229
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,228
Where's the old chart?

230
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:57,963
Does this kid have
type two diabetes?

231
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:00,733
It says he was in here five
months ago for gastroenteritis.

232
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,869
Do you have a blood
glucose? Almost.

233
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:06,539
Okay, let's bolus him with
normal saline, 10 cc's per kg.

234
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,257
Blood glucose is over 400.

235
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,760
What? Are you sure?

236
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,784
I checked it twice.

237
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,497
He's in a a hyperosmolar coma.

238
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,883
Start another IV,
regular insulin,

239
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,050
.1 unit per kilo per hour.

240
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,636
Let's get the bicarb
and potassium levels.

241
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,889
This kid's been
sick for a while.

242
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:25,158
What was his blood glucose
on his last admission?

243
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,193
They didn't do one.

244
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,162
You're kidding.
Did they dip a urine?

245
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,596
Nope. Doesn't look like it.

246
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,065
Who the hell took
care of this kid?

247
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,388
Carter.

248
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:37,024
Page him. Get him up here now.

249
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,291
Bloody flight took forever.

250
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,959
Unfortunately we have some time.

251
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,561
Had to ruled out
the first recipient.

252
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,995
What? I thought you cleared him.

253
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,697
I did but he developed
unstable angina.

254
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,132
He's not a surgical candidate.

255
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,367
Did you talk to UNOS? Yes.

256
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,335
They have another
Chicago person on the list.

257
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,336
She's on her way.

258
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,837
Okay, well let's
hope she gets here

259
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,640
while the kidney's
still viable. Yep.

260
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,774
Any family?

261
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,143
Dad's on his way. I'll send him.

262
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,745
Recheck his potassium and
bicarb levels in two hours.

263
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,847
Cleo, what's up?

264
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:09,018
Eddie Bernero, on his
way to the PICU, that's what.

265
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,186
Let me refresh your memory.

266
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,921
He was your patient
five months ago.

267
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,190
Sorry, I don't remember him.

268
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,091
Yeah, neither did I. It
took me a few minutes.

269
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,293
You called me in on the case.

270
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,362
Couch-potato kid,
type two diabetes.

271
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,063
Father was having
insurance problems.

272
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,633
So I guess you
doctored the chart?

273
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,201
What are you talking about?

274
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,403
He could've died of cerebral
edema or an infarction

275
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,139
'cause I rehydrated him
without knowing he had diabetes.

276
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,707
Hey, let me take
a look at the chart.

277
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,544
His electrolytes were so out
of whack, he could've died.

278
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,096
What the hell were you thinking?

279
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,298
Carter, your headache
patient's having a seizure.

280
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,267
Okay. If anybody asks questions,

281
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,451
don't expect me to lie for you.

282
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,922
Hey, Carter, nice hair.

283
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,590
Can you get me
Eddie Bernero's chart?

284
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,591
We sent it up to PICU.

285
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,450
I know. I said, just get it.

286
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,267
Henry is so excited.

287
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,935
Wouldn't you know
this would be the day

288
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,671
that he had to go to St. Louis.

289
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,639
He's on his way back? Oh, yeah.

290
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,708
I think he could fly
under his own power.

291
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,412
Oh, I did hemodialysis
for four years,

292
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,446
three times a week.

293
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,298
But three years ago
I switched to CAPD.

294
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:14,533
How often are the infusions?

295
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,702
Uh, four times a day.

296
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:20,206
Henry says it's like getting
my oil changed. A lot.

297
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,774
Yeah, but it gives
you more freedom.

298
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,125
Oh, yeah.

299
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,194
It is so great not to have
to go into that hospital

300
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,395
every other day.

301
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,230
And with the transplant,
I'll be able to...

302
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,065
Have you had any peritonitis?

303
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,817
Uh, a few times.

304
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,541
But not for at least six months.

305
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:38,245
Okay. Everything looks
good, Mrs. Bassett.

306
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:42,594
We'll wait for your labs
and then get you to the O.R.

307
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,096
Thank you so much.

308
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,932
Well, I haven't had
that much to do with it,

309
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,289
but you're welcome.

310
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,054
Mrs. Dwyer.

311
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,723
Angie, I'm back.

312
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,390
You're gonna be okay, sweetie.

313
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,959
Nurse Hathaway explain to you?

314
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,328
Yes. You have
to start another IV.

315
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,646
Yes, we've been trying,

316
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,732
but Angie is a very tough stick.

317
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,567
I know. She has a lot of
scarring from previous IVs.

318
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,669
That's why we thought
a central line's better.

319
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,522
It's really the best way to
give her fluids and antibiotics.

320
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,941
Yes, I understand.

321
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,176
Great, so could you just
sign this consent form?

322
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,578
Oh, I... I can't do that.

323
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,480
Oh, Mrs. Dwyer, it's
a very safe procedure.

324
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,166
I'm not Angie's real mom.

325
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,433
I'm her foster mom.

326
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,335
She's been in our care
for almost four years.

327
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,603
We wanted to adopt,

328
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,289
but we couldn't
afford the medical.

329
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,823
And her birth parents?

330
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,958
Well, they abandoned her.

331
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,162
She has a legal guardian
through, uh, DCFS.

332
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,198
Okay, Carol, see if you can
track down Adele Neuman.

333
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,700
Isn't there anything
else you can do?

334
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,638
We will keep trying
for another IV, all right?

335
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,357
Okay, Sweetie, here we go.

336
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,258
Mr. Bernero?

337
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,560
Dr. Carter, right?

338
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:48,561
How's he doing, Kit?

339
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,562
Much better.

340
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,029
Blood glucose is down to 380.

341
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:52,030
How are his lytes?

342
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:53,532
Potassium's normalizing.

343
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,468
He'll be here a couple of days,

344
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,870
but I think he's
out of the woods.

345
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:59,372
Do you have a minute?

346
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:00,828
Of course.

347
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,415
What happened, Mr. Bernero?

348
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,684
Well, uh, Eddie's
gettin' more exercise,

349
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,586
and, uh, we're workin'
on the diet issues.

350
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,187
What happened, Mr. Bernero?

351
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,955
You understood I
had insurance problem.

352
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:19,658
You understood that your son
had a very serious condition.

353
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:21,226
Yeah, I cut you some slack.

354
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,728
But you agreed
to monitor his food,

355
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,229
his exercise and his medication.

356
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,497
You know how kids are.

357
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,066
Yeah. Which is why
they have parents

358
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,234
to be responsible for them.

359
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:29,901
The insurance thing's
worked out now.

360
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:30,937
Eddie's covered.

361
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,204
At what expense? His life?

362
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,023
You know, he almost
died this morning.

363
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,659
You never led me to
believe it could get this bad.

364
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:37,910
Eddie's been doing just fine,

365
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,411
and then suddenly
this morning...

366
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:42,080
Oh, great.

367
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:45,167
Great, so you've got
no culpability here at all?

368
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,334
Is that right, Mr. Benero?

369
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,403
You're his doctor.

370
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,338
You said he'd be
fine for a few months.

371
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,440
I remember, that's
what you said.

372
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,909
Now, if you didn't
know this could happen,

373
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,349
how am I supposed to?

374
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,386
No, this is not an emergency,

375
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,356
but the child is
gonna need IV access.

376
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,958
Yes, we are aware of how
often she's been hospitalized,

377
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,294
but that has nothing
to do with this.

378
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,563
Her veins are sclerosed.
I can't get a thing.

379
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,132
Neither can I. This
is ridiculous. Here.

380
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,300
Give me the phone. Come on.

381
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,301
Steven Galbraith.

382
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,735
Hey, Mr. Galbraith, hi.

383
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,838
This is Kerry Weaver, and I'm
chief of emergency medicine.

384
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,675
Angie's PICC line is infected...

385
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,177
You should know
what a PICC line is.

386
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,279
You're her guardian.

387
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,082
Yes, I-I know that she
has an incurable disease.

388
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,239
But she's treatable
at this time...

389
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,353
No, it's not a matter
of life or death yet,

390
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,788
but it could be...

391
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,557
Mr. Galbraith, have
you ever seen Angie?

392
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,724
Have you seen her?

393
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,326
Because I'm looking
at her right now.

394
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,763
And I am see an eminently
treatable girl who would...

395
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,232
Well, thank you.

396
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,156
Thank you for nothing.

397
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,903
He said no.

398
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,105
She should be given pain meds

399
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,673
and made as
comfortable as possible.

400
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,778
There it is.

401
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,864
A heartbeat.

402
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:06,131
You're definitely pregnant.

403
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:10,753
I think you're about...
eight weeks along.

404
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,622
I wish Henry would get here.

405
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,041
Have you been
trying to get pregnant?

406
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:17,943
For almost two years.

407
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,834
With no luck. Until now.

408
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,381
This takes me out of
the running, doesn't it?

409
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,751
After the transplant,

410
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:29,521
you need to take
immunosuppressive drugs.

411
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,223
And they are
very, very powerful.

412
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:34,459
And it's likely they
would cause birth defects

413
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:37,696
or a miscarriage.

414
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,032
And if you choose
not to have the child,

415
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,296
then we can go
ahead with the surgery.

416
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,889
I'm sorry to pressure
you, Mrs. Bassett.

417
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,276
But we have only so
much time for the kidney.

418
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,380
We can't wait for your husband.

419
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:56,937
How could this happen?

420
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:03,410
I've waited so long for both.

421
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,063
Mrs. Bassett.

422
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,419
I wanna keep the baby.

423
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,403
Okay.

424
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,607
David, you been to
your appointment?

425
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:22,875
Yeah. Same old, same old.

426
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,576
Say, where is the
snack bar around here?

427
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,578
I'd like to grab a bite
before I head home.

428
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,380
If you don't mind
some company, I'll go.

429
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,003
No. Let's go.

430
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,053
His daughter says his
behavior's been unusual?

431
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,721
Erratic. Sometimes volatile.

432
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,756
Used to be a pretty
easygoing guy.

433
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,192
I was thinking maybe
some kind of mass or lesion?

434
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,526
No signs of that.

435
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,596
Any new stress at
home or at work?

436
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,631
Uh, he claims no.

437
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,600
So we've got
uncontrolled movements,

438
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:50,886
loss of balance and
personality change.

439
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,953
You get a family history?

440
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,088
Yeah, his mom's living,

441
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,923
but he doesn't know
much about his dad.

442
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,825
He died when Waters was 14.

443
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,227
So it'd make him early-mid-40s?

444
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,228
Probably.

445
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,229
What'd he die of?

446
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,331
Suicide, apparently.

447
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,288
We need to go talk to him.

448
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,204
I just wish you could talk
some sense into Mark.

449
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,539
Well, he's worried about you.

450
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,741
I know he is.

451
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,610
But he also thinks
that he can control

452
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,077
what's happening to me.

453
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:21,438
Hell, I wish he could,
but we all know he can't.

454
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,186
I know it's a cliché to
say you don't wanna be

455
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,755
a burden to your children,

456
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,891
but at my age, I don't
mind being be a cliché.

457
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,729
I don't want him to have
to deal with everything.

458
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,398
Well, he's going to,
one way or another.

459
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,633
Can you imagine your
mother allowing you

460
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,069
to take care of her?

461
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,872
She'd sooner push off in a
canoe and head out to sea.

462
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,610
Well, I don't need
to go to that extreme.

463
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,778
I do wanna check out
that... Uh, what do you call it?

464
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,547
Not quite a... A nursing home.

465
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,548
A hospice?

466
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,335
That's it. A hospice.

467
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:01,879
If I stay in Chicago, at least
that'll make Mark happy.

468
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,462
David, I don't think
there's anything about this

469
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,886
that's going to make Mark happy.

470
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,036
Huntington's Disease?

471
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,038
That's what we're thinking.

472
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,240
I never even heard of it.

473
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,944
Well, it's a progressive
neurological disorder.

474
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,079
It causes loss of
balance, mood changes

475
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,114
and jerking
movements of the body.

476
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,506
And progressive dementia.

477
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,419
You mean, like Alzheimer's?

478
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,790
Well, there are similarities.

479
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,547
Okay, um...

480
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,229
Now we know what
it is. What do I do?

481
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,666
I'm afraid there's no cure.

482
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,335
Well, how bad's it gonna get?

483
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,637
You'll need to discuss
this with a geneticist.

484
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,173
You're telling me that...
I'm going to lose control of...

485
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,742
Of everything
physically and mentally,

486
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,344
and there's nothing
I can do about it?

487
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,763
They're always
developing new treatments.

488
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:00,887
But at the moment, no.

489
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,998
I'm 46 years old.

490
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:15,314
How could I get such a thing?

491
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:16,782
It's genetic, Mr. Waters.

492
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:19,551
You inherited it.

493
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,422
It generally manifests
itself in your early 40s.

494
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:26,780
It could be the reason why
your father committed suicide.

495
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,020
That means I could've
passed this on to Jo.

496
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,711
There is a 50-50 chance.

497
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,464
Hyperosmolar coma,
no evidence of DKA.

498
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,332
This kid's got
type two diabetes.

499
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,603
I'd say. His blood glucose
came back from the lab at 980.

500
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,137
How far did you get?

501
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,040
Two liters of saline,
two units of IV insulin.

502
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,943
He's still altered,
up in the PICU.

503
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,329
And he was seen here five
months ago for gastroenteritis

504
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:06,198
Apparently.

505
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:07,866
If his glucose was 980 today,

506
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,484
it must've been
high five months ago.

507
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,785
You'd think so.

508
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,787
So why didn't anyone
pick up the diabetes then?

509
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,623
I really couldn't
say. Excuse me.

510
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,842
Dr. Greene, could you
take a look at this elbow film?

511
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,110
What's the problem?

512
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,648
Big anterior fat pad,
but I don't see a fracture.

513
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:23,932
Are you the Attending? Yeah.

514
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,667
Dr. Tillman, Century
Managed Care,

515
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,935
I'm admitting Eddie Bernero.

516
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,537
Oh, the diabetic coma?

517
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,072
Yeah. I was wondering why
no one picked up on his diabetes

518
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,541
when you guys saw
him in November.

519
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,608
Do you have the old chart?

520
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,276
Here's a copy.

521
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,679
Cleo, what was the glucose?

522
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,831
980.

523
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,983
No, not today. Back in November.

524
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,373
It should be in the chart.

525
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,338
No urine dip?

526
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,073
Not that I saw.

527
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,808
I'm gonna have
to look into this.

528
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:50,809
I'll give ya a call you.

529
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,116
Thanks. Dr. Finch.

530
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:58,066
Looks okay. An anterior
fat pad can be normal.

531
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,385
Thanks.

532
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:02,053
Is there something you didn't
wanna say in front of him?

533
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,054
About what?

534
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,857
The diabetic kid.

535
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:07,058
He was Carter's patient.

536
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,326
Mark. You're not in surgery?

537
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,995
We can't seem to
give this kidney away.

538
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,964
We're going through
potential recipients like...

539
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,099
Crap through a goose?

540
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:15,967
Yeah. That works.

541
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,537
Um, The Morgan Center's
going to be calling you.

542
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:19,538
Hospice or rehab?

543
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,773
The hospice.

544
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:21,774
What patient?

545
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:23,442
Uh, your father
asked me about it.

546
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,444
I think he's leaning
towards palliative care.

547
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,045
You went ahead
and called a place?

548
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,213
Yeah, well, he asked me to.

549
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,181
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What
the hell are you doing?

550
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,384
Mark, he asked me to help.
What would you have me do?

551
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:34,286
Well, tell him talk to me.

552
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,287
Well, he's a grown man.

553
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:37,389
Yeah, with a stubborn
streak a mile long.

554
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,191
The only other option
is your apartment...

555
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,592
I'm aware of my options.

556
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:41,810
With you looking after him.

557
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,244
A nurse's aid during the day.

558
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,245
I'll do the rest.

559
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,597
You talked to him about this?

560
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:48,581
I'm handling it, okay?
Or at least I was. Mark!

561
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,103
I didn't mean to interfere.

562
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:52,576
Then don't.

563
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,076
Is this what's best for
your father or for you?

564
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,885
Elizabeth, stay
out of it, please.

565
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,619
Fine.

566
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,956
I can send her up now.

567
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,212
Good. Thanks.

568
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,159
They can squeeze you in.

569
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,629
I can't see my own ob-gyn?

570
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:20,499
No. There's too many
potential complications

571
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:22,433
with your renal failure.

572
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:24,135
Dr. Kovac? Yeah?

573
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,304
This is Steve Maldonado. Oh.

574
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,873
The transplant candidate. Right.

575
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:29,007
You the surgeon?

576
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,710
No, but we'll get
you started here.

577
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:35,130
I-I was going to the movies,
and I left my pager at home.

578
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,833
And I went home to
get it, and it went off.

579
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,935
I had it on for
maybe 30 seconds.

580
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,105
Yeah. The nurses
need to draw your labs.

581
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,406
This way. Oh. Okay.

582
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,097
Good luck. Yeah, thanks.

583
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:50,484
You all right?

584
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,803
If I could have
both, I would be.

585
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,791
But I do want the baby.

586
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,406
Ask for Christine Collins.

587
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,808
Suite, uh, 4020.

588
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,495
Okay. Bye.

589
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,018
Bye.

590
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,099
Okay, Mr. Waters.

591
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,335
The geneticist is
Dr. Kevin Casey.

592
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,770
I've made an appointment
for you for next Friday at 11

593
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,906
to go over the results.

594
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,741
Uh-oh. I've just been ordered

595
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,476
to appear in court
Friday afternoon.

596
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,411
The incident... this morning.

597
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,746
I can make a day out of it.

598
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,114
Well, uncontrolled temper

599
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,699
is a symptom of Huntington's.

600
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,318
They might not
hold you responsible.

601
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,441
That's a pretty lousy excuse.

602
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,389
How is Jo doing?

603
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,492
She's meeting Glen
out in the lobby right now.

604
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,911
That's her fiancé.

605
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:42,386
Does she, um, want
to have the test?

606
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:46,034
I didn't tell her.

607
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:49,638
Mr. Waters, you have to.

608
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,940
I mean, if she has
the Huntington's gene,

609
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,542
she will eventually
get the disease.

610
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,377
Listen, my father didn't tell
me and I'm glad he didn't.

611
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,797
Well, she has a right to know.

612
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,699
If there's nothing that
she can do about it,

613
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:02,100
what's the good in her knowing?

614
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,186
But if she knows,
she can do something.

615
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,487
She can make different choices.

616
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,889
She might not want to work.

617
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,441
She might not want
to have children.

618
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,243
She might not get married.

619
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,228
Might not have a life.

620
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,463
She has to know that
she can pass this disease

621
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,032
on to her children.

622
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,337
Why? So she can
decide not have to any?

623
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:22,942
I love my daughter.

624
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,992
And I can't imagine
my life without her.

625
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:28,994
She's had a good
life up until now.

626
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:30,712
A happy life.

627
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:34,254
I'm gonna keep it that
way for as long as I can.

628
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,552
If you sign an
emergency consent,

629
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,520
I can overturn the
guardian's decision.

630
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,956
Doesn't DCFS have to appoint me?

631
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,857
Yeah, I already cleared
it with her, though.

632
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,092
I don't know, Kerry.

633
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,061
She's gonna die of
pneumonia sooner or later.

634
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,328
Her mother wants it.

635
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,197
Her foster mother.

636
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,966
She's had Angie for four years.

637
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,500
She might as well be her mother.

638
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,070
She hasn't adopted her
because she can't afford the bills.

639
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,370
But the state can?

640
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,673
How many hundreds of
thousands have been spent so far?

641
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,109
Mark. All right,
all right, I'll sign.

642
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,276
Thank you.

643
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,578
Let me know how she responds.

644
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,497
I will.

645
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:12,404
Can I help you, Robert?

646
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,239
My niece used to
watch <i>Sesame Street.</i>

647
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,840
Outgrew it when she was about 8.

648
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,442
Yeah, those are the<i> Muppets.</i>

649
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,044
Is there something
that you need?

650
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:21,430
I came in here looking for
Jevity and a Dobhoff tube...

651
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,849
By the way, we need to
discuss your supply management.

652
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:25,683
And I find this
girl's foster parent

653
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:28,937
conspiring with DCFS,
and apparently with you,

654
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,488
to circumvent
the state authority

655
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:31,890
and perform a
procedure on a girl

656
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,159
who has been a
gork most of her life

657
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:37,617
and has no chance of recovery.
Did I understand this correctly?

658
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,464
You're overstating it. Am I?

659
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:43,367
Yes, she has a potentially
life-threatening infection.

660
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:45,737
All she needs is a central line.

661
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,328
And her so-called
guardian has never seen her.

662
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:51,209
Well, I've seen her.

663
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,912
We have an obligation to
provide appropriate care.

664
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,647
All I'm doing is exercising

665
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,449
a safeguard that's
built into the system.

666
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,183
You're letting
sympathy for the mother

667
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,719
override your clinical judgment.

668
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:03,944
I disagree. But thank
you for your input.

669
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,028
This girl is not to
get a central line.

670
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:12,330
She's my patient. Hydrate
her through her G tube

671
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:14,899
and keep her comfortable. I
already have a second opinion.

672
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,301
I'm the final opinion. I'm
not getting in a pissing match

673
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,569
with the Welfare Department.

674
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,839
It's one bureaucrat.
And he is right.

675
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:24,597
It's hopeless and exorbitantly
expensive. Stop flogging her!

676
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,944
Frankly, I've come to expect

677
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,847
a higher level of
professionalism from you.

678
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:31,249
I'm supporting what I
see as a parental decision!

679
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:33,452
Angie is essentially
the woman's daughter!

680
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,670
She's her pet!

681
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,104
Look at this girl.

682
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,257
What kind of quality of
life do you think she has?

683
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,691
Robert.

684
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:41,995
Kerry, I'm serious.

685
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,619
No central line.

686
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,887
Has he always had asthma?

687
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,488
Yeah, since he was about 3.

688
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,690
I'm okay, Mom.

689
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,859
You are not okay, Troy.

690
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,560
I was sitting in the
audience watching,

691
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,863
and I could see his wheezing
getting worse and worse.

692
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,031
Breathe.

693
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,700
She came up and pulled
me right off the stage.

694
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,201
Oh, that's no fun, is it?

695
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,704
I don't ever wanna
go back to school.

696
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,939
Cleo, we got a bounce-back
from this morning.

697
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,158
Paramedics brought him in.

698
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:15,160
Collapsed at home.
Loss of consciousness.

699
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,161
Who?

700
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,496
Patient named Grunwald.

701
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,063
Grunwald?

702
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,421
He was constipated. Excuse me.

703
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,784
Pulse is down to 50!

704
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,386
He's unresponsive. Atropine.

705
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,355
Put in a liter of saline.
See if you can get a BP.

706
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,523
What happened?

707
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,491
He was getting off
the toilet, just fell over.

708
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,660
See if you can get first
aid labs, cardiac enzymes.

709
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,961
Pressure's 60 palp.

710
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,730
Mix up the dopamine.
He was your patient?

711
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,998
Yeah, abdominal pain.
Wasn't a surgical belly.

712
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:40,235
Well, we got ST elevations
in the inferior leads.

713
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,037
Any history of heart
disease? No, right?

714
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,822
You said he didn't
have cardiac problems.

715
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:45,023
His heart is fine.

716
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,124
Is he on any medications?

717
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:48,393
Codeine. A-and
what she gave him.

718
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,611
What was that? A laxative.

719
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:54,416
Uh, Bisopro... Bisoprol...
Bisoprolol? Yes.

720
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,701
No, no. We gave him bisacodyl.

721
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,003
Ho-ho, which one was it?

722
00:27:58,027 --> 00:27:59,437
This is Bisoprolol,

723
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,923
but it's not what we gave him.

724
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,925
Hal. Hal, wake up!

725
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,594
Can you have her
wait outside, please?

726
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,229
Ma'am, could you come with
me? No, I should stay here!

727
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,231
We need to work on your
husband, Mrs. Grunwald.

728
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,134
Call the cath lab. Mary,
bolus 5000 units of heparin.

729
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,536
What are you doing? You
gave him a beta blocker?

730
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,305
I didn't. At twice
the starting dosage.

731
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,574
You dropped his heart rate,
pulse, and gave him an MI.

732
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,875
BP's improving, 80 systolic.

733
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,744
Up the dopamine.
Stand by with a nitro drip.

734
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,946
I didn't write the
prescription. You said you did.

735
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,447
I handed it to
him, didn't write it.

736
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,649
Well, who wrote it?

737
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:28,883
Dr. Kovac, Yeah.

738
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,019
The labs are back on
the transplant recipient.

739
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,320
Good. Get ready to move him.

740
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,590
No, no, you're gonna
wanna look at this.

741
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,325
You're kidding? Nope.

742
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,094
What do you want me to say?
It's okay to tell the daughter?

743
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,397
I think it's debatable. No,
his choice is debatable,

744
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,931
not your obligation.

745
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,501
I have information that
could drastically affect her life,

746
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,103
and I'm hiding it. I feel I
have an obligation to her.

747
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,173
Right, but she is not
your patient. He is.

748
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,774
All you can do is
try and convince him.

749
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,544
I did try. Then
you can't tell her.

750
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:59,614
Your renal failure was
caused by rhabdomyolysis.

751
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,015
Yeah. From muscle breakdown.

752
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,651
And what caused that?

753
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:03,818
I don't know.

754
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,391
I think you do.

755
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,422
I was in a car accident
a few years ago.

756
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,609
It crushed my leg. They
think that could've done it.

757
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:11,993
Not using drugs?

758
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,366
No.

759
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:17,537
You tested positive for cocaine.

760
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:22,254
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was this high on the list.

761
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:24,839
I don't do it all the time. I
went to a party, you know.

762
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,207
I was depressed.

763
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,459
The damn dialysis.

764
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,710
You better get used to it.

765
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,478
You're not gonna
give me the transplant?

766
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,180
The cocaine
destroyed your kidneys.

767
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,799
You're still using. Why
would we give you another?

768
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,219
I won't do it after the
operation. I'm not stupid.

769
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,153
You should have told
me. You wasted my time.

770
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,472
Please, come on.

771
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:43,475
I'm not an addict.
I need this kidney.

772
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:45,409
The organ is only
viable for a limited time.

773
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:48,780
I have less than an hour to
get a real candidate in here.

774
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:51,283
You mean someone
who deserves it.

775
00:29:51,307 --> 00:29:53,952
Yes.

776
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:55,920
Dr. Chen?

777
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,310
Oh, one second.

778
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,657
Yes?

779
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,426
This is, uh, Glen, my fiancé.

780
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,961
Oh, how do you do? Good, thanks.

781
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:04,496
We were talking about Dad.

782
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,965
Glen thinks he might be
suffering from depression.

783
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,816
You know, the mood
swings and stuff.

784
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,469
Yeah, it might be the wedding.
We're married in a month,

785
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:12,870
and I know he
wanted to pay for it.

786
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,205
But it costs a lot of money.

787
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,924
Yeah, that would be tough.

788
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:19,160
I know, and Jo is
his only daughter.

789
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,813
All right, I'll get the car.
Nice to meet you, Dr. Chen.

790
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,648
Mm-hm.

791
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:25,789
So you think that's
what it is? Depression?

792
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,676
Uh, well, it's hard to say.

793
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:33,757
Are you ready to go, Dad?

794
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:35,341
Yeah, I am. I am.

795
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,697
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

796
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:40,448
Mm. Mm.

797
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,450
Thanks for everything.

798
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,757
You're welcome.

799
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,598
Kerry?

800
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,500
I thought Romano
said no to a central line.

801
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,884
He did.

802
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,936
But you're doing it, anyway?

803
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,405
I have emergency consent
from another physician.

804
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,541
That's all I need.

805
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,693
I've got this, Carol.
You're gonna need Opsite.

806
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:10,779
I said, I've got it.

807
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:13,881
But, Kerry... It's my decision.

808
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,171
It doesn't involve you.

809
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,227
Okay.

810
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,773
Well, looks like a
"P" to me. Bisoprolol.

811
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,410
It's a "C." Why would I order a
beta blocker for constipation?

812
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,917
What's that say, Carter?

813
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,164
Well, I can see how the pharmacy

814
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:48,933
could have read it wrong.

815
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,369
But they really
should've called. Sure.

816
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,503
Blame them, you coward.

817
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:54,038
It could have been
read both ways.

818
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,458
Hey, you, come here. I
need an impartial observer.

819
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,877
Come on, that's a faxed
copy... Quiet, Peter.

820
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,045
Is that a "C" or a "P"?

821
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,880
It looks like a "Q."

822
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:03,715
Someone else who can't read it.

823
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,183
I prescribed bisacodyl.

824
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,218
That's what I ordered.
That's what I wrote.

825
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:09,320
Why is he currently
undergoing an angioplasty

826
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,606
for a life-threatening
myocaridial infarction?

827
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,641
You heard me say bisacodyl?

828
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,110
Yeah.

829
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:18,063
Did you even bother to
read the pharmacy label

830
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:19,464
before you handed it out?

831
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:21,032
There was a trauma coming in.

832
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:23,535
Oh. Oh, a trauma came in.

833
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,787
Oh, well, then that
makes everything okay.

834
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,490
When traumas come in, we can
hand out any meds laying around.

835
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,658
Dr. Romano... What's
it have to do with you?

836
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,876
Nothing. So shut up.

837
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,211
Can I go? The growing level

838
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:35,213
of incompetence
around here is frightening.

839
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:37,582
Amazing we're not shut
down. It was an honest mistake.

840
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:40,006
No, it was tag-team negligence.

841
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:44,905
Okay, you are both prohibited

842
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,092
from writing prescriptions
until further notice.

843
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:48,843
How are we supposed
to treat patients?

844
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,928
I'm sure Dr. Carter or
one of the other colleagues

845
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:52,430
will be happy to
write them for you.

846
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:53,697
How long?

847
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,517
Until your penmanship improves,

848
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,651
and until you can read.

849
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,635
I know how to read. Then do it!

850
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,528
Ooh.

851
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,196
Thank you, Carter.

852
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,869
Thank you, Carter.

853
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,704
So you just gave
him a bottle of pills

854
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,472
without even looking at it?

855
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,142
Peter, what you
wrote wasn't legible.

856
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,511
I shouldn't be writing
your scrips, anyway.

857
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,613
I didn't ask you to.
He was your patient.

858
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,882
You always check the
label before you give drugs.

859
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:30,406
They teach you that
on the first day, Cleo.

860
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,322
<i>You called UNOS?</i>

861
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,224
I needed to get the
next person on the list.

862
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,259
Mrs. Nussbaum,

863
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,028
she is coming in
from upstate Indiana,

864
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,596
and she'll be
here in 40 minutes.

865
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,497
Well, that'll push me
past the 12-hour mark.

866
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,666
The new kidney might fail.

867
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,034
I thought we were at 10 hours.

868
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,269
Luka, We need to do a
workup, get preop labs.

869
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,637
She may have eaten a heavy meal,

870
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,539
in which case we need
to wait to anesthetize.

871
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,140
Let's assess her
when she gets here.

872
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,076
She's already on her way.

873
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,045
You should've talked
to me before you called.

874
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,047
We were in a hurry,
and we had to move on.

875
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,448
Look, you may not like this guy,

876
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,717
but we have a match in-house
who's ready for surgery.

877
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,686
Come on, you can't be serious.

878
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,254
I'd rather put a healthy kidney
in a questionable candidate

879
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,156
than no kidney in anyone.

880
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,392
The guy knows he's
on the UNOS list,

881
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,094
knows he can be
called at any moment,

882
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,929
and he's snorting cocaine?

883
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,665
He's not going to stop using
because he gets the transplant.

884
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,601
He'll burn his way
through another organ.

885
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,035
We've been through three people.

886
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,004
Your Mrs. Nussbaum
might not get here in time.

887
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:25,773
Or she might not qualify for
some reason. It'll go to waste.

888
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,192
Then let it go to waste.

889
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:28,943
I'd rather risk it
than give it to him.

890
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,495
It's not your risk to take.

891
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,162
The guy made his choice.

892
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,266
Give the next person
a chance to get here.

893
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:40,193
Thirty minutes. Then I'm
taking up Mr. Maldonado.

894
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,624
I'm not releasing him.

895
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:45,048
I don't need you to.

896
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:49,547
<i>They've never gone
up a tree before.</i>

897
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:52,049
<i>No, they usually
just go out on a limb.</i>

898
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:54,319
<i>Okay. Well, it was a great show,</i>

899
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,222
<i>and I have certainly
had a good time.</i>

900
00:34:57,246 --> 00:34:58,756
She likes this
one, I guess, huh?

901
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,963
It's her favorite.

902
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:06,664
Most doctors think

903
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,967
she's just responding
to the light changes.

904
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,391
But I notice a difference.

905
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,990
At least I think I do.

906
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,797
Dr. Weaver put
in a central line?

907
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,737
I know you think it's too much.

908
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:31,144
But... I'm not ready
to give her up yet.

909
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,382
I understand.

910
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:40,052
Excuse me.

911
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,889
Thank you.

912
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,576
You're welcome.

913
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:55,179
Strep throat in Curtain 2
ready to be discharged.

914
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,115
Did he get penicillin? Yep.

915
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,871
Curtain 3...

916
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:07,992
Were my instructions
in any way... unclear?

917
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:10,962
No, I-I think you made
your position known.

918
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:12,797
And you decided to ignore it?

919
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,565
I took it under
advisement. I see, okay.

920
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,866
Well, then you're suspended.

921
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,902
Sign out your
patients and go home.

922
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,286
Robert, let's... Right
now, Kerry. Right now.

923
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,941
Suspended?
Effective immediately,

924
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:26,132
and until further notice.

925
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,516
Carter, you going home?

926
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,918
Yeah.

927
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,486
I really wish I weren't, though.

928
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,488
My, uh, grandparents
are throwing

929
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,690
one of their dinner parties.

930
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,191
You have to go?

931
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,860
I'm staying there, so
attendance is kind of compulsory.

932
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,978
I have a question for you.

933
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:02,179
Shoot.

934
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:05,400
A 12-year-old presents
with abdominal pain, diarrhea,

935
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,568
low-grade fever,
no ill contacts.

936
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,187
What do you do?

937
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,688
Any vomiting?

938
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:11,889
No.

939
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:14,058
Probably gastroenteritis.

940
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:16,027
But that sounds like
a trick question to me.

941
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:18,996
So I'd probably order
a CBC and dip a urine

942
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,832
to rule out a UTI.

943
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:23,084
That's what I thought you'd do.

944
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:24,786
Do I pick up anything abnormal?

945
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,420
Nothing on the CBC.

946
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,422
And, uh, I don't
know about the urine

947
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,558
because... you didn't order one.

948
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,627
Eddie Bernero.
You saw him last fall.

949
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,897
Came back today
with... Type two diabetes.

950
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,698
Hyperosmolar coma.

951
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,667
Cleo told me. Uh-huh.

952
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,169
Is he gonna be okay?

953
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:43,037
Should be.

954
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,739
Would have been nice
if we caught it earlier.

955
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,475
Yeah, kid must not
have looked that sick.

956
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,278
What did I say? Stomach flu?

957
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:51,534
Yep.

958
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:56,701
Yeah, I really wish I
could remember him.

959
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:58,102
I feel bad.

960
00:37:58,126 --> 00:37:59,287
Must've misdiagnosed.

961
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,155
He didn't have any insurance.

962
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,573
Really? What are they gonna do?

963
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:04,909
Well, they're okay.
They have it now.

964
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:06,699
Oh, good.

965
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,315
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me, Carter?

966
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,950
No.

967
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:15,341
I made a mistake, I'm sorry.

968
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,979

969
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:23,511

Yes, Peter?

972
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,709
I didn't like how
we left things.

973
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,065
You mean, you screaming at me?

974
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:00,720
You mind if I come in?

975
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:05,403

1032
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,628
I checked it out.

1033
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,586
There weren't any
spots available.

1034
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,152
Well, when will they
have one available?

1035
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:10,955
I don't know. They didn't say.

1036
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:12,523

00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,960

1055
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:52,413
You had a 50-50 shot.

1056
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,653
No. She's the troublemaker.

1057
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,668
Yeah.

1058
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:01,255
Do you think
these are too thick?

1059
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,224
They might be rare inside.

1060
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,226
Well, don't worry.
If you blow it,

1061
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,795
I think I have a steak and
kidney pie in the freezer.

1062
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:08,962
Kidney, huh?

1063
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,946
Very funny.

1064
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,201
You know, the nurses
were about to take a poll.

1065
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,569
Thought you'd actually
have to take it home with you.

1066
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:18,222
I might as well have.

1067
00:43:18,246 --> 00:43:21,213
No, you probably
scared the guy into rehab.

1068
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,233
Well...

1069
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:29,688
What's wrong?

1070
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,058
What? Is...? Is that snow?

1071
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:36,929
Oh, man!

1072
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:41,045
Hello! It's April!

1073
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:42,512
We can finish cooking inside.

1074
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,381
No, I came here to barbecue.

1075
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:45,649
You wanna freeze?

1076
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:47,017
Come on, it's a little snow.

1077
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,318
I'm gonna get you a sweater.

1078
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:50,253
I don't think your
sweaters will fit me.

1079
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:51,978
I'll find something.
