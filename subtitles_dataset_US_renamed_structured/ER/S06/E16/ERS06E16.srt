1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,655
<i>Pass me some tape.</i>

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,190
Not that much.

3
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,460
Dad, you gotta finish up, okay?

4
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,794
I'm on at 3.

5
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,696
You got that bulb?

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,297
You're lucky I found it.

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,350
They don't make these anymore.

8
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:26,919
Bet we haven't looked at
these slides in 25 years.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,806
Your mother made me
drag that camera everywhere.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,360
I made an appointment for you
on Monday with the oncologist.

11
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:36,229
I told you I didn't want that.

12
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,052
Would you at least talk to him?

13
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,005
You got that bulb?

14
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,010
Don't get your
fingerprints on it.

15
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,209
In San Diego they said
the cancer was incurable.

16
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,794
Doesn't mean we can't treat it.

17
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,483
Plug that in, will you?

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,694
It's our trip to the
Grand Canyon.

19
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,342
You must have
bought the wrong bulb.

20
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,392
You left this in
the hall closet.

21
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,061
Oh, I always pack
the garment bag last.

22
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:11,297
Be a dear and, um,
empty me the top drawer.

23
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,699
I can't stay long.

24
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:15,256
I've got an incarcerated
hernia in the O.R.

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,140
What shall I do with this?

26
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:22,075
Would you mind
returning it to David?

27
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,528
Do you suppose he
wore only one sock home?

28
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:26,246
He's a sweet man.

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,914
Much like his son.

30
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:30,250
Does that mean you approve?

31
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,718
Oh, I more than approve.

32
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,853
I've seen how you glow
whenever he's around.

33
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:36,021
You two belong together.

34
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:39,325
Since when have you been
an expert on relationships?

35
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,427
I've enjoyed being single.

36
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,929
I've no regrets.

37
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:46,932
But what about you, Elizabeth?

38
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:49,302
What will make you happy?

39
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,803
Do you really
want to discuss this

40
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:52,107
as you're about to leave?

41
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,260
Uh, look, your plane
doesn't leave till 10.

42
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,762
Why don't you
drop by the hospital?

43
00:01:58,786 --> 00:01:59,796
We'll grab a coffee.

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,198
Yes. Absolutely.

45
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,755
I'd love that.

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,953
Mother?

47
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,779
Would you return those, as well?

48
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:21,834
Welcome back, Carter.

49
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:22,869
Thank you, Haleh.

50
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,271
Hey. How you feelin'?

51
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,140
Ready to go. Yeah?

52
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:28,541
Hey, you know, I saw your MRI.

53
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,442
Looks like you're
recovering just fine.

54
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,444
Yeah, I should be able
to get rid of these things

55
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,479
in about a week or two.

56
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:34,981
Carter, take your time.

57
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:36,437
Don't push it, man. All right?

58
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,485
John, how are you doing?

59
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,354
Oh. Just let me know
if you need anything.

60
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:43,738
I'm okay. Okay?

61
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,902
Hey.

62
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,109
Have you seen Abby?

63
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,276
Not lately.

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,112
Labs are back on
two of her patients.

65
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,379
We gotta move 'em.

66
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,949
You're late. Deal with this.

67
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,350
Where's Kovac and Weaver?

68
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,619
They are on tonight,
so you're the man.

69
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,809
All right.

70
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,256
Oh. Have you
checked my x-ray yet?

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,257
Uh, just a minute.

72
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,625
Abby, can you take this lady?

73
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,093
Sorry, I've got four already.

74
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,295
Randi, can you find out
who this woman's doctor is?

75
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,197
Mark, we got a lot of
angry patients waiting.

76
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,365
Yeah, it's Saturday.

77
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,367
Everyone shows up
when the clinics are closed.

78
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,468
You tell them that.

79
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,004
Dr. Greene?
Phone. It's your dad.

80
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,839
Hey. Phone book?

81
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,574
Yeah, why don't you
try the desk drawer?

82
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,976
No, Dad, I can't
hold. No, Dad...

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,844
Has anyone seen the Xeroform?

84
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,546
Uh, it's right here
under the Tegaderm.

85
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,981
Oh. Uh-huh.

86
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,483
So, uh, what time
do you get off?

87
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,818
Ten.

88
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,586
Saturday night. Whatcha doing?

89
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,587
Washing my hair.

90
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,789
Have fun.

91
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,224
Not the bedroom desk,
the living room desk.

92
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,161
Got a new one. Frank
Bacon, ICU charge nurse.

93
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,261
Passed out in the unit.

94
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,663
I feel fine. Can I
go back to work?

95
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,331
Not until we clear
you. Curtain 3.

96
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,800
I'll be right there, Mr. Bacon.

97
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,934
Call me Frank.

98
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,936
Mark! Three patients
left without being seen.

99
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,071
Listen, Dad, I gotta go.

100
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,906
Call 411, they can
help you find the place.

101
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,674
Problem? You go to do something.

102
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,410
All right. Uh, Randi, why don't
you hand me the cordless phone?

103
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,179
Haleh, bring over
the rolling cart.

104
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,182
Uh, Chen, Abby,
Malucci, over here.

105
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,883
We're gonna do power rounds.

106
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,085
Carter, you care to join?

107
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,853
Paramedics are
bringing an O.D. in.

108
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,354
Hey, you ready for that? Yeah.

109
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,978
All right. It's yours.

110
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:49,676
How are you doin'?

111
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,143
It won't stop.

112
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay. Well, Dr. Dave will be
back in a minute to fix you up.

113
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:54,947
Randi, it's Dr. Greene.

114
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,017
I need a nasal speculum
and a Merocel sponge in 3-A.

115
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,385
Thanks.

116
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,586
3-B?

117
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,154
Kim Tadlock, ascites. Okay.

118
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:03,155
CBC, chem panel,

119
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,757
and a three-way of the abdomen.

120
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,158
Should I check for a fluid wave?

121
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,461
Uh, let's get the labs
cooking first. 3-C?

122
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:09,762
I've already got him.

123
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,731
Cute guy with syncope.
He's off peeing for me.

124
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:13,867
All right. Let's go.

125
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,134
Where's she going?

126
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:17,737
Oh, Romano wants thin cuts

127
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,638
Okay, you guys ever
see a tongue-blade test?

128
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:20,940
No.

129
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,876
Ma'am, I'm gonna want
you to bite down on this

130
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,643
as hard as you can, okay?

131
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,080
And Chen, you're
gonna give it a twang.

132
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:30,183
You're gonna let us
know if it hurts, okay?

133
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:31,317
Uh-uh.

134
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:34,120
All right, no fracture.
You can cancel the CT.

135
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,121
That's it?

136
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,289
Well, why do an $800 test

137
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,441
when a simple
stick will do the trick?

138
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,708
One. Two. Three.

139
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,911
Adam Pulido, 38, altered
from a probable overdose.

140
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:42,912
I... just wanna die.

141
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:43,980
What did he take?

142
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,681
I found a bunch of
empty Benadryl packs.

143
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,150
Adam, did you
take anything else?

144
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,418
Leave me alone.

145
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,420
All right, let's start
with a CBC, EKG, lights,

146
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,687
blood and urine tox screen.

147
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,822
Carter, scoot over.

148
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,023
I need to put on the dynamap.

149
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,224
Just do it on the other side.

150
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,714
The IV's on the other side.

151
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,328
Carol?

152
00:06:58,352 --> 00:06:59,662
Your nanny's on line three.

153
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,364
Can you ask her to
hold, please. Yeah.

154
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,166
She's new. It's okay,
go ahead. Take it.

155
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,301
110/78. He's stable.

156
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,602
Hello?

157
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,737
Did you try the bouncy seat?

158
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,939
Try running the vacuum.

159
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,740
That stops her from
crying sometimes.

160
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,942
Get away! Hey, come on!

161
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,277
We're trying to help you.

162
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,378
I gotta go. Let go of me!

163
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,379
Whoa, whoa.

164
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,981
Settle down. Carter, you okay?

165
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,182
Yeah, I'm okay.

166
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,967
Just get him some
soft restraints. Okay.

167
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,453
Got a lot of fluid in there.

168
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,494
So the colon cancer spread?

169
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,025
Yeah.

170
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,393
They said that could happen

171
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,562
if I didn't respond
to the chemo.

172
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,915
Well, we should tap your belly.

173
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,333
It's pretty tender.

174
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,302
Yeah.

175
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,671
Well, could I interest
you in some morphine?

176
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,735
Really?

177
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,975
Last time they wouldn't
give me anything

178
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,177
till my labs came back
and I saw the surgeon.

179
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,480
Well, nobody should
sit around in pain.

180
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:55,217
I see you've been paying
attention on rounds, huh? Nice.

181
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,241
I'll be right back
with the morphine.

182
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:58,688
What are you doing?

183
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,355
Oh, the April nursing schedule.

184
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,725
You need to be on the
monitor. No. No, really. I'm fine.

185
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,226
Yeah, well. You know the drill.

186
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,530
Let's hook you up.

187
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:12,485
So your blood
pressure is, uh, 90 o...

188
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,737
90 over, um, 60.

189
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,071
Yeah, that's normal for me.

190
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,740
You know, all those
years of triathlon

191
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,108
and stuff like that, you know?

192
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,776
Oh. Well, we still
need to monitor you.

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,545
Oh, listen, I know
why I fainted, okay?

194
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,347
I ran 12 miles before
I came to work, right?

195
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,798
I skipped breakfast and lunch.

196
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:27,800
Wanna get something
at the cafeteria?

197
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,502
Oh, no. I never
touch that stuff.

198
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:30,858
Oh.

199
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,238
Um... Wha...?

200
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,558
What is that, uh,
on your... chain?

201
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,010
Oh. It's an ancient Roman coin.

202
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,812
I found it while I was
diving in the Mediterranean.

203
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,647
Oh, really? Yeah.

204
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,249
Hey, uh, let me
help you with that.

205
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,485
Thank you.

206
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,904
You, uh, need some
help over there, Dr. Chen?

207
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,505
No.

208
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,963
Everything is under control.

209
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:54,465
Ah. Good.

210
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,330
No, Dad. Shaumburg
is 45 minutes away.

211
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,365
I don't care if
they have the part.

212
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,856
We're gonna talk
about this later, all right?

213
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,337
Having a difference of opinion?

214
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,804
Oh, he is driving me crazy.

215
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,606
Yeah, my mother's
being unpredictable.

216
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,126
Suddenly when she's leaving,
she wants to be a parent.

217
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,560
Yeah, well, he won't listen.

218
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,479
He won't even discuss
treatment options.

219
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:14,796
For what?

220
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,882
His emphysema.

221
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,100
Is he worse?

222
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,134
I think so.

223
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,636
What do you got?

224
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,670
History of angina.

225
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,206
Fifteen minutes of chest pain.

226
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,007
Complete relief
with one nitro spray.

227
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,476
Randi, we need a monitored bed.

228
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,477
We're full.

229
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,178
Maybe you should
close to criticals.

230
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,480
No, no, no. We can handle this.

231
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:34,016
Okay, let's move
the, uh, TIA to 5.

232
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,684
CHF to 3.

233
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,520
And we're gonna put him in 2.

234
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,255
I'll see you next trauma. Okay.

235
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,212
Randi, I'm gonna get a refill.

236
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,627
Oh, I'm sorry. You
want some privacy?

237
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,884
No, no. I'm done pumping.

238
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,965
We staffed okay for tonight?

239
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,433
Down a nurse, but
I'm working on it.

240
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,135
What did I do
with that other lid?

241
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,837
This it?

242
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,305
Thanks.

243
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,773
Some days they take the bottle,

244
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,542
and other days they
just want their mom.

245
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,977
That's why they're so cranky.

246
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,678
Carol? Carter needs
you back in trauma.

247
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,580
Can you cover? I'm sorry.

248
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,781
GSW to the head coming in.

249
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,849
Okay.

250
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,102
I'll get the gunshot.

251
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,669
How much Ativan's on board?

252
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,904
Four. Push another two.

253
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,173
Sats are down to 81. I
need an intubation tray.

254
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,541
How long has he been seizing?

255
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:17,410
Three minutes. It's
worse than we thought.

256
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,378
Carol, would you bag
him? He's not breathing.

257
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,847
BP's only 60 systolic.

258
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,649
All right, start a dopamine.

259
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:24,939
10 mics per kilo.

260
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,671
You all right? Yeah.

261
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,890
Just pump up the bed.

262
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,592
He's bradying down.

263
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,793
I'm getting Mark.

264
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:36,295
No, no. I can do this.
Stop, that's high enough.

265
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,497
Conni, why don't you
go page the renal fellow?

266
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,154
This guy's gonna need dialysis.

267
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,601
All right. I'm in.

268
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,136
Any idea who who shot him?

269
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,806
No. Probably a
drug deal gone bad.

270
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,540
Abby, I want you to glove up

271
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,277
'cause you gotta
put in a central line.

272
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:54,980
On my count. One. Two. Three.

273
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:57,883
Order a head CT
and lateral C-spine.

274
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,884
Don't bother.

275
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,652
There's gray matter everywhere.

276
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,121
Okay, blown pupil on the right.

277
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,223
Let's start mannitol
and hyperventilate.

278
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,524
We have an organ donor here.

279
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:06,909
BP's 80 palp.

280
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,945
Okay, let's get his pressure up.

281
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,697
Is this a good angle?

282
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,171
Aim it towards
the sternal notch.

283
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,222
I hit the clavicle.

284
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:22,796
March it down slowly until
you slip under the bone.

285
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:26,762
Okay, lower the angle,

286
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,266
or you'll give him
a pneumothorax.

287
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,569
I'm still up against the bone.

288
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,842
Pull out and reposition.

289
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,407
Mark, we need that line in now.

290
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,409
Give her a chance.

291
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,145
This guy's brain-dead.

292
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,330
I'm not getting a flash.

293
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,181
Okay, we're not
perfusing his organs.

294
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,750
I'm sorry, Abby,
I'll have to do it.

295
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,752
Got a driver's license.

296
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,853
His name's Robert
Jackson from Naperville.

297
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,206
He's 18.

298
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,591
Okay, do whatever you
can to track down his parents.

299
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,877
We need their consent
to make him a donor.

300
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,078
Okay, I've got it.

301
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,662
Let's get two liters
on the rapid infuser.

302
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,484
Look at this. His
QRS is widening.

303
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:06,518
He needs dialysis.

304
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,087
There's no
indication for dialysis

305
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:09,554
in Benadryl
overdose. Look it up.

306
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,722
I read a case in the annals,

307
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,824
and they saved the patient
using hemoperfusion.

308
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:14,360
I know the pharmacokinetics.

309
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,529
Extra-corporeal
elimination won't work.

310
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,297
Well, we should give
it a try. Oh, no, no.

311
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,732
I'm not putting this
man at risk for hemolysis

312
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,119
and charcoal embolism
for an unproven procedure

313
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,988
you read about in an
emergency journal. Excuse me.

314
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,490
This is not a renal case.

315
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,314
Like hell it isn't.

316
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,362
Want me to push more bicarb?

317
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,530
It won't help.

318
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,965
Run of seven.

319
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,268
Well, damn it, I'm not gonna
stand here and watch him arrest.

320
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,803
I'll write the dialysis orders.

321
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,108
A nephrologist has to do that.

322
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,513
The article says
exactly what to do.

323
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,695
Kerry once did
hemoperfusion on an O.D.

324
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,553
Well, we should do
it. I know this will work.

325
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,983
Okay. Write out the orders.

326
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,486
I know a dialysis nurse.
She won't question it.

327
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,543
Set me up for a femoral line.

328
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,994
You wanna run this?
If you back me up.

329
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,830
Pulseless, V-tach.
What do you wanna do?

330
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,097
Uh, defibrillate at 200.

331
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,399
Sounds good to me.

332
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,223
Charged and ready. Okay, Clear.

333
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,003
Whoa!

334
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,371
Oh, sh... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

335
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,355
Get some water!

336
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,057
All right, turn off the oxygen.

337
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,242
He's still in V-tach.
Start compressions.

338
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,294
Oh, it smells!

339
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:23,546
Two prep razors.
I got this side.

340
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,469
Abby, get the paddles.

341
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:29,135
Hey, Rambo. Why
aren't you up in the ICU?

342
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,269
He's my patient.

343
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,687
I thought your name was Frank.

344
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,671
It's my nickname
from Desert Storm.

345
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,464
Okay, clear!

346
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,062
Normal sinus.

347
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,366
I've never seen
that happen before.

348
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,367
Me either.

349
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,934
Sometimes you
just gotta wing it.

350
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,959
Whew.

351
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,806
We're following that case study

352
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,074
for massive overdose.

353
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,143
Examine 2 is set up for
charcoal hemoperfusion.

354
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,400
Good. Keep me posted.

355
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,748
What's up?

356
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,050
Dropped his pressure.

357
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,052
He needs more volume.
Lily, another two units.

358
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,320
If it's brain stem failure,
you don't have much time.

359
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,522
I know, that's why we need

360
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,889
to get him to the O.R.

361
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,124
Did you find his family?

362
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,893
I'm sorry, it's a phony license.

363
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,261
Kids buy 'em on the street.

364
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,363
Well, maybe he's
been reported missing.

365
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,732
We sent out his photo. So
far, nothing's come back.

366
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,818
Keep on trying. We
need that consent.

367
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,320
Pressure's up to 90.

368
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:22,827
That's encouraging.

369
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,641
Even with consent,
it could take hours

370
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,460
to line up the
procurement teams.

371
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:28,894
Elizabeth, be realistic.

372
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,646
I could save five
lives with his organs.

373
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,831
Or he could arrest first.

374
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,503
I won't let that happen.

375
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,136
Let Kate sleep for another hour,

376
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,570
and then wake
her for her bottle.

377
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:39,738
Carol?

378
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:42,207
I'll talk to you later.

379
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:46,233
Carol, I need 3-0 nylon.
Dori, I think we are ready.

380
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:49,181
Aah! Oh.

381
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,349
You okay?

382
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,268
I think I just
contaminated my gloves.

383
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,986
Sorry, I shouldn't
have made you reach.

384
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,253
Just give me another pair.

385
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,945
Uh, did Dr. Krupp say
why he's using citrate?

386
00:14:58,447 --> 00:14:59,774
No.

387
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,744
That's weird. He
always uses heparin.

388
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,946
You know what? I
better go page him.

389
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,581
Oh, did he say when
to check an A.C.T.?

390
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,367
Uh... Do it 30
minutes into the run.

391
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,768
Well, I better check with him.

392
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,620
He's very particular
about his orders.

393
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,756
Dori, these aren't his orders.

394
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,876
Yeah, Krupp wouldn't help
us. We took them from a journal.

395
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,045
I won't do this
without his orders.

396
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:22,048
Look at the heart monitor.
His complexes are narrowing.

397
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:24,216
I'm gonna lose my job.
We're saving his life.

398
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,202
No. We're stopping.

399
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,953
I'll take full responsibility.

400
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,576
Hey, Carter, you wanna explain?

401
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,224
I told you about this.

402
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,727
Well, did he tell you that
nephrology refused to sign on?

403
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,461
Mark, it's working.
Just let us finish.

404
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,263
Carter, step out.

405
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:41,856
Carol, monitor his vitals.
Keep the dialysis going.

406
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,568
Sorry, Dori.

407
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,070
I'll speak with
the renal service.

408
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,094
Okay.

409
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,960
You have a problem with another
department, you come to me.

410
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,244
My patient's improving.

411
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,146
Fine, but you didn't
give me the whole story.

412
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,165
Let me break rules.
That's what I'm here for.

413
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,166
I can handle this.

414
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,367
It's your first day back.

415
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,002
You don't have
to prove anything.

416
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,387
Mark, we need you.

417
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:03,989
I wanna know everything
you're doing to this guy.

418
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,691
Six months old with
fever and vomiting.

419
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,959
Now lethargic after a
seizure. Couldn't get a line.

420
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,261
Uh-huh. Where's Cleo?

421
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,229
It's her day off. Okay.

422
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:12,598
Has she had seizures before?

423
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:13,999
No, she's a very good baby.

424
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,367
When did the vomiting start?

425
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,102
After she woke up from her nap.

426
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,103
What's her name?

427
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,647
Estrella. Is she okay?

428
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:22,674
Uh, she looks dehydrated.

429
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:25,711
Chuny, set me up
with an interosseus line.

430
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,846
Bolus, 20 per kilo of saline.

431
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,047
She's tachy at 160.

432
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,517
Okay. CBC, lytes,
blood and urine cultures.

433
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,052
Full septic workup.

434
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,076
<i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

435
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,542
What are you doing?

436
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,910
We need to put
this into the bone

437
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,711
to give her fluids.

438
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,496
Please don't hurt her.

439
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,967
Chuny, take her to Chairs.

440
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,868
Bring her back
after the spinal tap.

441
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,236
No. I want to
stay with the baby.

442
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,639
Can I stay with my
baby? Come on, honey.

443
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:56,175
Doctor, please. Can I
just stay with my baby?

444
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,860
It's okay.

445
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,115
Still in normal sinus,
doc. So how much longer?

446
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,683
Until your electrolytes
come back.

447
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:05,985
What about my patients?

448
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,153
Well, I told told the unit
you're taking a sick day.

449
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:09,805
They called in backup.

450
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,307
Well, then I guess
I'm your prisoner.

451
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,308
Excuse me.

452
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,543
Have you seen Dr. Greene?

453
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,629
He's supposed to help
me with this paracentesis.

454
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:19,415
Uh, he's in Trauma. I can do it.

455
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,816
Kim, this is Dr. Chen. Hey, doc.

456
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,183
Hello.

457
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,085
I've numbed the lower
left quadrant. Good.

458
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,804
Uh, 14-gauge angiocath okay?

459
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:28,188
Yeah, use a Z-track
so it won't leak.

460
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:31,043
And, um, what labs
should I send off?

461
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,445
Cell count, glucose,
protein, amale, psychology,

462
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,963
Gram's stain and culture.

463
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:35,981
Thank you, Frank.

464
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:37,905
No problem. There's the fluid.

465
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,109
Good flow. You got it from here?

466
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,276
Yeah. Thank you.

467
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,312
Okay, I'll be in Exam 4. Okay.

468
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,047
Well, that wasn't so bad.

469
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,783
Oh, actually, it's
starting to hurt.

470
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,685
I can readjust the
catheter for you.

471
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,370
Hey!

472
00:17:58,394 --> 00:17:59,371
Uh-oh.

473
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,539
If I were you,

474
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:02,563
I'd order an upright
chest film, stat.

475
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:05,427
<i>Lost the pulse.</i>

476
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,694
She's in V-tach.

477
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,830
Start compressions.
Charge the paddles to 20.

478
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,632
Bag her. What's going on?

479
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,634
Probably septic.
Could be meningitis.

480
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,658
Clear.

481
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,305
What do you want, Carter?

482
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,439
I can come back.

483
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,291
Charge again. What's up?

484
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,760
My overdose guy's
QRS is down to .12.

485
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,044
Weened him off pressors.

486
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,079
Clear.

487
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,297
Go on.

488
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,815
He's waking up.
Can I extubate him?

489
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,784
Charging. Give him
another half an hour.

490
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,785
Clear.

491
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,786
Thanks.

492
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,588
Hey. What are you doin'?

493
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,022
Checking labs.

494
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,624
We don't allow
patients back here.

495
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,192
He's a nurse. I
gave him permission.

496
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,261
Frank, why are
you off the monitor?

497
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,429
Some of my labs came back.

498
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,130
Dr. Chan, your patient
has a low sodium.

499
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,999
That must have been
the four liters of water

500
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,401
that I drank after my workout.

501
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,935
Just need to fluid-restrict.

502
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,969
Let's go back to bed.

503
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,938
Your cardiac enzymes
are still pending.

504
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,873
Oh, I think she wants
to keep me here. Hm.

505
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,275
That guy's a piece of work, huh?

506
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,443
And you're not?

507
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,744
What's that supposed to mean?

508
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,346
You're eating Cap'n Crunch

509
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,614
off an emesis basin? Please.

510
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,282
Randi, did my nanny call again?

511
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,217
No, thank God.

512
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,152
Ew. What is that?

513
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,220
I'm hungry.

514
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,088
Nothing in the lounge
except a box of cereal

515
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,089
and a jar of milk.

516
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,991
A jar of milk? Yeah.

517
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,627
Oh, God, Malucci!

518
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,028
What?

519
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,963
I'm in. Resume compressions.

520
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,498
She's in V-fib. Peddles.

521
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,535
She should come
around with 0-2 and epi.

522
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,869
Mark, our guy's crashing.

523
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,004
Clear.

524
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,789
No change. V-fib.

525
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,024
What's happened?

526
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:28,711
He's hypotensive.
I'm starting Levophed.

527
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,512
Chuny, start with procainamide,

528
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,147
100 slow IV push. Shock again.

529
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,299
Clear.

530
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,066
His brain stem's
mush. You gonna call it?

531
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,835
No. There must be a
way to make him a donor.

532
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,137
Not without his consent.

533
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,171
When was the last epi?

534
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,572
Four minutes.

535
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,573
Push another cc.

536
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,808
Can't we get a court order?

537
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:44,376
No, no, not in a case like this.

538
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,744
Well, I'll keep his pressure up

539
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,768
until we find his family. Fine.

540
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,364
Shock again.

541
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,388
Clear.

542
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,338
The black stripe is air
under the diaphragm.

543
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,007
The needle perforated the colon.

544
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,210
Yeah, well, it hurts like hell.

545
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,578
I'm really sorry.

546
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,746
Perforation is a
known complication

547
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,436
of the procedure.

548
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,134
What do we do now?

549
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:13,093
Well, we could operate
to repair the defect.

550
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,675
How long will I have
to be in the hospital?

551
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:18,877
A week.

552
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,263
But then you're looking
at a two-month recovery.

553
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:26,290
Doc, they don't expect
me to live that long.

554
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:32,273
What happens if I don't
have the operation?

555
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,445
The hole could
seal off, but, um...

556
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,246
More than likely
you would develop

557
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,532
an infection, peritonitis.

558
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,084
And then I'd die.

559
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,123
Yeah.

560
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,805
Let's get a second
round of atropine.

561
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,407
Pacer pads are ready.

562
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:50,609
Holding compressions.
Still flatline.

563
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,644
Labs are back. CBC
and lytes are normal.

564
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,979
What the hell is
wrong with this baby?

565
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,481
All right, start pacing at 180.

566
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,505
Pacer's on.

567
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:01,786
No capture. Turn up the gain.

568
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,955
Come on.

569
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,179
Still no capture.
Turn up the rate.

570
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:09,695
Can't feel a pulse. More epi?

571
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:11,263
How many rounds so far?

572
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:12,620
Seven.

573
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,703
Stop bagging.

574
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:18,970
That's it.

575
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,093
We're done.

576
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,775
Clean up the baby...

577
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,699
before I bring in the mother.

578
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:35,320
I don't want the surgery.

579
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,989
It's the only way...
Yeah, I understand,

580
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:41,215
but I don't want
another surgery.

581
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,550
Well, then, you know, we...

582
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,472
We could, um, treat
you with antibiotics

583
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,162
and hope for the best.

584
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,348
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me?

585
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:05,868
I'll be right back.

586
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,007
Yeah.

587
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:11,823
Dr. Benton?

588
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:14,059
Aren't we supposed
to fix our mistakes?

589
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,159
Usually.

590
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:16,962
Your patient has
end-stage cancer.

591
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:19,064
Surgery's only gonna
prolong his suffering.

592
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,599
You have to respect his wishes.

593
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:22,718
Well, he's going to die
because I made a mistake.

594
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:23,974
He's gonna die anyway.

595
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,774
Mark, we need you over here.

596
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:29,798
What is it?

597
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,145
Doctor, please help me. My baby.

598
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,047
Want me to give her
something? Uh, no.

599
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,316
My baby. Pilar.

600
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,318
She's still warm. Do something.

601
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,219
Pilar, we tried
everything, okay?

602
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,454
I explained that.

603
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:45,324
No, she's still warm. My baby.

604
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,828
Please.

605
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:53,365
Use your machines.
Give her the medicine.

606
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:56,168
Blow in her mouth. Do
something. Make her breathe.

607
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:57,169
We can't.

608
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:58,337
Yes, you can!

609
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,771
Yes, you can!

610
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,240
You're a good
doctor. I know you can.

611
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,042
You can save her. Please.

612
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,116
She's still warm,
my little baby.

613
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,146
<i>Por favor.</i>

614
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,789
Pilar, she's dead.
No, she's... I'm sorry.

615
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,282
Malik, what's up?

616
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,551
Cops found
Mr. Bartlett under the El.

617
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,819
How you doing, Mr. Bartlett?

618
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,153
Kiss my ass.

619
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,590
Okay, start a banana
bag, order a head CT,

620
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,890
and prep him for sutures.

621
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,593
Whoa! Whoa!

622
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,027
What do you got?

623
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,430
Rule out CVA and I've got
two new patients to present.

624
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,864
What about Frank's workup?

625
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,266
My enzymes are normal. I'm fine.

626
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,667
Yeah, he saw us getting slammed,

627
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,901
so he pitched in.

628
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,303
Uh, Dr. Greene.

629
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,939
There was a complication
with my colon-cancer patient.

630
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:51,973
Yeah, Benton said.

631
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,775
Thought I was
supposed to supervise.

632
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,744
Well, you were busy,
so I asked Dr. Chen.

633
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,146
Yeah, well, you didn't give
Dr. Chen a complete history.

634
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,148
Otherwise you would've
tapped the midline,

635
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,783
and you wouldn't
of perfed the bowel.

636
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,453
Well, he spiked a
fever. I think he's septic.

637
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,588
You should make sure
that he's comfortable now.

638
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,724
I'd like to stay with
him. There's no family.

639
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,359
Oh, no, no. We need
you out here, okay?

640
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:12,026
Nurses can take
care of him. Right.

641
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,295
Oh, and Abby.

642
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,297
After your shift, I want
you to go to Pathology

643
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,500
and practice procedures
with Dr. Upton.

644
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,204
Dr. Greene, got a live one here!

645
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,238
What happened?

646
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,340
My buddy's in Peru. I'm
feeding his Gila monster,

647
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,708
when the son of
a bitch bites me.

648
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,860
He won't let go. We
have to kill the lizard?

649
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,962
Only as a last resort.

650
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,196
Hey, Malik.

651
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,198
Why don't you grab a
couple of vascular clamps?

652
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,334
Get 'em yourself. I'm
not going near that thing.

653
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:37,335
I got it.

654
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,037
All right. Thanks.

655
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,039
Please, don't hurt him.

656
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,930
I'll do my best.

657
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,711
Oh, ooh. Ow.

658
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,870
Those jaws are awfully strong.

659
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,675
Ow. Oof.

660
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,539
Malucci, get ready to catch him.

661
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,242
In what?

662
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,999
Grab a kick bucket.

663
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,250
All right. Here we go.

664
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,250
Nice and easy.

665
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,536
Do it together.

666
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,176
Almost. Almost. There!

667
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,526
Now what do I do?

668
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,083
Call Animal Control or the zoo.

669
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,531
Need some help?

670
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,766
Yeah, why don't you
monitor his vitals?

671
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,258
Three grams of Unasyn...
and irrigate the wound.

672
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,940
How is he doing?

673
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,543
He's on maximum dopamine
and Levophed with runs of PVCs.

674
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,245
His heart's not gonna
last much longer.

675
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,946
V-tach. Lily,
charge the paddles.

676
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,081
Don't, he's a DNR.

677
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,383
Mark, let me code him.

678
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,935
No, it's a waste of time.
I'm pushing lidocaine.

679
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,721
We're swamped. You're tying
up my nurses and a trauma room

680
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,540
on a case that'll never
make it to the O.R.

681
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:49,658
It's time to stop.

682
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,425
No, not when his
organs are still viable.

683
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,111
I'm sure his family
would want some good

684
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,446
to come out of this tragedy.

685
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,147
Normal sinus. Want
a lidocaine drip?

686
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,200
I'll start one. You go
help the other nurses.

687
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,124
Don't keep flogging him.
I mean it. He's a DNR.

688
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:06,324
Mark? Labs are
back from Trauma 2.

689
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,460
Tox screen's positive
for amphetamines.

690
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,495
Let me see.

691
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:11,496
Oh, man.

692
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,964
What?

693
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,532
It's the baby.

694
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:17,123
Someone killed their
baby with amphetamines?

695
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,062
Pilar.

696
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,698
The labs came back on Estrella,

697
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,989
and she tested positive
for amphetamines.

698
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,726
My baby died from drugs?

699
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,756
Do you know anybody

700
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,624
who could have given
something to her?

701
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,692
No one has drugs at home.

702
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:43,245
Do you know anyone
who uses drugs?

703
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,484
Friends or relatives?

704
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:50,919
Pilar, what is it?

705
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,255
I work two jobs.

706
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,024
Sometimes I get so tired, I...

707
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,893
I take something to stay awake.

708
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,533
But I never bring drugs at home.

709
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:02,883
Are you nursing the baby?

710
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,945
Pilar, do you nurse your baby?

711
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,111
The drugs are
in the breast milk.

712
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,170
I love my baby.

713
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,986
I would never hurt her.

714
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,589
God forgive me, I
would never hurt her.

715
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:28,613
I didn't know.

716
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:32,282
Really, I didn't know.

717
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,999
I didn't know.

718
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,218
I didn't know.

719
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,387
Mother, are you there?

720
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,589
I'm involved in a case.

721
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,759
I can't make it for
coffee, so page me. Bye.

722
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:50,061
Dr. Corday, I completely
forgot to give you a message.

723
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,329
What message?

724
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,297
That your mother's
taking an earlier flight,

725
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,133
and she won't be
able to meet you.

726
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:56,256
That's all?

727
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:01,572
Hey, Mark, are you all right?

728
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,807
Oh, yeah.

729
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:05,043
Y-you keeping an eye
on that gunshot kid?

730
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,112
Yes, I had to cancel a
dinner date with my mother,

731
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:08,880
but she stood me up first. Hmm.

732
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,414
Well, that's parents for you.

733
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,716
Mm-hm.

734
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,084
Okay, get me lytes on Burch,

735
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,885
digs on Davis and
coags on Nguyen.

736
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,287
You got it. How we doing?

737
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:18,189
Don't worry, doc. I'm
moving the meat, man.

738
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:19,857
Hey, listen, I need
to free up this bed.

739
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,859
I've been waiting for
an hour for CT results.

740
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,394
I'm holding for Radiology now.

741
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,829
Yeah, well, page Steve Flint.

742
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:26,431
You know what?
Don't waste your time.

743
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,732
I have a direct line.

744
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:30,000
Chuny, my colon cancer
patient needs more morphine.

745
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:31,469
He was asleep
last time I checked.

746
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,937
Well, then check more often.

747
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,171
I don't want him in any pain.

748
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,323
Dad, what happened?

749
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,225
He was short of
breath, called 911.

750
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,727
Yeah, well, why
didn't you call me?

751
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,895
There's nothing you
could've done over the phone.

752
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,564
When did it start?
Couple of days ago.

753
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,665
Pulse ox 82 on room air.

754
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,617
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

755
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,753
Uh, I'm fine, Mark. It's
probably just a chest cold.

756
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:50,121
Okay, let's move him over.

757
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,388
Nice and easy.

758
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:52,790
I'm not that... On my count.

759
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,391
I'm not that sick!
I can do it myself.

760
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:55,493
Do you want a blood gas?

761
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:58,830
Yes, CBC, coags
and a portable chest.

762
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:00,531
If I knew it was gonna
be such a big deal,

763
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:02,333
I would've seen the
doctor on Monday.

764
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:05,224
Dad, can you be quiet
and take a deep breath?

765
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:09,007
Yeah, I think you
have fluid in your lungs.

766
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:10,441
What do you mean, you think?

767
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:11,798
Lean forward.

768
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:15,613
Yep. Fluid's halfway up.

769
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:16,914
Why did you wait so long?

770
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:19,316
You could've passed out,
gotten a terrible infection...

771
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,918
Don't scold me.

772
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,654
Okay, we need
to drain the fluid.

773
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,122
Mark, what's wrong?

774
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:26,942
Huge pleural effusion.
Needs a thoracentesis.

775
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,194
He wants to stick a
needle in my chest.

776
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:31,129
You're a surgeon. I
think you should do it.

777
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:32,831
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

778
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,299
Dad, I can handle this.

779
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:36,817
Mark doesn't think a doctor
should treat his own family.

780
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,470
It's a simple procedure.

781
00:29:38,494 --> 00:29:39,938
I've done it a hundred times.

782
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:42,202
I want Elizabeth
to be my doctor.

783
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,281
Fine.

784
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,130
The lizard guy's crashing.

785
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,799
Why didn't somebody get me?

786
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,422
He just went south.

787
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,571
Dropped his pressure to 60.

788
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,807
Yeah, it's Gila venom. Two
liters of saline, wide open.

789
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,743
I heard this guy was
coding. What do you need?

790
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,578
Point three of epi,
50 of Benadryl.

791
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:04,602
All right. Here you go.

792
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:06,648
Who's smoking?

793
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:07,849
I don't smell anything.

794
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:08,950
It's out there.

795
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,452
That's my hernia patient.

796
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,108
Yeah, well, tell him
to smoke outside.

797
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,422
Mark, bad cocaine overdose.

798
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,057
Pressure's sky-high.

799
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,395
BP's 260/140.

800
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,363
Okay, I've been waiting
here for five hours.

801
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,132
You wanna get that
cigarette out of here?

802
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,200
All right, start with
Osmolal and phentolamine

803
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,402
before she strokes out.

804
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,070
Dr. Greene, there's
a psych patient

805
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,838
on the third floor
getting ready to jump.

806
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,740
Why don't you clear a
trauma room? I'm on it.

807
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,409
Dr. Greene, my
stroke patient's son

808
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,876
wants to talk to the Attending.

809
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,345
Mark, you want a
Foley on this guy?

810
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,779
Why are you asking
me? Just do it.

811
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,514
I can't get a second IV.

812
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,317
What's the problem?
She's got good veins.

813
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,584
How about my stroke patient?

814
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,986
Look, can't you
see that I've got

815
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,421
two critical patients here?

816
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,789
Why don't you just deal with it?

817
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:48,979
The guy just jumped!

818
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:56,152
They said it was a
stage-four lung cancer.

819
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,602
Doctors said it couldn't
be cut out or cured.

820
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,704
Sometimes chemotherapy
can shrink the tumor

821
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,373
and lengthen survival.

822
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,542
I know all about that.

823
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,811
Are you interested?

824
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,880
Mark sure seems to be.

825
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:14,638
What about you?
What do you want?

826
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,019
I just wanna live out
the last couple of months

827
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,222
of my life as normal as I can.

828
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,124
I don't wanna be hooked
up to a bunch of tubes,

829
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,959
puking my guts out,

830
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,919
all for the sake of a few
extra miserable weeks.

831
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,766
Well, when we get the fluid off,

832
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,990
you'll feel a lot better.

833
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,371
Now, I'm gonna numb you up.

834
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,040
This will sting a bit.

835
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,931
Ready when you are.

836
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,316
Hey, stick around, Pete.
Fresh trauma coming in.

837
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,784
Uh-uh, page
Corday. I was off at 7.

838
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,586
Hey, you getting
around okay, Carter?

839
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,154
Yeah. Are you
late for something?

840
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,355
Yeah. I'll see you later.

841
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,057
Abby, sorry to hear
about your patient.

842
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,192
What patient?

843
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:58,492
Your belly tap in Curtain 3?

844
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,661
He expired.

845
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,131
Well, why didn't
anybody tell me?

846
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,232
My patient dies,

847
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,134
I'm the last one
to find out about it.

848
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,368
Pulse is weak.

849
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,937
Yosh, start two large-bore IVs.

850
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,739
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

851
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:12,406
We're gonna need
to put in a chest tube.

852
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,608
Hey, you want some help?

853
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,409
Uh, no, thanks. What's
Frank doing here?

854
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,212
Uh, it's a long story. Carter?

855
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,613
Everything okay? Yep.

856
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:19,981
How'd it happen?

857
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,250
Psych patient jumped
from the third floor.

858
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,852
Feels like a few broken ribs.

859
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,703
Get X-ray here.

860
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:26,871
Frank?

861
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,572
Hey, get the crash cart!

862
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:30,207
Frank?

863
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:31,976
Airway's clear. He's breathing.

864
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,879
What happened?
Probably vasovagalled.

865
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:36,347
Good pulse. We're okay.

866
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,599
I'll get a BP.

867
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,967
I need to intubate.

868
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,768
Push 15 of
etomidate, 100 of sux.

869
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,203
Prep for a chest tube.

870
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,404
I can do that.

871
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,306
I've got it, Carter.
We gotta move fast.

872
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,340
Uh, how can I help?

873
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,675
Here, run the HemoCue.

874
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,243
Dr. Weaver, you
need a hand up there?

875
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,645
No, but work on that HemoCue.

876
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,714
Carol, it's the nanny. I
hear the babies crying.

877
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,616
Take over for me, Yosh.

878
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,017
Okay, 8-0 ET tube.

879
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,685
Hey. No, I'm in the
middle of a trauma.

880
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,920
I can't do that right now.

881
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,444
10 blade and a
Kelly. Check the cuff.

882
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:03,992
No, I know, but I can't.

883
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,392
What's the pulse ox? It's 92.

884
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,428
HemoCue is 12.4.

885
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,196
Hey, Carol, we're okay. Okay.

886
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,165
Hi, Okay, just put
Kate's ear to the phone.

887
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,533

Hey, call
Respiratory for a vent.

899
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,843
You had quite a day, huh?

900
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,513
Randi, I'm gonna be
suturing in Exam 4.

901
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,915
I can pick up a few of
your patients if you want.

902
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,783
Mm, just take the new ones.

903
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,888
Oh, sorry, Carol. Pedes is full.

904
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,122
Oh, these are my girls.

905
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,257
They've gotten so big. Yeah.

906
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,291
Is your nanny sick?

907
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,627
No, no. She's new.

908
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,795
And they were fussy, so
I just had her bring 'em in.

909
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,764
Yeah, they certainly
look content.

910
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,733
They're always happy
after I've nursed them.

911
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,234
They miss their mom.

912
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,824
We'll be in the lounge.

913
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,105
Aw.

914
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,908
Hey, Randi?
Curtain 2 is going up.

915
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,475
Sorry to cause you
so much trouble.

916
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,167
Oh, it was nothing. Feel better.

917
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,449
What's wrong with Super Nurse?

918
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,084
Frank is being admitted.

919
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,119
Oh, yeah. What,
to the Psych ward?

920
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,154
To Medicine.

921
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,923
I diagnosed his
Addison's disease.

922
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,758
He'll be fine in a few days.

923
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:44,926
Good pickup.

924
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,627
I'm gonna go up to
the fifth floor later,

925
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,051
keep him company.

926
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,183
Time of death, 21:37.

927
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:55,008
I'll get the death kit.

928
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:57,221
Such a waste.

929
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,556
His organs could've
saved so many lives.

930
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,825
I couldn't do a thing.

931
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,560
Well, you had no choice.

932
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:05,395
Why couldn't they
find his family?

933
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,264
Probably a runaway.

934
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:09,133
He's someone's son.

935
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,736
His parents don't
even know he's here.

936
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,425
They may never know.

937
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:17,225
Dr. Corday, could you
sign a discharge order?

938
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:18,492
On which patient?

939
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,928
Dr. Greene's father.

940
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,450
I'll be right out.

941
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:29,404
Mark, why didn't you tell
me your father has cancer?

942
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,788
He didn't want anybody to know.

943
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,475
You told him to follow
up with Oncology?

944
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,710
He doesn't want to.

945
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,778
What about Navelbine?
There's no side effects.

946
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,248
It'll shrink the tumor,
and he won't get his chest

947
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,666
tapped every week. I've
given him those options.

948
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,169
But... it can improve
the quality of his life.

949
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:46,671
Talk to him.
He'll listen to you.

950
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,289
It's his decision.

951
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,758
But maybe if you explain
it, he'll change his mind.

952
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,593
Mark, I have to
respect his wishes.

953
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,857
He's my father, okay?
I wanna help him.

954
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:56,947
If you really want to help,

955
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,304
just be there for him.

956
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,890
I won't just sit there when
there's something more I can do.

957
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,157
The patient donated his body

958
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:09,494
to the med school
for educational use.

959
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:11,396
For anatomy class?

960
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,797
Yes, but we often allow students

961
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,265
to practice procedures here

962
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:15,888
on the fresh cadaver.

963
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,622
Dr. Greene mentioned
that you needed work

964
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,979
on your central lines.

965
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,663
Place your index finger
in the sternal notch.

966
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,731
Enter the skin at the junction

967
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:34,123
of the middle and
proximal third of the clavicle.

968
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,251
I'm sorry.

969
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:51,519
I don't think I can't do this.

970
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,975
You're doing fine.

971
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:59,064
Uh, he was my patient.

972
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,586
You wanna stop?

973
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,205
No.

974
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,208
Why don't you, um,
take me through it?

975
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,743
Aim just above and posterior

976
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,378
to your index finger.

977
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,128
Crazy day, huh?

978
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:31,097
Yep.

979
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,417
John, are you
still in a lot of pain?

980
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,199
It's not too bad.

981
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,533
Yeah.

982
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,335
It seemed like you're
having a hard time

983
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,825
getting around in Trauma.

984
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,791
I'm... I'm okay.

985
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:49,627
Well, the first day
back can be rough.

986
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:52,985
Yeah, every day
gets a little bit easier.

987
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,942
Have you talked to anybody
about what happened?

988
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,641
And your family's
been supportive?

989
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,977
Yeah, really, Dr. Weaver.

990
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:08,512
I'm okay.

991
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,747
You know, you might
benefit from a TENS unit

992
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:12,316
or from acupuncture.

993
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,639
Thanks. I'll let you know.

994
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,577
Okay.

995
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,234
I need a PT/PTT on De Salvo.

996
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:31,235
Yeah.

997
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,588
Head home?

998
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:37,175
I can take a cab if you have
something else planned.

999
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,949
Don't be ridiculous,
Dad. We're going home.

1000
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,382
Good night.

1001
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,406
Good night.

1002
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,838
Shoelaces are untied.

1003
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,679
I can't bend down
after that needle thing.

1004
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,906
I don't want you to fall
and break your neck.

1005
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,374
All right, from this angle.

1006
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,510
The one. Just cut it in there.

1007
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:15,446
Just hit a little
bit to the left.

1008
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,736
And let it...

1009
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,500
slide down.

1010
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,919
That's too much
thinking. I go by instinct.

1011
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,588
Do it your way.

1012
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,157
All right, uh, how about
the six in the corner...

1013
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:33,719
Yeah, right. Here we go.

1014
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:40,538
What happened to
the laws of physics?

1015
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:41,705
You distracted me.

1016
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:43,095
Yeah. Excuse me.

1017
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,814
Aah. You left me nothing.
What are you talkin' about?

1018
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:50,998
Go for the eleven.

1019
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,783
Are you crazy?
I can't make that.

1020
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,168
Of course you can. Come here.

1021
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,903
Let me show you something.

1022
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,037
All right, just call it.

1023
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,240
Eleven in the corner pocket.

1024
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,664
Just line it up.

1025
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,462
Now, hit it to the right.

1026
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,963
It'll slide right down the rail.

1027
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,099
Nice and easy.

1028
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:09,533
Trust me. Nice and easy.

1029
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:11,268
Trust you. Mm-hm.

1030
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:12,692
All right.

1031
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:17,608
See?

1032
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,031
How's that?

1033
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:22,668
It's not bad.

1034
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,809
Mm. What?

1035
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:31,577
Hm?

1036
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,278
If I'd known you were coming,

1037
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:56,347
we'd have served a late dinner.

1038
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,903
Soup's fine.

1039
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:06,908
You're looking well, John.

1040
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,212
Thank you.

1041
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,833
I started back to work today.

1042
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,416
Shouldn't you give
yourself a bit more time off?

1043
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,772
I did okay.

1044
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,925
Actually, it was kind of tough.

1045
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,883
I didn't know if I was gonna
make it through the day.

1046
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,638
I, uh, felt, I don't
know... Afraid.

1047
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:37,188
Afraid of what?

1048
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:39,312
That I couldn't handle it.

1049
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,949
But you did.

1050
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:48,799
I know we've had
our disagreements

1051
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:51,735
about your career.

1052
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,711
But I can see now that
medicine is what you love.

1053
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,864
I remember when you
were in high school,

1054
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,766
you'd drop by unexpectedly.

1055
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,858
I'd make cocoa, and we'd talk.

1056
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:10,843
I remember.

1057
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,314
We haven't done
this in a long time.

1058
00:42:16,484 --> 00:42:17,484
I know.

1059
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,187
Where is that? Mammoth? No.

1060
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,355
Lake Tahoe.

1061
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,857
I lost $200 at the craps table.

1062
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,643
Next slide.

1063
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,144
This is a fancy machine.

1064
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:36,163
If I'd known you could
get one at the hospital,

1065
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,998
I wouldn't have
fixed the old one.

1066
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,166
San Diego?

1067
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,119
That was the Santa Barbara trip.

1068
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,342
You were 7.

1069
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,679
Taught you to swim underwater.

1070
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,462
Ah, your mother
never did like motels,

1071
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,485
so we rented an RV.

1072
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,389
Planting the garden.

1073
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,221
You used to make
me pull the weeds.

1074
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,823
I did not.

1075
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,226
You remember you
always wanted to grow a...

1076
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,228
A watermelon tree?

1077
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,096
You saved all those
seeds and then snuck out

1078
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,315
and planted them in
your mother's petunias.

1079
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,367
Never did get a watermelon.

1080
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,135
No, but you sure
killed off the petunias.

1081
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,137
I forgot all about that.

1082
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,874
I thought this was
the vacation box.

1083
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,910
Why did your mother
take this one, anyway?

1084
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,813
<i>♪ Time it was And
what a time it was ♪</i>

1085
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,616
<i>♪ It was ♪</i>

1086
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,251
Guess she liked what she saw.

1087
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,904
<i>♪ A time of innocence ♪</i>

1088
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:37,113
<i>♪ A time of confidences ♪</i>
