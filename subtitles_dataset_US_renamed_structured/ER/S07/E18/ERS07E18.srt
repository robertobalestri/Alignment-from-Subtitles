1
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,155
Damn it! Oh, Elizabeth!

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,025
Six months ago this wedding
seemed like a good idea.

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,227
Look at me. What
the hell was I thinking?

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,962
You look beautiful.

5
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,598
Oh, please.

6
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,199
What could be more perfect?

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,603
You're marrying the man that
you love while carrying his child.

8
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:27,870
Yes, well, this love child

9
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,373
also comes with an extra
40 pounds and hemorrhoids.

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,642
There are some things
I don't need to know.

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,511
Where's Mark?

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,314
Why don't you sit down

13
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,848
and have some tea?

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,884
What? So that I can pee every
two minutes instead of every 10?

15
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,487
Elizabeth, listen to me.

16
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,255
You need to stop, take a moment.

17
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,908
Relax.

18
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:50,476
Enjoy your day.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,801
You're being awfully nice to me.

20
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:55,665
It only makes me more nervous.

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,690
I'll get it.

22
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,672
It is not raining.

23
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,939
Hello? No. No.

24
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,093
A little mist. I'm
sure it'll blow over.

25
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:09,262
Have you seen my
wallet? It's not in the car.

26
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:10,764
No.

27
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,665
Damn it. Must be
in my locker at work.

28
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,734
Everything will be fine, dear...

29
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,803
Well, let... Let
me get your father.

30
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,827
It's Rachel. Hey, Rach.

31
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:21,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

32
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,643
What's wrong?

33
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,028
She missed her flight.

34
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,329
No.

35
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,864
I'm sure she can
get another one.

36
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,118
But perhaps she shouldn't
have left it until today.

37
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:33,786
Well, she was starring in
her school play last night.

38
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,956
Well, that's why they
invented understudies.

39
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,125
Mother. All I said was that...

40
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,359
Don't. Everything's okay.

41
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:44,097
She's, uh, switching airlines,
and she's gonna fly into Midway.

42
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:45,966
Give me time to grab my wallet.

43
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,834
Then I can swing
by and pick her up.

44
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,303
Hey, it's no big deal.

45
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,538
Why does it always
have to get so complicated

46
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,040
just at the last minute?

47
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:57,576
Everything is gonna
go like clockwork.

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,563
In a few hours we're gonna
be surrounded by friends

49
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,865
and people we love,

50
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,205
and your mother.

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,170
And the three of us

52
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,993
are going to be married.

53
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,827
You said you were covered. No.

54
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,594
You told me Malucci
was covering for you.

55
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:17,897
I said he might cover
my last few hours.

56
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:20,066
Well, is he or isn't
he? I don't know.

57
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,334
Well, when will you find out?

58
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,535
When he gets here.

59
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,971
Oh, that's great.
Malucci's reliable.

60
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,539
Peter, I have my
dress in the locker.

61
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,274
If I'm ready when
it's time, I'll go.

62
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,608
If not, you can go stag.

63
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,544
Hey, uh, does Malucci
have a cell phone?

64
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,578
I don't know. Why?

65
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,779
Why don't we call him?

66
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:34,948
I'm not going to call him.

67
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:37,317
Open radius fracture
on call for the O.R.

68
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:41,287
Gastroenteritis in Seven
is being rehydrated.

69
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,655
What about the renal colic?

70
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,557
Discharged. If you
need to reach me,

71
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,558
I'll be at my hotel.

72
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,393
Dr. Weaver, Connie on four.

73
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,263
Okay. Tell her she can speak
with Dr. Kovac when she gets in.

74
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:51,965
Says she has a fever. Too late.

75
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,766
Her co-conspirators have used

76
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,268
the last of the
back-up registries.

77
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,635
Co-conspirators?

78
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:59,305
The nurses are calling in
sick to go to the wedding.

79
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,040
Says she has a
temperature of 102.

80
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:04,244
Give it to me. Connie,
I need you here.

81
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,612
Somebody might want to
look at the guy in Curtain Three.

82
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:09,815
Accidentally used Bengay
instead of Preparation H.

83
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,816
How are you feeling?

84
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,253
Like a Snuffleupagus
on Benadryl.

85
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,988
Go home. Take a nap
before the wedding.

86
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:16,422
We're already down a few nurses.

87
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,124
We're slow. We'll float someone.

88
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:21,527
Come on. I saw you yesterday
trying to change your shift.

89
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,996
I'm gonna wait
till she goes home.

90
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,164
She won't see you there.
She has to miss the wedding

91
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,100
for a billing conference.

92
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,534
Luka, she wasn't invited.

93
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:31,804
Okay, fine. Fine. Go ahead.
But I want a note from a doctor.

94
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:34,073
And if you show up in
any of the wedding pictures,

95
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,797
you're fired.

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,911
Go.

97
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,521
Hey, Mark, shouldn't you be...?

98
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:42,025
Oh, uh, forgot my wallet.
You going someplace?

99
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,261
Yeah. Reimbursement
Strategies Conference.

100
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,395
The one in Las Vegas.

101
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,864
Yeah, I missed it last year.

102
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,265
I thought it would
be the best way

103
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,534
to put a dent in our deficit.

104
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,170
Well, play a hand
of blackjack for me.

105
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,205
Sure.

106
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,639
Hey, Mark.

107
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,576
I want you to know how happy
I am for you and Elizabeth.

108
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,499
Thanks.

109
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,201
Dr. Greene, you're here?
Wow, that's devotion.

110
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,436
You never saw me.

111
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,270
Ah. Okay. Got it.

112
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:14,641
Jing-Mei, that pilonidal cyst
in Three isn't going anywhere.

113
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,576
Hm. Uh, new rule:

114
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,879
Anything that involves
pus waits until after lunch.

115
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,148
Can you see that
Mr. Tuttle gets a sandwich?

116
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:25,552
The unborn twin inside
of his stomach is hungry.

117
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,920
Okay. Uh, can you
wait over there, please?

118
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:31,290
<i>County base, this is Rescue 43.</i>

119
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,192
County base, go
ahead on Bravo One.

120
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:34,927
<i>We're at the site
of an accident.</i>

121
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,363
So you taking the cheerleader?

122
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:37,414
What?

123
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,315
To the wedding.

124
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,750
Or are they carding?

125
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,184
<i>Et tu,</i> Deb?

126
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,453
You have to admit,

127
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,521
She gives new meaning
to the term "girlfriend."

128
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,789
Who are you taking? I'm not.

129
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,791
Someone has to stay
here and hold down the fort.

130
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,843
Not invited? Amira,
find Luka now.

131
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,811
What? Prison van
over an embankment.

132
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,431
They want to know
how many we can take.

133
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:55,970
Three major, 10 minor.

134
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,685
Tell 'em.

135
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,191
I should ask Luka.

136
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,172
Three major, 10
minor. Are you sure?

137
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,540
This is County base. We can take

138
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,842
a total of three
major, 10 minor. Over.

139
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,745
<i>Got it. Rescue 43 out.</i>

140
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,902
Whoa! Whoa! Hold
on! Hold on! Wait!

141
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,017
That's my van. You can't read?

142
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,286
I'm a doctor here. Then
you should know better.

143
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,422
Look, I'm getting married
today. Give me a break.

144
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,524
Congratulations.

145
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,182
Let me get my tux out!

146
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,631
Dr. Greene, what are you doing?

147
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,865
He towed my van!

148
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,634
Aren't you supposed
to be getting ready?

149
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,702
I just came to grab my
wallet, and he towed my van.

150
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,070
You wanna take my car?

151
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,607
Continue CPR. Keep bagging.
This from the prison van?

152
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,808
Yeah. The driver,
blunt chest trauma.

153
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,710
Ah, damn it! What?

154
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,380
Rachel. She's stuck in
St. Louis. I gotta call her.

155
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,516
No seat belt. Lost the
pulse two minutes out.

156
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,773
First epi's onboard.

157
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,581
Well?

158
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,946
You're getting married.

159
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:03,416
It's not exactly
what I had in mind

160
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,118
when I used to imagine it.

161
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:08,321
I still remember you
running around the house

162
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,523
with one of your ballet
tutus on your head,

163
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,325
pretending it was
a wedding veil.

164
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,828
If I'm not mistaken,

165
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,864
weren't you going to marry
that little freckle-faced boy

166
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:19,065
who lived down the street?

167
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,668
Tommy Bradshaw. Ah.

168
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,903
I wonder whatever
happened to Tommy.

169
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,372
He was indicted
for insurance fraud.

170
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:29,342
Well, there you are.

171
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,144
Things have already turned
out better than you expected.

172
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,565
I wish your father
could see you.

173
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,966
Yeah.

174
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,868
Well, maybe he
couldn't get another flight.

175
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,437
Oh, I'm sure he has some
excuse. He always does.

176
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,541
Mother.

177
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,407
You're right.

178
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,575
I'm sorry.

179
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,843
I simply can't believe

180
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,947
that he wouldn't at least
have made the effort.

181
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,981
Oh, now,

182
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,049
don't start crying.

183
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,453
I'll be doing plenty of
that for the both of us.

184
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,622
This is your day.

185
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,058
Your hair is perfect.
Your dress is wonderful.

186
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,428
This color looks
fabulous on you.

187
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,631
Well, I didn't have much
choice, did I? Had I worn white,

188
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,599
I'd have looked like I
could sink the<i> Titanic.</i>

189
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,437
Only one thing missing.

190
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,594
What's that?

191
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,112
They belonged to
your grandmother.

192
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,982
She wore them for
her wedding, as did I.

193
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,952
Now, I know you're
not one for tradition,

194
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:32,088
but if you were thinking of
something old, something new,

195
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,393
something borrowed...
They're beautiful.

196
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,928
Thank you.

197
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,362
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

198
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,499
Don't worry. We're gonna
make a video. You can watch that.

199
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,936
Complains of neck and chest
pain. BP's 124/82. Pulse, 90.

200
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,604
Miss, are you short of breath?

201
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,173
Hurts when I inhale. Ow!

202
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,274
What is it?

203
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,277
My arm!

204
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,779
Do you guys have
the room number?

205
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,681
Pupils are equal and reactive.

206
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,851
Trauma panel, C-spine,
portable chest. Dip a urine.

207
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,520
Any pain back here?

208
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,954
A lot.

209
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,190
We're gonna keep this
on until we clear your x-ray.

210
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,392
What's wrong with my wrist?

211
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,459
Which one?

212
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,960
Left.

213
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,129
Can we take these
cuffs off? Not a chance.

214
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,964
Any O-neg here?
Two in the cooler.

215
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,199
My guy's in arrest.

216
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,701
She may have a wrist injury.

217
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,102
Probably did that herself.

218
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,639
She was in a major
trauma. I need to assess her.

219
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,140
I could only get two units.

220
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,475
All right. Normal saline,
wide open. Hang the blood.

221
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,543
Amp of epi and 100 of lido.

222
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,078
That's weird. Is
he gonna be okay?

223
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,380
The badge must have
impacted on the steering column.

224
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,599
Okay, clear.

225
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,867
He's got blunt chest
trauma. No vitals.

226
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,168
Vasopressin. 40, IV.

227
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,604
What should I tell his family?

228
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,606
Tell them we're doing
everything that we can.

229
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,373
Charging again to 360.

230
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,526
Stand clear.

231
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,778
Got a rhythm. Sinus at 50.

232
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,997
Got a pulse? Nope.

233
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,117
Shot twice on the job, and
now the weather kills him.

234
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:56,589
Okay. Let's run the O-neg
in. I'm gonna resume CPR.

235
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:57,874
He's P.E.A., Carter. Yeah?

236
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,864
So try another mg of atropine.

237
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,032
I hope you're joking.

238
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,334
Well, would you check again?

239
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,503
What is it?

240
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,940
Then I suggest you
do that. Yes, I'll hold.

241
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,174
Is it the limo?

242
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,976
Apparently they don't
have your booking.

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,678
Like hell they
don't. Give it to me.

244
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,847
Don't concern yourself.
I'll take care of this.

245
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:21,848
I'll do it.

246
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,482
I don't want you
upsetting yourself.

247
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:26,019
I won't. Here.

248
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,520
Yes.

249
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,922
Yes.

250
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:32,191
No. Well, I booked this
limousine months ago.

251
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,693
I gave you a deposit.

252
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,494
Yes, and when you
cashed my check,

253
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:38,164
you guaranteed me you'd
be here to pick me up.

254
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:39,632
No.

255
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,801
No, I don't care if it's
raining fire and brimstone.

256
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,369
You are going to
get me to that church

257
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,139
if I have to ride on your
back like a bloody donkey!

258
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:48,074
Perhaps you should
eat something.

259
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,793
I do not need to eat. Nor
do I need a spot of tea,

260
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,363
Or a moment's quiet reflection
on this, my special day.

261
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,698
This is America,

262
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,984
and sometimes in this country
you have to kick some ass!

263
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,103
We'll take your car
and get there early.

264
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,105
Fine. Fine, okay.

265
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,672
But unless you
can drive stick shift

266
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,208
on the right-hand
side of the road,

267
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,360
I am doing the driving.

268
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,946
Elizabeth, you can't possibly
drive in your condition.

269
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,248
Get your purse, grab
the flowers, and let's go.

270
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,319
Now, listen here,
you ignorant bastard...

271
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,821
<i>What's wrong?</i>

272
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,223
Oh, Mark. Sorry.

273
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,426
Uh, nothing, nothing.

274
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,761
Um, where are you?

275
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,714
<i>At the hospital.
Both the airports</i>

276
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:29,115
are closed because of the storm

277
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,017
and the flights from
St. Louis are canceled.

278
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,918
No.

279
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,653
<i>Rachel's pretty upset.</i>

280
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:36,155
Oh, I'm sorry.

281
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,391
<i>Well, what can you do?</i>

282
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:40,476
Do you want to postpone?

283
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,062
No. N... Do you?

284
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,430
No, no.

285
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,766
But, uh, if all the
airports are closed,

286
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,235
then other guests won't
be able to make it either.

287
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,438
Well, if, uh... If
you want to wait...

288
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,540
<i>No, no. I don't want to wait.</i>

289
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:55,942
Neither do I.

290
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,110
<i>Are you sure?</i>

291
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,661
Let's get married.

292
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,296
Okay.

293
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,132
<i>I'll see you walking
down the aisle, then?</i>

294
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,218
I'll be hard to miss.

295
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,086
I love you.

296
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,360
I love you too.

297
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,224
Smart move. What's that?

298
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,793
Not telling her
about the tow truck.

299
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,194
Don't need to stress out brides
anymore than you have to.

300
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:18,531
Especially pregnant
ones. Need an umbrella?

301
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,400
You have one? Yeah.

302
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:23,569
You transported them
without backboards?

303
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:25,405
Medics cleared
the necks on-site.

304
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:26,873
Was this a work detail?

305
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:28,574
No. Busy court day.

306
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:30,643
I'll work for you, honey.

307
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,512
Hey, nice stethoscope.

308
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:34,113
Let's shut the
pie holes, ladies.

309
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,815
Yosh, can you put
them somewhere?

310
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,950
This way. We gonna
play doctor with you?

311
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,619
Not a chance.

312
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:40,820
What have you got?

313
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,223
Tammy Gabbard, 19,
alert, oriented times three.

314
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:46,826
Complaining of belly
pain and a scalp lac.

315
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,827
I need to call Joe.

316
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,562
Vitals? BP, 120/80.

317
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:51,664
Brief LOC.

318
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,165
Ooh. Nice umbrella.

319
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,734
Hey, Mark. You still here?

320
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:56,924
Not anymore.

321
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,410
Don't bother.

322
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,745
Why? What happened?

323
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,648
Closed. Tree fell on
the track near Cermak.

324
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:10,850
Shorted out the Red Line.

325
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,574
How long is it gonna be down?

326
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:20,348
Hold on.

327
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,595
Let me on.

328
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,198
Wait for the next one, pal.

329
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,565
I gotta get to my wedding.

330
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,967
That's original.

331
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:30,202
It's true. Why else would
I be carrying this tux?

332
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,922
Look, they towed my
car. The El is down.

333
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,623
Right.

334
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,860
Make room! Make
room! Dead man walking!

335
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,283
Thanks.

336
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,215
Second chest tube in.
- Back in V-fib.

337
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,383
Let's charge again. Clear.

338
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,951
C-spine. Type and
cross times four.

339
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:47,953
Three-sixty. Charge
it again. Clear!

340
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,405
Where are you, Carter? V-fib.

341
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,791
Correcting volume loss.
Pulse/ox is down to 75.

342
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:53,025
Did he ever have a rhythm?

343
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,611
P.E.A. for five minutes.
He degenerated into V-fib.

344
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,479
How long has it been
down? Thirty minutes.

345
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,665
No response to
defibrillation times five.

346
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay, call it. Take her.

347
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:03,252
Head injury and abdominal
trauma. BP's dropped.

348
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,539
Charging to 360.
Here we go. Clear.

349
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:07,924
Carter, now. He may have

350
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,792
a pericardial effusion
or an aortic tear.

351
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,511
You're done. He's a cop.

352
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:13,045
He's brain-dead.

353
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:19,051
Time of death, 1458.

354
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,854
I want to see the x-ray
before you clear her C-spine.

355
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,361
Okay.

356
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:31,930
Excuse me.

357
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,787
Another beer.

358
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,639
Shady.

359
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,608
Five down.

360
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,776
Oh, yes.

361
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,612
Thank you.

362
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,946
Stuck on a layover?

363
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,182
No, my flight's delayed.

364
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:52,084
Do you mean canceled?

365
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,453
No. It still says "delayed."

366
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,805
Ah, an optimist.

367
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,639
Where are you trying to get to?

368
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,392
Uh, Las Vegas.

369
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,861
Oh, so you're not an
optimist. It's a compulsion.

370
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:03,396
Mm. Where do you play?

371
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,098
I-I'm going there on business.

372
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,233
And whatever
the lady's drinking.

373
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,468
Oh, no, thank you.

374
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,204
We may be here for a
while. I'm fine. Thanks.

375
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:15,062
Well, either he's
getting a very big tip,

376
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,411
or you're getting a free drink.

377
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,201
Excuse me.

378
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:25,284
BP's 90/75.

379
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:26,786
Has anybody called Joe?

380
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,987
We can't do that, Gabbard.

381
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,956
Who's Joe? My fiancé.

382
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,708
Meth dealer and lowlife. She
got nailed for holding his drugs.

383
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,410
He was set up. Uh-huh.

384
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,744
Ow.

385
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,512
Ooh, we got tenderness
and some guarding

386
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,764
in the left upper quadrant.

387
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:41,183
Let's call for a surgical
consult and get a CT.

388
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,168
You got a dislocated
shoulder in Curtain Three

389
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,354
in a lot of pain.
I'm off. Grab Chen.

390
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,629
Dr. Kovac asked for you
to take it before you left.

391
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,596
Okay. We'll get an
x-ray of your abdomen,

392
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,964
then another doctor's come
and gonna assess you, okay?

393
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,467
Have Surgery see her,
and I'll sign her out to Deb.

394
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,825
But you're calling Joe! I will.

395
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,207
Carter, IV and oral

396
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,975
contrast?

397
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,544
Yeah. Check her
BUN and creatinine.

398
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,912
I thought you were going home.

399
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,847
We're still short a
few nurses. The storm.

400
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,516
Boyfriend didn't
give you permission?

401
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,084
I haven't asked. You
should. You look worse.

402
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,986
Excuse me while I
complete my penance.

403
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,254
He's not doing that.

404
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,318
Oh, you don't think so? John.

405
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,292
Hi. Hey.

406
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,844
You look great.

407
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:26,312
Thanks.

408
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:27,346
Yeah, you do.

409
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,348
Thank you. Are you sick?

410
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,600
Um, it's just a cold.

411
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,342
You're not going to the wedding?

412
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,706
No, I don't think I'm
gonna be able to go.

413
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,709
Can you... Can you tell them
I'm sorry and congratulate them?

414
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,711
Yeah.

415
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,847
Are you ready?

416
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,115
Yeah, in a minute. Uh, wanna
give me a hand for a second?

417
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,284
Oh, sure.

418
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,287
Hi, Veronica. I'm
Dr. Carter. This is Rena.

419
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,021
She's helping out
in the ER today.

420
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,956
A well-dressed candy-striper.

421
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,091
Yeah. Ow.

422
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,793
Let's take a look at
that shoulder, huh?

423
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,995
Ah-ah. Okay, okay.

424
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,463
We're not gonna do that again.

425
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,432
Have you been given
any pain medication yet?

426
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,034
Mm. Nurse said
you could use a local.

427
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,004
I could. But local anesthesia
is not very effective

428
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,345
with this type of injury.

429
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,142
Ah.

430
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,064
I've been clean
for a year. Heroin.

431
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:19,831
Okay.

432
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:22,568
Well, maybe we could try
a mild sedative like Valium.

433
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:25,071
No, man. The taste
will bring me back.

434
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:28,207
I kept using on the inside.

435
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,847
Ow.

436
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,146
Oh, that was almost fun.

437
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,115
I thought I was past
morning sickness.

438
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,172
Well, I offered to call a cab.

439
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,321
I've never seen
it rain this hard.

440
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:45,090
Why brides get married in June.

441
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:48,248
I'll be breast-feeding
a 4-week-old in June.

442
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,216
Hello?

443
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,884
Perhaps we should
have called ahead.

444
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,186
It's not a restaurant, Mother.
They are expecting us.

445
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,823
Then why are the
doors locked? Hello?

446
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,992
I'd recognize that
bickering anywhere.

447
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,415
Daddy!

448
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,263
I didn't think you'd be here.

449
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,833
I wouldn't have missed this
day for anything. You look radiant.

450
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,102
Oh.

451
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,270
Belle, it's been a while.

452
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,605
Yes. Ten years, I believe.

453
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,593
You popped by for Elizabeth's
med school graduation.

454
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:22,327
I'm so happy you're both here.

455
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,597
I'd prefer if I didn't
have to separate you.

456
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:26,431
So please be at
least civil to each other

457
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:27,733
until the reception.

458
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:29,552
Hopefully, I'll be drunk then.

459
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,153
No doubt. Good behavior.

460
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,221
I'm serious.

461
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,773
Of course.

462
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:36,441
Do I get to meet the groom
before I hand you over?

463
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,943
Mark's not here?

464
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,379
Your umbrella is poking me.

465
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,563
Sorry.

466
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,519
Oh, for Pete's sake, leave it.

467
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,444
The damn things
give you brain cancer.

468
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:56,127
Can somebody ask the
driver what the problem is?

469
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,898
Excuse me. Coming through.

470
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:01,132
Hey, watch it.

471
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,751
Sorry. Excuse me.

472
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,620
Excuse me.

473
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,655
Why isn't the bus moving?

474
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,089
Engine seized.

475
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,291
So we're broken down?

476
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,892
Another bus on the way.

477
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,977
When?

478
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,001
When it gets here.

479
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,650
Let me out.

480
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:19,101
Raining like hell out there.

481
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,325
I know. Thanks. Let me out.

482
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,949
Lungs are fine. Neck is clear.
We can take off the collar.

483
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,152
I think I broke something
in here. I couldn't walk at all.

484
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,288
Hm. Any pain in your abdomen?

485
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,656
Uh-huh.

486
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,958
Yeah, she hurts everywhere.

487
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,026
All right, tell me
if this is tender.

488
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,330
Wait, lower.

489
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,399
Ah! Right there. Right there.

490
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,200
Send her for an AP pelvis.

491
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,970
I want to rule out
a ramus fracture.

492
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,605
We're gonna get an x-ray, Sara.

493
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,690
Okay.

494
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,812
She's playing you, doc.

495
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,861
You've had a C-section?

496
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,296
Yeah. So?

497
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,964
Any chance you're pregnant now?

498
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,299
No.

499
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:10,468
I got fixed after Diana.

500
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,104
I got pictures.

501
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,373
But these cuffs.

502
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:15,624
Save it, Morris.

503
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,393
I'm missing my visit
with her right now.

504
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,246
I don't know when
I'll see her next.

505
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,714
Why?

506
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:23,898
My sister's moving to L.A.

507
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,734
And there's no one
else to take care of her.

508
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,970
She's 7.

509
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,489
I got four years mandatory
before I see her again.

510
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:33,425
Should've thought
before you broke parole.

511
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,260
I just wanted to see her today.

512
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:36,512
That's all.

513
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,897
She's probably
better off. Shut up!

514
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,899
You shut... Ow!

515
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,417
Sara.

516
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,738
Sara, I'm gonna come
back after the x-ray, okay?

517
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,181
You just keep giving resistance
to the pressure I apply, okay?

518
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:57,749
Veronica, you ready?

519
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,184
Do it.

520
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,219
Here we go.

521
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:04,006
Whoa! No, no, no, no.
You gotta keep pulling.

522
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,291
Right. Okay, sorry. Okay?

523
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,126
Here we go.

524
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:10,629
That's it. Hold it
right there, Rena.

525
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,098
She needs more sedation,
Carter. She's a former addict.

526
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:15,517
She doesn't want any
narcotics. I gave her a local.

527
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,802
She needs more than that.

528
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:19,555
I offered. She refused.

529
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,357
Stop. I almost got it.

530
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,796
Stop!

531
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,561
Abby?

532
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:28,647
She asked me not to
administer narcotics.

533
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:30,316
Give her 10 of morphine.

534
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,218
No! No! Keep going.

535
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:35,721
We need to relax you to
pop your shoulder back.

536
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:38,156
She's my patient. I'm just
trying to respect her wishes.

537
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,197
If we don't, you could end up
with permanent nerve damage.

538
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,752
Okay. Okay.

539
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,584
Push the morphine, Abby.

540
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,803
Okay. You know
what? I'm off the clock.

541
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:54,840
She's all yours. I'm
out of here. Let's go.

542
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:06,417
I had a dream last night

543
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:09,571
that I'd be in a car
wreck, but I'd survive.

544
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,838
My grandmother was like that.

545
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,807
She could predict when
her cat would get sick.

546
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,993
In the dream,

547
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:18,163
I strangled a female
doctor with my bare hands.

548
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:20,666
Hey, Cleo. Is Malucci here yet?

549
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,467
No. We're done.

550
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,335
Someone'll be back
to fit you for crutches.

551
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,937
Just sit tight.

552
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,573
You should get dressed now.
So when he gets here, we can go.

553
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,208
I'm thinking this
might not happen,

554
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:32,010
between this storm and
how swamped we are.

555
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,311
You should go ahead without me.

556
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:34,780
Are you serious?

557
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:37,149
Yeah, Malucci only said
he'd try. He couldn't promise.

558
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:38,150
Aw. What?

559
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:39,151
Cleo, come on.

560
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,819
That would've been nice to know.

561
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:43,188
Well, it would've been
nice if you'd asked me to go.

562
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:44,622
What? I did. No.

563
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:47,693
You RSVP'd and told me to
save the date. Cindy Purcelli?

564
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,161
Right here. All right.

565
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:52,263
So, what are you saying?
You don't want to go?

566
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,532
I don't have a compelling need

567
00:22:53,556 --> 00:22:55,300
to attend your
ex-girlfriend's wedding.

568
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:58,120
Cleo, we dated. It's no big
deal. She's getting married.

569
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,821
Peter. All right.

570
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,791
Listen, if you don't want to go,
just say you don't want to go.

571
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:03,959
All right.

572
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,044
All right what?

573
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:06,412
I don't want to go.

574
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:08,113
Fine.

575
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,381
Amira, I need a car.

576
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,817
What are you doing back?
A car. I need to borrow...

577
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,485
Peter! Peter, can
I borrow your car?

578
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:15,053
I-I need to get to the church.

579
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:16,789
I'm on my way
now. Right. Perfect.

580
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,391
Can you take me? Come on.

581
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:21,493
I'll just change in your car.

582
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,812
Where's Cleo?

583
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,956
Are people arriving?

584
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,913
A few.

585
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:43,532
Any sign of Mark?

586
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,400
He'll be here.

587
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,086
Where's Isabelle?

588
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,688
Oh, she went off looking
for someone to complain to

589
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,457
about the temperature.

590
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:57,096
So I'm going to
be a grandfather.

591
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,181
This won't affect
my dating, will it?

592
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,433
One can only hope.

593
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:03,735
Yes. Well,

594
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,806
maybe I'll be better at
it a generation removed.

595
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,224
Parenting.

596
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,528
Listen, I didn't turn
out that badly, did I?

597
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,368
That was luck.

598
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:19,618
You gonna continue to
practice after the baby's born?

599
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,125
Eventually.

600
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:29,878
What?

601
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,080
Nothing.

602
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,420
That's good.

603
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:36,335
I know what you're thinking.

604
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,220
For years I criticized
you and Mommy

605
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,088
for all the time
you spent working,

606
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,673
and now I'm about
to do the same.

607
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,510
I'm sure you'll strike
a better balance.

608
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:46,311
You don't believe that.

609
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:47,734
Actually, I do.

610
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,000
No answer?

611
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,335
Just the church
service schedule.

612
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,738
Elizabeth is gonna be on
the verge of a meltdown.

613
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,107
Yeah, I bet.

614
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,009
Between the weather,
and her mother,

615
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,578
and her father, who
I have yet to meet.

616
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,046
Oh, he's okay.

617
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,081
You know him?

618
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,616
Yeah, I met him.

619
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,406
That's right.

620
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,643
Why aren't we moving?

621
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,024
We should've taken
the expressway.

622
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,626
You said not to
take the expressway.

623
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,483
I know. I know.

624
00:25:23,806 --> 00:25:25,017
Is he a nice guy?

625
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,184
Who?

626
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,653
Elizabeth's dad.

627
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:29,955
Oh. Well, he seemed nice.

628
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:31,690
That's good.

629
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:33,692
'Cause her mother can
really be a piece of work.

630
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,193
Yeah.

631
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:37,729
What is it with women
and their mothers?

632
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,866
I mean, I got along
with my mom. You?

633
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,818
She was the best.

634
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,253
Must be a chick thing.

635
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,072
And weddings
really bring it out.

636
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,045
So have you met Cleo's mom?

637
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,447
No. Really?

638
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,505
Thought you guys
were, uh, pretty serious.

639
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:06,758
What the hell is the problem?

640
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:12,163
This isn't gonna
leave a scar, is it?

641
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,832
Not that you'd notice. Huh.

642
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:16,267
A nurse will be by
to put on a dressing.

643
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,502
Jing-Mei,

644
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,504
we've got a hypothermic
10-year-old coming in.

645
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:20,505
ETA?

646
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:22,006
Mm. Ten to 15.

647
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,274
Okay, set up some warm saline.

648
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:24,509
Close the exit!

649
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,577
No!

650
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,979
Morris! Morris!

651
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,703
Now, Morris!

652
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,972
Get the cuffs on her!

653
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,724
Leave me alone! Let go!

654
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:41,026
What happened?

655
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,878
She jumped off
the table and ran.

656
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,380
Stop! She bit me!
The bitch bit me!

657
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,949
You're hurting her. Stop
it! I'm missing my daughter!

658
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,968
Please! Where's the cuffs?

659
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:51,770
Stop. Stop!

660
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:54,339
I'm missing my daughter! No!

661
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:57,275
Come on!

662
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,278
Please! I have to
see my daughter!

663
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,268
I have to see her!

664
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:07,853
How was that wine?

665
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,988
Oh, it was very nice. Thanks.

666
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,523
I'm getting a refill.
You want one?

667
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,891
No, I really shouldn't.

668
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:15,160
Oh, come on. You're not driving.

669
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,778
You're tenacious.

670
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,380
Is that a yes? Heh-heh. Okay.

671
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,714
Only if I buy this round.

672
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,817
Even better. Excuse
me. Two more, please.

673
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,952
May I?

674
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,088
Sure.

675
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,789
I'm Mike. Hi, Mike. I'm Kerry.

676
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,758
Yeah, you working on your novel?

677
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,459
Uh, no.

678
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,179
No, I was just writing
a letter to a friend.

679
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:35,597
E-mail or actual letter writing?

680
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,499
An actual letter.

681
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,684
A lost art.

682
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:41,103
The last letter I wrote
was to Marcia Brady.

683
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,138
Did she write you back?

684
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,306
No. Never really got over it.

685
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,208
Oh. I'm sorry.

686
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,478
So, what do you do when
you're not writing letters?

687
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,279
Uh, I'm a... I'm a doctor.

688
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,815
Really? Yeah.
Emergency medicine.

689
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,734
Brains too.

690
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,001
That's impressive.

691
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,620
Thanks.

692
00:27:58,644 --> 00:27:59,954
Damn it! What?

693
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:03,091
It's dead. I dropped it,
and it must have... Uh!

694
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,193
All right, calm down.
There's nothing you can do.

695
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,295
I'm missing it. No, you're not.

696
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,331
It... It started, Peter.

697
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,565
Obviously, it hasn't.

698
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,700
I am screwed.

699
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,804
She'll wait, Mark.

700
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,839
Mark, what are you doing?

701
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,074
Mark!

702
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,652
Mark, get off my car!

703
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:33,321
I'm trying to see
what the hang-up is.

704
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,489
Mark, get down!

705
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,525
I think I see lights.

706
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,560
Maybe a cop. Maybe a rig.

707
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,912
Mark, get down! Now!
Come on, man! Get down!

708
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,580
Approximately
seven-year-old male,

709
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,982
environmental exposure
with secondary hypothermia.

710
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:47,118
This is ice. Rain's
freezing everything.

711
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,954
Any idea how long
he's been down?

712
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,622
Groundskeeper found him
down on the soccer field. No ID.

713
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,491
Guess he was at the
game that got rained out.

714
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:55,893
Where's the rest of his
team? Or his parents?

715
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,829
BP is 70 palp. Core temp is 86.

716
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,564
Pupils are slow but reactive.

717
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:00,832
Set up for re-warming.

718
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:02,500
Start a second
line of warm saline.

719
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:03,534
And put in a Foley.

720
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:05,236
He's about 80
pounds, soaking wet.

721
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,537
I'll be right there.

722
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:09,407
Yeah. let's get him
out of these wet clothes.

723
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:12,743
She just wants to see
you. Is that so hard?

724
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,212
Yeah, I know it's
been a long time.

725
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,615
How many years has
she served for you?

726
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:18,005
Hello?

727
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:20,685
Jerk.

728
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:21,786
Who's a jerk?

729
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,988
Nobody.

730
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,406
You feeling any better?

731
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,840
No.

732
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,492
Why don't you go lie
down in the lounge?

733
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,077
I'll take you home
when I'm done.

734
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,463
Okay, I just have
to finish this first.

735
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:33,270
Are you mad at me?

736
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:36,367
Me? No.

737
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:40,914
You were a little
hard on Carter.

738
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:44,176
He wasn't listening to me.

739
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,644
He's a good doctor.

740
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:48,263
And, uh, he's been
here for a long time.

741
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,481
And I'm his Attending.

742
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:52,717
I know. It's just

743
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:54,319
he's my friend.

744
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:56,822
So?

745
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,389
I don't know. He's
a nice enough guy.

746
00:29:58,413 --> 00:29:59,858
But he's got to
let me do my job.

747
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,126
Isn't he your supervisor?

748
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,460
Technically.

749
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:03,628
So this has nothing to do

750
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:05,297
with him dating
your ex-girlfriend?

751
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,232
No. No.

752
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:10,101
Actually, Abby and I
never really went out.

753
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,769
You said you did.
Yeah, I made that up.

754
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,138
Why would you make that up?

755
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:14,739
I'll explain it to you later.

756
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:16,107
So you'd like to
go out with her?

757
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:17,375
I... Hey, Dave!

758
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,876
Hey, Carter. Nice weather, huh?

759
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,911
Do you know Rena?

760
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:20,912
Yeah. How are you doing?

761
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,313
Fine, thanks.

762
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:25,016
I didn't think you'd
come. Cleo didn't need me

763
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,602
and a few girls from Uncle
Sal's party like weddings.

764
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,104
Did you RSVP for 'em?

765
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,606
With the rain, there's bound
to be a couple of no-shows.

766
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,809
A few extra butts in
the pews couldn't hurt.

767
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,310
You know where can I dump this?

768
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,064
Uh, they'll probably have
a gift table at the reception.

769
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,650
I'm supposed to lug this
around till then? It's heavy.

770
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,952
You didn't buy them a
crock pot, did you? No.

771
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,204
No. We got them
something off the registry.

772
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:47,471
Yeah, I'm not into that.

773
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:50,130
"Here's a list of things
to buy me." It's dicky.

774
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,712
Evening, gentlemen.

775
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:57,048
What? You didn't
think I'd be invited?

776
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:59,050
So where's the bride?

777
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:02,303
Uh, she's in waiting.
Dr. Greene hasn't shown yet.

778
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,773
Really? Well, if he's smart,

779
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:07,092
he's halfway to Mexico by now.

780
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:12,314
She runs me off the road!

781
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:13,815
It's my wife!

782
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,817
Ex-wife, you
cheating son of a bitch!

783
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,286
Kept ramming me over and
over, completely out of control.

784
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,555
Do you have control
over your zipper, Kevin?

785
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,923
Look at this!

786
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,726
Take your mid-life crisis
car and shove it up your ass!

787
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,127
You could have
killed me, Brenna.

788
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,229
Everybody settle down.

789
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,497
Shut down around Bedford.

790
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,499
Excuse me. How long
before you clear the street?

791
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,435
Sir, would you step
off to the side, please?

792
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,403
Listen, I'm getting
married in 15 minutes.

793
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,339
Get back to your
car. Nothing's moving.

794
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:38,673
We're waiting for a tow truck.

795
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,342
Hey, I'm a doctor
at County General.

796
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,243
Any chance of one of
you guys giving me a lift?

797
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,546
You're joking, right?

798
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,481
I heard he's awake.
What are his vitals?

799
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,217
BP's 100/70. Temp's 97.

800
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,942
Good.

801
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,310
Hey.

802
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,626
Hi. I'm Dr. Chen.

803
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,394
You're in a hospital.

804
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,063
You were very cold

805
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,131
so we had to warm you
up through your tummy.

806
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,457
It might hurt for a while,
but you're gonna be okay.

807
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,726
Can you tell me your name?

808
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,380
Bryan Cooley.

809
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:18,330
Bryan,

810
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:19,970
do you remember what happened?

811
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,751
I was waiting.

812
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,255
I think I fell
asleep on the field.

813
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,062
What were you waiting for?

814
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:34,078
They were supposed
to pick me up.

815
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:37,515
Who? Your teammates?

816
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,072
My parents.

817
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,987
They forgot.

818
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:46,825
Well, there's a pretty
bad storm outside.

819
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:49,527
Maybe they were
just running late.

820
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,785
No. They forgot.

821
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:56,689
Sometimes they forget.

822
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,624
Are you denying it?
- I had to work late!

823
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,977
Doris! What are you doing here?

824
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:08,646
I'm stuck. Can you, uh,
give me a ride to Northbrook?

825
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,531
That's outside my
catchment area.

826
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,233
I'm trying to get to my wedding.

827
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:14,085
When? Now.

828
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:16,537
O-okay. If you help
me clear the scene.

829
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,705
Sure. Let's hurry.

830
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,774
Screwing your dental
hygienist was an accident?

831
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,309
You're crazy.

832
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,778
I'm home having your baby.
Sir, we have to check you over.

833
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,947
I'm fine. Let her
check your vital signs.

834
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,565
Let him bleed. If you're okay,

835
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,400
you can take yourself
to the hospital.

836
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,935
Who are you? I'm a doctor.

837
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,171
Did you hit your head?
What do you think?

838
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:34,572
Mark, what are you doing?

839
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,141
I'm gonna catch a ride with
Doris when we clear them.

840
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:39,544
No, I got it. Wait in the
car. No. Check her out.

841
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:41,745
Did you lose consciousness?
Ma'am, I'm a doctor.

842
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,013
Is there any pain?

843
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,333
Where is the whore? Getting
more ass fat put in her lips?

844
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,502
She didn't slam her car into
anybody, you psychotic bitch!

845
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,338
Hold still. We need
to check your head.

846
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,240
He doesn't think with
that head. Ah! Ooh.

847
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,391
Ma'am. Are you all right?

848
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:54,759
Okay, come on.

849
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,026
Oh, my God! What is it?

850
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,396
I think my water broke.
When are you due?

851
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,397
Tuesday.

852
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:00,464
Is this your first baby?

853
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:02,600
No. I gave this bastard a son.

854
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,686
How long was your first labor?

855
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,721
Oh, boy! What is it?

856
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,656
The baby's doing somersaults.

857
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,325
Sit down.

858
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,994
What's wrong?

859
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,797
Your grandchild
is getting restless.

860
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:18,299
He's not the only one.

861
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,334
Have we heard
anything from the groom?

862
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,887
I'm sure he'll be
here momentarily.

863
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,110
We'll let you know.

864
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,998
Make yourself useful,
Charles. Get us a glass of water.

865
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,049
I hope Mark
didn't get cold feet.

866
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:35,616
Oh, no.

867
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,987
Surely he would've called
if there was a problem.

868
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:42,290
Yes. Well, he's not
answering his cell phone.

869
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,193
He probably left it at
work with his wallet.

870
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:47,795
Men get just as nervous as
women on their wedding day.

871
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,952
Right, Charles?

872
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:53,535
Well, to be honest,
I was never more...

873
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,620
More anxious.

874
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:57,722
Practically forgot it
was our wedding day.

875
00:34:57,746 --> 00:35:00,375
In retrospect, that could've
been wishful thinking.

876
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:03,878
In hindsight, it would've
saved me several years of grief.

877
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,880
Stop it, please, the two
of you, just for one day!

878
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,883
We were teasing.
Well, don't! It's not funny.

879
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,636
Oh, he'll be here,
Elizabeth. Don't fret.

880
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,739
But I do fret!

881
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,442
Every time he's late I fret.

882
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:19,444
Every time he
slurs a word, or...

883
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:21,546
Or... Or gets tired
or bumps his head,

884
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,764
I fret!

885
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,650
I'm about to get married.

886
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:27,118
And I'm afraid.

887
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:28,919
Not of being with him.

888
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:30,888
But of being without him.

889
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:35,076
I'm afraid he won't be
around to raise this child.

890
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,646
But you told me the last
MRI showed no recurrence.

891
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,782
These new therapies
offer a long survival.

892
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,583
We don't know
that for sure, do we?

893
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,385
Oh, darling,

894
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,904
don't start crying now

895
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:49,312
or we'll never get
through the ceremony.

896
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,964
Say something, Charles.

897
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:58,821
You're going to have a
wonderful life together.

898
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,653
Your mother and I love
you very much, Elizabeth.

899
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:04,655
And we will always
be there for you.

900
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,979
You know that.

901
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:16,818
Breathe! Just relax.
Blow through the pain.

902
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,320
I'll bring her in. I'll give you
a ride after we drop her off.

903
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,056
I can't. I'm better
off riding with Peter.

904
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,825
I have the lights and siren.

905
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,626
Right. Go, go! Good luck!

906
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,660
Thanks.

907
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,162
Brenna? Don't talk to me.

908
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,632
I wanna come. Yeah, we're full.

909
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,300
Keep him away! She's my wife!

910
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:34,935
Radio County. Have
them call the church.

911
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,754
Tell Elizabeth where I am.

912
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,673
Brenna... Go away!

913
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,864
Let's go.

914
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:48,721
Ah.

915
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,941
He was found unconscious
on a soccer field.

916
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,676
I thought his mother
was picking him up.

917
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,078
He was hypothermic.

918
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:03,214
But we managed to bring his
body temperature back to normal.

919
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:05,649
So he'll be all right?

920
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:08,653
We'd like to keep him
overnight for observation.

921
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:10,576
He thinks you forgot about him.

922
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,826
I guess we did.

923
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,579
It's just, uh...

924
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,781
It's been a real bad few months.

925
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,833
Mr. Cooley, Bryan almost died.

926
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:25,119
He understands you both
are very busy and work a lot...

927
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,789
His mother and I are
going through a divorce.

928
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,324
We haven't told him yet.

929
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,210
That doesn't mean you
can forget about him.

930
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:33,962
Dr. Chen.

931
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:36,564
We got a mother in active
labor following an MVA.

932
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,832
When? Just rolled in.

933
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,067
Excuse me.

934
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,435
Is she full-term?

935
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,338
Mm-hm. Contractions every
eight minutes, says Dr. Greene.

936
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,372
Who?

937
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,640
Thirty-two-year-old, G-2, P-1.

938
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,209
Fetal heart tones 1/40.

939
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,711
BP's 120/80. I have to push.

940
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,214
No, Brenna, not yet. You
gotta wait till we get upstairs.

941
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,183
I can't hold it. Yes, you can.

942
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:57,918
What happened to you?
Oh, nothing. I'm fine.

943
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,455
Mark. We'll take it from
here. Go to your wedding.

944
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,723
But I need my gurney.
Take it later. Go.

945
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:03,991
Good luck, Dr. Greene.

946
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,592
You know, I-I need a shirt.

947
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,295
Luka, give him...
Give him yours.

948
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,802
What? Give him your shirt.

949
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:12,383
Is this a private party?

950
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:15,486
Uh, Mommy, Daddy, I
think you know Dr. Romano.

951
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,255
Yes. I believe you were

952
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:19,424
operating on a dog
last time we met.

953
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:20,991
That's right. You were in town

954
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:22,677
attending an
astrology conference.

955
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,062
Astronomy.

956
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:26,730
Well, anyway, I don't wanna
break up this love fest. I...

957
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:29,333
Your guests are getting
ready to eat each other.

958
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,019
Now, I have $50
Greene'll be a no-show.

959
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,421
Robert. But we just
heard from the ER.

960
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:36,607
And it seems that your
ex-boyfriend and future hubby

961
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:38,476
decided to play
paramedic on the way here.

962
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,661
He's with Peter.

963
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,595
Not anymore.
Greene's still out there

964
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,698
saving some pregnant
woman or something.

965
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,533
What? Suffice it to say,

966
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,468
if you give him a
few more minutes,

967
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,008
I'm gonna lose that bet.

968
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,699
Oh, uh...

969
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,871
You look beautiful, Elizabeth.

970
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,719
Thank you, Robert.

971
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,809
Greene's a lucky man.

972
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,029
I know.

973
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:15,146
I always wanted
to move to Florida,

974
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,581
just get away from
the ice and snow.

975
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,882
Why didn't you?

976
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:21,385
I don't know. It just
never worked out.

977
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:22,820
I know what you mean.

978
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:25,055
By this time I always thought

979
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,658
that I'd be married
with two kids and a dog.

980
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:29,793
Well, you can always
get the dog. Heh-heh.

981
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:31,295
That's true enough.

982
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:33,414
How about you?

983
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:37,251
You don't live with,
like, 50 cats or anything?

984
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,652
No.

985
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,320
I didn't think so.

986
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,356
Too pretty to be one of
those crazy cat ladies.

987
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,225
<i>Now boarding at Gate 17,</i>

988
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,060
<i>Flight 2247 to Portland...</i>

989
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,595
I guess you were right.

990
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,697
Some of those flights
were just delayed.

991
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,920
That was mine.

992
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,020
Maybe when we're both in town
again, we could have dinner?

993
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,793
Since we've already had drinks.

994
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:00,591
Uh...

995
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,244
I'm not so sure that
that would work out.

996
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,902
Oh, uh, okay.

997
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,167
Well, thanks for the drink.

998
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:12,003
And thanks for the
company. Really.

999
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:13,204
If you ever change your mind,

1000
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:15,361
or you find yourself
stranded in an airport...

1001
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:18,926
Enjoy Las Vegas, Kerry.

1002
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,683
Thanks.

1003
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,285
My last jailbird had an
ingrown hair in her groin.

1004
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,020
How lucky is that? Hey.

1005
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,554
What happened to you?

1006
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,924
Has anyone seen Dr. Finch?
I think she's in the lounge.

1007
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,380
Oh, great.

1008
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,599
Whoa.

1009
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,668
Peter, what are you doing here?

1010
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,753
There was an accident.
Where are you going?

1011
00:41:02,777 --> 00:41:04,755
On my way to meet
you at the reception.

1012
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:06,156
Oh, really?

1013
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,858
Yeah. Do you
think it's too late?

1014
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,926
No, no, no. I don't
think it's too late. Good.

1015
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,929
Whoa, whoa. What makes
you think I still want to?

1016
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:14,765
Because you like
to dance with me.

1017
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:16,166
Oh, I do, do I?

1018
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,568
Yeah. Let's go.

1019
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,638
You know you're
looking good, right.

1020
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:21,772
Thanks. You look wet.

1021
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:23,191
Mind if we stop so I can change?

1022
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:25,359
We'll take my car. All
right. Give me the keys.

1023
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:26,994
You're not driving.
Of course I am.

1024
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,596
Why does a guy automatically
think he has to drive?

1025
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,799
Hi, Linda? Yeah, hi.

1026
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,368
This is Jing-Mei Chen.

1027
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,704
No, no. Everything's
fine. Um, it's just, uh,

1028
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,173
I thought I'd call and, um...

1029
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,875
I got your card.

1030
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,234
Oh, yeah. He's beautiful.

1031
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,970
Is that him?

1032
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,187
He's laughing already?

1033
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,890
Oh.

1034
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,980
Wow.

1035
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,327
Hm.

1036
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,884
Really?

1037
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,068
Thanks.

1038
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,320
Your jacket.

1039
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:11,444
Your jacket! Good luck! Oh.

1040
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,160
Are you Mark?

1041
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,261
Yes.

1042
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,662
Glad you could make it.

1043
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,319
Sorry. Ahem.

1044
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:29,188
Good luck.

1045
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,626
Nice of you to show up.

1046
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,383
It was raining.

1047
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,266
Dearly beloved...
