1
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,921
Hey, Greg.

2
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,990
Hey, Dr. Greene. Busy day, huh?

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,625
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,560
Can we, uh, skip the
gown? I got a shift.

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,664
Oh, sure, yeah. Let's go.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,008
You know they say we're
gonna hit zero tonight.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,394
Even with the snow?

8
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:37,819
Thought my heating bill
was bad last month. Hm.

9
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:41,001
Feel any side effects?

10
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:43,937
Just the usual fatigue.

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,441
Well, in eight days
this will all be a memory.

12
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:50,160
Believe me, I've been counting.

13
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,880
Okay, hold on, because we're
off by about a millimeter or so.

14
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:56,082
Take your time. I don't
want anything to get zapped

15
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,584
that doesn't have to be.

16
00:00:57,608 --> 00:01:01,393
There we go. I'm
gonna lock you in now.

17
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:09,129
Here we go. You okay? Yeah.

18
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,969
About three minutes. Right.

19
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,153
What do we got?
58-year-old male.

20
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,689
Collapsed at a birthday
party. Intubated in the field.

21
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,991
Whoa. That's a clown.

22
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,827
He aspirated a balloon in
front of a dozen 6-year-olds.

23
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,078
Good air entry. BP's 105/70.

24
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:27,714
Carter, will you
help Abby with this?

25
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:29,248
Why can't you do it?

26
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:30,249
I... I just can't.

27
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,119
What, Dave, you
afraid of clowns?

28
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,721
Maybe he had a bad circus
experience. How long he down?

29
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:37,157
Three to five minutes.
Found him in respiratory arrest.

30
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,158
Hook him up to a vent.

31
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,560
EKG, CBC, lytes,
cardiac enzymes.

32
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,962
Dr. Carter... will you
talk to this woman?

33
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,964
And a chest film. I wanna
check tube placement.

34
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,566
What's up? I've
got a dirty needle.

35
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,034
I want a clean...
We don't do that.

36
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:50,337
Like I said. A doctor
here gave this to me.

37
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,071
He said if I come back
today, I can have...

38
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,840
There's a number to
call. There's a van...

39
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,975
I don't want to call the
van. I want a clean needle.

40
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,810
I'm sorry. I cannot
help you. Dr. Carter?

41
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,363
He said I wouldn't have to wait.

42
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,032
Some girl called. Said she
can't make it tonight. Flu.

43
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,268
Some girl? That's...
You didn't get her name?

44
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,770
You got more than
one date? Oh, great.

45
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,639
Big date? Had potential.

46
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,508
So ask someone else.

47
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,510
No, it's this charity
event. It'll be boring.

48
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,611
Nobody will want to go.

49
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,346
Why? Ask someone
in the ER. Like who?

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,514
I don't know. Chuny?

51
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,816
You, uh, wanna go?
Not me. I've got plans.

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,484
Don't even look at me.

53
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,819
Dr. Carter?

54
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,022
Hey, sorry about that. I
got, uh, pulled away there.

55
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,757
You were gonna give
me something for...

56
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,393
Mary, can you give Jeff
here some viscous lidocaine?

57
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,095
They haven't taken my blood yet.

58
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,697
No? Someone will be in there.

59
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,298
Do you think it's
something serious?

60
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,467
Probably not. But, uh,
with two weeks of fever,

61
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,868
we should check
out a few things.

62
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,320
How we doing in here?

63
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:43,023
Some spontaneous
movement, but he's still out.

64
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,613
Glasgow Coma Scale is 1-1-4.

65
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,278
So, what are you doing tonight?

66
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,498
I've got an appointment
with my couch.

67
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:53,466
Pulse ox, 98 on 50 percent.

68
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,135
Well, I hate to come
between you and your couch,

69
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,770
but how does dinner and dancing

70
00:02:57,794 --> 00:02:59,089
at the history museum sound?

71
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,674
Dancing at the museum?

72
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:03,609
Pressure's down to
90/60. Run in 500 of saline.

73
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,811
Yeah, it's, um...

74
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,930
It's a benefit for an
after-school program.

75
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,015
Ah. Charity date.

76
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,685
How's the EKG
coming? Almost done.

77
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,237
Yeah, my grandparents,
um, host this annual event,

78
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,406
and I have to go.

79
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,706
But I would...

80
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,643
think of it as a favor...

81
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,478
Do I owe you a favor?

82
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,313
Ha. At the very
least, it's a free meal.

83
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,199
Tombstones on
the anterior leads.

84
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:28,568
Let's push 6000 of
heparin. Call the Cath Lab.

85
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:30,703
BP's only 70 systolic.
Would you get Dr. Weaver?

86
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,688
Start dopamine at 10
mics per kilo per minute.

87
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,990
I'll put him in Tredelenburg.

88
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,826
Dr. Weaver. This
clown is crashing.

89
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,832
So, what do you, uh,
think about tonight?

90
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,901
I think it's the
least I could do.

91
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:37,537
No one should be
alone after killing a clown.

92
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,871
You killed the clown? No.

93
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,408
Didn't save him.

94
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:42,942
Enough flu on the board?

95
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,343
'Tis the season.

96
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,845
Guy in Curtain
3 fell off a ladder.

97
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,146
Oh, yeah? How far?

98
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,449
Taking down Christmas
lights. Fell from the top rung.

99
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:51,250
That's what you get
for procrastinating.

100
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:52,452
I'll take it.

101
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:55,021
There he is. This is
my doctor. Hi, Janice.

102
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,439
They wouldn't give me a needle.

103
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,375
Haleh, take it and
give her a clean needle.

104
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,443
You serious? We
I&D'd the abscess

105
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,462
on her forearm
yesterday. I got that.

106
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,264
This will keep it from
happening again.

107
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:06,099
Thank you, Dr. Greene.

108
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:07,717
Come back tomorrow
for a wound check.

109
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,051
I'll try.

110
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,753
You're, uh, not
gonna fill out a chart?

111
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,954
Nope. No prescription?

112
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,856
Waste of time.

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,160
I can get behind that.

114
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,094
Excuse me.

115
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,130
I'm looking for Dr. Kovac.

116
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,832
I know you. You're...
You're the bishop, right?

117
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:23,900
Right.

118
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,435
Where's that hat
you were wearing?

119
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,204
I left that one at home
today. Oh. I really liked it.

120
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,273
Me too. There he is.

121
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,274
Hello again.

122
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,809
Bishop... are you all right?

123
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,413
Oh, yeah. Sure. I was just
finishing up my visitations.

124
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,048
Do you have a moment?

125
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,183
I don't see a cane.

126
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,984
No, you don't.

127
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,719
Have any more pain?

128
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,887
Not from the fall.

129
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,789
Your arthritis is
still a problem?

130
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,158
I was wondering if I could get

131
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,793
another prescription for
some prednisone to keep going.

132
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,295
Did you follow up
with your doctor?

133
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,065
No, I keep having to
change the appointment.

134
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,300
That should be
the priority. I know.

135
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,302
Unfortunately, he
doesn't work on Saturdays.

136
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,004
What's his name?
Don Frost at St. Mary's.

137
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,374
I should call him. Ha.
You'll only get his service.

138
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,243
And frankly, just between
us, I'd rather not get him going.

139
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,545
I so much as sneeze,

140
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,646
and he wants to poke
and prod every inch of me.

141
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,014
I'd have to do some tests

142
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,649
before prescribing
anything more.

143
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,953
What kind of tests?

144
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,888
Blood, urine... check
your sugar level.

145
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,656
My sugar's a little high.

146
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,092
I have a touch of diabetes.

147
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,426
But I control it with diet.

148
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,427
Okay. Let's take a look.

149
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,795
<i>Ah.</i>

150
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,996
Ah. Ah. Ah.

151
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,432
Mm. Looks good.

152
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,866
Strep throat, right?

153
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,703
No fever, no swollen glands.

154
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,705
I had the exact
thing last year. Strep.

155
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,141
You have a cold, Mr. Ramirez.

156
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,860
Antibiotics, 10 days. Right?

157
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:44,163
No white spots on your
tonsils. Antibiotics won't help.

158
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,282
Well, last year I took
'em, they cleared right up.

159
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,867
It would have cleared up anyway.

160
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,036
Come on, doc. I've been
waiting three hours here.

161
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,871
Plenty of fluids
and get some rest.

162
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:53,640
Can you just give
me the prescription?

163
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,041
Dr. Greene, we need you.

164
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:56,643
You don't have strep throat.

165
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,166
I'll take them just in case.

166
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,831
85-year-old woman,
collapsed at her nursing home.

167
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,299
You got a pulse? No.

168
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,700
Found her in V-fib. Intubated,

169
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,553
shocked five times,
two rounds of drugs.

170
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:08,171
How long you been
at it? 20 minutes.

171
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,073
She's pretty blue. Okay,
everybody, nice and easy.

172
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,898
On my count. One, two, three...

173
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,512
Any medical history?

174
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,181
Emphysema. She's on home oxygen.

175
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,266
Asystole on the monitor.

176
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,735
When was the last
epi? Five minutes ago.

177
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,988
Push another amp.

178
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,557
What? She didn't respond

179
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,725
to 20 minutes of
ACLS in the field.

180
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,910
She doesn't have a chance.

181
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,912
I know. The family
wanted us to bring her in.

182
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,165
Why? So we could flog
her for another hour?

183
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,088
You want dopamine? Nope.

184
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,752
I'm sorry, Dr. Greene.

185
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,589
She should have
died in her own bed.

186
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,174
Abby, hold compressions.

187
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,293
Asystole.

188
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:51,181
Time of death: 1409.

189
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,525
Family's in Chairs.

190
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,456
Don't worry about it.

191
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:03,342
Hey. Hey.

192
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,700
Everything okay?
We just lost a patient.

193
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,380
Sorry.

194
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,517
That singer you like is
playing at the hotel tonight.

195
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,221
Really? Ten o'clock.

196
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,990
I told Carter I'd go
somewhere with him tonight.

197
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,292
Oh. Okay.

198
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,377
It's a fundraiser thing.
His date stood him up.

199
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,246
It's not a problem.

200
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,498
I have a pile of
journals to read.

201
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:28,334
Well, I'm sorry. I wouldn't
have said yes if I knew...

202
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,086
Labs are back on the bishop.

203
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,838
Blood sugar's high.

204
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,944
Go. Have fun. Okay.

205
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:41,269
Draw five units. Take
a look at his ANA.

206
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,383
Do you have his
BUN and creatinine?

207
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,807
Renal insufficiency.

208
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:50,945
Hey, Jeff.

209
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,109
You okay?

210
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,478
Just nervous.

211
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,502
Sit. I got your blood test back.

212
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,684
Okay. Bad news is you
have mononucleosis.

213
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,152
Good news is, if you rest up,

214
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,887
you'll bounce back
in a couple weeks.

215
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,323
Mono. Yeah. But
you'll be all right.

216
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,825
How is my blood count?

217
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,894
Uh... white cells were
a little elevated, but...

218
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,880
that's consistent with mono.

219
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:16,144
What about my CD4 count?

220
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,268
Are you HIV-positive?

221
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:22,071
'Cause we only
do that if you are.

222
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,773
I think I need an HIV test.

223
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,809
Have you ever
been tested before?

224
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,412
Five months ago I was
negative. That's good.

225
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,531
But, uh, since then
I've been exposed.

226
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:32,732
You've had unprotected sex?

227
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:34,722
With an infected partner.

228
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,409
You know how unsafe that is?

229
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,220
I guess I just get caught up.

230
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,667
Gotta put a stop to that, Jeff.

231
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,864
My sugar that bad?

232
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,023
Three hundred forty-eight.

233
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,682
Maybe I should go
back on the glipizide.

234
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,484
Right now you need insulin.

235
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,752
There was also...

236
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,554
protein in your urine.

237
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,640
So I ordered an, um, ANA.

238
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:17,660
That's a test for a
disease called lupus.

239
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,396
I know.

240
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,198
I take Plaquenil.

241
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,355
200 milligrams a day.

242
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,704
You lied to me?

243
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,340
Ha. I wanted to avoid a debate.

244
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:33,209
I may have harmed you
by giving you those steroids.

245
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,794
The steroids help me.

246
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:37,297
I can move around, make visits,

247
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,598
do my work.

248
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:40,032
Without them...

249
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,634
I'm stuck in bed.

250
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:45,004
The steroids raise
your blood sugar so high

251
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,348
that the diabetes
destroys your body.

252
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:51,799
I need to continue my ministry.

253
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,802
You understand?

254
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,636
Anyway...

255
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,971
thank you for your time.

256
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,673
I need to do a
complete physical exam.

257
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:07,043
Ah. No, I'm sorry. I got
a lot on my plate today.

258
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,717
I have to make sure I didn't
harm you with my treatment.

259
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,071
You owe me that much.

260
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,194
And what is it you
think I owe you?

261
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,691
Bishop...

262
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,128
lupus is very serious.

263
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,230
It can attack your kidneys,

264
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,348
lungs, your heart.

265
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:30,471
I know what it does, Dr. Kovac.

266
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,916
I even know I'm
gonna die from it.

267
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,932
Did I wake you?

268
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,934
No, I was just resting my eyes.

269
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,969
So how's the heart?

270
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:52,271
EKG looks good.

271
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,040
That's what we like to hear.

272
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,242
Do you want me to call
someone to come be with you?

273
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:01,452
No. I called the
archdiocese just in case.

274
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,267
What church do you belong to?

275
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,035
I don't.

276
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,989
Haven't found one you
liked? Haven't looked.

277
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,573
How long have you
been in Chicago?

278
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:14,243
I don't go to church anymore.

279
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,751
Really? Why's that?

280
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,136
I don't remember.

281
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,257
You married? No.

282
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,788
Haven't found one you liked?

283
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,458
Something like that, yeah.

284
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,260
Dr. Kovac, we've got a kid
with bad congestive heart failure.

285
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,217
The nurse will be in.

286
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,267
What's the pulse ox? 81.

287
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,736
Sixteen year old. Collapsed
at a basketball game.

288
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,971
Watching or playing? Watching.

289
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,607
What's his name? Nick.

290
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,576
Hi, Nick. I'm Dr. Kovac.

291
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,560
Whoa.

292
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,562
Have you had
heart surgery, Nick?

293
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:50,563
Transplant.

294
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,731
How long ago? Six years.

295
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,867
Okay, someone call
his parents. On their way.

296
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,736
BP, 115/72.

297
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,204
Lungs are full of fluid.

298
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,805
He's in pulmonary edema.

299
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,807
Sublingual nitroglycerin
and start a drip.

300
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,793
Open your mouth,
Nick. This will help.

301
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,460
Okay. Titrate up
to 10 of morphine.

302
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,798
I need a 12-lead, blood gas,
portable chest and 40 of Lasix.

303
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:12,034
Pulse ox down to 78.
Notify the transplant team,

304
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,419
and order a PICU bed.

305
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:15,138
They want to give
me a new heart?

306
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,672
Yes.

307
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:19,342
I don't want another transplant.

308
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,431
Malucci, what do
you got in Exam 4?

309
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:26,532
Uh, lady with bronchitis.

310
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,134
Sending her out
with amoxicillin.

311
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:31,537
Bronchitis? Productive
cough, myalgias, arthralgias.

312
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,973
Sounds like the flu. She's
pretty high-maintenance.

313
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:36,442
She wants antibiotics.
Antibiotics are not indicated.

314
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,210
I told her that, but
she still wants them.

315
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,213
You need to educate her
about antibiotic resistance.

316
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,182
Do I have to? Gotta
break the cycle.

317
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:45,017
It's easier to just
write a prescription.

318
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,020
If you feed the bears,
they'll come back for more.

319
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,323
Food poisoning gets
another liter of saline.

320
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:52,658
Check a post-reduction
shoulder on this one.

321
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:55,661
This is a patient who's
waiting on an... HIV test.

322
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,029
Okay. Malucci can take it.

323
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,365
This last one's pretty
delicate. He's high-risk...

324
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,434
Malucci can be delicate.
Thank you, chief.

325
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,335
No, really...

326
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:06,138
Dave, this one's
gonna require some tact.

327
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,322
You got it.

328
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,610
He's a patient with
mono, he's gay,

329
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,779
he refuses to use condoms.

330
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,013
Think you can talk to him?

331
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,365
Without being insensitive?

332
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,490
Sure. I'll wrap it all
up in a nice big bow.

333
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Tsk.

334
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,724
Carter... a construction worker

335
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,476
had a pane of glass
dropped on him.

336
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,695
Can you help with the
suturing? Actually, I'm off.

337
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,746
I gotta go.

338
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,882
Oh, yeah, the fundraising. Yeah.

339
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,117
Yeah, you know, it's more
like a family obligation.

340
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,719
It's nothing really exciting.

341
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,754
What's the charity?

342
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,556
After-school
enrichment programs.

343
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,957
Enrichment?

344
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,792
Yeah. It's, you
know, extra education.

345
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,616
Arts, music, that kind of thing.

346
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,147
Actually, Abby's saving me

347
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,149
from getting heat
from my grandparents.

348
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,901
They kind of insist
I bring somebody.

349
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,103
I hope it's successful.

350
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,237
Thank you.

351
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,381
Oh. See you.

352
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:02,260
Hey, Jeff. I'm Dr. Malucci.

353
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,796
Dr. Carter went off duty.

354
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,082
You, uh... You
have his lab results?

355
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,150
I'd like to talk to
Jeff about that.

356
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,201
Would you excuse us?

357
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:11,103
Uh, actually, I'd like to stay.

358
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,339
I'm Sean, Jeff's partner.

359
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:16,041
Is that okay with
you, Jeff? Yeah.

360
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:17,676
Okay, well, it's all good, man.

361
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,800
Your HIV antibody test
came back negative.

362
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,882
Really? Yeah. You got lucky.

363
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:25,684
But now you need to avoid
risky behavior and, uh...

364
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,637
and... And keep
yourself healthy.

365
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,555
Yeah.

366
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,545
Mm. Am I missing
something here, guys?

367
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,815
I'm HIV-positive.

368
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,030
Oh.

369
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:40,335
Jeff and I are together.

370
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:43,235
Through everything.

371
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,236
Right.

372
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,938
So, what?

373
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:47,072
Are you...

374
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,662
trying to contract HIV?

375
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,328
You a bug chaser, Jeff?

376
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,579
We don't call it that.

377
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:55,414
Really? Then what
do you call it? Suicide?

378
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:57,300
HIV is treatable
with medication.

379
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,335
Doesn't mean you
should try and catch it.

380
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,504
Look... we both know

381
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,973
that his HIV antibody
could be negative

382
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,008
for six weeks after exposure.

383
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,393
So you can't really tell us

384
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,867
that he's definitely
negative, can you?

385
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,766
Uh, no.

386
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,267
We'd have to take
a direct measure

387
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,519
of his viral load.

388
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,192
Okay. Mm, let's do that.

389
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:21,729
That's gonna take some time.

390
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,533
We'll wait. Yeah, we'll wait.

391
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:29,386
Okay.

392
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:33,074
Flat T-waves in
the lateral leads.

393
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,377
Okay. Repeat 12-lead in an hour.

394
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,092
Something wrong?

395
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:44,063
You have some
non-specific EKG changes.

396
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:50,636
Yeah, and there is a
friction rub around your heart.

397
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,139
I'm creaky all over.

398
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:55,508
Have you had chest pain?

399
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:58,244
Occasionally. I'm used
to it. How about today?

400
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,546
This morning. For how long?

401
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,970
I don't know, half an hour?

402
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,119
You may have fluid
around the heart.

403
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:09,955
You could be at
risk for a heart attack.

404
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,557
I feel fine.

405
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,726
We need to get a cardiac
echo and admit you.

406
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,262
No.

407
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,631
I have to observe your
heart for at least six hours.

408
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,932
I'll stay six hours, but I
don't want to be checked in.

409
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,669
I'd rather observe
you in the Cardiac Unit.

410
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:25,588
I don't want my life
to end in a hospital.

411
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,412
You're not gonna die
today. I will not be admitted.

412
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,995
Are you Nick's
doctor? Yes. Dr. Kovac.

413
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,897
There's no doctor
with him, just a nurse.

414
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,733
Well, Nick is stable right now.

415
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,769
He was in heart failure?

416
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,671
Yes, uh, he's responding
to aggressive therapy.

417
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,939
He has pulmonary edema.

418
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,608
The same thing happened
after his second transplant.

419
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,144
He's had two?

420
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,013
One when he was 4, then
again when he was 10,

421
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,282
and now he's on
the list for a third.

422
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,168
They did angioplasty last
year, but he's still so weak.

423
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,942
Has Nick ever told you he
doesn't want a new heart?

424
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,607
He says that when
he's depressed.

425
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,959
He takes 15 medications a day.

426
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,777
He's still so sick.

427
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,880
A lot for a 16-year-old
to go through. Mm.

428
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,599
Can you call UNOS? He
should go to a higher status.

429
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,734
I was waiting to talk to you

430
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,136
to see if that's
what you wanted.

431
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,660
Of course we do.

432
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,557
Okay.

433
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,160
Dr. Greene, my flu patient
wants to see someone higher up.

434
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,195
What's the problem?
She wants antibiotics.

435
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,197
Says she gets them every
year. Refuses to leave

436
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,565
until she gets a prescription.

437
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:27,666
Where is she?

438
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,130
Right there. Curtain 1.

439
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,339
Hello. My name's Dr. Greene.

440
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,576
Sara Dell. I've been
sick for three days.

441
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,796
Fever, runny nose... Feel
like my head's in a vise.

442
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,133
Mrs. Dell, antibiotics
don't help the flu.

443
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,835
They always help mine.

444
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,803
I can assure you they don't.

445
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,139
You're not giving them
to me 'cause I'm poor.

446
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,374
If we give antibiotics

447
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,343
to the millions of people
who don't need them,

448
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,577
a resistance builds,

449
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,446
which eventually
makes the drugs useless

450
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,981
to the people who do.

451
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,883
And 'cause I don't
have insurance.

452
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,101
That's persecution.

453
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,768
You think so? I know so.

454
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,438
You know what? Follow me.
Well, where are we going?

455
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:09,062
Come on, follow
me. Pay attention.

456
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,466
Excuse me.

457
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:15,614
My name is Dr. Greene.

458
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:17,867
I'd like to see a show of hands

459
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:20,035
of people who
have a sore throat.

460
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,553
Right here. Yeah, man.

461
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,577
Cough?

462
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,724
Muscle aches, fever?

463
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,678
You all have the flu.

464
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,046
People who have the flu

465
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,632
will not be receiving
antibiotics today.

466
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:35,400
So consider that
while you decide

467
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,269
whether you want to wait or not.

468
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:40,438
What are you doing?
Clearing the board.

469
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,407
Isn't that an EMTALA violation?

470
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,116
I didn't discharge anyone.

471
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,997
Hey, Greene. Tell me you are not

472
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,566
giving free needles to junkies.

473
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,201
On a case-by-case
basis. No, no, no.

474
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,635
On no basis. It's illegal.

475
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,288
Not if there's a public-health
emergency, which there is.

476
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:58,791
How much of your
brain did they cut out?

477
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:01,160
This does not put extra
needles on the street.

478
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:02,761
I don't care. We
are not gonna have

479
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,546
junkies parading
in and out of here.

480
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,633
So you're not interested in
cutting back on HIV and...?

481
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:10,252
And? What? Sounds like...?

482
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,587
Hep...

483
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,505
Hep...? Hep...

484
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,208
Hep? Heparin? Heptathlon?

485
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,177
Hepatitis. Tough one.

486
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:20,796
Tell you what. You want
to start a needle exchange,

487
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,403
do it from your house.

488
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,245
<i>♪ Forgetting all I'm lacking ♪</i>

489
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:40,049
<i>♪ Completely incomplete ♪</i>

490
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:44,370
<i>♪ I'll take your invitation ♪</i>

491
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:46,905
Hi. You're wearing a tuxedo.

492
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,308
You didn't say it
was formal. I didn't?

493
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,892
No. Oh.

494
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,563
Yeah, it's formal.
Heh. You tricked me.

495
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,231
Doesn't matter.
You look terrific.

496
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,268
Well, yeah, we don't
match though. I mean, I c...

497
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,402
I can go change.

498
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,372
I don't even know
if I own a dress.

499
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,007
Wanna go buy one?

500
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,515
No. Can you just...?
Just wait one minute.

501
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,987
You mad at me? Yes.

502
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,753
Did you get a haircut? Yeah.

503
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,188
Who are my parents talking to?

504
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,691
Dr. Corday. She's a surgeon.

505
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,862
I told you I didn't
want surgery.

506
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,965
You were in a lot of
pain when you said that.

507
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,934
I still meant it.

508
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,359
You won't survive
without the transplant.

509
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,942
I was hoping to
make it to my prom.

510
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,511
But if I can't...

511
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,446
I can't.

512
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,016
With a new heart, you will.

513
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,687
Do you know what it's like
to have your chest split open?

514
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:52,871
No.

515
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,542
I can barely walk to
class, I get so tired.

516
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:00,396
I take pills every two hours.

517
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,699
And I look like a freak
from the side effects.

518
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,339
It's not worth it.

519
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,989
He's at the top of the
list? Yes. Status 1-A.

520
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:12,824
It's just a matter of
waiting for a heart

521
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:13,959
with a tissue match.

522
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,161
We waited a month
on Status 1A last time.

523
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,663
Now that he's older,
there are more possibilities.

524
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,099
Excuse me, uh,
Mr. and Mrs. Stevens,

525
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:23,601
but Nick doesn't
want a new heart.

526
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,237
We explained that to you.

527
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,339
He's thought it out.
He has good reasons.

528
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:28,824
I think you should
listen to them.

529
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,025
He's 16.

530
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,060
And he is tired
of living like this.

531
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,496
Well, I'm not giving up
on him because he's tired.

532
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,082
I'm... only telling you
what Nick told me.

533
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,626
I understand. When do
we move him to the unit?

534
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,704
Shouldn't be too long.

535
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,207
Kerry...

536
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,775
we have a little
personnel problem.

537
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,377
Well, you do. Mark Greene.

538
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,245
Mark. He's walking
around with attitude,

539
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,214
handing out needles,
blanking out on words.

540
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,717
Yeah, it's swelling from
the chemotherapy wafers.

541
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:55,718
We... Really?

542
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,953
He has a mild
expressive aphasia.

543
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,421
It's temporary. I don't like it.

544
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,189
Well, I don't think
he likes it either.

545
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,958
You noticed any
personality changes?

546
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,560
He got very
confrontational with me.

547
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,128
You're used to confrontation.
We're not talking about me.

548
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,630
Isn't that your
favorite subject?

549
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,532
Just straighten him out.

550
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,000
Who's this with
you at the beach?

551
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,602
Eric. My brother.

552
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,543
You know, I never
got the whole concept

553
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,578
behind dried flowers.

554
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,613
I mean, they're dead.

555
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,249
They're dead as
soon as you cut 'em.

556
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,418
Yeah, but... they look nice.

557
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,922
Dead ones look nice too.

558
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,312
Right. Right, no. I
was just wondering.

559
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,735
Wondering what? Wondering, um...

560
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,029
Why not just buy the, uh...

561
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,931
fresh flowers?

562
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,799
Because there's something sad

563
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,568
and dark about the dried ones.

564
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,152
Oh, yeah? You like
sad and dark? Yeah.

565
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:53,942
Okay.

566
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,511
Just give those a couple days.

567
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,447
Wow. You found something.

568
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,847
That looks nice.

569
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,333
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

570
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,018
Oh. It... It... It works on you.

571
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,069
You're lying.

572
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:06,738
No, honestly. Nobody
would know that.

573
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:09,007
Looks like it was,
um... made for you.

574
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,010
Okay. Now I know
you're lying. Let's just go.

575
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,315
Carter. What?

576
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,615
What is this?

577
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,818
Oh, come on. What do
you want, to take the El?

578
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:21,820
You're not gonna take
me to the airport and say,

579
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:23,388
"By the way, this
party's in Paris"?

580
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:25,891
No. We stay in
Chicago, I promise.

581
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:28,093
He needs bandages,
update his tetanus,

582
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:30,784
and order a six-pack of Keflex.

583
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:35,066
You lost your cap.

584
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,302
I decided to wear
my scar with pride.

585
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:40,105
It adds character.
Well, it scared a little kid.

586
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:41,739
Called me Humpty Dumpty.

587
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,641
Well,<i> Humpty...</i>

588
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,877
how do you feel about
an evening service?

589
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,779
What service? The wedding.

590
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,714
Coordinator
double-booked the afternoon,

591
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,017
and they want to
push us back to 5:00.

592
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,584
That would push
the reception back.

593
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:56,054
Yes. I've already
spoken with the caterer.

594
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,255
He says he can do it,

595
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,557
but we can't use
the patio for cocktails.

596
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,092
What's wrong with the patio?

597
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,694
April, the evening.
Be really chilly.

598
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,397
Well, ask him to
move out the, uh,

599
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,555
um... you know, uh...

600
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,804
Space heaters.

601
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:15,529
So it's all right with
you? Yeah, sure.

602
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,779
Okay then.

603
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:25,918
Mark...

604
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,335
you're getting better.

605
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,803
The aphasia's fading.

606
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,088
I'm glad you think so.

607
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,523
No, it is.

608
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:34,510
In a couple of weeks,
this will all be gone.

609
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:37,513
I don't think I can count on
you for an unbiased opinion.

610
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,648
No, you can't. I am biased.

611
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:40,883
I'm also right.

612
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,385
Dr. Corday? Nick
Stevens just arrested.

613
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,653
Whose patient? Kovac.

614
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,721
I'll grab him.

615
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,322
Oh, God. What's the rhythm?

616
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,790
Still V-tach.

617
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,026
Charge to 300.
Nick. Come on, Nick.

618
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,895
Excuse me, sir. You'll
have to stand back.

619
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,396
Okay, I need to intubate.

620
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,933
100 of lidocaine. Stand
by with amiodarone.

621
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,568
Charged and ready. Clear. Clear.

622
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,670
- Still no change. MRS.
- Please save him.

623
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,323
360.

624
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:06,458
I need some cricoid pressure.

625
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,076
I'm in.

626
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,879
Rebolus 50 of
lidocaine in five. Clear!

627
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,720
Clear.

628
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:15,634
Got a rhythm.

629
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,003
There's a weak radial
pulse. Mix up the dobutamine.

630
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:20,126
Open your eyes, Nick.

631
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,058
Come on, Nick. Wake up for me.

632
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,560
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

633
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,678
Unresponsive to
painful stimulation.

634
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,897
He wasn't down long.
He should wake up.

635
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,151
Maybe.

636
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,097
You get the three
separate light settings.

637
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:48,481
That's an essential amenity.

638
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:53,538
So I talked to Luka. Me too.

639
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,039
Didn't seem to
mind about tonight.

640
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:56,040
No.

641
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:57,897
He doesn't get jealous.

642
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,967
Ever.

643
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,725
All the, uh, years
I've lived here,

644
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:15,126
I've never been to the... The...

645
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,528
Natural History Museum? Mm-hm.

646
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,895
Oh, that's criminal.

647
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,198
They've got dinosaurs, cavemen.

648
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,899
Dinosaurs and
dancing...? It's great.

649
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:26,170
Yeah. My grandparents
like spectacle.

650
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,172
It's not gonna be that
big of a deal though.

651
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:30,042
A few people.

652
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,450
You are so dead.

653
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:40,719
It's kind of a scene.

654
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,554
Kind of? I told you.
They like spectacle.

655
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,590
Did you grow up going
to these kind of things?

656
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:47,192
Yes. This is par for the course.

657
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,460
If you hate it, we can
leave in a half an hour.

658
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:50,895
I won't hate it.

659
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,597
Can we duck around
this photographer?

660
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:53,598
Can we? Yep.

661
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,462
Give me a smile.

662
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,889
Hey, Jeff.

663
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,725
Where's Sean?

664
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,393
Uh, he went to move the car.

665
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,962
Well, I don't want to
wait to tell you the news.

666
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,354
Your viral test is back.
No virus detected.

667
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,591
So I'm really HIV-negative.
<i>Definitely</i> negative.

668
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,464
You and...

669
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,978
You and Sean are close, huh?

670
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,814
Been together almost a year.

671
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,350
That's nice. Yeah.

672
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,889
But nothing's
worth dying for, is it?

673
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:32,187
I'm not dying.

674
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,522
No. You're safe right now.

675
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,058
But you have to
protect yourself.

676
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,575
I'm gonna get it
sooner or later.

677
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,061
Not if you practice safe sex.

678
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,129
I don't want to treat Sean

679
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,397
like he's contaminated.

680
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,232
If we use a condom,
that's how he feels.

681
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,201
HIV can kill you, Jeff.

682
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,819
I know a lot of
people living with it.

683
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:50,377
I've seen a lot of people
who'd rather be living without it.

684
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,380
Look. Look...

685
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,295
How old are you,
man? Twenty-three.

686
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,337
Because you got 50...
60 years ahead of you.

687
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,418
I love him.

688
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:07,522
Well, if he loves you, he
should want you to stay healthy.

689
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,990
He thinks that
this is the only way

690
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,159
that we can really be intimate.

691
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,796
That's easy for him to
say. He's got the virus.

692
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,260
I don't have anybody else.

693
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,691
You have yourself.

694
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,093
Whoa.

695
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:30,662
Those are the
bouncers. I know them.

696
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,696
Oh, yeah?

697
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,298
Bark is much
worse than their bite.

698
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:35,066
I can see how they
keep people in line.

699
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,068
John. There you
are. Hi, Grandpa.

700
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:39,204
Finally. Someone I
really wanted to talk to.

701
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:40,738
Not so loud.

702
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:42,407
Is this your friend
from the auction?

703
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:43,708
No, no. She had the flu.

704
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:45,910
And you are...? Abby Lockhart.

705
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:47,512
Jonathan Truman Carter Sr.

706
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,614
Delighted. We don't get to see

707
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:51,016
too many of Johnny's friends.

708
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,750
You got lucky tonight.

709
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,352
You're very good
to get dressed up

710
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,887
and come out on
such a cold night.

711
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:59,074
I'd much rather stay at
home... in a bathrobe.

712
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,809
Don't let Gamma
hear you say that.

713
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,394
Oh, she knows me by now.

714
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:04,396
I'd love to meet her.
Yeah, where is she?

715
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,414
Talking to the
keynote speaker...

716
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,448
Go on.

717
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,284
Shall we? Nice to meet you.

718
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,403
Have a good time.

719
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:13,237
Friend from the auction?

720
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,907
Last family event I was
at the daughter of the host,

721
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:17,051
she, um...

722
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,244
Never mind. No,
come on. Tell me.

723
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,714
You ever take dance classes? Ah.

724
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,716
No. Have you?

725
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,051
Mm-hm. Yeah. Actually,
I have a few moves.

726
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,953
I'm sure you do.

727
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:31,356
Care to give it a whirl?

728
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,157
Mm, I don't know. Come on.

729
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:34,492
Just follow me.

730
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:37,629
I'm not sure that
I can. I got you.

731
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,231
I feel like I'm back at my
spring formal in high school.

732
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:54,879
I went with this guy Seth.

733
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,716
But really I had a
crush on this guy Tim.

734
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,801
I'm feeling for Seth. When
he went to the bathroom,

735
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,670
Tim asked me if I wanted to

736
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,438
go outside and
smoke a cigarette.

737
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,241
And, um...

738
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,109
we never went back inside. Mm.

739
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,133
That's cruel. I know.

740
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:13,398
Is that when you
started smoking?

741
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:16,167
I guess so.

742
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:19,475
See, it's all Tim
Stillman's fault.

743
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,698
Right. Ha-ha.

744
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,777
I didn't forget you.

745
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,959
Your...

746
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,816
CPK's normal.

747
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:46,553
I watched you work
on that boy. Yeah.

748
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:51,970
You'll be going
for your echo soon.

749
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,471
It was remarkable.

750
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,674
You brought him back to life.

751
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:57,392
Yes.

752
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,027
It won't do much good

753
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,595
if he doesn't have the surgery.

754
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,932
Can't find him a heart?
He doesn't want one.

755
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,766
But he's so young.

756
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,819
There are bound to be
medical advancements.

757
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,655
He's gotta fight.

758
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,039
One could say the
same to you, bishop.

759
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,478
I am fighting. Are you?

760
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,782
You say you should
prolong his life...

761
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,166
but you want to
hasten your death?

762
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,454
I'm not looking forward
to dying, Dr. Kovac.

763
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:29,696
But I also don't want to
be enfeebled or bedridden.

764
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,884
I only wish I was
as brave as he is.

765
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,709
I think you've been
more than brave.

766
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,625
Have I?

767
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,508
I wanted to set
a good example...

768
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,444
serve my parish...

769
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,746
do God's work...

770
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,014
as long as I was able,

771
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,584
and then... go to glory...

772
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,541
with a modicum of grace.

773
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:04,859
But there are times...

774
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,728
when I'm alone in prayer

775
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,453
or... trying to get to sleep...

776
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,976
when it just overwhelms me.

777
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:22,493
I should never feel
the way I do sometimes.

778
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:23,900
How's that?

779
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,173
Frightened.

780
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,441
You got the phone
number, right? Yeah.

781
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:40,311
You should call tomorrow and
make an appointment, you know?

782
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:41,634
I'll see.

783
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,017
Anyway... Anyway... thanks.

784
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,686
Yeah.

785
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,821
Uh, Jeff?

786
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:52,741
You gonna protect
yourself from now on?

787
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,005
Maybe.

788
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,313
Probably not.

789
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,501
Big plans tonight, Malucci?

790
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,603
Uh, no. No. Just
getting out of here.

791
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,072
Go ahead, 104.

792
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:09,140
<i>We're at the home
of a 65-year-old male.</i>

793
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:11,409
<i>Collapsed in the bathroom.
Found him in V-fib.</i>

794
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,311
Haleh, can I... take the mike?

795
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:14,779
<i>Defibrillated times four.</i>

796
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,448
<i>Gave epi and lidocaine.
Now in asystole.</i>

797
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,783
He's gone.

798
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,819
This is Dr. Greene.
What's the downtime?

799
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:22,187
<i>Been here 15 minutes.</i>

800
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:24,122
<i>Probably down
another 10 before that.</i>

801
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,423
Any medical history?

802
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:28,326
<i>Two MI's. Status,
post-bypass surgery.</i>

803
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,362
The last doctor's
appointment? <i>Hold on.</i>

804
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:33,497
If he's seen a PMD
in the last month,

805
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:35,133
they can sign the
death certificate.

806
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,234
Save us the trouble.

807
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:38,770
<i>Saw his cardiologist
nine days ago.</i>

808
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:41,372
Still in asystole? <i>For
the last five minutes.</i>

809
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:43,608
That's it. Stop CPR. <i>What?</i>

810
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:47,278
I'm pronouncing him.
Time of death, 2118.

811
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,330
Can you do that? Yeah. You can.

812
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,365
Let the family know
that everything was done

813
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,700
under physician guidance,

814
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,336
but he did not respond.
<i>You want us to transport?</i>

815
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,305
No, have them
contact a funeral home.

816
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,574
This is County General,
clear with Rescue 104.

817
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,576
I don't know why
that was necessary.

818
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,534
What's the point in going
through the motions?

819
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,733
I'm looking for Dr. Kovac.

820
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:12,353
I'm Dr. Frost, Bishop
Stewart's personal physician.

821
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,161
See? You were great.
I had a good partner.

822
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,429
If we get really motivated,
we could enter a contest.

823
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,666
That might be too
much of a good thing.

824
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,567
Thank you.

825
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,457
Oh, no. What?

826
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:32,011
Hello, Abby.

827
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,843
What are you doing here?

828
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,382
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

829
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:39,664
I'm here with a friend...

830
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:40,798
John Carter.

831
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,050
Hi.

832
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:44,394
How you doing? That's Richard.

833
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,309
So what are you doing
at a charity event?

834
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,695
Oh, I'm here with Alexis. Who?

835
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,984
She went to get us drinks.

836
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,817
She old enough to drink?

837
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:01,269
Rich, who's this?

838
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:04,388
<i>This</i> is Abby.

839
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,040
Oh. Hi. Hi.

840
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,209
We should probably...
Where've I seen that dress?

841
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,711
You haven't. I swear.

842
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:12,797
No, I-I really don't
think you've ever seen it.

843
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:13,864
My sister's wedding.

844
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:16,368
You were a bridesmaid.

845
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:19,078
Always the gentleman,
Richard. Thank you.

846
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,924
Rich, let's go sit down.
Okay. Nice meeting you.

847
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,080
Bye.

848
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,163
Am I awake or was
that just a nightmare?

849
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:31,915
Last week I gave him IV
Solu-Medrol and put him on

850
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,684
high-dose steroids
for his arthritis.

851
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,119
Last week? Yeah,

852
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:36,454
this is his second time here.

853
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:37,754
He has diabetes.

854
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,724
Steroids put him in the
ICU last year with DKA.

855
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:42,126
I didn't know that.

856
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,361
Which is why you should have

857
00:36:43,385 --> 00:36:45,162
contacted his primary physician.

858
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:47,331
I was going to, but...
What's his sugar?

859
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:49,700
348. Oh, great work, doctor.

860
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:53,004
You're destroying his vision,
his kidneys, his circulation.

861
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:55,106
Now that I know
about his diabetes,

862
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,674
I'm checking for
end-organ damage.

863
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:59,177
I've been treating Bishop
Stewart for 15 years.

864
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:00,744
He doesn't need
another physician.

865
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:02,430
Well, maybe you
should tell him that,

866
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,148
because he came to me.

867
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:06,634
Underneath that robe, he's
just a man like everyone else.

868
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:07,969
A man facing death.

869
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,721
And right now he's drug-seeking.

870
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:12,106
He just wants to
feel right again.

871
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,525
Well, that's not possible.

872
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,860
Where is he?

873
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,629
Okay, 104. See
you at the back door.

874
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,930
This is County Base. Clear.

875
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:22,366
What's going on? 104's
bringing in a full arrest.

876
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,135
I just talked to that guy.
Called en route. Cardiac arrest.

877
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,788
I already pronounced him.

878
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:27,955
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

879
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,523
We gave him two
of atropine en route.

880
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,992
What's your
problem? We did this.

881
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,359
The family freaked. They want...

882
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,796
Do not unload the patient.
We have to. We're here.

883
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,063
He's been dead for an hour.

884
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,232
Family wanted a doctor.
They're right there.

885
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,701
Mark. Kerry, he's not
supposed to be here.

886
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,970
Stop CPR. No.
Resume compressions.

887
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,406
I said stop. This is the
guy who died at home.

888
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,709
Keep going, Cleo. Set up
Trauma 2 for a full arrest.

889
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,578
He's dead. When the
paramedics bring a patient,

890
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,514
we have to care for him.

891
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,849
Chuny, wanna put a
shroud on the bed. Shroud?

892
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,518
Yeah, he's dead.
Might save some time.

893
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,519
Mark.

894
00:37:58,543 --> 00:37:59,920
Not gonna get him back, Kerry.

895
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,289
We still try. Are you
running this or am I?

896
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,659
Fine. What's his
rhythm? Still asystole.

897
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,461
What do you think?
Another amp of epi?

898
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,696
Might get him back?

899
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,934
Pupils fixed and dilated.
Hold compressions.

900
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,570
Dr. Finch, would you concur

901
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:16,921
that the rhythm is asystole?

902
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:17,971
Yes.

903
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,207
Code is over.

904
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,343
Take out the tubes
and clean the body.

905
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,383
That's the family.

906
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:28,099
I hope this helped them.

907
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:29,872
I'll go talk to them.

908
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:39,410
So typical of him to cry poor

909
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:41,045
and then show up
at this fancy party.

910
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,429
And did you think
she was even pretty?

911
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,832
I don't think I'll answer that.

912
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,869
I don't see it. I
think this is silly.

913
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,139
It's a blue BMW. What
if they took her car?

914
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,941
What do you think
she would drive?

915
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,476
A Lexus?

916
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,844
Ha. Get it? "Alexis"?

917
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,046
No... I mean...

918
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,914
Say we find it. What
are you gonna do, key it?

919
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,217
No. Maybe I'll
just slash the tires.

920
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,086
I think that would be overkill.

921
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,487
Oh. Stop! Stop!

922
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,721
Wait. There it is.

923
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,029
Do you have a pen? Yeah, why?

924
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,397
I'm just letting the
air out of the tires.

925
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,766
How many tires? Two's fair.

926
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,702
One's fair. Fine. Pen, please.

927
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,095
Uh-oh.

928
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,296
Now what do we do?

929
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,732
I think we have to run.

930
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,439
<i>He's awake?</i>

931
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,574
Yeah. And oriented.

932
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,643
Passed mental-status
exam with flying colors.

933
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:48,279
Where are you taking him?
He's got no neuro deficits.

934
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,947
He'll go to the ICU
and be extubated.

935
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,982
And the heart? I'm
gonna recommend surgery

936
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,302
to the transplant committee.

937
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,897
Dr. Romano?

938
00:40:06,354 --> 00:40:09,167
Nick has requested
not to have the surgery.

939
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,936
Well, he's a minor. His
parents make that call.

940
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,505
You're gonna make him
do it, knowing how he feels?

941
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:16,140
Dr. Kovac, he's a teenager.

942
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,109
What do they know about life?

943
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,360
He'll thank us for
this in a few years.

944
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,735
Mark.

945
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,705
I'm off, Kerry. We
have to talk about this.

946
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,274
And what might "this" be?

947
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:36,110
The way you've been
acting. A-abrupt, cavalier...

948
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,311
Realistic?

949
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,931
Are you ready to
be back? Yes, I am.

950
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:42,683
Mark, you are still
reaching for words.

951
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:43,901
I'm fine.

952
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:45,987
What happens in a code
if you need a cardiac drug,

953
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,189
and you can't think of the
name? That won't happen.

954
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:51,159
I am asking you to
take some time off.

955
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:52,598
I'm telling you no.

956
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:01,919
Dr. Frost is arranging for you

957
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:04,054
to have more tests on Monday.

958
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,489
Did he dress you down?

959
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:06,891
He was, uh...

960
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:07,992
pretty mad, yeah.

961
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:09,660
He's very possessive
about my care.

962
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,212
You were on his turf.

963
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,979
Well, as I told him,

964
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,716
your EKGs and cardiac
enzymes are normal.

965
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,185
Thank you, Dr. Kovac.

966
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,104
For the treatment.
And for listening.

967
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,294
You're welcome.

968
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,982
I, uh... I saw they
took the boy away.

969
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,980
Is he gonna get
the operation then?

970
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:32,033
Yeah.

971
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:35,436
I'm sorry. Me too.

972
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,304
You think he should
have been able to choose

973
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,328
how he wanted to live?

974
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,499
I think so.

975
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,970
Well, I wanna work.

976
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,475
Do you still want the steroids?

977
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:54,993
I need to work.

978
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,579
Poor guy doesn't even have AAA.

979
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,448
So he has to pay for this.

980
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:21,982
Maybe Alexis will chip in.

981
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,717
She looks about ready
to call a cab to me.

982
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,087
I'd say we've successfully
ruined their evening.

983
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:29,323
Mission accomplished.

984
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,929
Now I feel kind of bad. Why?

985
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,898
Because I kind of
ruined our night too.

986
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,082
Ruined, how?

987
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:42,769
Besides the vandalism?

988
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:43,971
Yeah.

989
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,839
And that we're
freezing to death? Yeah.

990
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,774
You never even saw
your grandmother?

991
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,543
Oh, she knows I was
there. That's enough.

992
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,670
Okay, then, I guess nothing.

993
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,809
I had an okay time.

994
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:02,978
Me too.

995
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,875
Yeah. This is Kerry
Weaver at County.

996
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,544
I need information about

997
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,146
evaluating a physician

998
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,282
who's possibly

999
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,666
cognitively... impaired.

1000
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,755
Could we speak first
thing Monday morning?

1001
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,624
Thanks.
