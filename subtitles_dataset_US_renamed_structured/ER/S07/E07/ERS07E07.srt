Hey. Reece woke up early.

9
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,186
I'll go make breakfast.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,340
Hey, no, no, no. I got it.

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,976
Why don't you go back
to bed? There's no point.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,712
Do you want something
to help you sleep?

13
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,769
No, no, no, no.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,352
Walt still asleep? Mm-hm.

15
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,354
Thought I'd come home
early from the hospital

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,555
and help with dinner.

17
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,890
Thought you were
going to Cleo's.

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,047
I don't have to.

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,745
I'm not making a big
Thanksgiving dinner.

20
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,665
Please go. Have
Thanksgiving over there.

21
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,667
Jackie, I'd rather be here.

22
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,208
Please, go.

23
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:05,715
Hey.

24
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:18,405
Have you seen the Tylenol?

25
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:20,540
Uh, I took the last two.

26
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:21,874
Did you put it on the list?

27
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,643
Uh, no.

28
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,029
That neck still bothering you?

29
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,733
I know. No more hockey games.

30
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:34,170
There you go.
Greene's eggs and ham.

31
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm sorry, Mark.
I'm just not hungry.

32
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,909
Well, I hope you have
an appetite tonight

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,412
'cause I am gonna
be grilling filet mignon,

34
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,647
and baking potatoes.

35
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,817
On Thanksgiving? No
turkey? No cranberries?

36
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,086
No, we did that last year.

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,390
What? No yams? No pumpkin pie?

38
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,225
Pumpkin pie, yes.

39
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,150
Whoever it is,
don't buy anything.

40
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,115
Dr. Elizabeth Corday? Uh, yes.

41
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,299
Happy Thanksgiving.

42
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,404
What is it?

43
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,372
Some sort of letter.

44
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:13,164
It says, "Notice
to the defendant..."

45
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,414
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,706
I'm being sued for malpractice.

47
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,488
I'll keep taking my medication.
I... I won't be a burden.

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,557
Come on. At least let me
stay through the weekend.

49
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,277
I can't go back. I lost my
job at the department store.

50
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,582
Your brother's not
even talking to me.

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,251
You can't throw me
out. I'm your mother.

52
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:59,589
I put the bus ticket and
some money in your purse.

53
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,342
And you'll have to find a
job as soon as you get there.

54
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,544
I've been here for a week.

55
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,513
I know how hard
things are for you.

56
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:08,081
I know what you're
going through.

57
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,382
We've been through this.

58
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,917
I just want to be here for you.

59
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,469
I have to go. Excuse me.

60
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,020
Honey, please.

61
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,222
Here. Take my coat.

62
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,045
Okay?

63
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,467
I love you.

64
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,911
I love you.

65
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,752
Morning, guys.

66
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,671
Hey.

67
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,539
Good morning.

68
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,307
You're getting pretty
good at that, huh?

69
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,843
I've been practicing.
Are we still on for tonight?

70
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,796
Yeah. Actually, I'm looking
forward to meeting your parents.

71
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,031
You'll like them.

72
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,401
Their flight get in okay?
Picked them up this morning.

73
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,303
Hope you don't mind
going out to my cousin's.

74
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,021
No. No.

75
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,061
How's Jackie?

76
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,811
She's okay with you
not being home tonight?

77
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,448
Ah. She doesn't want me around.

78
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,789
Mm. I'm sorry.

79
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:12,527
I, uh, gotta get
him up to Daycare.

80
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,308
Chen and Carter are late.

81
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:17,577
It's pouring outside.

82
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:18,944
You know, when I was a resident,

83
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,013
I left early during
inclement weather.

84
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,815
Whoo. Boy, it's
a mess out there!

85
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,517
Finally. Sorry I'm late.

86
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,686
John, got a drunk with
a hand lac in Sutures.

87
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,354
Chen, a breast abscess in 4.

88
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,390
If you need an
Attending, Kovac is here.

89
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,457
Greene is due in an hour.

90
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,726
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.

91
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,628
Taking Mr. Morgan
up? He's a bit anxious.

92
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,296
They were gonna
murder Bernadine.

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,564
He's delusional.

94
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,466
Threatened to blow
up his neighbor's house.

95
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,268
Did you do something
with your hair?

96
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,269
Oh, no. Not really.

97
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,704
You look different somehow.

98
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,205
Contacts. I broke my glasses.

99
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,173
Oh, suits you. Thank you.

100
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:49,174
Abby.

101
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:50,376
How's your mother doing?

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,345
Better. She left for
Florida this morning.

103
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,548
I'm really sorry about what
happened the other day.

104
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,651
Don't apologize.
She has a disease.

105
00:05:58,675 --> 00:05:59,974
Nothing to be ashamed of.

106
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,400
Hi. Hey.

107
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,315
Did you put her on the bus?

108
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,485
Yep.

109
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,193
Uh, are you free...?
Would you like to go...?

110
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:20,963
Dinner?

111
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,146
Think anything'll be open?

112
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,865
I think Doc Magoo's.

113
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,490
I think that's kinda
depressing on Thanksgiving.

114
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:38,608
I could cook at my place.

115
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,245
Rescue's pulling up. A
guy got hit riding his bike.

116
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,831
Call her! She's waiting for me!

117
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,866
30-year-old. Bicycle
versus minivan.

118
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,968
Bent the bike and
pinned him against a pole.

119
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,620
Vitals? BP's 100/60.

120
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,788
Gave him two liters.

121
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,457
Cut off as much of
the bike as we could,

122
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,426
but his leg started bleeding.

123
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,028
I can get it. Four-by-fours.
Looks like the femoral artery.

124
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,351
Abby? Abby?

125
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,900
Abby. What are you doing here?

126
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,335
Come on, Abby!

127
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,021
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

128
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:09,655
Get four units of O-neg.

129
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,657
I need a thigh cuff
and a Doppler scope.

130
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,958
Ask for dry clothes at the desk

131
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,511
and wait. I tried
to get on the bus.

132
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,279
I can't leave you, Abby.
Pulse is 124 and thready.

133
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,366
Abby? Set me up
for a central line...

134
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,835
Slow down, damn it!

135
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,436
Oh! Oh! Oh!

136
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,989
Set me up for a central line,
and prime the rapid infuser.

137
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,624
We need X-ray to clear the neck.

138
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,759
I'll get the Foley.

139
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,345
Call Maintenance for a hacksaw.

140
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,963
Here we go. On my count.

141
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,565
One, two, three.
Want a second line?

142
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,109
Yes. Set a trauma panel,
and type and cross for six.

143
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:42,856
Ugh. That smarts
like a son of a bitch.

144
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,590
I gave you
lidocaine, Mr. Florea.

145
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,192
It should be pretty numb.

146
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,460
I can give you some more.

147
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,829
Yeah, please.

148
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:51,630
It hurts like hell.

149
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:54,133
So does my knee.

150
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,902
What's the matter
with your knee?

151
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:58,771
I twisted it when
I fell off the curb.

152
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:03,676
Dropped my turkey. Cut my hand.

153
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,583
You cut yourself on a turkey?

154
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,582
Wild Turkey. Wild Turkey.

155
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:12,852
I was drinking it on
account of it's Thanksgiving.

156
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,354
Don't think the Pilgrims
envisioned the liquid kind

157
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,140
when they
established the holiday.

158
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,874
How about something for my pain?

159
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,177
What would you like this
time? Percocet or Demerol?

160
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,578
I'm allergic to Percocet.

161
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,713
This is Mr. Florea's
third time in here

162
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,766
this week complaining of pain.

163
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,136
Really? Oh, I see.

164
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,838
I didn't realize it
was that serious.

165
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,892
In that case, I'll refer you to
a clinic to help you manage it.

166
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,612
I don't need no damn clinic. I
need something for my knee.

167
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:44,923
Well, we'll get you some x-rays.
Then I'll give you some Motrin.

168
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,470
You think I'm an addict?

169
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,539
I think you have a problem
with drug dependency.

170
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,374
What do you know about my pain?

171
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,776
Ooh, I'll be back
in a couple minutes.

172
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,944
You want to finish him up?

173
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:55,968
Sure.

174
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,453
Randi? Randi, excuse me.

175
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,956
Do you have a bag I could
put these wet things in?

176
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,291
Did they just bring in a
man from a bike accident?

177
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,262
You'll have to sit in
Chairs. I'll be right back.

178
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,764
He's in the Trauma Room.

179
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,266
Where is that?

180
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,702
Well, I'll show
you. Right this way.

181
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,137
I saw them bring him in.

182
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,655
Was he badly hurt?

183
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,780
I know they're doing absolutely
everything they can for him.

184
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,963
I got two units
of type-specific.

185
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,749
Okay. Neck is clear.

186
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,417
Pulse ox is down to 88.

187
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,886
Okay, bag him while
we set up for intubation.

188
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,755
Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.

189
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,258
Got a quart of melted
strawberry ice cream.

190
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,394
His name is Jim Peakins.

191
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,479
He is relaxed.
Take off the collar.

192
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,754
Abby, give me some
cricoid pressure.

193
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,520
Whoa! Big neck lac.

194
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:55,655
It's hard to see the cords.

195
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,657
Direct your
pressure to the right.

196
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,075
How's that?

197
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:03,212
Better. Looks like a foreign
body down there. McGills.

198
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,881
Sats are 82 and falling.

199
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,425
Hold on.

200
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,169
There.

201
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,755
Holy crap, you pulled my gauze
right through his neck wound.

202
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,440
Open up some lap pads.

203
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:18,683
I'm in. Bag him.
Abby, call for a vent.

204
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,964
Sats are still low.

205
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,832
Decreased breath
sounds to the right.

206
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,834
Chest-tube tray.

207
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,837
Okay, start chest compressions.

208
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,128
We're out. I'll get one.

209
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,526
Clear. Clear.

210
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,278
What are you doing here?

211
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,179
The gentleman's wife showed up,

212
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,547
and there was
no one to help her.

213
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,683
I'm not his wife. I hit
him. It was an accident.

214
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,084
I didn't even see him.

215
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,354
Randi, can you sit this woman
down in the hall, please?

216
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,012
Is he gonna be all right?
Ma'am, ma'am, this way.

217
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,926
Abby. Abby, I need
to talk with you.

218
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,695
Not now. It's important.

219
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,063
I'm not going anywhere,
Abby. I'm staying here.

220
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,549
No good deed goes unpunished.

221
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,384
I step in, I clean up your mess,

222
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,219
and I end up named
in your lawsuit.

223
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,653
I'm so sorry.

224
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,022
Yeah, well, sorry isn't
gonna save your ass, or mine.

225
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:06,392
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

226
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,136
How noble of you.

227
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,766
The guy's a gimp. He walks
in with a little bit of a backache.

228
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,368
He'll be wheeled
out in a wheelchair.

229
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:17,987
Do you have any idea
how that'll play for a jury?

230
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,140
Not well. Not well?

231
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,409
When his lawyers get
through, you'll be lucky

232
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,578
if you're slinging fish
and chips back in England.

233
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,997
Robert, I thought the
procedure had gone smoothly.

234
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,565
Oh, well, it was a
screaming success

235
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,333
if your desired
outcome was paralysis.

236
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,103
I'll talk to Risk Management
so you're not implicated.

237
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,872
Rocket, are you almost through?

238
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,578
One minute, love.

239
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:43,629
Do not talk to Risk Management.

240
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,432
Do not discuss this case
with anyone. Am I clear?

241
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,351
Yes.

242
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,619
Surfer.

243
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,022
Couldn't be just some
fat-assed couch potato, no.

244
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,625
And don't even think about
paging me during the weekend.

245
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,292
Ready, Nikki?

246
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,883
Let's go.

247
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,585
Still in V-fib. How
long has it been?

248
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,052
Twenty-five minutes.

249
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:09,489
Two liters out
of the chest tube.

250
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,557
Okay. Shock once
more, and then we'll call it.

251
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:14,693
How about a thoracotomy?
Not with blunt trauma.

252
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:17,230
Charged.

253
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,786
Clear.

254
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,701
Asystole.

255
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,303
Okay, that's it.

256
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:28,363
Time of death, 10:57.

257
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,111
Any family here?

258
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,668
No. Just the woman who hit
him. She's waiting out in the hall.

259
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,006
Ma'am? Yes?

260
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,476
The man on the bicycle
was, uh, profoundly injured.

261
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,778
We did everything we could,

262
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,280
but he didn't respond
to the treatment.

263
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,714
Oh, God.

264
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,850
He died a few minutes ago.

265
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:04,477
My baby was crying and I
turned around. I didn't see him.

266
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,951
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,884
Sweetie, it's all right. It's
all right. It wasn't your fault.

268
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:14,253
I didn't see him.
It was raining.

269
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:16,221
It wasn't your fault.
It's gonna be all right.

270
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,557
My God!

271
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:20,643
It's all right.

272
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,030
You didn't see him. Oh, my God.

273
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,621
It was raining.
You didn't see him.

274
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:43,332
I thought you quit. I did.

275
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,402
Then my mother showed up.

276
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:50,028
Is she going back? Yeah.

277
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,712
Think it'll ever stop?

278
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,536
What?

279
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,284
The rain.

280
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,075
Has to stop eventually.

281
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,047
I hope so.

282
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,279
I'm telling you, my knee
still hurts like a son of a bitch.

283
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,781
Yeah, that's why you're
going to X-ray, Mr. Florea.

284
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,149
Hey, Conni, can you take him up?

285
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,685
Call Transport.
They're short-staffed.

286
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,887
I'm suffering.
Stop torturing me.

287
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:25,691
Yeah, yeah. Catch you later
when you get back with your films.

288
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:29,595
Excuse me. I'm looking for
Dr. Chen. Is she working today?

289
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,882
She's with a patient.
Just take a seat in Chairs.

290
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,238
Thanks.

291
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,652
Hello. Hi.

292
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,960
Do you work here?

293
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,364
Oh, n... Oh, these? No,
I got caught in the rain.

294
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,483
Oh. My daughter works here.

295
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:52,068
Ah, so does mine.

296
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,103
Really? Mm-hm. Jing-Mei Chen.

297
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,188
Oh, the cute one. Pregnant.

298
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,741
What? Ah, ha.
You must be thrilled.

299
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,110
I tell you, I would be so
excited if one of my children

300
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,411
made me a grandmother.

301
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,513
Actually, I don't think
of myself as old enough

302
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,581
to be a grandmother.

303
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,616
But I am.

304
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,168
You must be thinking
of someone else.

305
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:10,675
Jing-Mei!

306
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,784
Mommy. Ji... Jing-Mei...

307
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,727
Oh, my God!

308
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,762
What are you doing here?

309
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,654
I wanted to invite you
for Thanksgiving dinner.

310
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,601
Why didn't you tell us?

311
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,009
Because I didn't know how.

312
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,523
Come home tonight.

313
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,508
Is everyone coming?

314
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,809
Yes.

315
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,128
No, Mommy. Not with all
those people there. Please.

316
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:39,932
They're your family. I can't.

317
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,883
Please? No, I just can't.

318
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,985
No, please! I need
a hand in Exam 1.

319
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,944
I gotta go. Don't tell<i> Ba-Ba.</i>

320
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,014
We miss you. I know.

321
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,797
You looked like you
needed some help.

322
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,765
Ooh. Thank you,
Carter. No problem.

323
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,186
Did you page me? I've
got an appy in 10 minutes.

324
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,654
Old patient of yours
is here. Debby Marlin.

325
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,723
You operated on her
last year for breast cancer.

326
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:05,924
What's she doing back?

327
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,960
She's in terrible pain.
Mets to the spine.

328
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:09,361
Ah. Thought you'd like to know.

329
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,751
All right.

330
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:18,504
Hi, Dr. Benton. Hey.
How are you doing?

331
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:21,707
Terrible. I went to my
pharmacy this morning.

332
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,643
They told me they couldn't
refill my morphine prescription.

333
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,145
Why not?

334
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:30,182
Well, they don't carry narcotics
anymore. Too many robberies.

335
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,683
I gave her a shot of morphine

336
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,585
but it's barely
taken the edge off.

337
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,255
All right. Come on. Let me
see. How much did you give her?

338
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,457
Ten.

339
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,960
You contacted your oncologist?

340
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:42,845
Mm-hm. I just got the service.

341
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,964
He's away for the
holiday weekend.

342
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:48,233
All right. Come on. All
right. Give her another 10.

343
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,936
If she's feeling better, send
her home with Percocet.

344
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,056
You mean I have to
come all the way back here

345
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,891
tomorrow for my medicine?

346
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:59,445
I'm sorry, but the outpatient
pharmacy's closed today.

347
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:01,986
Can we admit her
for pain control?

348
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,317
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

349
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:06,869
Let's admit her to Medicine.

350
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,855
Thank you, Dr. Benton.
You're welcome.

351
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:12,441
The little weasel warned
me not to speak to anyone.

352
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,342
Are you gonna listen?
Do I have a choice?

353
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,045
You're being sued.
You must respond.

354
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,713
Romano insisted he'd handle it.

355
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,716
Yeah, sure. Cover his ass,
and hang you out to dry.

356
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,552
Let me talk to my buddy Dave
Medler. He's in Risk Management.

357
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,721
Off the record.
See what he thinks.

358
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,489
Thanks.

359
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,960
You look tired. So do you.

360
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:32,761
I shouldn't be
dragging you into this.

361
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,563
We're getting married, okay?

362
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:38,233
Your problems are my problems.
Mark, Ortho's waiting in 2.

363
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,057
See you later.

364
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:48,143
♪ It's now or never ♪

365
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,814
♪ Come hold me tight ♪

366
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,667
♪ Kiss me my darling ♪

367
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:57,903
What's the score? Texas up by 6.

368
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:00,405
I see Judy's back for
a return engagement.

369
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,141
Elvis' greatest hits. Conni's
serving turkey in the lounge.

370
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,777
I'll wait for dinner. Is there
any ETA yet on my x-rays?

371
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:08,013
No. I got three
patients waiting.

372
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:10,816
There's only one file clerk.
Well, you don't look that busy.

373
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,273
You want to cover the
phones? I'll get the x-rays myself.

374
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:16,889
You all right?

375
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:19,525
Look at her sitting there. How
long will you make her wait?

376
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,426
She should be on a
bus. Will you talk to her?

377
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,530
I've talked to her all my life.
There's nothing left to say.

378
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:26,765
Randi, would you call
Security to move her out?

379
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,500
Security? What?

380
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,157
Oh.

381
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,106
Abby. Abby. Abby, listen.

382
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,075
No! What are you
trying to prove?

383
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,677
You're my daughter.
I care about you.

384
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,012
Do you mind?

385
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,080
I'll take my medicine.
I'll get a job. Whatever.

386
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,682
We both know that's
not gonna happen.

387
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,651
I'm not going anywhere
until you talk with me.

388
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,853
Damn it, Abby, I'm your mother.

389
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,454
Deal with me. Go
back to Florida.

390
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,156
I need a monitored bed.

391
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,558
Trauma 1's open.

392
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:55,561
Lie still. We're trying to
help. Put him on the dynamap.

393
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,328
Get an ultrasound.
What have you got?

394
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,032
25-year-old pharmacy tech
found down in Central Supply.

395
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,520
BP's 260/140. He's combative,
not moving his right side.

396
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,955
And he's vomiting.

397
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,507
Increased intracranial
pressure. Probably a brain bleed.

398
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:11,910
He needs intubation, a
Nipride drip and a stat head CT.

399
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:14,363
Go away! We
need hard restraints.

400
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,948
How about we
paralyze and intubate?

401
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,950
Six of Versed, 100 of sux.

402
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:20,986
Oh. Now I know why
his pressure's so high.

403
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,588
Want a tox screen?

404
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:24,340
It's probably coke
or crystal meth.

405
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,414
Paralytics are on
board. 80 ET tube.

406
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,664
Damn it!

407
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:34,466
That's all right. I'll
get another one.

408
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,534
You all right? Uh.
Yeah. Just a little dizzy.

409
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,853
You wanna sit down?

410
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,377
No. Okay.

411
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,624
I'm gonna be sick.

412
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,098
Get an emesis basin.

413
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,766
Pulse ox down to 86. Bag him.

414
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,968
That's okay. Sit
down. I'm sorry.

415
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,405
Put your head down.

416
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,074
His sats are still dropping.
Chuny, can you get some help?

417
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,660
Go ahead. You have to intubate.

418
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:04,562
Randi, find a doctor! We need
some help in Trauma 1 now!

419
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:07,633
I can't see the cords. I need
suction. There's a lot of vomit.

420
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:09,835
Try a straight blade.

421
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,738
Lydia, we need a vent.

422
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,305
How's that Nipride drip coming?

423
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:15,306
Working on it.

424
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,608
What do you need?

425
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,511
It's a difficult intubation.
Dr. Corday is sick.

426
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,096
Go lie down. I've got it.

427
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,031
Take one more look.

428
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,935
If you can't get it, I'm here.

429
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:29,660
Can I have a cords tube? Okay.

430
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,332
Bag him. Good.

431
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:46,922
Knee film on Mr. Florea
looks normal. I knew it.

432
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,524
Take a look at his ultrasound.

433
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,325
I didn't order an ultrasound.

434
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,799
He was in a lot of pain.

435
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,548
Oh, man!

436
00:20:56,572 --> 00:21:01,319
He's got a clot from
the popliteal fossa

437
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,055
to the femoral vein?

438
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,359
Uh-huh.

439
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,625
I thought he was
drug-seeking. Where is he?

440
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:08,893
Guy was a pain in the ass.

441
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,080
He tried to bum an El
token from the desk clerk.

442
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,482
When the guy wouldn't
cough it up, he got pissed off.

443
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,700
You just let him leave?

444
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,653
I'm not a hall monitor. Damn it!

445
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:28,868
Mr. Florea!

446
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,738
Mr. Florea!

447
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,439
Mr. Florea!

448
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,213
Mr. Florea!

449
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,143
Excuse me.

450
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,834
Mr. Florea!

451
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,248
Excuse me.

452
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,717
Mr. Florea...

453
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,553
Out of my way.
Move away from him.

454
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,510
Mr. Florea?

455
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,961
Mr. Florea?

456
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,997
Randi, it's Carter.
I'm at the El station.

457
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,302
Send a gurney
up here right away.

458
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,671
What happened?
Found him down at the El.

459
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,373
He was drinking
again? No, he left AMA.

460
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,642
He's got a leg clot. It must
have traveled to his lung.

461
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,143
Sats are only 78.

462
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,311
Just keep the TPA box ready.

463
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,579
Mix up the TPA,

464
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,447
run 100 milligrams
over the next two hours.

465
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,949
I've got to do
the checklist first.

466
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,818
No, no. There's
no time for that.

467
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,803
He's altered, a
contraindication.

468
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:26,271
He's altered because of the PE.

469
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:27,739
Not enough oxygen to his brain.

470
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,040
I won't give it.

471
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:31,242
He may be bleeding
internally. I'll give it to him.

472
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,099
I'm not signing my
name to this. Then don't!

473
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,904
You know the pharmacy dude that
Corday and Abby were working on?

474
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,472
The one with the
crack pipe? Yeah?

475
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,975
Cop said he was cooking
crystal meth in the basement.

476
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,677
Had a whole lab set up.

477
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,278
You're kidding. Bad news.

478
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,081
Debby Marlin's HMO
wouldn't authorize admission.

479
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,717
Who? Breast cancer
with spine mets.

480
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,486
HMO said she should be
managed as an outpatient.

481
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,389
Well, if she's in pain, have
her contact her HMO tomorrow.

482
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,926
Oh, should she do that
before or after she takes the bus

483
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,028
across town to refill
her prescription?

484
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,296
Cleo, Cleo, we've
done all we can.

485
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,332
She's got end-stage breast
cancer, Peter. She's in pain.

486
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,536
I know. But she's gonna
have to take it up with her HMO.

487
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,371
She'd be better off
without insurance.

488
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,041
Then we'd have to admit her
and County would pay for it.

489
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,346
Doesn't make a
damn bit of sense.

490
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,511
How's your sister doing, Peter?

491
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,203
Ah, you know. As well
as can be expected.

492
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,253
Randi, how long is Abby's
mother gonna be sitting in Chairs?

493
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,956
I bet three days.
Wanna join the pool?

494
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,679
No, thanks.

495
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,613
You were giving TPA? He's
got a pulmonary embolus.

496
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,031
Are you sure? He's got a DVT,

497
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,000
he's hypoxic and he's
got a right ventricular

498
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,468
strain pattern on the 12-lead.

499
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,902
What are his coags?

500
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,806
What's his head CT
show? I don't know.

501
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,141
Stop the TPA. He could
bleed. Pulse ox is down to 72.

502
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,742
This is his only chance.

503
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,645
You know nothing
about this man's history.

504
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,113
You could kill
him with this drug.

505
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,450
He's hypoxic on 100% oxygen.

506
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,235
He'll never make
it! We must try.

507
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:06,038
Hey! He'll arrest!
I'm the attending.

508
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,879
Pulse ox is going up to
80. Heart rate's steady at 72.

509
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,383
I just pray he didn't
bleed in his brain.

510
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,059
Thanks.

511
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:28,626
I feel like such a klutz.
These things happen.

512
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,828
My husband likes
celery in his stuffing,

513
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:32,797
so I'm chopping away, and whack!

514
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:35,500
Next thing I know,
there's blood everywhere.

515
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:37,702
Oh, I should've stuck
to my oyster recipe.

516
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,689
But Sam likes a
traditional stuffing.

517
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,925
You know, you can tell a lot
about people by their stuffing.

518
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,927
My mother hates sage.

519
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,930
And I'm not too fond
of nuts or raisins.

520
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,682
Heh-heh, to tell you the
truth, I don't like a lot of that

521
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:55,603
fancy stuff thrown in
like eggs or dried fruit.

522
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:56,704
Oh, how about you, doctor?

523
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,696
What kind of
stuffing do you like?

524
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,649
Dr. Greene?

525
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,880
What do you prefer?

526
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,061
Dr. Greene, lab needs
another red top on Caine.

527
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,532
Dr. Greene, can I run
my asthma patient by you?

528
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,640
Mark, we've got a
lady with syncope in 4.

529
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,069
Mark, do you have a minute?

530
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,059
I got into a thing
with Cart... Not now.

531
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,562
Are you going anywhere tonight?

532
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:12,897
I don't think so.

533
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,133
Stop by. I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner for 30.

534
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,667
Thirty people? How do you do it?

535
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,070
Takeout from Chicago Chicken
served on my good china.

536
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:22,407
Abby. Abby, please
talk with me. Please.

537
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:23,808
Please don't do
this to me again.

538
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,909
All right. All right.

539
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,677
I lost my apartment.
I've been evicted.

540
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:29,047
I have no place to go.
I don't wanna hear it.

541
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:31,605
Why are you so damn stubborn?
It's called self-protection.

542
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,986
I did the best I could.

543
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,123
I took care of you
and Eric all by myself.

544
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:40,425
Excuse me, Mom.
We took care of you.

545
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:43,795
You always had a place to
stay, food to eat, and clothes.

546
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,197
I worked hard for that.

547
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,297
When you were on your meds.

548
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:47,665
I tried hard to be
a good mother.

549
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,034
I tried every day.

550
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:51,102
Abby. Abby, now
you listen to me.

551
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:54,755
There is a lot of
me in you. I see it.

552
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:00,329
Please. Do you know that
every night before I went to sleep

553
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:03,248
I used to pray that you
would take your lithium

554
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:05,183
and just... Just act normal?

555
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,003
Do you think it was easy for
me? But it was exciting for us.

556
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,404
We never knew what to expect.

557
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,607
Would you bring home some
loser you picked up in a bar?

558
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,742
Or maybe you would
run down our street naked,

559
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,843
screaming your head off.

560
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,229
You can hate me.

561
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:19,731
It's okay to hate me. Then
there was that Thanksgiving

562
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:20,766
when I was 10.

563
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,300
You remember that one?

564
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:25,470
Oh, God, here we go. Here we
go. You were cooking potatoes.

565
00:27:25,494 --> 00:27:27,172
Here we go. Here
we go. I walked in.

566
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:29,324
Okay. You asked where I'd been.

567
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,427
I said I'd been to visit Dad.
I'll never forget your face.

568
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,430
You threw the food on the
floor. You chased me with a knife.

569
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,898
I would never hurt you, Abby.

570
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,634
I'd never, ever hurt you. I
locked myself in the closet.

571
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,454
I remember sitting with
my feet It was the disease.

572
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,257
Against the door to keep
you out. It was the disease.

573
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:47,342
You have to see me.
I'm not just a disease!

574
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,311
Then that night you
made me sleep beside you

575
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,345
to prove you were sorry.

576
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,379
I couldn't sleep.

577
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,948
I had to watch you.
I'm your mother.

578
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:55,600
You might flip out again.
I'm the only mother you have.

579
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:57,769
I was 10 years old!

580
00:27:57,793 --> 00:27:59,971
I didn't choose to be sick.

581
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:01,945
You never tried to get better!

582
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,830
I can't make things
different. That's right!

583
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,822
You can't. So now just go home.

584
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:26,131

00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,433

00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,470
I couldn't talk. The words
just wouldn't come out.

594
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,705
Have you had any other symptoms?

595
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,108
Change in vision?
Headaches? Syncope?

596
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,077
Nothing significant.

597
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,844
Neck's a little
sore from hockey.

598
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,380
Headache, on and off.

599
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,249
Could be an atypical
migraine, maybe cerebritis.

600
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,051
You under a lot
of stress lately?

601
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,986
Who isn't?

602
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,211
Right. Let's take a look.

603
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,823
You ready? Yeah, I guess.

604
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,822
This is ridiculous.

605
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,824
I-I'm actually
feeling much better.

606
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:46,160
It's probably hypoglycemia
from skipping breakfast and lunch.

607
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,531
Well, when I was dizzy and
vomited I took a pregnancy test.

608
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:52,217
I'm not pregnant. I
had a period last month.

609
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,685
Hmm.

610
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,303
That was breakthrough bleeding.

611
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,888
What?

612
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,473
You're pregnant.

613
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,724
Well, that's impossible.

614
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:01,843
Really?

615
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:06,231
Technically, it's possible.

616
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,868
You know, maybe we
should run a serum test

617
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,019
just to make sure.

618
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,488
It's okay. Why
don't you lie down?

619
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:17,831
I'll do an ultrasound and
see how far along you are.

620
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,968
What's the word?

621
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:48,239
There appears to be a 3.5
cm mass in the frontal cortex.

622
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,976
A brain tumor.

623
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,211
How bad is it?

624
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,380
I wanna discuss it with
a neurosurgeon first.

625
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:58,183
You're a radiologist.
How bad is it?

626
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,939
I really can't say.

627
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,078
What's my prognosis?

628
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,348
Phil?

629
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:13,320
You need to talk to a
neurosurgeon right away.

630
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,722
It's not like he
swallowed one nail.

631
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,124
We're talking
pounds of hardware.

632
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:26,594
There's nails and screws

633
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,597
and one of those metric
socket sets, and a plier.

634
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,467
I mean, I'm palpating
this guy's belly.

635
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:37,338
And there's a crescent
wrench outlined in bas-relief.

636
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,874
I mean, just smashed
up against the skin.

637
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,476
So my husband says to me,

638
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,279
"You've gotta go in there
and consent this guy."

639
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,081
You were married?
Yes. And, um...

640
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,983
He was a surgical Resident.
So I go in there and I say:

641
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,952
"Mr. Jebson, how did
you get all this stuff down?"

642
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:56,541
And he says, um... He
says, "A good Chablis."

643
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,996
He says, "A good
Chablis." Oh, my gosh.

644
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,882
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

645
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:05,183
It's fine. I can't believe...

646
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:06,835
No, you missed most of me.

647
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,304
I'll pay for the dry-cleaning.

648
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,672
Sorry. Kerry, it's all right.

649
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,273
Did you bring the guacamole?

650
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,308
Yeah, and onion dip.

651
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,013
Hey, Dr. Greene. Hey.

652
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,614
Are you okay?

653
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,784
I was just heading
out. Good night.

654
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,553
We need dessert. I can grab
something from Doc Magoo's.

655
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,954
We don't need it that bad.

656
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,489
Good night. Happy Thanksgiving.

657
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,158
Have a good one.

658
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,193
I'm starving.

659
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,284
Those are my favorite, girl.

660
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,900
Hey, what happened? Hmm?

661
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:41,135
Your...? Oh. I went for a walk.

662
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,771
In the rain? How's Mr. Florea?

663
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,508
He, uh... He threw a
clot. I had to give him TPA.

664
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,544
Oxygen levels are
up, vitals are stable.

665
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,813
Can I give you a hand?
Help you with anything?

666
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,916
I'm just starting an IV.
With your mom, I mean.

667
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,352
No. Every time she
goes off her meds

668
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,953
she says she's not
gonna do it again.

669
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,621
Why should this
time be any different?

670
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,490
I don't know. My
patient's smoking again.

671
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,025
Excuse me.

672
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,194
Mr. Thal, I told you.

673
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,263
If you wanna smoke,
you have to go outside.

674
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,964
In the rain?

675
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,322
I've got pneumonia.

676
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,904
Man, this is smelling weird.

677
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:18,572
I need an ashtray.

678
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,574
Anything else I can get you?

679
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,994
An extra pillow would be nice.

680
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:25,864
Dr. Carter, could
I speak with you?

681
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,632
Sure.

682
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:29,884
I know you're a friend
of my daughter's.

683
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:34,389
Oh, this is awkward for me.
I don't know what else to do.

684
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,307
Could you talk to her for me?

685
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:39,166
I'm not sure what...

686
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:44,149
Abby's in there!
Stay here! Stay here!

687
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:45,783
Are you okay? Yeah.

688
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:48,636
Oh, my God! Abby!
Everyone, stay outside!

689
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,206
Abby! Stay out here!

690
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,274
Abby! MAGGIE: Abby!

691
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,528
Abby! MAGGIE: Abby! God, Abby!

692
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:58,696
Abby! MAGGIE: Oh, my God, Abby!

693
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,365
Please wait outside.

694
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:02,934
Abby? MAGGIE: Is she all right?

695
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,508
- Is your neck okay?
- Is she all right?

696
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,942
Is her airway clear?
I think she's okay.

697
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,595
Let's go! Let's go!
Down the hall to the right.

698
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,862
Carter, you need help?

699
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,447
I don't think so.
I'll be in Curtain 2.

700
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,716
Get me an intubation
kit, lactated Ringer's

701
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,074
and lots of burn
dressings. Look out, please!

702
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:24,455
Excuse me. Excuse me.

703
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,246
Is she all right?

704
00:34:27,516 --> 00:34:28,943
Is she badly hurt?

705
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,562
Can you please wait outside? No.

706
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:32,780
Stethoscope. Do you
have any chest pain?

707
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,983
Yeah. You do? Where's it hurt?

708
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,717
Uh, right there. Right here?

709
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,120
Okay, take a deep breath for me.

710
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,394
All right, give me the oxygen.

711
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,825
Hello, Mommy.

712
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:15,695
Jing-Mei.

713
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,050
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

714
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,449
Who's here?

715
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:26,084
Everybody.

716
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:28,903
Great.

717
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,372
I'll go get your father.
You didn't tell<i> Ba-Ba</i> yet?

718
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,596
You asked me not to.

719
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:37,049
He'll be okay.
Shocked, but okay.

720
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,131
You underestimate us, Jing-Mei.

721
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:42,188
You've always underestimated us.

722
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:51,047
Mommy, will you love the
baby if the father is black?

723
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,069
He's black.

724
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,592
That's what I thought.

725
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,041
Jing-Mei?

726
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,459
It's okay, Mommy.

727
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:10,233
That's why I didn't tell you.

728
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:17,552
Any idea what started it?

729
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,637
Ether. Ether?

730
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:23,707
A couple of guys in the pharmacy
were cooking crystal meth.

731
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,776
Transported the
ether in IV bags.

732
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,595
One of theirs got mixed in.

733
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:28,980
Damn.

734
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:30,481
Everybody out?

735
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:32,066
All but two patients.

736
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,570
Well, move it. We're
evacuating this whole department.

737
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,654
They're critical.

738
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:38,528
I'll give you 10 minutes.

739
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:43,494
Just take a deep breath.

740
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,663
Chest still hurt? A
little bit. Can I get up?

741
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:48,399
I'm okay, and I could help.
Not until I get a chest x-ray.

742
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,368
I don't need a chest x-ray.
Abby, come on. Let him help you.

743
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:53,037
How are you? I'm a little sore.

744
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,623
I think she cracked
a rib. How's Mr. Thal?

745
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,692
He's going up to the Burn
Unit. But I think he'll be okay.

746
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,096
How much Ringer's do you
want? Ten liters over eight hours.

747
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,798
How's your guy with the PE?

748
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,302
CT was normal.
No brain bleeding.

749
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,103
Good.

750
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,560
Let's get you up to Radiology.

751
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,579
He was staring up at
me from the pavement.

752
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,515
And with every breath

753
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,302
I could see frosted cloud

754
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,739
from his mouth

755
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:29,729
get smaller.

756
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:33,544
I just talked to him.

757
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,664
Tried to reassure him.

758
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,834
And I held his
hand, until he died.

759
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,754
The ambulance never came?

760
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:45,556
He was gone by the
time they got there.

761
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,592
Oh, my God.

762
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:51,145
Well, what happened
to the driver who hit him?

763
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,848
Not enough.

764
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:57,484
He was drunk, but
this was 19 years ago.

765
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,220
They revoked his
license for a while

766
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:04,513
and had him pick up trash
on Saturday or something.

767
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,980
Well...

768
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:16,175
I certainly got us off on a very
depressing tangent, didn't I?

769
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:20,375
I think we're gonna
close this place down.

770
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,711
I'm sorry. We haven't
taken care of this.

771
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,079
No, no, no. Let me.

772
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,814
No, you paid last time. Come on.

773
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,649
You know what? Why
don't we just split it?

774
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,618
I got it.

775
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,874
Thank you.

776
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:36,573
You know, this is our
second meal together.

777
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:41,446
Some people might consider
a second dinner a date.

778
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,902
A date?

779
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,800
You do know I'm
gay? Of course I do.

780
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,269
I don't have a
problem with that.

781
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:49,573
I have gay friends.

782
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,258
Oh.

783
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,661
Oh, I'm sorry,
Kerry. I misread this.

784
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:58,562
No. I mean, I didn't...

785
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,682
I'm so sorry if I gave
you the wrong impression.

786
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:02,849
It's just that you called me

787
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,018
for eight psych consults
in the past week.

788
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,322
We work well together.

789
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,824
My instincts are usually
a lot more reliable.

790
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,143
You know what? I'm... Thank you.

791
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:16,013
You know, I'm really very
flattered. It's just that I'm...

792
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,399
Gosh, you're such
a beautiful woman.

793
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,768
You're so beautiful. But I'm...

794
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,902
I... I'm straight.

795
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,322
I mean, I don't... I'm straight.

796
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:26,590
Okay. Oh, God...

797
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,927
Oh, my God. I don't
know... I don't know what...

798
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,529
I mean, I'm sorry.
I just, I don't...

799
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:33,553
I feel very...

800
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:36,500
I'm...

801
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,084
You know what? I'm... I just...

802
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:47,700
I mean, I-I guess I never
even really considered this.

803
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:55,553
You haven't said a word
since we left the hospital.

804
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:56,787
We can talk to each other.

805
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,712
That's what people
do in relationships.

806
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:02,560
All right.

807
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:06,264
I'm pissed that Romano's docking
my pay for punching Malucci.

808
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:07,565
That better?

809
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:11,302
You should be furious.
Malucci was way out of line.

810
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,604
Not that I'm surprised.

811
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:14,994
What's that supposed to mean?

812
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,111
You get docked because
Malucci's a jackass.

813
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:21,329
Your nephew gets crappy care

814
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:24,248
because they
assume he's a banger.

815
00:40:24,272 --> 00:40:26,250
And today our patient
couldn't get her meds.

816
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:28,386
Okay, I'm so tired of
hearing you go off on this.

817
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,055
You need to stop trying to
teach everybody how to be black.

818
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,975
And you need to face reality.

819
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:38,312
Debby Marlin couldn't get pain
medication because her pharmacy

820
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:41,014
was in a black neighborhood.
You grew up in the suburbs.

821
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,567
What do you know
about her problems?

822
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:44,435
What, I can't relate
because I wasn't poor?

823
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:46,303
No. I'm just saying,
I know who I am.

824
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,439
I don't have anything to prove.

825
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:50,775
And I do because
my mother's white?

826
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:52,415
I didn't say that.

827
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,713
Where are you
going? I'm getting off.

828
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:57,898
This isn't our stop.

829
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,084
It's mine. I don't
wanna see you tonight.

830
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,389
Cleo, we're supposed to
be going to your cousin's...

831
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,844
Good news. Your
lungs look clear.

832
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,880
But you cracked
a rib on the right.

833
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,716
I'll write your
discharge orders.

834
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,150
You don't have to do that.

835
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:21,689
Fine. You did have a
concussion, loss of consciousness.

836
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:24,692
So I'm gonna call
you later. Thank you.

837
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,616
"Doctor." Doctor.

838
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,881
I borrowed an umbrella. Okay.

839
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,640
Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Carter.

840
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,411
Hey. GREENE: Hey.

841
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:30,891
Ooh.

842
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,594
That steak smells fantastic.

843
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:34,895
Mwah.

844
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,264
How'd you get the
charcoal going in the rain?

845
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,800
I just pulled the grill
in under the overhang.

846
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,502
I've never had a
deck to grill on before.

847
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:44,305
Makes me feel very American.

848
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:47,073
Yeah? Yeah.

849
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,743
Shall I help you
with the salad? Sure.

850
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,133
Okay.

851
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:00,125
Mark...

852
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:07,260
I have something to tell
you. It's not going to be easy.

853
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,546
Go ahead.

854
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,253
Well, I know it's not
exactly the best time, but...

855
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,885
What the hell? I'm pregnant.

856
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:21,764
Uh, Chen did an ultrasound.

857
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,403
What are you thinking?

858
00:43:32,627 --> 00:43:34,272
I think it's wonderful.

859
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:35,928
Oh, I love you.

860
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,051
I love you too.
