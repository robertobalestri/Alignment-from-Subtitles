1
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:19,646
No, no, no, no...

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,415
Hi, I'm looking for Carl
Ferris. He's not in his room.

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,317
How much longer?

4
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:26,103
Trudy!

5
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,654
Where's the damn ambulance?!

6
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:28,888
They're on their way.

7
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,157
What's the problem?

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,325
Oh, nothing you need
concern yourself with, sir.

9
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,193
I'm a doctor. Then get in here!

10
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:37,013
I think this guy's
having a heart attack!

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,982
Make way! Doctor coming
in! Bernice, shake a leg.

12
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,485
Mr. Ferris? Are you
having pain in your chest?

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,122
Well, he says yes. It's like
someone's squeezing his heart.

14
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,924
No, no, no. It's more like...

15
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,960
Like he's been
punched in the chest.

16
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,345
When did it start?
A few hours ago.

17
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,081
Give me your stethoscope.
Let's sit him up. Here we go.

18
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:56,933
Easy.

19
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,468
He needs oxygen.

20
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,603
We're board and care.
We don't have any.

21
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,204
Jerry, I need your oxygen.

22
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,673
Get your hands off that!

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,808
Hey, that's mine!

24
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,560
How am I supposed
to breathe now?

25
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,478
Ah, he's in CHF.

26
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,863
Oh, CHF.

27
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,764
What's that?
Congestive heart failure.

28
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:14,567
I just take blood
pressures. I know CPR.

29
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:15,634
Dr. Benton?

30
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,903
Good. He's in rapid A-fib.

31
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:18,155
Let's start a line.

32
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,073
Oh, my God. Look at this.

33
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:22,508
We can't take your orders
unless you stay with us.

34
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:25,378
All right. Five liters
O-2 on a nasal cannula.

35
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,046
Let's get him on the gurney.

36
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,514
Hang in there, Carl!

37
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:29,749
Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

38
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,951
His lungs are wet. We
need to treat as failure.

39
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,819
Another nitro spray
in five minutes.

40
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,122
Forty of Lasix and titrate
up to 10 of morphine.

41
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:37,674
Keep his pressure above 100.

42
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,847
Lasix and MS. What's happening?

43
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,982
You've got fluid in your lungs.

44
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,317
Ten of morphine.

45
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,936
This might make you
a little drowsy, okay?

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,022
Pressure holding at
110. Pulse down to 100.

47
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,523
Am I gonna make it?

48
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,492
You're doing just
fine. You're gonna be...

49
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,330
Anybody hurt?

50
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,748
No, I don't think so.

51
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:03,405
Are you okay? Yes.

52
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,269
What happened? He
came out of nowhere.

53
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,839
Sir, does your neck hurt?
- A little.

54
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,340
He pulled out
right in front of me.

55
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,542
I didn't see you.

56
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,610
Don't move your head.

57
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,345
I had my lights and sirens on.

58
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,479
I'll go call another rig.

59
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,865
No, we'll take him with us.

60
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,442
I don't wash my hair. I
never wash my hair. It helps.

61
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,144
You shouldn't wash
your hair every day.

62
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,313
It gets rid of the natural oils.

63
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,982
Hi, Mom.

64
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,918
Abby. What are you doing here?

65
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,152
I'm on a break.

66
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,790
If you comb it too much,
you'll damage the ends.

67
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,275
How are you feeling?

68
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,326
Better.

69
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,912
Now it's full of
static electricity.

70
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,453
Winona, your hair
looks fine. Really.

71
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,502
I don't think she
knows where she is.

72
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:48,704
Time for your meds, Maggie.

73
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,374
I think Winona needs
to go to the bathroom.

74
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,676
She gets agitated
when she has to pee.

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,845
Thanks.

76
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,247
You need to use the
bathroom, Winona?

77
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,482
I need to fix my hair.

78
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,818
Okay. I'll be right back.

79
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,754
Uh...

80
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,841
You're gonna have to
stay here for a little while.

81
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:10,560
They're keeping you on
a 90-day hold. I'm sorry.

82
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,828
No.

83
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,431
No, it's me.

84
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,999
I should never have put
you through all of that.

85
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,302
It's me.

86
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,459
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,258
Trauma panel, C-spine, chest
and pelvis. Prep the left chest.

88
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,561
Where does it hurt?
My chest and stomach.

89
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,463
Any headache or neck pain? No.

90
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,031
No loss of consciousness.

91
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,467
Is there someone you'd
like us to call? My mom.

92
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,569
Let's infiltrate with
lidocaine, Malucci.

93
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,705
Where you going?
I'll be right back.

94
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,307
CBC, chem panel,
cardiac enzymes,

95
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,343
12-lead EKG and
a portable chest.

96
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,812
He was in A-fib with a
rapid ventricular response.

97
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,447
Heart rate's 88, irregular.

98
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,649
He's in CHF. How
about some Lasix?

99
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:52,117
We gave him 40. How
you doing, Mr. Ferris?

100
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,252
You tell me.

101
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,554
Don't worry. You'll be okay.

102
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:56,288
I've gotta go work
on the crash victim.

103
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,691
Dr. Kovac will take
care of you, okay?

104
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,461
Let me see that EKG
as soon as it comes back.

105
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:03,730
Lidocaine's on, second
liter of saline is up.

106
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:04,930
Do the ultrasound, Malucci.

107
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:06,532
Pulse ox, 89 on two liters.

108
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,668
Up it to five. 32
French. Thank you.

109
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,302
Open a chest-tube tray.

110
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:11,904
Set up Thora-Seal
to low suction.

111
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:15,458
Get serial crits, due
20 minutes, okay?

112
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,060
Ah, damn it!

113
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,727
What's wrong? Nothing.

114
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,063
Pulse ox down to 85.

115
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,299
Hurt yourself? No.

116
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,801
I can give it a try if you want.

117
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,225
I'm fine. Open another tube.

118
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,789
Can you shove this
under the desk for me?

119
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,257
I belongs to
Mr. Simpson in Exam 4.

120
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:32,525
You don't wanna know.

121
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:35,328
Abby, shouldn't you be
at the courthouse? Huh?

122
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:38,264
Your mother was just transported
to her commitment hearing.

123
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:40,032
Aren't you supposed to testify?

124
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,868
Uh, what commitment hearing?

125
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:43,837
State Attorney's Office
should have called.

126
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,405
Well, nobody called me.

127
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,973
Okay, um...

128
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:50,109
Your mother has contested
her certificate of commitment.

129
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,680
By law, she is entitled to a
hearing in front of a judge.

130
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,415
And, what, he could release her?

131
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,683
Technically.

132
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:59,452
Attempted suicide is a good
argument for a 90-day hold,

133
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,787
but since you witnessed it...

134
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:02,121
W-When is this happening?

135
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,357
11:15, county courthouse.

136
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:06,426
<i>Tube placement looks good.</i>

137
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,660
Pressure's up to 120.

138
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:09,796
I'll meet you at the
elevator. How we doing?

139
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,764
No chest pain after
two more nitros.

140
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,365
Where are you admitting him?

141
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,000
He's fifth in line
for Tele admit.

142
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,436
How long will that take?

143
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,271
Sometimes we rule
out MI, send them home.

144
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,207
He spent two days
in the ER last time.

145
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,310
It's okay, Mr. Ferris.

146
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,011
I'll sort this out
and get you a bed

147
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,780
as soon as I'm done in the O.R.

148
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,014
Thank you, Peter.

149
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,083
Sure.

150
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,336
<i>She sat there and let
me apologize to her,</i>

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,171
and she knew she
was going to court.

152
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,973
Maybe she didn't
wanna get you involved.

153
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,075
Maybe she doesn't want
me to testify against her.

154
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,509
Are you? I don't know.

155
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,634
I have to find this state's
attorney, whoever that is.

156
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,482
I'll go with you. No.

157
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,251
I can get somebody to cover.

158
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,518
I can't wait.

159
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,420
You shouldn't have
to do this by yourself.

160
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,823
I shouldn't have
to do this at all.

161
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,092
You'd rather Carter go with you?

162
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,127
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,930
He helped you
deal with her before.

164
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,233
I'll call you later.

165
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,735
Hey. Nice basket. Is that
for Greene and Corday?

166
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,503
Yeah, and you still owe $50.

167
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,938
Fifty? For that?

168
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,707
We got them a
baby video monitor.

169
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,575
Nurses pitched
in 20, doctors 50.

170
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,410
I pay the same as
Benton and Weaver?

171
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,846
Aren't you a doctor?
That's debatable.

172
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,515
Cleo, can you take
a lady in Exam 2?

173
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,451
I'm already juggling
seven patients.

174
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,319
I'll trade you one.

175
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,122
Well, then can you
lend me 50 bucks?

176
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,625
Hey, Jing-Mei. I got
a woman in Exam 2

177
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,860
who hasn't had a bowel
movement in over a week.

178
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:31,994
She needs a rectal.

179
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,129
So do it.

180
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,764
Well, she threatened to Mace me.

181
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,267
You should be used
to that. Take this one.

182
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,852
No. Forget it.

183
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:39,986
What's the problem here?

184
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,238
I don't know.
Maybe it's your B.S.

185
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,190
Or maybe it's PMS.

186
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,992
Excuse me?

187
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:47,777
Look, I'm just saying...

188
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,280
That it's okay for you
to dump a patient on me

189
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,865
and okay for you
to refuse handoffs.

190
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,200
But the minute I do,
it's because I'm a bitch

191
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,836
or it's because it's
that time of the month!

192
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,371
Screw you.
Forget it. I'll leave.

193
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,124
I'm tired of your crap!

194
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,325
Another 2-0 silk.

195
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,526
Pressure's holding at 120.

196
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,828
Dr. Benton, what are
you still doing in here?

197
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,499
The gastrosplenic and
splenorenal were very vascular.

198
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,167
Are you suturing
with your left hand?

199
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,469
Yeah, I'm ambidextrous.
The hell you are.

200
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,671
I've seen third-year
medical students sew faster.

201
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,135
Let me see you
use your right hand.

202
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:23,396
Uh-huh. Sterile gloves.
What happened?

203
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,898
I may have bruised my wrist.

204
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,400
How? Fell to an
outstretched hand.

205
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,602
Ah, perfect mechanism
for a fracture.

206
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,287
Get your hands out
of the field, Peter.

207
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,906
What?

208
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,330
Hold them out like
this. Fingers spread.

209
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,281
Your radius and ulna feel okay?

210
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,467
I'm fine.

211
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,635
Ouch. Point tenderness
at the snuff box.

212
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,888
We call that a scaphoid
fracture. Scrub out.

213
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:50,723
I can finish this
case. I'm almost done.

214
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:51,890
No, Peter, you are done.

215
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,893
If this poor devil had
some complication

216
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,661
and his lawyers
discovered his surgeon

217
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,230
was operating
with his wrong hand

218
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:59,515
we both might as well bend over.

219
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,518
Be thankful you're
not a racehorse, Peter.

220
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,253
I'd have to take you
out and shoot you.

221
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,155
Dr. Benton, your wife's here.

222
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,357
What? I'm not married.

223
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,893
I'm sorry. Carla.

224
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,244
Where is she?

225
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:13,613
How long have you had
the pain? A few hours.

226
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,980
When was your last period?

227
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:16,716
Uh, seven weeks ago.

228
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,016
When I didn't get it,

229
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,319
I did a home pregnancy
test. It was positive.

230
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:21,887
That was two weeks ago.

231
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,589
Have you seen your gynecologist?

232
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,991
Do you have a
history of migraines?

233
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,326
Yeah.

234
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,229
And are you on any medication?

235
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,498
Inderal and sumatriptan.
But they're not helping.

236
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:34,600
It just keeps getting worse. Hm.

237
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,269
So where's the pain?

238
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,504
It's all around my right eye.

239
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:39,739
How many other pregnancies?

240
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,707
This is my first.

241
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,008
Am I having a miscarriage?

242
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,043
I can't tell until
we do some tests.

243
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:48,581
And a pelvic exam as well.

244
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:52,785
It pounds with every heartbeat.
I think it's the numbers.

245
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,920
What, you're an
accountant or something?

246
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,989
No, no, binary numbers.

247
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,659
Ones and zeros. Electronic data.

248
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,529
80, 146, 72, 109.

249
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:07,033
80, 146, 72, 109.

250
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:08,868
Deb. What?

251
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:12,104
80, 146, 72, 109.

252
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,475
80, 146, 72, 109.

253
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,676
Freaky.

254
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,229
I warned you!

255
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,432
- What happened?
- Patient Maced him.

256
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,033
You happy now?!

257
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,436
Flush his eyes with
saline. Call Security.

258
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,472
Give me that pepper
spray. Hey, give it to me!

259
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,508
Do you want me to
have you arrested?

260
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:36,496
I told him not to touch me
or my personal possessions.

261
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,764
Dr. Malucci was
only trying to help you.

262
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,583
You could have
seriously injured him.

263
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,469
Well, I hope I taught
him some manners.

264
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,455
Have you been in this ER before?

265
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,123
I've been in a lot ERs.

266
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,492
And to be honest,
this one's substandard.

267
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,844
Oh, well, maybe you'd
feel more comfortable in jail.

268
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,813
You know, they used to
drown redheaded babies

269
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:56,298
because they
thought they were evil.

270
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,033
And they used to
burn crazy people

271
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,577
who they thought were witches.

272
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,807
I just need something to
help me go to the bathroom.

273
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,764
Is that too much to ask?!

274
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,296
She's historically
non-med compliant?

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,031
Well, she has phases.

276
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,832
But this time she's
been off for about...

277
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,370
Ma'am. Six months.

278
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,138
How many serious
suicide attempts?

279
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,342
This one makes three.

280
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:24,911
Don't you know this stuff?

281
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,412
Just reviewing before we go in.

282
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,414
I got the case this morning.

283
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,582
Hey, Marty. You got Wyninski?

284
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,583
Wyczenski.

285
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,818
Wyczenski. Sorry.

286
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:34,253
Yeah. Drug overdose.

287
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,789
So you're stipulating to
an attempted suicide, right?

288
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:40,714
No, but nice try. No intent.

289
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,098
I'm sorry, what was
your name again?

290
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,401
Um, Abby.

291
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:50,069
Did you witness
the attempt, Abby?

292
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,437
I was with her.

293
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,706
She took the pills in a
bathroom. Who was that?

294
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,642
Your mother's public defender.
Since they won't stipulate

295
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,410
I'll have you testify
to the intention

296
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:01,480
and lethality of the attempt.

297
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,700
Nobody called me to testify.

298
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,935
That's why you're here, right?

299
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,670
You want your mother
to stay committed.

300
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,439
Well, yes, but... But
somebody should have...

301
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,209
Okay. You're here now.

302
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,678
Come on.

303
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:19,716
I think we pretty
much have it all...

304
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,351
Just answer all the
questions that we talked about.

305
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,895
All right.

306
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,512
Peter, I thought you
would never get here.

307
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,148
What happened?

308
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,382
I was carrying Reece.

309
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:38,384
I stepped in a
grate in the sidewalk

310
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,619
and twisted my ankle so bad

311
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:42,004
I thought I was
going to pass out.

312
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,575
Was he hurt? Hey, are you hurt?

313
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,960
He scraped his elbow. He's okay.

314
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:51,164
Carla, you were carrying him
while you were wearing these?

315
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,799
They said they want to operate.

316
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,968
I kept telling them to call
you. I do not want an operation.

317
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:59,305
Yeah, well, you have
a trimalleolar fracture.

318
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,091
They'll have to put a screw
in it so it'll heal properly.

319
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,559
Can't you do it?

320
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,394
No. You need an
orthopedic surgeon.

321
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,130
Well, how long am I gonna
have to stay in the hospital?

322
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,348
A couple of days.

323
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,351
I can't. Roger's out of town.

324
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,903
Yeah, is he ever around?

325
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,127
We haven't been getting
along too well lately.

326
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:19,491
Which is one of the reasons

327
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,744
why I cannot deal
with this right now.

328
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,746
I'll take Reece for
a couple of days

329
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,248
till you get back on your feet.

330
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,816
I don't think that's
gonna be a good idea.

331
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,452
Why not?

332
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,171
Jackie told me that you
moved in with that girlfriend.

333
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,173
And that's a problem?

334
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:36,592
I don't think it's a very good
environment for our son.

335
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:40,362
Carla, give me a break.
She's a pediatrician.

336
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,634
I'm just saying she don't
seem like the motherly type.

337
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,236
DeRAAD: She was admitted
following a suicide attempt.

338
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,305
That's not what I
asked, Dr. DeRaad.

339
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,174
Has Mrs. Wyczenski
shown any signs of suicidality

340
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,842
since her admission?

341
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,177
Not that I'm aware of.

342
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,647
She has voluntarily
submitted for all treatments

343
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,866
and medications recommended
by your department?

344
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,567
That's correct.

345
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,486
No further questions,
Your Honor.

346
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,955
Thank you, doctor. Does the
state have any more witnesses?

347
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,474
Yes, Your Honor. The
people call Abby Lockhart.

348
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:12,378
Hold on. All right, I was next.

349
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:13,645
I was next. It's my turn.

350
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:16,349
That's enough.

351
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:18,050
The testimony you
shall give in the case

352
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:21,120
will be the truth and
nothing but the truth?

353
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:23,111
Yes. JUDGE: Please have a seat.

354
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,930
It was my turn.

355
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,645
You're Mrs.
Wyczenski's daughter?

356
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,764
I've been waiting.
This bitch took my turn.

357
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,349
Settle down.

358
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,934
Miss Lockhart?

359
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,302
Yes.

360
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,988
And as such, you
support a mandatory hold

361
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,856
for your mother because
she might attempt

362
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,224
to kill herself again.

363
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,343
Objection. Leading.
JUDGE: Sustained.

364
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,629
Miss Lockhart, do you
feel that your mother

365
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,347
should be involuntarily
committed?

366
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:50,616
Yes. Why?

367
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,618
No. There are no
such thing as cuts!

368
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,003
Russell?

369
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,123
No back cuts! No front
cuts! No, it's my turn!

370
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,391
That bitch stole my
spot! Take her! Come on.

371
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,309
You take her out! I
didn't do anything!

372
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,494
Shut up.

373
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:06,432
She took my spot! No! No!

374
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:08,968
He was pushed
down in an altercation.

375
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,903
No LOC. Tenderness
to mid-shaft clavicle.

376
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,838
You said there's no
LOC? He's faking.

377
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,907
Vitals are normal.
No chest or belly pain.

378
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:15,942
What's his name?

379
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:16,976
He refused to give it.

380
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,710
He said it was "O. Possum."

381
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:19,946
Ow.

382
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,880
His name's Brett
Paxton, and he's crazy.

383
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:24,417
What's this? Human
bite to the left hand.

384
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,252
I'll need stitches,
thanks to this freak.

385
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:29,021
Hey, cool it! Cool
it! Okay. Okay.

386
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,990
Take the opossum to Exam 1

387
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,959
and get the kangaroo
to Sutures. Come on.

388
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,860
Aah! God! Okay, okay, okay!

389
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,162
You need to flush them out.

390
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,064
Well, you've flushed
enough already. Okay?

391
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:40,266
Here you go.

392
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,867
You know I've never
worn one of those.

393
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:43,535
Well, maybe it's
time you at least

394
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,706
started dressing like
a doctor. Come on.

395
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,908
Ah.

396
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,143
What? What?

397
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,845
Carter, your
pregnancy's bleeding out!

398
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,314
Where is she? She's
passed out in the bathroom.

399
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:57,183
Noni?

400
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,651
Oh, my God. Hey, Noni,
can you hear me? Wake up!

401
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,053
I can't find a pulse.

402
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,522
She's got a weak
carotid. Get a gurney.

403
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,858
You're divorced, Mrs. Lockhart?

404
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,326
Objection. Irrelevant.

405
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,927
Goes to living arrangements.

406
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,930
I'll allow it.

407
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,081
Yes.

408
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,116
And when was your
divorce finalized?

409
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,201
Last summer.

410
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,420
Have you been dating anyone?

411
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,621
Your Honor?

412
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,923
Get to the point, Mr. Nesmith.

413
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,527
Your mother can be eccentric,

414
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,963
maybe a little
embarrassing at times?

415
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,598
She suffers from a
debilitating mood disorder.

416
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,500
Having her live with
you while trying to date

417
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,719
would be a major inconvenience?

418
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,888
I've tried having her live
with me before several times.

419
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,107
It doesn't work.

420
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,358
Doesn't work?

421
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,026
No. She stops taking
her medications,

422
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,250
she loses control
and she disappears.

423
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,822
Does she look out
of control to you?

424
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,223
She's on her meds now.

425
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,958
So she does take her medication.

426
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,509
She's only taken
them for a week.

427
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,829
But as long as she's med
compliant, she's not a danger.

428
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,048
She doesn't stay med compliant.

429
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,949
That wasn't my question.

430
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:06,252
Have you known your mother
to be a danger to herself

431
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,742
while med compliant?

432
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:12,925
No. Not usually.

433
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,561
You think locking her
up in a psychiatric facility

434
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,763
would be better for
her than living with you?

435
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,399
I can't take care of
her. Can't or won't?

436
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,435
She tried to kill
herself while with me.

437
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,252
Nonresponsive,
Your Honor. Please.

438
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,521
Just answer the questions.

439
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,323
Well, tell him to ask them.

440
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,213
Miss Lockhart.

441
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,777
You okay? Yes!

442
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,497
Would you like some
water? No, thank you.

443
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,398
BP's 60 palp. CARTER:
What's her HemoCue?

444
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,432
10.8.

445
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,134
Good. She's got
a little reserve.

446
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,404
No fetal pole, no heartbeat.
Just blood and POCs.

447
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,072
That's an incomplete
miscarriage.

448
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,541
Call OB. She needs a D and C.

449
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,242
I'll do a pelvic to see if...

450
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,944
Carter, this is her boyfriend.

451
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,278
What happened?

452
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,847
Your girlfriend
had a miscarriage.

453
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,015
But it's incomplete.

454
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,683
She needs a D and
C to stop the bleeding.

455
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,151
She's gonna be okay?

456
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,320
She might need a transfusion.

457
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,222
I'll speak with you
after she's stabilized.

458
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,558
Oh, God! Can you
take him outside?

459
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,959
Call for packed cells.

460
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,628
If pressure's not
up after two liters,

461
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,696
HemoCue every 30 minutes.

462
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,964
Is it true human bites
are worse than dog bites?

463
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,701
Yeah, because of the
virulence of the bacteria.

464
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,204
If germs infect the joint,
it can cause scarring

465
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,673
which can limit
your range of motion.

466
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,809
You don't wanna lose
your opposable thumb.

467
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,712
So you guys rival
mascots or something?

468
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,914
No, we were at the
Furturama show.

469
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,066
It's a convention for furries.

470
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,604
People who like to
dress in animal costumes.

471
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,889
He started it. I think
he'd been drinking.

472
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,341
One minute he
was skritching me...

473
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,226
Skritching?

474
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,294
Scratching. Mock grooming.

475
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,263
Sort of our version
of a handshake.

476
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,933
Next thing you know, he's
got his hand in my pouch.

477
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,107
So I decked him. I'm
not into the weird stuff.

478
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,424
It makes me sick. I
never felt like myself.

479
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:55,161
I told the doctors that. They
never really listen to me.

480
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:57,896
They just keep
giving me more pills.

481
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,032
How do you feel now? - Better.

482
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,834
So you're no longer depressed?

483
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:03,786
No.

484
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,020
Did you try to kill yourself

485
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,564
during your last
depressive episode?

486
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:13,184
I took an overdose
of sleeping pills, yes.

487
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,849
But I never meant
to kill myself.

488
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:18,884
She's lying. Shh.

489
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,603
Why did you take so many pills?

490
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,071
Who in their right mind

491
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,473
wants to drive from
Oklahoma to Chicago, really?

492
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,729
I get carsick.

493
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:32,097
I just thought if I could
sleep, I'd be all right.

494
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,782
I took some pills.

495
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,116
She took 900 milligrams.

496
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,403
They didn't work right away.

497
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,305
You know, I foolishly
then took some more pills.

498
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,340
She took 900
milligrams. That's 36 pills.

499
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:43,659
How much did you take?

500
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,295
I know it was stupid.

501
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,365
I just thought if
I could sleep...

502
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,002
The next thing I know, I
woke up in the hospital.

503
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,172
But I never meant to
hurt myself or anyone else.

504
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,075
Abby, I'm so sorry.

505
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,077
I never meant to
put you through that.

506
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,779
Ask her where she got the pills.

507
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,431
- She stole them.
- Mr. Rifkin,

508
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,483
could you please ask
your witness to be quiet?

509
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,351
If your daughter's not
ready to take you in,

510
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,504
are you able to
take care of yourself?

511
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,324
I always have. I've
always worked. Always.

512
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,742
Do you have any money?

513
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,244
I have a few credit cards.

514
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,945
They're all canceled.

515
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,001
I mean it, Miss Lockhart.

516
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,567
HemoCue every 20 minutes.

517
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,836
Set up a DIC panel and
call me with the results.

518
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,338
What's happening?

519
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,773
She's going up to the O.R.

520
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,975
I removed some
tissue from her cervix.

521
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,444
She's still bleeding

522
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,614
but it's slowed to the point
that her pressure's okay.

523
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,516
Did you have to give
her a blood transfusion?

524
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,918
We gave her plasma. Her
blood wasn't clotting properly.

525
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,720
Why isn't her blood clotting?

526
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,455
Uh, it could be a
sign of liver disease.

527
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,525
The liver affects
the clotting factors.

528
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,728
She ever have hepatitis?

529
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,230
No.

530
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,233
She drink alcohol every day? No.

531
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,658
Tylenol? Any other medications?

532
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,341
Maybe some herbal stuff.

533
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,609
Uh-huh.

534
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,412
What kind of herbal stuff?

535
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,282
Root extracts. They're
supposed to induce miscarriages.

536
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,307
Oh, I thought she
wanted this baby.

537
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,022
She didn't know.

538
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,507
How could she not know?

539
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,930
I gave them to her.

540
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,478
You what?

541
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:30,149
Put them in her tea
for the last few days.

542
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:33,084
She didn't even ask
me if I wanted the baby.

543
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,653
So you poisoned her?

544
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:36,622
I wasn't ready.

545
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:37,773
I thought she'd just...

546
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,858
What? Bleed to death?

547
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,594
I didn't mean to make her sick.

548
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:43,928
Ugh.

549
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:46,887
No, man, you just
meant to kill her baby.

550
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:52,087
You have a large
tumor on your left ovary.

551
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,790
I came in here
because I couldn't poop.

552
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,291
The tumor is large enough

553
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,835
that it's blocking your
bowel movements.

554
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,329
Cancer, huh?

555
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,732
Well, well, well.

556
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,769
Every day comes
with its own surprises.

557
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,304
What?

558
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,476
Nothing.

559
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:14,359
That's how I know you.
You're Princess Taffeta.

560
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,962
And you had that children's show

561
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:18,964
I used to watch all the
time when I was little.

562
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,498
And you always used to say,

563
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,818
"Every day comes
with its own surprises."

564
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,935
I don't think so.

565
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,171
And you worked with
those great puppets.

566
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:30,575
There was Mojo and
Mr. Whiskers, and what was that...?

567
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,046
Coconuts! The chimpanzee
in the sailor uniform.

568
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,947
We got that monkey from a lab

569
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:38,083
and we had to dress
him in that stupid outfit

570
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,308
to hide his open sores!

571
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,325
We need to admit you.

572
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:49,294
A gynecologist
will want to see you

573
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:50,729
and start treatment right away.

574
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:53,965
No, thanks. I
don't like hospitals!

575
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:57,035
Look, the tumor
will only get worse,

576
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,608
and you'll feel sicker.

577
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,174
Is there someone
that we can call?

578
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:06,177
A family member, perhaps,
who can talk to you about this?

579
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:08,413
Nope. Don't have
any brothers or sisters

580
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:11,350
and never got married.

581
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:16,321
I was engaged once to a man
named Christopher Clemmons.

582
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:19,157
He was gonna be a
famous jazz musician.

583
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:21,682
I was gonna be a movie star.

584
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:25,364
Doesn't really matter now.

585
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:29,890
In the end, everybody
dies alone. Right?

586
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,851
<i>Excuse me, you got a light?</i>

587
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,672

590
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,920

This is turning into
a freaking disaster.

594
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,678
You did fine.

595
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:17,900
Who's covering for you?

596
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,124
Don't worry about it.

597
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,105
I'm not hungry.

598
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,296
She's asking for you.

599
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,611
Maybe you should talk to her.

600
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,585
What for?

601
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,084
You're the one that didn't
want me to deal with her.

602
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,588
No. I thought she
needed hospitalization.

603
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,007
Well, why do you think I'm here?

604
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,742
Because you know
she needs your help,

605
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,427
even if she doesn't want it.

606
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:49,097

00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,627

609
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:04,584
Thank you.

610
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:18,198
You lied.

611
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,481
You wanted to kill yourself.

612
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:26,651
I can't be committed.

613
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,286
Well, you need help, Mom.

614
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,123
And I obviously don't
know how to help you.

615
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:34,492
I understand. I don't want
to be a burden to you, Abby.

616
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:37,528
I swear that's the truth.

617
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:39,047
But I can't be committed.

618
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,416
So you'll just do this
to yourself over again?

619
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,251
You'll just roll through
the whole cycle?

620
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,887
No.

621
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:47,356
Then what?

622
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,059
What? What are you gonna
do differently this time?

623
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,827
I don't know. I don't
want to make any...

624
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,397
I don't want to break
any more promises to you.

625
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,065
I've put you through
so much already...

626
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,501
If you believed that, you
would seek treatment.

627
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,819
I will. I just...

628
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,237
Can't be committed.

629
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,461
Right. Well...

630
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:10,116
Well, just forgive me if I
don't trust your judgment.

631
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,935
I would have found
a way to try, Abby.

632
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,872
It's not your fault.

633
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:23,830
Nothing I do is your fault.

634
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:27,945
My company has this
Christmas charity event.

635
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,047
One year the guy who always

636
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:31,316
dresses up for
the kids got sick.

637
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,585
My boss made me
put on this reindeer suit.

638
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:36,188
The kids went nuts. The
adults thought it was great.

639
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,106
Everybody took pictures with me.

640
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,374
Sounds almost
fun. It was a blast.

641
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,445
I used to be so shy. But
the suit gives you freedom.

642
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,381
It lets you do things
you normally wouldn't do.

643
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,383
But I'm not a
plushie or a furvert.

644
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,119
A what?

645
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,655
Furverts like to wear
their suits during sex.

646
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,825
And plushies are overly
fond of stuffed animals.

647
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:57,826
What?

648
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,017
But not me. I
just like the suit.

649
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:06,001
Some people disapprove and
think it's wrong, but the truth is,

650
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,058
I'm never happier than
when I'm a kangaroo.

651
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,706
You have to rule
out appendicitis,

652
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,642
biliary disease, food poisoning.

653
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:14,776
Does she have a fever?

654
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,511
No. 98.8.

655
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:20,187
Good breath sounds.
What's that smell?

656
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,404
Oh, my God.

657
00:27:25,428 --> 00:27:26,772
I've seen this before.

658
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:29,040
Get a surgical
consult. I'll call DCFS.

659
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,709
No. It's a folk cure.

660
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,144
They heat a coin over a candle
and drag it across the back.

661
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,447
Sometimes they dip
the coins in essential oils.

662
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:37,282
Just because it's
an ancient tradition

663
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,317
doesn't mean it's
not child abuse.

664
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,920
The minty smell is
probably oil of wintergreen.

665
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:43,938
It's got a high
concentration of salicylates.

666
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,840
It could have caused
the aspirin toxicity.

667
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,711
Let's get a blood gas and
a salicylate level, okay?

668
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:53,148
You do that. I'm
calling Family Services.

669
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,251
Will I be able to
have more children?

670
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,619
Yes.

671
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:08,230
Noni, what your boyfriend
did was really wrong.

672
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:11,266
You need to consider whether
or not to file criminal charges.

673
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,423
Victor loves me.

674
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,204
He just got scared.

675
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,196
That doesn't
justify what he did.

676
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,968
I was so excited to be pregnant.

677
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,178
What do you want to do?

678
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,045
Mrs. Wyczenski, are you
familiar with reading directions

679
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:44,482
and warnings on
over-the-counter medications?

680
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:46,384
Yes, I suppose so.

681
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:49,253
Would you please
read the label on this?

682
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:52,190
I'm sorry, I don't have my
reading glasses. I can't see.

683
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:55,760
Allow me, then. - Okay.

684
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:57,629
"One tablet at bedtime.

685
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,898
"May repeat in four
hours if necessary.

686
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:05,770
Do not exceed four
tablets in a 24-hour period."

687
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:08,039
You took 36
tablets, did you not?

688
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:11,976
I didn't have my reading
glasses with me then either.

689
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,804
You took 36 pills and you
didn't intend to kill yourself?

690
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:22,286
I was depressed, but I didn't
want to kill myself. Really.

691
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,522
Where did you get the pills?

692
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:25,757
I got them at a
convenience store.

693
00:29:25,781 --> 00:29:28,693
How did you pay for them?

694
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:31,229
I didn't. You stole them?

695
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:34,499
Objection. Shoplifting has
nothing to do with suicidality.

696
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,800
Goes to intent.

697
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:37,536
Get to it quickly.

698
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,304
Why did you have to steal them?

699
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:43,141
Why didn't you ask your
daughter to pay for them?

700
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,044
She wouldn't have. Why not?

701
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,796
She was worried.

702
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,765
Worried that you'd
try to kill yourself?

703
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,169
She worries when
I get depressed.

704
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:57,239
Because during other depressions
you have attempted suicide.

705
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,341
In fact, you've been committed
on two other occasions

706
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,394
for attempted
suicide, haven't you?

707
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:05,162
In '83 and 1974.

708
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:06,898
Yes.

709
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:08,833
What method did you
use for those attempts?

710
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:11,836
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

711
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,171
In '83.

712
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:16,307
What about in '74?

713
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,081
I took some pills.

714
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:24,583
Did you coin Lynda
because she's sick?

715
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:28,787
I don't understand
what you're saying.

716
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:31,155
Could someone get me a
translator? Where's Chen?

717
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,591
Hey, look who's here!

718
00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:34,392
Your cardiac enzymes
are back, Mr. Ferris.

719
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,894
Yeah, you had a
small heart attack.

720
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,396
What did I tell you, huh?
I know my heart attacks.

721
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,431
I guess I'm lucky you
showed up when you did.

722
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:42,667
Hey, we kept you
alive till he got there.

723
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,669
If there are any
blockages around the heart,

724
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:46,471
we'll open it with an
angioplasty balloon

725
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,139
and we'll keep it
open with a stent.

726
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:49,574
Thank you, Peter.

727
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,443
Not bad for a guy who blew
up a rubber in your classroom.

728
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,945
I'll check on you later.

729
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:57,682
Hi, Reece. What
are you doing here?

730
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,116
His mother broke her ankle.

731
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,985
So she's waiting to
be admitted to Surgery.

732
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,687
Ouch. Could you
look at a belly? Sure.

733
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:04,355
Excuse me.

734
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,995
I don't understand
what you're saying.

735
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,697
Could you just
calm down, all right?

736
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:15,988
She seems pretty
upset. You think?

737
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:20,905
Hey, you speak Cantonese?

738
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,708
You think? I was a
translator in the Army.

739
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:26,544
Could you ask her what she
treated her granddaughter with?

740
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:29,180
I think I can manage. Excuse me.

741
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:31,882
Malucci. Her labs are back.

742
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:33,618
Electrolytes are
normal. No anion gap.

743
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:37,689
PH 7.4. Salicylate level's
10 milligrams per deciliter.

744
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:39,990
Well, that's not a
toxic range. Nope.

745
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:42,760
Her liver-function tests and
her head CT are also normal.

746
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:45,095
Then it's one hell of a
case of gastroenteritis.

747
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,799
We've given her 10 of
Compazine and she's still puking.

748
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,067
Peter's looking at her
now. I'll let you know.

749
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,036
Well, anything?

750
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:56,374
She said she used
hot coins and liniment.

751
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,676
Yeah, I know that.
But did she say why?

752
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,712
Uh, she's possessed.

753
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:02,213
Grandma or the girl?

754
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:04,816
What are we talking
here, demonic spirits?

755
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,985
No, more like evil
thoughts. Sinful behavior.

756
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,977
You know, S-E-X.

757
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,876
Faye? Faye!

758
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,779
Hey, Faye, where are you
going? Where're you going?

759
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,748
I got a garden party at 6.

760
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,750
You need to be
admitted to the hospital

761
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,118
so you can start treatment.

762
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,654
We both know that's
not gonna happen.

763
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,589
You can't leave. Come on.

764
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:33,794
I've never been one for
hospitals. They smell funny.

765
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,763
Besides, I already
signed the papers.

766
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,922
Will you at least
speak to a psychiatrist?

767
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,504
Mr. Whiskers.

768
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,389
Take it.

769
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:46,591
No, I can't. Really.

770
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,493
Look, honey,

771
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:51,396
I'm gonna be dead in a few
months. You said so yourself.

772
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,498
Make me feel better
knowing he's with someone

773
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:55,317
who'll appreciate him.

774
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,570
Stupid puppet ended
my acting career.

775
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:02,228
But it did buy my first house.

776
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,465
Thank you.

777
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:11,504
Every day comes
with its own surprises.

778
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,988
A statement from a former
employer of Mrs. Wyczenski...

779
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,790
I don't need any
more statements.

780
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:20,759
The employer affirms that...

781
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:22,660
We've spent enough
time on this one already.

782
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:23,995
Let's move on.

783
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:26,598
Mrs. Wyczenski is released
on her own recognizance.

784
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:30,034
What's next, Mike? Well,
that's good. You won.

785
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:31,519
Wait. JUDGE: Is this yours?

786
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,587
Yes, it is. So I can just go?

787
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,557
Yes, you can go. Wait
a minute. That's it?

788
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,558
I'm sorry.

789
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,227
No, she's letting her go?

790
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,563
She needs hospitalization!

791
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,616
I'm not debating it with you.
You've counseled your client?

792
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,550
Yeah, but, I mean, that's...

793
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:49,371
We did all we can. I'm
sorry. We have to move on.

794
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,972
You're done. It's good.

795
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,741
Just go back to the
hospital and sign out.

796
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:56,277
Okay. That's good. Move on.
All of you should just move on.

797
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,212
We wouldn't want
to waste time on this.

798
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,182
I've been dealing with
her for 30 years. Russell?

799
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,251
You didn't have to
drive her to the hospital.

800
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:06,087
Pour charcoal down her
throat. Or breathe for her.

801
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,756
This way. I'm getting my coat!

802
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,357
Just don't touch her.

803
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,593
She's not your mother.
What do you care?

804
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:13,495
The rest of us will
just take care of her.

805
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,981
And maybe, maybe if
you're really lucky next time

806
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,900
you won't have to
hear the case at all.

807
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,769
Because maybe next
time you'll do it right!

808
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,627
And then it'll be the
coroner's problem.

809
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,877
No evidence of
appendicitis or pancreatitis.

810
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,213
Biliary colic? No.

811
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,549
I'm about to give up.
Did you check for pyelo?

812
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,083
Yes. And hepatitis.

813
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,586
You should get an x-ray of
that wrist if it's bothering you.

814
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,787
I'm fine.

815
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,055
What will you do with Reece?

816
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,457
I left a message for Jackie.

817
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:45,560
Hopefully she can pick him
up on her way home from work.

818
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,061
Why don't you take him home?

819
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,813
You can't do anything
with that hand.

820
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,232
I wanna stick around
until Ferris gets a room.

821
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,319
Then I'll take him home
with me. I'm off in an hour.

822
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,936
No, I don't want you
to have to do that.

823
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,272
I don't mind.

824
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,564
We'll have fun, right?

825
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,079
All right. Thanks.

826
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,830
You have to let
me take an x-ray.

827
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,688
Come on, you're
resorting to blackmail?

828
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,255
What the hell is that?

829
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,358
I remember Mr. Whiskers!
Where did you get him? On eBay?

830
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,561
Princess Taffeta was the
patient who Maced you.

831
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,496
Wow. That's probably
worth some money.

832
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,897
Looks like roadkill.

833
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,733
Malucci, there's a
priest in with Lynda An?

834
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,302
Yeah. He's doing an exorcism.

835
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,736
Excuse me?

836
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,206
Actually, he's a chaplain,
and it's more of a blessing.

837
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,142
But it should work. I think
her problem's psychosomatic.

838
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,444
Based on your vast
knowledge of psychiatry?

839
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,679
That and the fact her
grandma caught her

840
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,316
messing around with her
boyfriend. It's all about guilt.

841
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,017
Hey, how's it working
out with Lynda?

842
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,386
I think she's gonna
be fine. Excellent.

843
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,555
How are you feeling? - Hungry.

844
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,956
No more nausea?

845
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,225
No. I'm starving.

846
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,393
She's eating solid
foods and not vomiting.

847
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,661
She's ready to go home.

848
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,930
I'd like to admit you,
keep you in overnight

849
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,732
for observation and rehydration.

850
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,367
Could I get a
pizza or something?

851
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,469
We'll see what we
can work out, okay?

852
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,903
Nice catch, huh?

853
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,639
I'd still like to do
some more tests.

854
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,407
Why, because you can't admit

855
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,109
that a surgeon
and a pediatrician

856
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,445
got outsmarted by a goombah?

857
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,113
Yeah. Don't sweat it.

858
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,615
You're not the
first to be deceived

859
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,367
by my rugged good
looks and boyish charm.

860
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:19,003
By signing, you
acknowledge that doctors feel

861
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:20,571
it's best you
remain hospitalized

862
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,173
and that you accept
and understand

863
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:24,141
by leaving against
medical advice

864
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:28,212
you risk a deterioration of
your psychiatric symptoms.

865
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:31,549
What about my meds?

866
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:33,317
Can I have a prescription?

867
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:36,287
I will give you
three days' worth.

868
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:38,523
I want to see you Monday.

869
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:41,025
If you're doing well, I'll
give you a week's worth.

870
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:43,461
Okay. Okay what?
What does that mean?

871
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,162
Could I call you?

872
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:46,664
Sure.

873
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,566
All right. You can
call me anytime.

874
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,801
You can call me just to talk.

875
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:51,791
Okay.

876
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:00,344
I got some stuff
from that motel room

877
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:02,547
and some stuff you
left in my apartment.

878
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:03,815
Thank you.

879
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,372
Figure out where you're going?

880
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:13,324
Yeah. Dr. Legaspi gave
me the name of a shelter.

881
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:16,894
I'm gonna go
there for a few days.

882
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:18,952
Okay. Okay.

883
00:37:23,224 --> 00:37:25,703
Good luck, Maggie.

884
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,338
See you next time.

885
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:29,474
Next time?

886
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,944
Yeah, whenever it
is, wherever it is...

887
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:35,418
Maybe there won't
be a next time.

888
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:45,306
You're gonna walk out of
here on your own one week

889
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,292
after swallowing a pharmacy,

890
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:48,859
as close to death
as I see people get,

891
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,951
and you think there's
not gonna be a next time?

892
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,517
I hope not. I don't know.

893
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,492
I promised myself I
wouldn't make any promises.

894
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,690
You know,

895
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:07,761
when I saw you seizing
on that table, I thought:

896
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,764
"This is it. This is it. This
is how it's all gonna end.

897
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,305
I am going to watch
my mother die."

898
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,222
I still might not be
wrong about that.

899
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:19,623
It could still end that way.

900
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,859
And there's not one
thing I can do about it.

901
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,133
But I'll show up.

902
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:28,566
Because you will always
have that power over me.

903
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,973
I will show up and
I will try to stop it.

904
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,626
I love you, Mom.

905
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,954
How long will she
be in the hospital?

906
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:52,890
We'll keep her
overnight for observation.

907
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,659
Could I see her?
I don't think so.

908
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:56,961
I wanna talk to her.
She prefers to be alone.

909
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:58,679
You need to speak to the police.

910
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,013
This the guy? This is the guy.

911
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,249
Wait a second. This is
between me and Noni.

912
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,319
What did you do, talk
her into pressing charges?

913
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,571
I didn't have to.
Murder is a felony.

914
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,123
Come with me, sir.
It wasn't even a baby.

915
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:13,660
Can I speak with
Dr. Quaid? Daryl Quaid.

916
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,664
Well, he gave me his card
and it has this number on it.

917
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,369
Right. Okay, thanks.

918
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,237
One of those days, huh? Mm.

919
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,738
Did you ever find
out what happened

920
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,541
with your numbers guy?
Was he some kind of a savant?

921
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,444
Don't know. He left with
this doctor from the VA.

922
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,014
I just called to follow up but
there's no record of my patient

923
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,016
or the doctor I
let him leave with.

924
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,451
What will you do? Same
thing as I always do.

925
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,786
Hit a bar, get drunk,
go home with a stranger

926
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,423
and have wild sex until I
pass out from exhaustion.

927
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,991
Takeout and a hot bath? Yeah.

928
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,360
Randi, have you seen
my puppet? Your what?

929
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,695
Mr. Whiskers. I didn't
touch it. Trust me.

930
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,498
Can't believe somebody
would steal that.

931
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,966
So where do you guys
want Super Larry? Exam 1.

932
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,535
The opossum
guy's still in there.

933
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,370
Okay. Well, let's
get rid of him.

934
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,361
Mr. Paxton?

935
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,032
Mr. Paxton? You
still playing opossum?

936
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,050
Mr. Whiskers!

937
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,972
<i>Whatever happened
to Mrs. Lindstrom?</i>

938
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,775
Retired.

939
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,677
She was mean.

940
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:22,680
That woman was born mean.

941
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:25,516
Even the other teachers
were afraid of her.

942
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:32,322
I'm sure you thought
the same of me

943
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,575
with all those
detentions I gave you.

944
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,009
Hey.

945
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,080
Your detentions steered
me towards medicine. So...

946
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,949
I might have played
a small role in it.

947
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,255
I'm proud of you, Peter.

948
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:47,054
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.

949
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,638
And you should be
proud of yourself.

950
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,743
I am. Look, don't get me wrong.

951
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,045
Sometimes it's hard

952
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:56,747
when people's lives
depend on your success

953
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,316
and you're not
always successful.

954
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,686
Sometimes you...

955
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,188
Sometimes you get
so tired that you start

956
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,607
forgetting what's important.

957
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,327
And what is that?

958
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:11,429
Two things in this
world I'm certain of:

959
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:14,965
My love for my son and
my skills as a surgeon.

960
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:19,337
I'm a father, I'm a doctor.

961
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:21,422
At the end of the day,
that's enough for me.

962
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,874
What about a teacher?

963
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,543
That was never one
of my greatest skills.

964
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:30,515
The only skill you need to
be a good teacher is to care.

965
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:32,800
That's all.

966
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,236
Who knows? Maybe
one of your students

967
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,594
will wind up saving
your ass one day.

968
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:46,814
Hi.

969
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,449
Hi.

970
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,285
I, uh, heard you were
here, but I haven't seen you.

971
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,120
Uh, yeah.

972
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,589
Most of my day is
spent in the jail ward.

973
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,412
I'm sorry.

974
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,412
I was glad to hear that
the charges were dropped.

975
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,247
Shannon Wallace
decided to tell the truth

976
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,650
after she got the
treatment that she needed.

977
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:08,886
That's good.

978
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,471
What do you want, Kerry?

979
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,739
I thought you might be hungry.

980
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,675
No. No, I'm not,

981
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,939
and I have a ton
of work to do. So...

982
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:21,999
Right. Well, uh, if
you change your mind

983
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:24,573
here's some Kung Pao
chicken from George's.

984
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:38,582
Abby, are you okay in there?

985
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:40,584
Want some dinner?

986
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:44,310

Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
