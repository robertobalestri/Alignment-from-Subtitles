1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,220
So he's a scalper.

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,922
He's a respiratory therapist.

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,458
But he's got a friend who
can get us good seats.

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,128
So it's either a sporting event

5
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,395
or a concert.

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,997
No more hints. Sporting event.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,399
Were you one of those kids
who peeked at his presents?

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,901
Hi, guys. Hey.

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,102
Hey. You on swing?

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,304
Only an hour left.
Bringing your dog to work?

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,639
We're picking something up.

12
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,073
What's his name? Norman.

13
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,576
Hi, Norman. Don't let
him close to your leg.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,228
John. What? Don't be ashamed.

15
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:36,730
He's a guy. I'm
getting him fixed.

16
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,799
Oh, God. What?

17
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:40,801
That car. What about it?

18
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:43,070
Read the license plate.

19
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:44,938
Huh. ABBY: "Man-o-med"?

20
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,940
Ha. That's Richard.

21
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,860
Ah. Who's Richard?

22
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:53,429
Randi, is there a guy named
Richard looking for me?

23
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,764
Your ex? Yes.

24
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,499
In the lounge,
talking with Dr. Kovac.

25
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,203
Call Security. Tell
them there's a BMW

26
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,972
illegally parked in
the ambulance bay.

27
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:05,125
She tried to quit three
times while we were together.

28
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,865
Got addicted to the gum.

29
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:10,797
What do you need, Richard?
You didn't return my calls.

30
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,899
When did you call?
Last night, this morning.

31
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,357
I haven't checked
my messages yet.

32
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,674
Excuse me. RICHARD:
Nice meeting you.

33
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,258
Yeah.

34
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,732
Look, it's your mom.

35
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,867
She's gone off the
reservation again.

36
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,092
She's holed up in a motel
outside of Muskogee, Oklahoma.

37
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,326
She called you? No.

38
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,912
Apparently, some guy that
she's been traveling with

39
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,613
prepaid the room
for a week, then split.

40
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:44,881
That was three weeks ago.

41
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,384
The manager of the
hotel got your old number,

42
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,553
which is my number,
and took it out of her bag.

43
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,856
What was he doing
going through her stuff?

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,258
Looking for money, I guess.
He says she's all spaced out.

45
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,160
She won't leave the room.

46
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,617
Is she answering the door?

47
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,532
Richard...

48
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,906
is she answering the door?

49
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,661
You should call this guy.

50
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,067
I'm sorry, Abby.

51
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,985
How did you fall?

52
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,921
Greased pigs. Heh-heh.

53
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,924
What? We were
chasing greased pigs.

54
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,392
Tau Beta Chi

55
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,512
against Gamma Psi Mu.

56
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,847
Is this a contest?

57
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,815
Oh, yeah. And thanks to Tasha,

58
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,207
Tau Beta kicked ass. Ha, ha, ha.

59
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,689
Been drinking already, huh?

60
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,907
It's Greek Week. Mm-hm.

61
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,859
Okay, we'll have to seal that

62
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,662
with some
calcium-hydroxide paste.

63
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,480
I'll be back. Mm-hm.

64
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:43,064
Abby?

65
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,018
What did the guy
say? She's there.

66
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,687
Um, he says she owes him $800.

67
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,255
Do you have that? Not really.

68
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,423
I do.

69
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,591
No, Luka.

70
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,259
Hey, I'll take care of it.

71
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:55,428
Don't give him a credit
card. We'll wire the money.

72
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:58,198
I told him I'd give it to
him when I got there.

73
00:03:58,222 --> 00:04:00,467
When you got there?

74
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,934
I'm... I'm gonna take a redeye.

75
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,220
No, no, Abby. We'll
call the local hospital,

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,454
talk to a psychiatrist

77
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,790
and see if we can get
the police to bring her in.

78
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,727
I can't put my mother
in a lockup in Oklahoma.

79
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,762
You can fly down there
once she's medicated.

80
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,063
No, no, if I have to commit her,

81
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,399
it'll be easier to do it
from Chicago, trust me.

82
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,568
Why are you doing this?
Because my mother's sick.

83
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,070
I know. I saw her, and I saw
what she did to you last time.

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,507
Dr. Kovac, possible DKE
in 4. Accu-Chek is 400.

85
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,164
In... In a second.

86
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,079
I have to talk to
the supervisor,

87
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,915
see if I can switch my shift.

88
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,583
Abby, don't go out there.

89
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,206
It's my problem.

90
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:39,723
Damn it. You all right?

91
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,146
Oh, yeah. No problem.

92
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,780
Mark, I don't know why
you insist on baby-proofing

93
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:48,581
every drawer and cabinet.

94
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,817
The baby's not gonna
be crawling immediately.

95
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:54,086
There's a high likelihood that
he'll be advanced for his age.

96
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,322
Who was at the door?

97
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,990
UPS. More gifts.

98
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,060
Between the baby and the
wedding, they know me by name.

99
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,762
You didn't lift
anything, I hope.

100
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,597
No. It was light.

101
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,088
No lifting. I'm serious.

102
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,007
What are you doing?

103
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:16,793
Trying to get this
show on the road.

104
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,428
I hope you don't
have it on the floor.

105
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,463
I've been sitting
around for days.

106
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,515
I need to move.

107
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,805
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

108
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,685
I had to pee, Haleh.

109
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,454
I didn't say anything.

110
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,190
You have nothing in coach?

111
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,476
Okay. Well,
what if I fly into...

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,877
To Oklahoma City?

113
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,379
Hi. Hi.

114
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,403
What did Richard want?

115
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:43,787
My mother has, uh, bottomed
out 40 miles outside of Tulsa.

116
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,656
And, of all people, the motel
owner had to call Richard.

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,491
Hey! Did you talk to her?

118
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,693
She... She's not
picking up the phone,

119
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,728
and she won't come
out of the room, so...

120
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,032
Hey, your dog!

121
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,084
John! Norman, drop that.

122
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,386
You brought him inside?
Yeah, we used the bathroom.

123
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,473
Is that gonna hurt him?
No. No worse than a chilidog.

124
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,808
No! No.

125
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:05,909
Good boy. Come on.

126
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,744
Did you get the
tickets? Yeah, all set.

127
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,746
So, uh, am I gonna
have to call you a cab,

128
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,248
or you gonna make it back?

129
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,516
I'll meet you outside.

130
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,584
What's wrong? I just
wanna change that bag.

131
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,904
Give me five minutes.
Or you can start running.

132
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,873
I'll wait. A dog has no business

133
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,841
in a hospital! Seeing Eye dog.

134
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:25,678
Well, how many people are
going to Oklahoma tonight? I...

135
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,347
No. Thank you.

136
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,999
You okay? I can't get a flight.

137
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,501
You trying direct to Tulsa?

138
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,102
I can't get anywhere close.

139
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,588
There's not even a connection
open. What are you doing?

140
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,123
I have a really
good travel agent.

141
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,842
She always finds
something somewhere.

142
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,293
Wanna fly out tonight?

143
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,883
Hi. Katie Witcher, please.

144
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,599
Open return? No, I
have to drive her back.

145
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,719
Why? Because she
can't handle flying.

146
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,889
You're gonna drive her all the
way back to Chicago by yourself?

147
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,445
Is Luka going with you?

148
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,546
Hey, Katie. It's John Carter.

149
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,782
Good. Yeah.

150
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:04,450
Any way that you could find me

151
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,375
two one-way tickets to Tulsa?

152
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,794

Sorry, I didn't hear you.

165
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,838
I think it's time.

166
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,821
Will I have a black
eye? Probably.

167
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,923
Piggy-kick to the face.
Bet that's a new one, doc.

168
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,626
Ha, ha, ha, ha. It's
not funny, Kevin. Ow.

169
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,294
Sorry. Do you have a minute?

170
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,495
Yeah.

171
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,363
Your eye movement is intact.

172
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,699
But we'll have to take x-rays

173
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,367
to make sure
there's no fracture.

174
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,036
He could've cracked my face?

175
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,037
Probably not.

176
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,105
But maybe next time

177
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,674
you wrestle animals,
you should be sober.

178
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,142
Well, it wasn't my idea.

179
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,878
You're still the best-looking
piggy mud-wrestler I know.

180
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,183
Shut up, Kevin. Ha, ha, ha.

181
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,902
I'm taking an
11:40 flight to Tulsa.

182
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,120
Hold on, I checked.
There's a psychiatric facility

183
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,272
at Saint John's Medic...
Carter's coming with me.

184
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,541
What?

185
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,242
Her mom suffers
from bipolar disorder.

186
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,110
She's locked herself
in a motel room.

187
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:41,480
A motel room? Probably
in a major depression.

188
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,500
Well, why do you have
to go? He offered to help.

189
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,569
And I have to drive
her back here, so...

190
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,887
I offered to help.

191
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,822
No, you offered

192
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,307
to decide for me.

193
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,709
Abby, your mother
needs hospitalization,

194
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,678
not a road trip
with you and Carter.

195
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,030
Yeah, Luka. We're
doing it for the fun of it.

196
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,932
It's gonna be a blast.
It's a Bulls game.

197
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,901
You said you liked basketball.

198
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,653
I do. Then let's go.

199
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,322
Abby needs someone with her.
But why can't her boyfriend go?

200
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,774
Abby, it's... It's a mistake.

201
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,575
Are you gonna
lecture me on this? No.

202
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,677
Good. Because you
have no idea what it's like.

203
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,664
I grew up with this. And I... I
don't wanna be lectured on it.

204
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,866
I'm not lecturing.
I'm trying to help.

205
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,534
You're spending
the weekend with her.

206
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,853
And her depressed mother.

207
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:23,289
I will pay for the tickets...
It's not about the tickets.

208
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,258
Shut up! Don't
tell him to shut up!

209
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:27,593
Don't put yourself in the
position to get hurt again.

210
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:30,401
Well, you'd be the expert
at that, wouldn't you?

211
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,721
I'm sorry.

212
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,056
I'm sorry. Go.

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,358
Rena. Okay, go.

214
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,795
I think I can make it.

215
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,431
Hospital policy. How
far are you dilated?

216
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,532
She wouldn't let me check.

217
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,034
You're the father,
not the doctor.

218
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,069
Ooh, I'll get it. You
get the elevator.

219
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,237
You having a baby?
Did your water break?

220
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,606
Why the sneakers?

221
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,408
I'll be on my feet. He's
worried about foot pain.

222
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,177
I've been through
this. I haven't.

223
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,712
Are you in labor?
You got cigars?

224
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,280
How far apart are
the contractions?

225
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,648
Three to five minutes.

226
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,584
For how long? Every hour.

227
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,086
Sounds like
you're getting there.

228
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,154
All right. Is it time?

229
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,890
We think so. Congratulations.

230
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,158
Don't be a hero.
Get the epidural.

231
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,644
We'll see.

232
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,445
She'll get it.

233
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,008
I'm so humiliated.

234
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,612
It was an honest mistake.

235
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,080
I've been through
the real thing.

236
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,781
I should know what
Braxton Hicks are.

237
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,783
Dr. Corday, you drop
that baby already?

238
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,852
Couple more hours. Or days.

239
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,420
I thought you were
having your baby.

240
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,022
I am. Just not right now.

241
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,624
They're sending us home.

242
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,025
This place ain't going anywhere.

243
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,960
Suppose I don't need
this chair anymore.

244
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,829
Relax. You'll need your energy.

Uh...

257
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,553
Uh, one... Well, one day
she woke up and she decided

258
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,555
she wanted to take
us to Disneyland,

259
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,847
which sounded like a great idea.

260
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,927
We got to skip school,

261
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,162
and we all rushed
to the airport.

262
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,164
She didn't get on the plane? No.

263
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:49,235
When we were flying over
Nevada, the pilot came over the PA,

264
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,604
playing tour guide.

265
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,672
And...

266
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,574
she freaked out.

268
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,979
She was convinced we were
flying over a nuclear test site.

269
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:02,699
She tried to open the
emergency-exit door.

270
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,134
It took two flight attendants

271
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,126
and three passengers
to restrain her.

272
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,009
They tied her up right
there in the seat next to me,

273
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,377
and she screamed her head
off all the way to Los Angeles.

Wonder what?

285
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:05,261
What brings her here?

286
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,997
He was an interstate trucker,

287
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,267
freelance by the
look of his rig.

288
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,170
He stayed one night,
prepaid the week, then left.

289
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,194
I figured he'd be
coming back for her.

290
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:21,177
She was ordering pizza
for a while, and then nothing.

291
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,879
Saw her by the candy
machine a few times,

292
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:26,282
tried to talk to her.
She didn't say nothing.

293
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,717
Well, should we, uh...?
We should knock first.

294
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,022
No. She don't answer.

295
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,045
Maggie?

296
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,927
Maggie, it's, uh...
It's John Carter.

297
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,768
We met in Chicago.
I have Abby with me.

298
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,278
Told you.

299
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,253
Thanks. We'll take it from here.

300
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,727
You're paying her bill,
right? Yeah, I'll take care of it.

301
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,958
Mom?

302
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,317
God.

303
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:32,870
Abby.

304
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,057
Do you have any clean clothes?

305
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,374
Mom?

306
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,165
Mom, you know where you are?

307
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,121
I'm in a motel. Where?

308
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:09,506
Where's the motel?

309
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,939
It's in Oklahoma.

310
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,124
Abby? Yeah?

311
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,726
How is she?

312
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,162
Oriented. No focal findings.
Can you run out to the car...

313
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,764
for me and grab my bag?

314
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,198
I brought some extra clothes.

315
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,689
Yeah, sure.

316
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,803
Raise your arms. No.

317
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:28,971
Yeah. No.

318
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,140
I need you to raise
your arms. Please?

319
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,407
No.

320
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,221
Hello?

321
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,769
Who's this?

322
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,516
Hey.

323
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,885
No, Abby's inside with her mom.

324
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,441
We're at the motel.

325
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,023
I don't know. I haven't
really seen her yet.

326
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,407
Abby's giving her a bath.

327
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,361
Ahem. Yeah, I will.

328
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,537
What?

329
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,927
You related to her?

330
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,452
I'm just gonna set
'em on the bed, okay?

331
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,956
Thank you.

332
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,231
And, uh, Luka called. He
said you can call him tonight.

333
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,814
Abby? ABBY: Yeah?

334
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,849
There's a diner about a
half mile down the road.

335
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,353
You want me to pick
up something to eat?

336
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,322
Uh...

337
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,089
Yeah. Some eggs maybe.

338
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,625
And some toast.

339
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:40,692
Sure.

340
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:42,450
Okay, I'll be right back.

341
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,010
You gonna be okay?

342
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,150
Abby?

343
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,468
Yeah.

344
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,084
Okay, lean your head back. No.

345
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,276
Come on. Come on.

346
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,262
There you go.

347
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,288
Okay.

348
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,661
I have to go to the bathroom.

349
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,197
Someone, please?
A nurse will help you.

350
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,466
When? Soon. You're late.

351
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,034
Four minutes. I needed a coffee.

352
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,903
You wouldn't be late if
Dr. Weaver was here.

353
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,538
That's true, but she's
not. Yep, it's showtime.

354
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,074
Will you take me
to the bathroom?

355
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,375
Get this guy a urinal.

356
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,110
Find a nurse. - Ow, my...

357
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,579
- What do we got?
- Frat boy. Roof to roof.

358
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,181
Didn't make it.
It's "fraternity."

359
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,483
You had a few? Stopped
counting yesterday.

360
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,418
Argh, I can't
walk on either leg.

361
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,989
Reed, you baby. Pete's
the one really messed up.

362
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,625
BP, 110/65.

363
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,593
Pulse, 120. Complains
of chest pain.

364
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,911
Man, you really ate it, bro.

365
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,963
I'm okay, man. I hit the trees.

366
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,432
Trauma panel, C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

367
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,768
- Fall from height?
- Maybe 20 feet.

368
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,503
Losers couldn't clear 6 feet.

369
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,004
It looks like you
had trouble too.

370
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,306
I was the only one that
made it. How'd he fall?

371
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,250
I jumped. Eww.

372
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,257
Come in.

373
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,606
No toast.

374
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,525
- Hope you like biscuits.
- Whatever.

375
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,245
Hi, Maggie.

376
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:41,619
John Carter, Abby's friend.

377
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,238
You don't have to clean up.

378
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,462
I gave the guy a little
extra money for the mess.

379
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,011
Abby, you don't
have to clean up.

380
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,779
I took care of it.

381
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,936
Hungry?

382
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,073
No. But she needs to eat, so...

383
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:07,205
Hey, Mom.

384
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,274
I need you to eat
some eggs now. No.

385
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,442
Yes. No.

386
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:13,578
Yep. Settle for one bite. No.

387
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,564
Come on. Oh, my God. No.

388
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,234
Come on. Just
one bite. Oh... Ugh!

389
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,237
Get that away. I don't want it.
Okay. We're ready to go then.

390
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,872
No. Yeah, we're leaving.

391
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,273
Let's go.

392
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:27,126
No, I wanna stay here. No,
we're leaving. Get the bags.

393
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,528
I'm staying here. No,
you're not staying here.

394
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,697
I'm staying. I'm taking
you back to Chicago.

395
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,833
I don't want to. Mom?

396
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:35,050
I don't wanna go back.

397
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,185
Mom, this one you're
not going to win.

398
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,171
Okay? So get up.
Get off the bed now!

399
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,195
Abby.

400
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,427
Okay, we'll carry you. No.

401
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,096
Yeah, we're gonna
carry you. Damn it.

402
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,598
Are you sure? I'm sure.
Get her into the car.

403
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,733
Why can't I stay here?

404
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,801
Why can't I just
stay here, please?

405
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,821
- Just let me stay here.
- Come on, Maggie.

406
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,857
Why can't I just stay? No. No.

407
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:02,260
I wanna stay here. Why
won't you let me stay?

408
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:07,866
Just let me stay here.
Damn it! Just let me stay!

409
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,035
Why won't you let me stay?

410
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,870
God.

411
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,396
Seat belt? No. Just go.

412
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,719
Let's get a post-procedure
film. You want a Foley?

413
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,721
Let's give this idiot a
tube in every orifice.

414
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:30,756
Can I please go to the bathroom?

415
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,058
Haleh, would you please
take this man to the bathroom?

416
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,993
In a minute.

417
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,450
Benton, right?

418
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,532
Peter Benton. Have
I seen you before?

419
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,534
Yes. What for?

420
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,403
I believe it was an
exploding condom.

421
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,638
Excuse me?

422
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,108
You filled a condom with
gas from a Bunsen burner,

423
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:50,876
and set it on fire.
Ah! Mr. Perry.

424
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,945
In my classroom. Uh-huh.

425
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,413
How are you? You
remember? Yes, yes.

426
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,750
I guess all that
detention time paid off.

427
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:59,317
Come. I'll take you
to the bathroom.

428
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,286
Thanks. I'm about
to have an accident.

429
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,371
You grew a few inches. Uh-huh.

430
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,372
So how have you been?

431
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,608
Good, until last
month. I had a stroke.

432
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,744
What from? Atrial fibrillation.

433
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,647
Left me with some left-sided
weakness, but I'm managing.

434
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,216
What are you doing here today?

435
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,151
I had my teeth
cleaned a few days ago,

436
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,086
and they won't stop bleeding.

437
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,722
Hm. What's your Coumadin
dosage? Five milligrams.

438
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,257
Any other bleeding?
From your...?

439
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,725
No, just my gums.

440
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,760
Did they draw your
blood? An hour ago.

441
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,329
I'll try to track down your labs

442
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,797
and see what
your prothrombin is.

443
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,832
Thank you, Peter.

444
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,300

It's no problem.

454
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,569
Is this as bad as it gets?

455
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,434
Has it been worse?

456
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,215
It's always different.

457
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,705
Sort of.

458
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,585

Although, it was
pretty bad the time

462
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,833
she locked herself in the
garage and turned on both cars.

463
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,215
She's been suicidal?

464
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,783

Broken bottle.

473
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,475
It was stupid. My fault.

474
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,545
Let me guess. Greek
Week. How'd you know?

475
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,314
Because you smell like
you've slept in a beer garden.

476
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,249
Actually, a car trunk, but...

477
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,273
Oh... Oh. Here.

478
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,394
So you were locked in a trunk?

479
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,451
Yeah.

480
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,132
It's a... It's a pledging
thing. Uh-huh.

481
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,453
And that's supposed to
make you feel like a man?

482
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,056
I don't know. It's tradition.

483
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,924
How did the bottle
break? I was, uh...

484
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:22,894
I was pounding it on
the trunk of the car.

485
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:24,679
I don't know why,
but I panicked in there.

486
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,565
It's called claustrophobia.

487
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:28,400
But I knew they'd come back.

488
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:29,651
They did last time.

489
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,036
You did this before?

490
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,805
Yeah, I'm pledging again.

491
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,457
I didn't make it
through last time.

492
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:38,460
Well, I guess you
really want this, huh?

493
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,046
It's a good house, and
th-they're good guys.

494
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,315
Don't you think you're
jumping the gun?

495
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,135
Hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.

496
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,202
You're ready to pop.

497
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,637
Shouldn't I be
the judge of that?

498
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,038
Is this time for real?

499
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,207
We should have been here
a few hours ago. We were.

500
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

501
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,912
If we'd waited any longer, we
would have had a home birth.

502
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,881
Did you get any
sleep? Do I look rested?

503
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,238
Okay, good luck. Thanks.

504
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,285
A chef's salad

505
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,054
and a cup of pea soup for her.

506
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,023
No, just coffee. You...
You have to eat something.

507
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,881
No. Mom.

508
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,662
Pie.

509
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,431
Okay, fine. But could you bring
a glass of milk also, please?

510
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,688
Sure.

511
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:22,170
Well, it's about 30
more miles to Springfield.

512
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:25,607
And there's not much
after that until St. Louis.

513
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,443
Unless you wanna stay
in a town called Lebanon.

514
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,907
It sounds kinda dangerous.

515
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,317
So how'd you end up in
Oklahoma? Don't bother.

516
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,855
He can talk to me
if he wants. Fine.

517
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,623
How'd you end up in Oklahoma?

518
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,580
None of your business.

519
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,329
Oh!

520
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,831
What's that? Depakote.

521
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,165
No.

522
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,902
You can't make me, Abby.
I don't want to make you.

523
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,537
No, no, no. I want you

524
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,628
to do it on your own.

525
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,139
Thanks.

526
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:15,707
There you go.

527
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,142
Mmmmm.

528
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,977
I have to go to the bathroom.

529
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,378
No.

530
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:21,847
I can order for myself.

531
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:24,916
I can talk for myself.
I can pee for myself.

532
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,173
Just...

533
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:30,822
I'm not a child.
It's a bathroom.

534
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:32,490
What am I gonna do with myself?

535
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:34,526
Are you gonna follow
me in the stall? No.

536
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,483
Don't expect a thank-you.

537
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,932
Somebody had to come. We
needed to start her medication.

538
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,901
How long to reach
therapeutic levels?

539
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,870
Tomorrow night. It's
10 hours to Chicago.

540
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:20,772
I know. I-I'll take
her to my house.

541
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:23,608
I'll get her to Psych on Monday.
Are you working on Monday?

542
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:24,843
No, I'll switch shifts.

543
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:27,211
Well, what about Monday night?

544
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:30,815
Uh, Luka, I'm gonna have
to call you back. Why?

545
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,752
I'll call you back. Rena.
No, no. Wait. Because...

546
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:36,220
Wh-where'd she go?
You're misinterpreting this.

547
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:37,310
What? My mother.

548
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:44,284
I thought I locked that door.

549
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:48,087
I unlocked it.

550
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,136
Okay. I needed some air.

551
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
Okay. Okay.

552
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,609
See that family down there?

553
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,578
Right down there.

554
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:02,914
There's two little
boys over there.

555
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:05,505
They're fighting by the
pool. Do you see them?

556
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,422
And I think that must be
their parents over there,

557
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,579
having a cocktail.

558
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:18,018
I watch people
like that for hours.

559
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:22,035
People doing their marketing

560
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,192
and tying their shoes.

561
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,105
Just doing routine things

562
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,429
that probably
bore them to tears.

563
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,812
I think how lucky they are.

564
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,103
They have...

565
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:44,922
They have ordinary lives.

566
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:46,157
You could be like them.

567
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:48,159
No, I couldn't
ever be like them.

568
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,428
Yes, if you took your
medication. I tried.

569
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:52,230
I did everything
I could think of.

570
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,066
I got married. I had two kids.

571
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,325
I tried to fool everyone
that I was just like them.

572
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:07,667
God, why did you come, Abby?

573
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,543
Because you needed me.

574
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:23,777
There's no one here to save.

575
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,768

578
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,178
Do you want me to talk to her?

579
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:42,113
What would you say?

580
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,949
That I asked you to come with
me and help me with my mother.

581
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,435
You didn't ask me
to come with you.

582
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,136
Just get back and
send her some flowers.

583
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,705
I'm sure it'll be fine.

584
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,058
I don't think so. She's young.

585
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:56,461
If you get involved with a
teenager, expect drama.

586
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,862
We broke up.

587
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,630
You broke up?

588
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,898
She broke up. When?

589
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:03,490
Last night. Over a
basketball game?

590
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:07,439
Over you.

591
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:09,674
That's silly. What
does she think?

592
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:12,160
We're having an... An
illicit affair or something?

593
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,828
No.

594
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,412
Just that I have a crush on you.

595
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:22,420
It's not like the relationship
didn't have its obstacles.

596
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:25,023
Yeah, but I wouldn't want
you to break up because of me.

597
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:27,413
Face it. You're a home wrecker.

Dr. Greene?

601
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,503
Hey, Malucci. Hey, I
got you your cigars.

602
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,138
Great. Congratulations.

603
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:42,407
Wow, she's a cute
one. Look at her.

604
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:44,476
You're gonna have to keep
the boys away from her.

605
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,110
What's her name? Ella.

606
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:48,447
Hiya, Ella, you're quite
the heifer, aren't you?

607
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:50,682
Can I hold her? No.

608
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,518
I just washed my hands.
Good for you, Dave.

609
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,120
Are you serious?
I'll see you later.

610
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,255
Why can't I hold her?

611
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,558
Go away, Dave.

612
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:01,942
Hey, you owe me 300
bucks for the cigars.

613
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,997
- What's the matter?
- My mother's coming.

614
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,632
She just left.

615
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:09,367
Yes. Well, she decided
she wants to come

616
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,719
help with her granddaughter.

617
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,388
We'll all get along famously.

618
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,978
Yeah, we'll see.

619
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:20,028
How did she do?
She was an angel.

620
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,430
She didn't even cry
with the heel stick.

621
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,901
Oh. Now she's gonna
give her mother a hard time.

622
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,835
Well, if you don't feed
her, I think she will.

623
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,337
I think she's hungry.

624
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,140
Well, the nurse said she'd
walk me through breast-feeding.

625
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,031
I don't think Ella knows that.

626
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,946
I suppose I can wing it.

627
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,116
Here we go. Oh, yeah. Oh.

628
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,552
Here you go. Oh,
it's okay. It's okay.

629
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,488
Just try and keep the
head above the tummy.

630
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,790
There you go.

631
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,013
Mark.

632
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,061
I don't know
whether I can do this.

633
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,163
Yes, you can. It
just takes patience.

634
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,099
No, I mean... I mean...

635
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,101
I know. I know what you mean.

636
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,992
You're gonna be great.

637
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,836
Can I help you?

638
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,171
Looks like you got a leak. What?

639
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:23,542
Yeah. Here's your problem.
You must have run over a nail.

640
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:24,976
But it just started hissing.

641
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,645
Yeah, I can patch that for you.

642
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:28,213
Fifteen dollars. You did that.

643
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:30,348
Just because I saw it
doesn't mean I did it.

644
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:32,851
- You put that nail in the tire.
- What's the problem?

645
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,053
He popped the tire. He
thinks I don't know about cars

646
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:36,104
'cause I'm a woman.

647
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,973
You want me to
fix it? Ten bucks.

648
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,892
Now his price is going down.
Fix it before we call the cops.

649
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:41,893
Five bucks?

650
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:43,883
Negotiating with me now?

651
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,147
Mom?

652
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:50,975
Mom?

653
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,177
Mom.

654
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,546
What? What are you doing?

655
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,361
I'm hungry.

656
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,469
You're hungry? Yeah.

657
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:06,656
Okay. I'll go with
you. You all right?

658
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:09,042
Do you want something to eat?

659
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:12,790
No. What?

660
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:13,925
No. Here.

661
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:15,260
What's that? Egg salad.

662
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,795
It's disgusting. Not as
disgusting as Twinkies.

663
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:20,954
I don't want it. Uh,
and a veggie burrito.

664
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:25,870
You're getting a Slurpee.

665
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:28,106
And some Twinkies.
Anything else?

666
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,842
Yeah. A pack of
light cigarettes.

667
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,444
That's a nasty
habit. I know that.

668
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,914
You should take
better care of yourself.

669
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,082
$9.49.

670
00:32:57,326 --> 00:33:00,070
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

671
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:02,473
She was pretty close to traffic.

672
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,975
It's hard not to
overreact sometimes.

673
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,359
She seems better today.

674
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:10,977
She couldn't really be worse.
- All done.

675
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:14,919
All right. I'm gonna go
pay Paco his three bucks.

676
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:17,423
I'll bring the car around.

677
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:21,381
Coming.

678
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:27,461
You all set? Yeah.

679
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,067
How much longer to Chicago?

680
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,169
Two or three hours.

681
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,994
Abby, thank you for coming.

682
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,729
Good news. They haven't
given your room away.

683
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:43,031
Frank's calling a cab.
Right, Frank? Right.

684
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:46,300
Don't take any Coumadin tonight.
Take four milligrams tomorrow.

685
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,803
And I am going to
see you on Friday.

686
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,171
Thank you, Peter.

687
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,207
Ah, you're welcome.

688
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,375
I have to say I'm impressed
by your dispo skills.

689
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,045
I talked to his board and care.
They all refused to take him.

690
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,579
Oh, yeah? Well, I
promised to go by

691
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,215
and do his blood test.

692
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,582
Every other day? Mm-hm.

693
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,584
Since when does Peter
Benton give home care?

694
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,187
Yeah. Well, you know
what? I owe that guy.

695
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,556
He must have done something
for you to make house calls.

696
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,925
He was my junior high
science teacher. I did something.

697
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,895
I should have been expelled.
He gave me a month's detention.

698
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,030
Expelled? What did you
do? Blow the place up?

699
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,033
Almost. I had to prep the
experiments the night before.

700
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,535
And, just, you know, it changed
how I thought about things.

701
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,688
How I looked at school,
science, everything.

702
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:25,472
Did you ever tell him? No.

703
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,061
What was that for?
School, science, everything.

704
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:32,129
You did not. I did.

705
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,365
You did not. Why
would I make that up?

706
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,755
You got a perm?

707
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,053
Twice. Twice?

708
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,489
What?

709
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,041
It was junior high school.

710
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:44,575
That was the style.

711
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,744
I don't know what
planet you grew up on,

712
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:48,812
but I do not remember
perms on boys

713
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,014
ever being popular.

714
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:52,450
Yes, it was. Jenny
Butler liked it.

715
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:55,558
I'd like to see pictures of
it. I think I burned them all.

716
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,873
Twice.

717
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,242
So that means you thought
it looked good the first time.

718
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,712
As far as youthful
transgressions go,

719
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,914
I think it scores
pretty low on the scale.

720
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,483
If you say so.

721
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:11,552
<i>♪ I don't know what
I'm Diving into ♪</i>

722
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,887
<i>♪ Just hanging by a moment... ♪</i>

723
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,989
Is she still out?

724
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,013
Yeah.

725
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,694
Well, I think you'll be
all right by yourself.

726
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,184
I should be.

727
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:25,121
I really wanna thank
you again for doing this.

728
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,005
You didn't have to.

729
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,946
I'd never seen
Oklahoma before. No.

730
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,519
I mean it.

731
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,459
Well, I'll help you inside.

732
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:49,129
Okay, Mom. Uh, we're here.

733
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:51,697
Mom?

734
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,934
Wake up. We have to go inside.

735
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,071
Mom?

736
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,404
Mom? Mom?

737
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,794
John!

738
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,775
What? She's not waking up.

739
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:13,081
Maggie? Maggie, can you hear me?

740
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,549
Maggie! Ah-ah. Ah.

741
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,684
Pupils are dilated. How much?

742
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,870
About nine millimeters.
Did she take something?

743
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,139
Sit her up. Did you
see her take something?

744
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:22,423
She's tachy. Oh, God.

745
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,192
Pulse is 130. God.

746
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,562
Don't see any head
injury. She took something.

747
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,666
Where'd she get it from?
Call the paramedics.

748
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,484
What are you doing?

749
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,719
We can be there
before they can get here.

750
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:39,212
Shut that door. Keep her
chin up. Keep her airway open.

751
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,405
Chuny, pull an intubation kit,
get a vent, NG and charcoal.

752
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,739
What size ET?

753
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,474
Seven and a half. She's little.

754
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:00,111
They're here. Okay.
And get her a unit bed!

755
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,197
Turn her head if she
vomits. She's cyanotic.

756
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,199
What's her Glasgow?
Negative 15, 2-2-4.

757
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,433
Got her? Yeah. Go.

758
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,619
Not anymore. She's
completely unresponsive.

759
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,237
Get a mask going at 10 liters.

760
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:12,040
Breaths are shallow, but
I think her airway's clear.

761
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,608
CBC, Chem-20, blood
and urine tox screens.

762
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,632
BP, 90/60.

763
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,631
QRS complexes look wide.

764
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,299
Get a 12-lead. NG tube.

765
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,889
Hold on.

766
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,685
No gag reflex.

767
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,492
One of Pavulon, 90 of sux.
- Look at this.

768
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,729
What? Diphenhydramine,
25 milligrams.

769
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,181
How many are
missing? All of them.

770
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,434
Twelve to a sheet. Three sheets.

771
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,075
Twenty-five times 36.

772
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,806
- That's 900 milligrams.
- Stand by with bicarb.

773
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,980
Hurry up, Carter.

774
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,111
Give me some cricoid pressure.

775
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,746
Charcoal after intubation.

776
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,416
Abby, you wanna be in
here? QRS complex is 0.16.

777
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,508
- Push the bicarb.
- Okay, I'm in.

778
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,071
Abby?

779
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,126
I'm okay.

780
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,394
19-year-old male. Passed
out from shots of tequila.

781
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,263
Wasn't breathing.
How long was he down?

782
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,032
Long time. They
thought he was sleeping.

783
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,800
And the writing?
Frat brothers did it.

784
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,619
Were trying to clean him.
Peter splinted him yesterday.

785
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:17,922
I can't get a pulse.
Nothing from the neck either.

786
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:20,391
Peter, was this your
patient? He's in V-tach.

787
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:22,526
- Charge the paddles.
- What happened?

788
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,561
Too much to drink.
Charged to 200.

789
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:25,945
Clear. PICKMAN: Clear.

790
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,466
How much? Uh, they
were having a contest.

791
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,969
Is someone coming in?
- They're all drunk.

792
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:33,037
Still V-tach.

793
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,206
Charge again. Amp
of epi. Come on.

794
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,840
Clear. PICKMAN: Clear.

795
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:38,475
No change. 100 of lidocaine.

796
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,311
Charge to 360. I'll
shock him again.

797
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:42,079
That doesn't work,
get him on the gurney.

798
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:45,300
He's young. We can get him back.
- Here we go. Clear.

799
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:46,768
Deteriorated to V-fib.

800
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,569
Let's get somebody
from that fraternity.

801
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,874
Find out what the hell happened.

802
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,608
Got more bicarb. Put
an amp in the next liter.

803
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,643
Charcoal is in. I
need vent settings.

804
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,077
Tidal volume, 600.

805
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,763
AC of 12 on 100 percent.

806
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:00,998
Pressure's down
to 80 after two liters.

807
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:03,634
Start dopamine at 10 mics.

808
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:07,238
Antihistamine overdose can
give you myocardial pump failure.

809
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,996
Did she have
sleeping pills with her?

810
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,444
I need another
Iomed for the drip.

811
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:15,096
Where did she get
them? Call X-ray.

812
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,764
Tell 'em we need
a portable chest.

813
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,750
She's hyper-reflexic.
Is the tox screen back?

814
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,974
She's seizing. Watch the tube.

815
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,423
Pulse ox is dropping.
Check the O-2.

816
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,791
We're bagging at 100 percent.

817
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:28,793
Hold on. Hold on.
Her finger probe fell off.

818
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:30,595
Help me keep her head steady.

819
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,964
Help me keep her head steady.
- Hold on.

820
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:36,083
- Ativan's on board.
- Another four?

821
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,387
Give it a minute to work.

822
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,204
Still fib.

823
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:55,419
Pulse ox down to 72.

824
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:57,354
All right, um...

825
00:39:57,378 --> 00:39:59,858
Push another epi. Shock again.

826
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,298
His friend is here.

827
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,664
Not you again.

828
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:08,332
Adam's pledging
Upsilon Psi Lambda.

829
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:09,384
I'm his big brother.

830
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:10,918
How much did you make him drink?

831
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,387
He drank on his own.

832
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:15,173
How much did you make him
drink? 35 tequila shots, maybe 40.

833
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,007
Clear.

834
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:19,810
Asystole.

835
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,046
All right, a
milligram of atropine.

836
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,564
And set up the
pacing pads. Come on.

837
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,666
Blood alcohol is
0.529. Tox screen:

838
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,568
negative for marijuana,
cocaine, opiates.

839
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,103
Adam wouldn't touch drugs.

840
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,355
Ready to pace.
Rate of a hundred.

841
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:32,907
Aren't you gonna
shock him again?

842
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,575
You can't shock a flat line.

843
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,776
You only shocked him once.

844
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,478
We've been shocking
him for 40 minutes.

845
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,664
No capture, no pulse.

846
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:46,006
Time of death, 2023. Here.

847
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,790
But you gotta help him.

848
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,659
His heart's been deprived
of oxygen too long.

849
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,965
He's gone.

850
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,434
Here.

851
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,518
Clean him up.

852
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,653
What? You and your friends.

853
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,289
You wrote this on him, right?

854
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:07,346
Yeah. But... But
it was just a joke.

855
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:11,528
I hope you got a
good laugh out of it.

856
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,130
We didn't know this
was gonna happen.

857
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:16,400
You're his big brother. You're
supposed to look out for him.

858
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:18,702
He drank voluntary... Shh-shh.

859
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,038
Just shut up, all right?

860
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,582
You get over there,
and you clean him up.

861
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:32,816
Hey, Maggie? Maggie,
can you squeeze my hand?

862
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,285
She's not waking up.

863
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:35,886
CT said they can take you.

864
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,422
She's got a unit bed? 2102.

865
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:40,090
You wanna call
Psych? No, no. Not yet.

866
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:42,359
She should be on a
hold. They can't talk to her.

867
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:44,962
Pressure's holding. You
wanna finish the Dilantin?

868
00:41:44,986 --> 00:41:47,764
Yes. Have them check
her level in an hour.

869
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:50,734
I want her on a hold
when she wakes up.

870
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,391
She might not wake up.

871
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,057
Dr. Benton.

872
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:09,992
Dr. Benton.

873
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,089
Hey.

874
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,207
What are you doing here?

875
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,926
Is this a bad time?

876
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,328
No. I, uh...

877
00:42:17,352 --> 00:42:18,796
I just had to tell
a father in Iowa

878
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,881
that he lost his son.

879
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:21,716
So it is a bad time.

880
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,384
What can I do for you?

881
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,119
I wanted to let you know

882
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,604
I was accepted into med school.

883
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,106
Yeah, I know. I
know. Congratulations.

884
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,858
I wanna thank you for your help.

885
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,560
You deserved it.

886
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:33,928
It wouldn't have been an option

887
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,813
if you hadn't gone
out of your way.

888
00:42:35,837 --> 00:42:38,716
Look, uh, don't
thank me. Just...

889
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,202
Just work your
ass off, all right?

890
00:43:09,937 --> 00:43:11,603
They extubated her?

891
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,942
She woke up and
started fighting the vent.

892
00:43:18,246 --> 00:43:20,424
Her vitals are normal.

893
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:23,561
Did you get a hold?

894
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,420
Legaspi saw her.

895
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,405
I thought I was watching
her every second.

896
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,824
That's not possible.

897
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:38,514
I shoulda listened to you.

898
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:43,753
She'll be okay.

899
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,594
She'll never be okay.
