1
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,738
Very good.

2
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,573
My turn now? My turn?

3
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,975
Did he finish his breakfast?

4
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,777
No, but I got him to
eat some strawberries.

5
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,779
Ah, Cleo, he's supposed
to have hot cereal

6
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:20,981
before he gets treats.

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,717
These are just as
nutritious, if not more so.

8
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,536
And they're yummy too.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,455
At least tell the babysitter to
make sure he has a good lunch.

10
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:30,840
I cancelled the sitter.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,208
What?

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,544
I'm off today.

13
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,114
Cleo, Reece needs
a lot of attention.

14
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,304
Peter, I'm a pediatrician.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,285
All right.

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,292
Hey, see you, man.

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,642
Say, "See you at
the game, Daddy."

18
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,045
What? I didn't say I
was gonna play tonight.

19
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:54,931
You're not. You're going to
sit in the bleachers with Reece.

20
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,300
Come on. It'll be fun.
I'm playing first base.

21
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,868
Yeah, he doesn't
have a jacket here.

22
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,620
I'll go to Carla's
and pick one up.

23
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,922
No. You know what? I'll do it.

24
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:03,923
I can go.

25
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,847
I said I'd go.

26
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,610
I'm on the cell.

27
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,644
Okay.

28
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,753
Wanna play trains?

29
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,503
God, I slept so great.
And the dreams.

30
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:21,040
It's so wonderful to
be able to dream again.

31
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:24,244
Obviously, the therapy sessions
are helping, and these walks.

32
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:25,400
Good.

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,480
You know what?

34
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,182
You don't have to
stay home all the time.

35
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:31,017
I'm sure Luka would
love to see you.

36
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,987
It's only been a
couple of weeks.

37
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,689
He's a good man. Yeah.

38
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:37,857
So is your friend John.

39
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,259
Yeah.

40
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:41,160
Must be fun to have two
men interested in you.

41
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,428
Ma! Mom!

42
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,031
I've had men interested
in me all my life, you know.

43
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,901
Just not good ones.

44
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:49,903
Actually, I think your
father was the best

45
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,704
compared to all the rest.

46
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:52,972
But I certainly blew that.

47
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,163
Think we should head home?

48
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,178
Why is it we can't talk?

49
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,580
We're talking.

50
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:04,517
No. I mean about
important things.

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,887
You know, Dr. Legaspi
says it might be easier

52
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,939
for us to do it in
a therapy session.

53
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,275
Do what? Talk.

54
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,127
She wants you to come
to one of the sessions.

55
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:15,128
No. I don't think so.

56
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:16,896
I want you to come too. Please?

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,397
You could come
during lunch break.

58
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,599
I'm gonna head back.

59
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:20,600
Abby, will you come?

60
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,869
I'm gonna go to work.

61
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,527
Come on. Just... Just
think about it. All right?

62
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:37,306
Hi.

63
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,236
Hi.

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,105
Can I help you?

65
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,658
Uh, I was just
dropping something off.

66
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:47,549
For Kim? She's in the shower.

67
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,919
I can give her that if you want.

68
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:56,136
No, thanks. Uh,
I'll pass it on later.

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,637
You're welcome
to come in and wait.

70
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,672
No. That won't be
necessary. Thank you.

71
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,791
Give me your name. I
can tell her you stopped by.

72
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:55,061
Dr. Greene? Huh?

73
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,429
Yeah, sorry. Oh.

74
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:57,964
I need to get some lab slips.

75
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,654
Oh, sure. Sorry.

76
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:01,668
Baby keeping you up, huh?

77
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:02,736
Oh, not really.

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,504
She slept for six
hours last night,

79
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,739
10 minutes at a time.

80
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,241
How long we gotta wait here?

81
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,909
I've been in the
hall for five minutes.

82
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,310
I can't find a doc
to save my life.

83
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,579
What do you got?

84
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:14,881
Seven-year-old boy tried
to put out a fire in a can.

85
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,349
Thickness burns on both hands.

86
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,350
Need some help?

87
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:19,018
Sure. BP, 110/60.

88
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,520
Is that him? He sounds agitated.

89
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,555
You could say that.

90
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,656
Hey. I'm Dr. Mark Greene.

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,191
You wanna tell me your name? No!

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,192
It's Ben.

93
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:27,293
I want this out of my nose!

94
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,544
That's to help you breathe.

95
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,728
It's only for a little while.

96
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:30,796
Are you his mother?

97
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,365
Neighbor. He's a
friend of my son's.

98
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,133
No answer at the kid's house.

99
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,369
Good air entry.
Both lungs are clear.

100
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:37,988
Any way to contact the parents?

101
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,589
He just has a father.
I left a message.

102
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,590
I wanna go home!

103
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,908
Let's go. Get it out!

104
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:42,909
What do you see me in?

105
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,944
A Beemer or a Porsche?

106
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,413
Most of the time
I see you walking.

107
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,948
Okay. You can
forget about a ride.

108
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:52,118
Carter, buy or lease?

109
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:53,853
Dr. Dave behind the wheel, huh?

110
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,622
This is topaz-blue metallic.

111
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:56,723
What do you think?

112
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,324
I think it's out of
your price range.

113
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,427
I'm moonlighting at a
doc in the box, my friend.

114
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:02,395
Figure three months, I
got my down payment.

115
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:03,396
Ooh, then what happens?

116
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,064
Ah, fake my own death.

117
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,699
Hey, uh, you
playing ball tonight?

118
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,267
We'll kick Sanitation's ass.

119
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,268
Maybe.

120
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,970
Neck pain in Curtain
1 is asking for you.

121
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,872
I'll be right there.
Black or sand interior?

122
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,074
Malucci, I hope you're
not keeping patients waiting

123
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:16,275
while you shop for a car.

124
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,745
No, no, no. I'm all
over that board, chief.

125
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,047
Don't worry. He still has
to pass his driver's test.

126
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,516
Dr. Carter, can I
speak to you a minute?

127
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Sure.

128
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:28,938
Morning.

129
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,073
Morning, Dr. Chen.

130
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,380
Hey. Deb.

131
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:34,782
Could you excuse us a minute?

132
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,602
Oh, sure.

133
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,791
Your application was
intercepted by administration.

134
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,108
Processing time has improved.

135
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:50,298
You realize you're still
in a probationary period?

136
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,996
Which will be
completed by the time

137
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,464
the chief resident's
slot needs to be filled.

138
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,267
Why do you wanna do this?

139
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,403
Well, it gets me closer
to a junior faculty position.

140
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,871
Looks good on the CV.

141
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,241
No. I mean why risk
compromising your recovery

142
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,778
by taking on a new and
very demanding position?

143
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,463
I guess I don't
see it as a risk.

144
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,732
Having teaching and
administrative responsibilities

145
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:15,502
along with your clinical shifts?

146
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:17,604
I'm in the program. I've
been managing my stress.

147
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,306
I got myself back up to speed.

148
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,209
Carter, you'd all but give
up nights and weekends.

149
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,995
It's a tremendous
amount of work.

150
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,430
I'm ready for it.

151
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,466
We can't just gloss over
what happened last year.

152
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,935
Neither can the committee.

153
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,502
You're returning my application?

154
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,328
Did you honestly think
that you'd make the first cut?

155
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,193
Get your hands off me!

156
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,694
He's all yours.

157
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,095
Here. Let me take a closer look.

158
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,263
Don't touch me!

159
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,031
It'll feel better in a
second. I promise.

160
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:47,466
Mild erythema, no blistering.

161
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,801
It hurts! Stop!

162
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,269
Let the doctor finish. Okay?

163
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,371
You wanna tell me
what happened? No!

164
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:53,790
I think he lit the fire himself.

165
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:54,773
Shut up!

166
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,342
Why don't we get
a burn tray for Ben?

167
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:57,343
Sure.

168
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,845
He's home by himself a lot.

169
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,112
I said shut up!

170
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:03,037
I just wish he would stop
hanging around my son.

171
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,901
Hey. Good news.

172
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,803
Our second baseman
has the stomach flu.

173
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,539
Luka, I'm not playing softball.

174
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,940
Well, you don't
have to be great.

175
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,008
It's just for fun.

176
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,843
Actually, I happen
to play very well.

177
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,077
So go. It'll be good for you.

178
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,412
I can't.

179
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,704
One night away from your
mother isn't gonna do anything.

180
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,008
I miss you.

181
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,549
Have a good time tonight.

182
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,763
Conni, can you dispense
some ketoconazole to Exam 1?

183
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,898
Sure. Thanks.

184
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,200
Emergency ringworm, huh?

185
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,368
Yeah, pretty hard to avoid.

186
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:39,835
The guy has 40 cats.

187
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,299
You might wanna give him
a flea bath while you're at it.

188
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,377
So, what was going on
between you and Weaver?

189
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,312
Not much.

190
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,103
Except for her denying my
application for chief resident.

191
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,018
Apparently, I still have
a scarlet A on my chest.

192
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,776
Oh, wow. I'm really sorry, John.

193
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,407
Don't be. It makes
you a shoo-in.

194
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,475
There are other candidates.

195
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,511
Not really.

196
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,179
I guess congratulations
are in order.

197
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,847
Congratulations. You deserve it.

198
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,449
Thanks. Not as
much as me, but...

199
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,202
Yeah, right.

200
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,193
Hey. It's on the chair.

201
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,741
I put a cap in there too.

202
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,864
Good.

203
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,080
Just stay a while, and
have some coffee, maybe.

204
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,904
You know what?
I need to get back.

205
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,853
You all right?

206
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,210
Yeah.

207
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,585
Roger moved out a few days ago.

208
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,617
I'll be okay.

209
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:45,761
Are you sure?

210
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,942
It would have saved us
both a whole lot of trouble

211
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,344
if we had just stayed together.

212
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,868
You know, Peter?

213
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,442
Would have been
better for Reece, anyway.

214
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,150
He said he never loved me.

215
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,798
You know, Carla,
people say a lot of things

216
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,483
they don't mean
when they're fighting.

217
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,374
I don't know.

218
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:23,789
I think, uh, it's true.

219
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,764
Maybe we never had anything.

220
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,836
It'll work itself out.

221
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,819
You and I...

222
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,764
we had something.

223
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,314
Didn't we, Peter? Hm?

224
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,771
Hm?

225
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,056
Sometimes I think we still do.

226
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,309
I'm not doing this, Carla.

227
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,333
Peter, don't go.

228
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,281
Yeah?

229
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,882
<i>That's a nice hello.</i>

230
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,951
Cleo.

231
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,218
Did you make it to Carla's yet?

232
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,653
<i>A few minutes ago.</i>

233
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,489
<i>Good. Hey, how about picking
up deli on the way home?</i>

234
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,890
<i>We can have a
picnic on the field.</i>

235
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,626
Uh, sure. Yeah. Whatever.

236
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,160
You all right?

237
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,329
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

238
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,381
I don't know. You sound funny.

239
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,666
<i>Is she giving you a
hard time again?</i> Who?

240
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,051
Carla.

241
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,720
<i>You know, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a rush.</i>

242
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:28,721
Reece, wait!

243
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:30,673
<i>What's he doing?</i>

244
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,092
Hang on, Peter. Oh, my God!

245
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:34,760
Cleo, what happened?

246
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,262
Is there something wrong?

247
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,397
Read it and weep.

248
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,100
No bleeding, no
hydrocephalus, no midline shift,

249
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,853
no subarachnoid hemorrhage.

250
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,221
Okay. Do an LP.

251
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,789
You got a chronic
neck pain patient.

252
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,726
Wait. You want me to give a
Demerol junkie a spinal tap?

253
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,362
CTs are only 95
percent sensitive, Dave.

254
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,263
What are you two? A tag team?

255
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,998
I know what I'm doing.

256
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,768
Oh, to be a junior
resident again.

257
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,769
Not.

258
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,237
Dr. Chen, can I see you?

259
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,293
Sure.

260
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,940
Good luck.

261
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,063
Thanks.

262
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,963
As you know, Chief residency
is typically an extra year

263
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,699
completing the emergency
medicine program.

264
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,718
In rare cases, we
make an exception

265
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:19,722
and allow a senior to be
promoted into the position.

266
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,723
Right.

267
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,791
Unfortunately,
your maternity leave

268
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,729
put you three months behind
on shifts and procedures

269
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,282
keeping you just
shy of senior status.

270
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:32,568
But I'm in the process
of making that up.

271
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,571
Yes, but the academic
year ends June 30.

272
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,074
And I'm planning on
working every weekend

273
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,675
and every holiday until then.

274
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,445
Hospital policy actively
discourages work weeks

275
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,397
in excess of 60 hours.

276
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:47,049
And given that limitation,
it doesn't seem feasible

277
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,724
that you'd succeed in
making the deadline.

278
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,505
Oh.

279
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:53,973
And as a result,

280
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,475
I'm afraid you
won't be a candidate

281
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:56,779
for chief resident this year.

282
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,601
I'm sorry. I know it
doesn't seem fair.

283
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,939
Wait. This is completely
sexist and discriminatory!

284
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,274
Excuse me?

285
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,841
You all but offered
me this position

286
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:13,860
prior to my pregnancy.

287
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:14,961
Yes. And at that time

288
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,080
I anticipated your
completion of the program.

289
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,014
I had a baby.

290
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,502
I think I made a choice that
was both legal and responsible.

291
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:23,753
Of course you did.

292
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:24,987
I made a sacrifice,

293
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,089
largely for the
sake of my career

294
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,709
and becoming chief
resident is a huge part of that.

295
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:30,960
Jing-Mei.

296
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,127
I'm a good doctor.

297
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,729
I've offered to make
up for lost time.

298
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,164
And I didn't screw up.

299
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,822
Under the circumstances,
I think I deserve a chance.

300
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,353
I appreciate your thoughts.

301
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,105
And I'll take them
under advisement.

302
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,995
I'd hope you would.

303
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,246
What is that stuff?

304
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,148
Thermazine cream.

305
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,316
Make you feel better,

306
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,418
and it helps keep it
from getting infected.

307
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,920
My fingers feel funny.

308
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,921
How?

309
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,188
I can't feel the ends.

310
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,456
No?

311
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,258
Maybe with this hand.

312
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,426
Hey!

313
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,096
You know, that's not funny.

314
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,164
Everything okay in here?

315
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,235
Yeah. Little Ben here
just tried to grab me.

316
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,986
She was hurting my hand.

317
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,187
Oh, yeah? Let me take a look.

318
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,445
He says he can't
feel his fingers.

319
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,512
Here, let me see your hand.

320
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,145
What's wrong?

321
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,146
Ouch!

322
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,814
Oh, it hurts there,
huh? Did you fall?

323
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,250
I don't know. Maybe.

324
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,968
Let's get an x-ray of
this left hand just in case.

325
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,486
Ouch! Ow!

326
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,088
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,089
Settle down.

328
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,357
My head. Yeah.

329
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,310
Okay, let me take
a look at your head.

330
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,929
Okay. Do you remember
when you hurt your ear?

331
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,196
Huh?

332
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,671
You got a pretty
bad bruise back here.

333
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,588
Six-disk CD changer, tinted
windows. That's... Hello?

334
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,791
There's an ACL tear in Exam 2.

335
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:52,992
Yeah. I was on my way, chief.

336
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,761
Yeah? Dr. Malucci,
you're a resident.

337
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,079
You can't afford a car!

338
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,715
What was all that about?

339
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,618
Uh, misguided
sense of job security.

340
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,287
Lot of that going around.

341
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,621
I heard you came by the house.

342
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,223
Yeah, I was in the
area, and on a whim,

343
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,257
I thought I'd stop by.

344
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,691
Lori said that you had a letter,

345
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,195
but that you didn't leave it.

346
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,198
It just didn't seem like
the timing was very good.

347
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,742
I can see how you
would feel that way.

348
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,354
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

349
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,710
Not long.

350
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:26,692
I'm sorry. I know this
must be painful for you.

351
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,561
No, I'm fine. I mean, it's fine.

352
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:29,695
Okay.

353
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,598
Kerry?

354
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,765
You take care of yourself.

355
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,535
You too. Okay.

356
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,204
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

357
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:40,606
You didn't.

358
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,750
You two okay?

359
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,143
Oh, Dr. Legaspi.

360
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,178
Hi. Hi.

361
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:47,680
I was wondering
if you could tell me

362
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:48,981
how it's going with my mother.

363
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,148
Oh, I'm sorry, Abby.

364
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:52,051
I really can't discuss
her therapy with you.

365
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:53,986
Even if she said you
said I should attend

366
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,955
one of her sessions?

367
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,224
I think that it would be
mutually beneficial. Yeah.

368
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,248
Okay.

369
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:04,430
Could you give me a little
bit of an idea what to expect?

370
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:06,053
Well, it's not an ambush.

371
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,242
I'm sorry. It's just
that she lies a lot.

372
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,777
We meet at 1.

373
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19,133
You don't have to
come if you don't want to.

374
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,235
Still hurt? I'm sorry.

375
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,528
Oh, baby! Look at you.

376
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,611
Ugh, it's all right.
Your mommy's here.

377
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,745
How bad is it?

378
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,415
He's got a fracture
of the fifth metacarpal.

379
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,782
His hand is broken?

380
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,518
He's gonna have to
wear a cast 6-8 weeks.

381
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,852
How is he gonna sign?

382
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,521
He's not.

383
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,274
All right. It's okay.

384
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:49,975
Mommy's here.

385
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,811
I'm sorry. I just looked
away for a second,

386
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,979
and he was at the piano.

387
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:56,232
Listen, why don't you give
us a few minutes, okay?

388
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,821
Mm-hm. Of course.

389
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,240
Hey. This is your
fault, you know.

390
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,941
I am so sorry. Mm-hm.

391
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,409
Reece is not like
other children.

392
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,611
I know.

393
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,512
Then how come you
didn't stay in his eye line?

394
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,680
It was an accident, Carla.

395
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,948
I don't know what else to say.

396
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,917
I feel horrible about this.

397
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,120
I want you to stay
away from my son.

398
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,288
Carla, can we just...?

399
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,457
What would have happened
if you turned away again?

400
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,924
What would have
happened if Reece

401
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,593
had run out into the
street? He is deaf!

402
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,595
You cannot just call him!
You have to be with...!

403
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,929
All right, Carla.

404
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,798
I don't wanna see this bitch...

405
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,799
I said back off!

406
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,401
Anywhere near Reece again!

407
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,425
Go.

408
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,139
Hey. Hi.

409
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:56,775
Hit and run. ETA's five minutes.

410
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:03,437
Kind of like waiting for thunder
after the lightning strikes.

411
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:14,081
Dr. Legaspi and I...

412
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,185
It ended.

413
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,786
I'm sorry.

414
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,958
Something changed?

415
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,014
Yes.

416
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,686
Do you love her?

417
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,478
Then you should
go forward, not back.

418
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,901
Fifty-year-old male
changing a blowout

419
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,303
got sideswiped by a car.

420
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,604
LOC at the scene, but started
coming around in the rig.

421
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,206
Obvious femur fracture. Vitals?

422
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,541
Initially, 90 palp.

423
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:06,111
BP's up to 115/70
after 1500 cc's of saline.

424
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,996
Sir, can you tell us your name?

425
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,248
Jim Vogel. God! My legs!

426
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:10,349
Trauma 2. Go.

427
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,185
Serial crits, type
and cross times 4.

428
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,337
We got one more, doc.

429
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,504
She won't come out.

430
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,707
Restrained, but got a
forehead lac from the mirror.

431
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,210
Brother says she's
developmentally challenged.

432
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,545
What's her name?

433
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,546
Won't say. I'm not sure

434
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,880
she understands the question.

435
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,083
Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver. Can
you tell me who you are?

436
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,435
Jim's sister.

437
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,836
Okay.

438
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,888
We need to make sure
you're not seriously hurt.

439
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,473
Can you come out?
I wanna go again.

440
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:35,474
I'm sorry?

441
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:36,875
On a ride. It's fun.

442
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,099
She's been smiling like
this ever since I got her in.

443
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,653
Here we go.

444
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,283
Crepitations on the right,

445
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:45,985
with decreased air entry.

446
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:46,986
I need that chest tube.

447
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,287
Tachy at 110. I'll set it up.

448
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:49,738
God, I can't stand it.

449
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,739
What do you got so far?

450
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,723
Pneumo on the right,

451
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,409
unstable pelvis
fractured right hip.

452
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,910
Where's Bonnie? She all right?

453
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,128
Is that your sister's name?

454
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:58,247
Yeah. Another doctor's checking.

455
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,999
She appears to have
only minor injuries.

456
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:03,535
Mr. Vogel, does Bonnie
have any medical conditions

457
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,554
other than her
developmental delay?

458
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,723
No. She's always been healthy.

459
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,846
Okay.

460
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:27,993
Sorry I'm late.

461
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,127
It's fine.

462
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,650
We're glad you could join us.

463
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,524
Hi. Hi.

464
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,159
Please know that
we both understand

465
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,894
how awkward it can be

466
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,546
to step into someone
else's therapy.

467
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,719
It's okay. I'm fine.

468
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,701
Maggie, do you wanna continue?

469
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,570
Sure. Um...

470
00:19:55,594 --> 00:20:01,242
So, uh, Dr. Legaspi
and I were talking about...

471
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,528
Well, we talked about a lot.

472
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:06,649
But we were talking about
ways that I could stay healthy.

473
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,718
You know, how to position
myself to get it together,

474
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,388
keep on track. And, um...

475
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:19,183
part of that is that I've
decided to go home.

476
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,882
Have you talked to Eric?

477
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:25,284
No, not Florida.

478
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,909
Um, "home" home. I'm
going back to Minnesota.

479
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,599
Uh...

480
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:41,016
Uh... You haven't been to
Minneapolis in 15 years, Mom.

481
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,752
I know that. I know. I haven't.

482
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,655
But I grew up there. And
I feel like I belong there.

483
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,424
I've got a little bit of
family and some friends.

484
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,492
What friends?

485
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,527
Gina.

486
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,584
You remember Gina?

487
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,832
Well, I'm gonna stay with her.

488
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:57,833
She has a spare room.

489
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,317
She thinks she
could get me a job

490
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,337
in the convalescent
hospital where she works.

491
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:04,540
Really? When did
you arrange all this?

492
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,341
Last week. I...

493
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,243
She accepted a collect
phone call from me.

494
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,712
She was glad to
hear from me, Abby.

495
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:13,037
She was glad to talk to me.

496
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,236
Anyway, I... I'll... I'll
save enough money,

497
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,500
and I'll get a place of my own.

498
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,191
A place of your own?

499
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,860
Yes. A place of my own

500
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,895
with no roommates, no men.

501
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,064
Just me. Maybe a cat.

502
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,533
A cat? That would
be a great pet. Cat.

503
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,535
Abby, are you reacting
to your mother's plans?

504
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,937
I'm not reacting.

505
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,576
I'm just...

506
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,044
Just... Just what?

507
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,785
Nothing.

508
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,650
Abby, I can't stay
here in Chicago.

509
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,274
I don't wanna go to Florida.

510
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:55,090
It's just too easy for me
to be a drain on you and...

511
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,448
You know, I think we're
way past that at this point.

512
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:00,729
What is your objection to
your mother going home?

513
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,816
Nothing. It's very romantic.

514
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,939
You're not happy about it?

515
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:10,588
I don't know what...
What you want me to say.

516
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,441
Yippee, she's going home?

517
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,661
Fabulous, that solves
all the problems? What?

518
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,030
Then what is your solution?

519
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:19,531
I don't have a solution.

520
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:22,534
I... I don't... I don't
think there is a solution.

521
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,221
To talk about this as if it were
some life-management problem

522
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,041
that you can plan your
way out of, well, it's absurd.

523
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:31,293
Then what do you suggest?

524
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,317
I... I don't know.

525
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:41,970
Y... Uh, you know
what? I don't know.

526
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,339
I don't know. So I
guess you're right.

527
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,026
You have to do
something, Mom. Good luck.

528
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,811
So, what? You're leaving?

529
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,280
You wanted to tell
me. You told me.

530
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:52,948
Well, I'm not going
for a week or so.

531
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,806
Okay, great. See you later.

532
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,792
When did Ben
Fossen's father arrive?

533
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:08,102
A while ago. Someone
should have told me.

534
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,416
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

535
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,784
Derek Fossen.

536
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,452
Thanks for taking care of him.

537
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,521
Sure. Can we talk outside?

538
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:19,446
Yeah. We'll be
right outside, Ben.

539
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:24,229
Mrs. Shayatovich
told me about the fire.

540
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:25,297
Your neighbor?

541
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,499
Yeah. He's always
getting into trouble.

542
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:28,567
Yeah?

543
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:30,702
Yeah. His mom's
out of the picture.

544
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,504
And I think it
makes him act out.

545
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:34,039
Well, those burns will heal.

546
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:35,624
Good. Thanks.

547
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,426
I'm just waiting
on the psychiatrist

548
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,410
to come talk to Ben.

549
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,295
Psychiatrist? Why?

550
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,832
We found some unusual
bruising on your son, Mr. Fossen.

551
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,367
Do you know about that?

552
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:46,468
No.

553
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,704
You've never
noticed the bruises?

554
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,839
Well, he gets into
scrapes at school.

555
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,641
Fights? Yeah.

556
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,309
Any serious injuries?

557
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,311
No more than any kid.

558
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,746
Well, I'm sure he'll
tell that to the doctor.

559
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,615
Look, he doesn't
need a psychiatrist.

560
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,734
And I have to get
back to work. So...

561
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,198
I know. I know.
This won't take long.

562
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:15,389
We're supposed
to be at the park.

563
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:19,151
Is that where you were driving?

564
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:22,587
Two to 4:00 we go to the park.

565
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,211
But we had a crash.

566
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,515
I know.

567
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,201
My parents had a crash.

568
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:36,618
When's Jimmy coming back?

569
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,922
I don't know.

570
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:42,558
Did they die in the crash?

571
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,381
Your parents?

572
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,504
So, what do you do
in the park, Bonnie?

573
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
The slide.

574
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,587
Anything else?

575
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,857
The swing. You know,
Jimmy pushes me.

576
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,163
Not too high, though.

577
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,462
Do you have any other
brothers or sisters?

578
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:04,885
Nope.

579
00:25:07,023 --> 00:25:08,433
C-spine is clear.

580
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,668
No perihepatic fluid but
I can't see the spleen.

581
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,936
Where's Bonnie?

582
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,705
She's fine. She's
getting some sutures.

583
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:14,739
Oh, thank God.

584
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,141
Minimal blood in the Thora-Seal,

585
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:17,442
but his repeat crit is 34.

586
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:18,810
He's bleeding from somewhere.

587
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,412
Probably here. What's wrong?

588
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,613
You shattered your pelvis.

589
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:23,015
That'll heal though, right?

590
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,617
Yes. But the edge of the
bone may be cutting an artery.

591
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,020
We need a CAT scan to see
where the bleeding is coming from.

592
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:29,821
Lydia, call Radiology.

593
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:32,957
Tell them we need abdomen
and pelvis with contrast.

594
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:34,059
Will I need surgery?

595
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,227
We'll know after the scan.

596
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:36,594
I can't be laid up. My sister...

597
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,629
Yes, I know.

598
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:38,930
We'll try to stop the bleeding

599
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,433
by injecting a clotting
agent into the artery.

600
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,368
BP's down to 95/60.

601
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,237
Okay. Hang another two units.

602
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,305
And call for six type-specific.

603
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:50,509
Okay. We need to go now.

604
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:51,676
I'm gonna bring Carla home,

605
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,645
and then go by your
place and pick up his stuff.

606
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,480
Fine.

607
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:56,648
Listen, I told you.

608
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,216
Reece, he needs
special attention.

609
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,418
Peter, I know that.
I made a mistake.

610
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,053
All right.

611
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,221
You know, but you're acting

612
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:04,823
like I deliberately
let him get hurt.

613
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:06,591
I'm sorry about what happened.

614
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:07,993
Carla gets upset.

615
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:10,194
Well, I don't get called
a bitch by anyone.

616
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:11,230
Bonnie,

617
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:12,997
where are you supposed to be?

618
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:14,399
Finding my brother.

619
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:16,134
Okay.

620
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,036
Jing-Mei?

621
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,004
Bonnie, you're supposed
to stay in that room.

622
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:22,207
I have to tell my brother
what I want for dinner.

623
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:23,475
Why is he back?

624
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,344
He dropped his
pressure upstairs.

625
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,778
There he is. Jimmy!

626
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,146
BP's only 80 palp.

627
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,382
Hang another two
units on the infuser.

628
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:31,883
What did the scan show?

629
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:34,185
He crashed before we
even got him on the table.

630
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:35,254
Dr. Weaver?

631
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:36,855
Open a peritoneal lavage kit.

632
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:39,374
We'll go supra-umbilical.
Lydia, drop an NG.

633
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,842
My sister has special needs.

634
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,227
Let's worry about you right now.

635
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:43,228
HemoCue is ten.

636
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,713
Okay, we need central access.

637
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,648
Somebody get Dr. Chen!

638
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,066
There's no one else but me.

639
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,301
Okay, Jim. Dr. Chen,
put in subclavian.

640
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:51,319
Got it.

641
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,688
Pressure's down to 70.

642
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:54,489
Pulse ox dropped to 84.

643
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,692
Jim? Jim?

644
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,376
He's not breathing.
Give me a 9-0 tube.

645
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,711
Bag him on 100 percent.

646
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:01,184
Get in that line!

647
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,050
Luka, if the tap is positive,
he goes to the O.R.

648
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:07,919
If not, maybe we can
embolize the pelvic bleeders.

649
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:08,920
I'm in.

650
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:10,321
Squeeze in all
the blood you can.

651
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:11,423
Call for eight more units.

652
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:12,957
Well, the hand's okay.

653
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,192
Look at the wrist.

654
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,895
Is that a Colles' fracture?

655
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,563
Ben says he
never hurt his wrist.

656
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:20,331
Maybe he's too
young to remember it.

657
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:22,400
His dad doesn't
remember, either.

658
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:23,668
How did your talk go with him?

659
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:25,403
Well, he's a pretty hostile kid.

660
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,204
Clammed up when
Dad showed up though.

661
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,773
Yeah. It was
hard to talk to him.

662
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,775
His dad was standing
outside the whole time,

663
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,776
and Ben knew it.

664
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,944
He's terrified of him.

665
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:34,178
I think he is.

666
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:37,214
But, uh, he says there's
no violence in the home.

667
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,483
You saw that bruising.

668
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:40,184
That's him getting
pulled by his ear.

669
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,454
He says he doesn't
remember how it happened.

670
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,207
You don't forget a broken
bone or bruising like that.

671
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:46,208
Lost his pulse.

672
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:47,391
He'll never make it to Angio.

673
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,494
Pump in that blood.
Order two units of FFP.

674
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:50,528
He's in V-fib!

675
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:52,063
Starting compressions.

676
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,788
Okay, charge to 200. Clear.

677
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,052
V-fib.

678
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,053
Thoracotomy tray.

679
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,255
It's blunt trauma.

680
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,924
It's an isolated
pelvic injury. Clear.

681
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,644
Lydia, close the
blinds to Suture.

682
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:06,645
Still in fib.

683
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,837
Three-sixty. Clear.

684
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,937
I'm starving.

685
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,239
We could pick something
up from Doc Magoo's.

686
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,475
You know, if I were smart,
I would have gone to lunch

687
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:24,179
instead of getting reamed
by my mother and Legaspi.

688
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,614
I don't get it. A week ago
she wanted her committed.

689
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,483
And now she's
completely on her side.

690
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:29,650
It's not about sides.

691
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,286
Well, it felt like it was.

692
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,753
All of a sudden it
was all about me.

693
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,123
What was my problem
that I couldn't get onboard

694
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,559
with this plan she figured out?

695
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,961
Would any plan have
made you happy?

696
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,396
No.

697
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,232
When was the last time
your mom was in therapy?

698
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,334
I don't know. Like 10 years ago.

699
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,668
That's different.

700
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,770
Yeah. So you got a choice.

701
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,058
You can either hope that she
makes it this time or give up.

702
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:54,192
Right.

703
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:56,127
Doesn't seem like
you wanna do that.

704
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,485
I don't know what I wanna do.

705
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,166
Weaver dropped a
bomb this morning.

706
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,167
What happened?

707
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,869
She bagged me
for chief resident.

708
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:05,737
Really?

709
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:08,406
Apparently my rehab
has caught up to me.

710
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,009
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

711
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,410
It's not your fault.

712
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,162
Not exactly.

713
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,197
I guess part of
facing the problem

714
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,661
is accepting some
people won't get over it.

715
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,891
I'm sorry, John.

716
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,926
Me too.

717
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,149
For you.

718
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:29,760
Get a 10-pack of platelets.

719
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:30,778
Heart's not filling.

720
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,146
Units 9 and 10 are in.

721
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,180
Hold compressions.

722
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,181
Still in fib.

723
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,767
Vasopressin? Onboard.

724
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,270
Another 100 of lido. I'll
take the internal paddles.

725
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:39,337
How long has he been down?

726
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,338
35 minutes.

727
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,574
Charge to 20. Jimmy?

728
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:44,443
Bonnie, you have to go outside.

729
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,445
Clear.

730
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:47,946
I don't like that.

731
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,180
Charge again.

732
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,181
Lydia?

733
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,783
I don't want you to do that.

734
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:52,918
We're trying to help him.

735
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:54,970
But it hurts him. Clear.

736
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,426
It hurts him.

737
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,310
Charge again.

738
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,245
Clear!

739
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:07,015
Heart's empty. Asystole.

740
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,319
Should we try pacing him?

741
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,638
Okay. That's it.

742
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:17,375
Time of death 17:10.

743
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,543
Can you close the chest up?

744
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,744
Yeah.

745
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:23,214
Clean him up but leave
the tubes in for the coroner.

746
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,004
I'll tell the sister.

747
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,909
Want me to come with you?

748
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:35,933
Yeah.

749
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,020
I'm tired of it here.

750
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,557
I think Jimmy and
me should go home.

751
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,592
The doctors are going
to talk to you now.

752
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,361
Hi, Bonnie. Hi.

753
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:57,065
Bonnie, this is your
brother's doctor.

754
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,350
Is he ready to go?

755
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:00,985
Bonnie, Jim was very hurt.

756
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:03,410
And he couldn't
recover from his injuries.

757
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,381
Cover? Get better.

758
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,468
Your brother died,
Bonnie. I'm sorry.

759
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,034
Do you understand?

760
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:17,335
Like Ernie.

761
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,470
He died.

762
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:21,289
Um, who's Ernie?

763
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,224
My hamster.

764
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,598
We put him in a box.

765
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,929
Okay.

766
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:31,182
Well, like your hamster, Jim
won't be with you anymore.

767
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:34,157
I got a new hamster.
His name is Ernie too.

768
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,473
You know how your
parents went away?

769
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,830
In the crash?

770
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,450
Jimmy went away like that too.

771
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:49,334
But it's library night.

772
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,236
I know.

773
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,538
And I get scared at night.

774
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:57,697
Bonnie, you're gonna
have to be very brave.

775
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,034
Where's Jimmy?

776
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,068
There you are.

777
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,069
Hi.

778
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,670
Do you have a minute?

779
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,173
Sure. Am I in
trouble or something?

780
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,575
I don't usually do this.
But I think it's important.

781
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,844
Okay.

782
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:18,013
I think you need to give
your mom one more chance.

783
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,348
Didn't I just do that today?

784
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,651
Well, you started to.
And then you ran away.

785
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:24,953
Maybe because I've heard
it about 100 times before.

786
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,320
I think this time's different.

787
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,189
Do you? Why?

788
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:31,025
Well, she hasn't been willing
to go to therapy for 10 years.

789
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,193
Now she's embracing it.

790
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:35,163
I'd love to believe
that meant something.

791
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,448
Don't let your mom go away

792
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:38,249
without being able
to really talk to you.

793
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:39,951
That won't make
either of you happy.

794
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:42,253
I don't think "happy"
is on the table.

795
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:43,254
Why not?

796
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,029
Look, I'm not in therapy.

797
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,116
Fair enough.

798
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:51,751
But I'll consider it.

799
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:55,383
What you said.

800
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,907
Okay.

801
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,505
She has the mind
of a 7-year-old.

802
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:01,506
And no other relatives?

803
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,408
Her brother was her only family.

804
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:06,277
I've tried ARC, Protection,
and Advocacy. No luck.

805
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:07,562
The facilities are all full.

806
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,281
She'll have to take a temp
place at a group home.

807
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:12,183
No. I don't want her
sent to a place like that.

808
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,985
There's four or five
people in every room.

809
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:16,220
Unless you take her
home, this is all I can offer.

810
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,973
Okay. But I don't wanna
hear about her sleeping

811
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,659
on the couch or on the floor.

812
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:21,826
Well, I'll pass that along.

813
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,494
You'll have to get
her there yourself.

814
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:24,629
They're too backed up.

815
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:25,630
Oh, come on!

816
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:27,198
I'm just the messenger.

817
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:28,600
Look, in time she'll adjust.

818
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:29,834
Adele, this stinks.

819
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:31,502
They have got
job-training programs.

820
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,137
Hopefully she'll learn a skill.

821
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:35,640
Adele, ready? Yeah.

822
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:37,080
Sorry.

823
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:44,149
It's about time.

824
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:46,017
Ben has not eaten since noon.

825
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,084
We'll get him something.

826
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,269
We'd rather just go.

827
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,271
This is Adele Neuman.
She's a social worker.

828
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,256
Hi. Hi, Ben. Hi.

829
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,443
Look, my kid does not need
any more counseling or whatever.

830
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,612
I'm afraid Ben's gonna
have to stay for a few days.

831
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:58,613
What?

832
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,532
We're taking him into custody.

833
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:02,667
What are you talking
about? What for?

834
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,368
I'm not comfortable
with the bruising.

835
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:06,637
God forbid you're
not comfortable.

836
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,923
I also found evidence
of a broken wrist

837
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,324
which neither of you mentioned.

838
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,026
I told you that he fights!

839
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,561
Would you tell
them? I fight a lot.

840
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,214
If that's true, then you'll
get to go home in three days.

841
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:17,615
But now I need you
to come with me.

842
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,616
I don't want to.

843
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,685
Whoa! You're not
doing this to us!

844
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:21,709
Security!

845
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:24,555
Get your hands off of me!

846
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,624
You don't have a choice here.

847
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,359
If you think I hurt
my kid, you're crazy.

848
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,111
I suggest you contact a lawyer.

849
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,563
To sue your ass!

850
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:32,614
For your protection.

851
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:33,615
I don't wanna go away!

852
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,016
Please let me stay with him!

853
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,017
I'm sorry.

854
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,119
Leave him alone!
No! Dad! Please!

855
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:39,120
You bastard!

856
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,655
Please! Dad!

857
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,740
Why are you doing this?

858
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:43,329
Dad!

859
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,730
Hi. Hi.

860
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,766
Guess what? The super
finally fixed the stove fan.

861
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,101
So I cooked dinner.

862
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,672
Cucumber soup, a little salmon.

863
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,240
Why don't you
invite Luka to dinner?

864
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,458
He's playing softball.

865
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:03,078
That sounds like fun.
Are you gonna go?

866
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,502
I don't wanna play. Um...

867
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,186
The reason why I ran out today

868
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,190
like that is because
it's just, um...

869
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:18,147
It's scary to hope
too much, you know?

870
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,168
Yeah, I know.

871
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,833
I know I might not make it.

872
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,935
But, Abby,

873
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:31,505
something happened
to me in that ICU room.

874
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:35,031
I realized I don't wanna die.

875
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,363
And more than that,

876
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,164
I don't want my little
girl to watch me die.

877
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:43,651
I can't do that
to you. Not ever.

878
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,876
That's what I wanted
to tell you today.

879
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,724
I'm gonna handle my life.

880
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,433
And I want you to
get on with yours.

881
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:58,938
Okay.

882
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:03,054
You can't put your
life on hold anymore.

883
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,255
It's not on hold.

884
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:06,690
You won't play softball
with your boyfriend.

885
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:07,958
So? I don't wanna play.

886
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:10,495
Stop sitting things out, Abby.

887
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,530
I don't.

888
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:13,998
Yes, you do.

889
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:15,666
You can't use me as the reason

890
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,902
for not doing the
things you wanna do.

891
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:18,936
Go to medical school.

892
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,138
That's not so easy.

893
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:21,406
Get married. I was married!

894
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,696
Get pregnant. I was pregnant!

895
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,267
What happened?

896
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,670
What happened?

897
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,479
I had an abortion.

898
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,420
Some people aren't
meant to be mothers.

899
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,171
Abby...

900
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:55,440
I was a lot younger
than you are now

901
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,509
when I had my
first manic episode.

902
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:00,578
I've watched you since
you were a little girl.

903
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:01,946
You're not bipolar.

904
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,781
No. But my kids could be.

905
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,584
But they might not be.
They could be anything.

906
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:09,576
And you will just
love them. That's all.

907
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:16,827
You never even
told Richard, did you?

908
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:18,429
No, I...

909
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,199
I think that was the
beginning of the end for us

910
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:24,124
because we just stopped
talking about everything.

911
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:27,560
I just was too scared.

912
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,809
I cou... I couldn't risk it.

913
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:36,914
I just... I didn't want to...

914
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:39,417
Turn into me? Yeah.

915
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:42,375
Or have to end up
taking care of another me?

916
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:45,623
Oh, honey.

917
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:49,093
Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.

918
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:51,129
That's all there is is risk.

919
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:55,121
You just have to take a
chance and leap into life.

920
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:57,502
Otherwise, sweetheart,

921
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,477
you're gonna miss out
on all the great things.

922
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,179
Abby, you deserve
all the great things.

923
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,317
Do you hear me?

924
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,968
But I like my home.

925
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:16,404
Someone there will
take good care of you.

926
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,572
This man's gonna
drive you, okay?

927
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,874
Jimmy was gonna
make me hot dogs.

928
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,676
Take this woman to this address.

929
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,612
Make sure she's met by
an adult before you leave.

930
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,181
Yeah, all right.

931
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,916
Will they have hot
dogs? I don't know.

932
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,485
But I'm sure they'll
have something good.

933
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,486
Here you go.

934
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,588
I had better go to my home.

935
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,623
I'm sorry. You can't.

936
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,345
But I like my home. I like
my bed and my blanket.

937
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:43,436
Bonnie, you can't live alone.

938
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,018
But I need my blanket.

939
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:49,086
Jimmy always
gives me my blanket.

940
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,022
Someone there will give you one.

941
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:53,446
And he gives me
hot dogs when I want.

942
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,961
I like my home. I
don't want a new one.

943
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,335
Bonnie...

944
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,803
Zip your jacket,
sweetie. It's chilly.

945
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,797
Hey, batter, batter.
No batter. No batter.

946
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,612
Strike one!

947
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:32,597
That's good, right?

948
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,598
That's good.

949
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,982
Put it right here, doc.

950
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,339
You got it, big guy.

951
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,653
That's strike two.

952
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,397
That's all right.

953
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,743
Luka, look alive, man.

954
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:48,535
Hey, batter, batter.
No batter. No batter.

955
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,003
You change your mind?

956
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,671
Yeah. I even
brought my own glove.

957
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,624
Hey, Abby. You playing? Yeah.

958
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,126
Pick your weapon because
you're up after Carter.

959
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,762
All right. Keep your
head in the game.

960
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:06,264
You brought your mom?

961
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:07,348
Go get 'em, John.

962
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,384
Thank you, Maggie.

963
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,652
All right, Carter.
Get in there, man.

964
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,403
Luka, I didn't know
you played softball.

965
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,572
I don't. I'm last in
the batting order.

966
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:16,807
You should put Abby up.

967
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,909
She was an all-star on
her Little League team.

968
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:19,910
How about you?

969
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,214
I'm just gonna watch.

970
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,681
All-star?

971
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,516
I like you in that hat.

972
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,685
I almost look American, huh?

973
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:28,709
Almost.

974
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,861
Some vocabulary
for a 7-year-old.

975
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:37,995
Bone survey turned up

976
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,798
bilateral healed spiral
fractures of the radius.

977
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:41,799
So you were right.

978
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:43,322
Pin a rose on me.

979
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,604
Kim?

980
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:47,872
Hi, Kerry.

981
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:50,374
Um, this is for you.

982
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:51,675
What is it?

983
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,245
It's how I feel about
things, about you.

984
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:56,647
And I never really told you.

985
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,616
And maybe it doesn't matter now.

986
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,573
But I wanted you to know.

987
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:03,809
Okay.

988
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,497
You broke both your arms, Ben.

989
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:14,198
No, they're fine.

990
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,199
These are your x-rays.

991
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:19,787
These lines are fractures.

992
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,889
That was a long time ago.

993
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,374
I tripped at school.

994
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,166
No. You don't get these
kinds of breaks from falling.

995
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,603
After I tripped, I
fell down the stairs.

996
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,816
No, Ben.

997
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,451
You know what I think happened?

998
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:38,455
I think somebody grabbed
your arm with two hands

999
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:42,181
and then twisted it like
you do with a wet towel.

1000
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,468
I'm bad a lot.

1001
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:48,454
You are?

1002
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,838
I make too much noise playing.

1003
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:56,007
I leave messes.

1004
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:58,591
And your Dad punishes you?

1005
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,893
Well, how does he punish you?

1006
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,536
Sometimes like you said.

1007
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,872
He calls them Indian burns.

1008
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,108
Yeah?

1009
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,142
It's my fault.

1010
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,377
He wouldn't do
it if I wasn't bad.

1011
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,601
No, Ben.

1012
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,916
Nobody should break your arm

1013
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,734
no matter how bad you are.

1014
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,469
You understand?

1015
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:29,106
I don't care. I just
wanna go home.

1016
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,243
You can't go home
right now, Ben.

1017
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:34,600
I'm sorry.

1018
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,888
Come on, Malik! Show
'em where you live!

1019
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:44,255
Run, Abby! Run, Abby!

1020
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:45,256
Get in there.

1021
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,707
Abby, go! Abby!

1022
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,809
Woo! Way to go!

1023
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,877
Brought your
cheering section, I see.

1024
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,514
That's my girl! That's great!

1025
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:54,637
Go get 'em.

1026
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,717
All right, Luka.

1027
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:00,276
Just meet the ball like
we talked about, all right?

1028
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:01,922
Hey.

1029
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,690
Strike one!

1030
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,576
You were so great.
You were great.

1031
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,711
Did you hear me cheering?

1032
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:10,803
Yes. I think everybody
heard you cheering.

1033
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:12,816
Strike two.

1034
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,952
Luka, don't crowd the plate!

1035
00:43:14,976 --> 00:43:16,037
What?

1036
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:18,744
The plate! Get back!

1037
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,142
He's very cute but
he's no Mickey Mantle.

1038
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,494
No.

1039
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,950
Ball one.

1040
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,014
Are you cold?

1041
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,149
No, no. I love it.

1042
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,751
Thank you for bringing me here.

1043
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,319
You looked like
you were having fun.

1044
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,055
I was.

1045
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,879
That's good. That's really good.

1046
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,061
Foul ball.

1047
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,713
That's a foul ball.
That's a foul ball!

1048
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:43,714
That's a foul ball.

1049
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:45,016
Where are you going?

1050
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,401
I don't think he knows that.

1051
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,270
Run, Luka! Run!

1052
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,328
Luka!
