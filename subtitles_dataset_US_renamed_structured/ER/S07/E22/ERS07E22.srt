1
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,593
Shh.

2
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,907
How'd she do?

3
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,709
Up from 3:30 to 6.

4
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,412
Then she watched her feet at 7.

5
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,414
Lie down. Take a nap. Okay?

6
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,086
Are you leaving? Yeah.

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,288
Please don't go.

8
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,829
I have to.

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,151
I want you to stay.

10
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,641
So do I.

11
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,456
Can't you call in sick?

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,581
I wish I could. Just do it.

13
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,372
Mwah.

14
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,163
I'll leave the van.

15
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,841
What was that?

16
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,526
It's 8:00. They're demolishing

17
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,111
the old textile
building on State.

18
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,634
That'll wake you up.

19
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,691
Exactly our problem.

20
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,027
They blow up a manufacturing
plant to build a mall.

21
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,661
What's wrong with a mall?

22
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:00,864
Fifty cents.

23
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,165
All we do is buy and sell.

24
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,234
We don't produce nothing.

25
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,269
See? What do you do?

26
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,504
What? For a living?

27
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,006
I'm a doctor.

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,208
Okay. Bad example.

29
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,375
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,476
You're building the mall.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Not for long.

32
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,754
Mark Ainsley, 12 years old.

33
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,056
GSW through the upper left arm.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,157
Neuro-circ still intact?

35
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,725
Complains of pain
and paresthesia.

36
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:29,726
Can you squeeze my hand?

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,894
It hurts. What happened?

38
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,595
Open fire in a
foster-care facility.

39
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,331
Foster care? Twelve down.

40
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,332
Can you feel this?

41
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,333
A little.

42
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,634
Think about a vascular study.

43
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,635
Got it.

44
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,142
Mark! Mark! Take that one. Go!

45
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,073
It's still in me. It hurts.

46
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,558
We're gonna help you out.

47
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,659
Entrance wound only.

48
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,360
Palpable in the
sub-Q. Got this, Dave?

49
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:50,262
As long as there's no
compartment syndrome.

50
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,297
I can't breathe.

51
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,531
Slow your breathing down.

52
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:55,034
Maria Fredrikkson, with
significant blood loss.

53
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:58,037
BP, 90/palp. Tachy at 120.

54
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,371
Any belly pain, ma'am?

55
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:00,673
No. My leg is cold.

56
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:01,941
Foot pulses are diminished.

57
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,944
Did they get him? Who?

58
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,278
The man with the gun.

59
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,530
I don't know. Did you see him?

60
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,297
We were hiding in a closet.

61
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,534
But he just shot
through the door.

62
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,569
Foot is pale.
Poor capillary refill.

63
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,070
Trauma 1, coming through!

64
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,171
Who's on for Trauma?

65
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,840
We're bringing everybody in!

66
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,708
Two more of saline,
order pre-op labs.

67
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,176
Doesn't she have
an ischemic leg?

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,477
Get through to Surgery first!

69
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,713
We have an
8-year-old girl in arrest.

70
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:24,714
Where was she hit?

71
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,716
Shot in the head. Intubated.

72
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,418
Bradyed down to 30,
then lost her pulse.

73
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,519
Pupils fixed and dilated.

74
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,887
P.E.A. Let's get her epi.

75
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,122
You just get here?
Nice way to start.

76
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,191
Well, I was gonna call in sick.

77
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,611
Dr. Weaver, gluteal
gunshot wound.

78
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,079
He needs a cystourethrogram.

79
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,548
Try a rigid sigmoidoscopy.

80
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,615
He should see a surgeon.

81
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,817
Yeah, get in line.
Where's Benton?

82
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,018
Charge to 60.

83
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,053
You getting a rhythm?

84
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,477
Degenerated into V-fib. Clear.

85
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,926
Another 120. Looks
like brain-stem failure.

86
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,196
Weaver, 104's on the
radio with the last one.

87
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,630
GSW to the chest.

88
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,065
Is he hypotensive? No change.

89
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,333
120 again. No.

90
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,418
Fine. Bring him in.

91
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,953
Is it the same gunman?

92
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:55,404
Yeah. He shot the
gardener on his way out.

93
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,428
Clear.

94
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,858
Surprised he had
any bullets left.

95
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,227
Push another .3 of epi.

96
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,495
Want to try mannitol?

97
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,596
Couldn't hurt. 30 grams.

98
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,064
Do you need an angiogram?

99
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:08,218
No, I don't think
so. No bruit or thrill.

100
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,052
Is that Helen?

101
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,138
Who? Helen. She's new.

102
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,561
Foster-mom bailed on her.

103
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:17,209
Uh, I don't know.

104
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,228
Clear!

105
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,896
Expanding hematoma.

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,432
No pulse deficit. They
catch the guy yet?

107
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,317
No. Dispatch doesn't
know anything.

108
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,869
He was mad at Mrs. Buckley.

109
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,120
What's that?

110
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,855
He was waving the
gun at Mrs. Buckley,

111
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,006
yelling, then shot her.

112
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,474
Did we get a Mrs. Buckley?

113
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,508
DOA.

114
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,709
Gram of cefazolin,

115
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,944
follow with neuro exam.

116
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,647
We've also got a GSW
to the lateral malleolus

117
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,882
in Exam 2 still waiting. Yep.

118
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,451
Portable x-ray and
a Doppler scope.

119
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,686
Make sure the bullet
didn't damage the bone.

120
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,322
Go ahead. I got this.

121
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,224
Let's get an AP lateral
to the left humerus.

122
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,825
Hey. Did you turn
it in? What's that?

123
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,728
Weaver said my
application was incomplete.

124
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:52,895
Missing my peer reference.

125
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,647
Right, yeah. I'll do that today.

126
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:55,849
It's due today.

127
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,268
Yeah. I'll do it. Okay, thanks.

128
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,236
I need you! Femoral
artery's pumping blood.

129
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,988
I can't control it
without my finger in.

130
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,055
Then get me surgeons.

131
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,574
I got three unstable patients

132
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,941
and a fourth coming in.

133
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,165
Anspaugh's gonna
take this one. I'll be back.

134
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:09,963
Dr. Weaver? Yeah.

135
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,364
Officer Napolitano.

136
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,566
I need someone to pull
out a bullet for the crime lab.

137
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,868
Which patient? Calf wound.

138
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,936
He's stable. We'll
get to him soon.

139
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,037
As long as we get evidence.

140
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:19,039
Just find the shooter.

141
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:20,273
We'll get him.

142
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,641
I was in the bathroom.

143
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,076
I heard a loud explosion.

144
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,544
It scared me for a second.

145
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:28,681
But then I remembered that they
were tearing down that building.

146
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:30,884
But then I heard all
this screaming, and...

147
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:33,586
BP, 132/78. Pulse, 96.

148
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,888
He was out front in the bushes.

149
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,090
Took us a while to find
him. We were inside.

150
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,224
Kerry, what happened?

151
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,260
Lunatic shot at a
foster-care facility.

152
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:41,527
Why? Who knows? Go.

153
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:42,896
Curtain 3. Go!

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,297
You were right to stay.

155
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,499
I should have gone to
help, done something.

156
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,067
No. You did the right thing.

157
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,085
I'll be right back.

158
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,653
Can I get a cigarette?

159
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,721
I need a cigarette.

160
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,024
Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

161
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,693
Kerry, I've got a
hypotensive social worker.

162
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,862
Probably just stress, but
you should check it out.

163
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,206
Okay. Thanks. Hello.

164
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,183
Mm-hm.

165
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:05,218
I read your letter.

166
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,919
Good. I was wondering.

167
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,738
Dr. Legaspi, Dr. Romano,
line three, for you.

168
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,141
Tell him I'll call him back.

169
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,309
She'll call you right back.

170
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,029
Anyway, um, I
appreciate the sentiment.

171
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,197
I'll give her the message.

172
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,298
"Sentiment"? Yeah.

173
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,584
He says for you to
get on the line now.

174
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,319
He needs to talk to
you about a transfer.

175
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,221
Frank, she's busy.
He should be too.

176
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,990
We could have as many
as eight GSWs going.

177
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,491
Nine. Carjack victim.

178
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,126
Okay. We're swamped with this.

179
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,694
Tell them to divert to Mercy.

180
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,345
Mercy said no ETAs 9 to 10.

181
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,347
Why do they bother calling?

182
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,916
Um, anyway, thank you,

183
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,693
um, but I don't think
that anything's changed.

184
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:45,992
Right. Okay.

185
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,099
Okay. I should get back.

186
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:49,868
Yeah.

187
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,349
Chuny, grab Cleo.

188
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,435
The kid she's with
isn't gonna make it.

189
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,886
Clear.

190
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,889
Asystole.

191
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,156
How long has she been down?

192
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,292
At least an hour
since the shooting.

193
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,962
Dr. Finch, can you take a
carjack victim rolling up?

194
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,070
Go ahead. This is a fatal wound.

195
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:10,950
What is it?

196
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:12,685
GSW to the abdomen.

197
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:15,577
Someone should have told
me that today was gun day.

198
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,114
Time of death, 9:12.

199
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,321
This the carjacking?

200
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,488
Yeah. Mr. Jeffries.

201
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,091
GSW to the left lateral abdomen.

202
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,359
You need to be careful.

203
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,860
He has AIDS.

204
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,229
How's his pressure?

205
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,597
140/82.

206
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,998
Okay, good. That's good.

207
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,266
What do you got?

208
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,967
Entrance wound
below the costal margin

209
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,187
and the anterior
axillary line. No exit.

210
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,072
Mr. Jeffries is HIV-positive.

211
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,773
I was getting out of the car.

212
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,341
He shot me anyway.

213
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,760
Frank, what's open? Nothing.

214
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,761
I got a GSW.

215
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,030
Don't make you special today.

216
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,115
Mark called in. Trauma 1.

217
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,383
That's fine. Let's go.

218
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,185
Let's set him up. Get
him a portable chest.

219
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,449
Hey! Roger?

220
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,923
Stay away from my wife! What?

221
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,024
You stay away from my wife!

222
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,792
She told me... She
told me everything.

223
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,661
You had your chance.
She's my wife now.

224
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:12,762
I don't know what you're...

225
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,430
I'll take care of
Carla. You stay away.

226
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,431
Frank, call Security!

227
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,883
Get him outta here!

228
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,117
Stay away!

229
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,621
I haven't touched
her! I'll kick your ass!

230
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:24,140
Nothing happened.

231
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,541
Chuny, get a trauma panel.

232
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,926
Type and cross for four.

233
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,927
He really nailed you.

234
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,295
Shut up and mind your business!

235
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,696
Is this the carjacking? Yes.

236
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,231
Sir, I'm sorry about that.

237
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:35,167
Sir? Sir, I'm
Officer Napolitano.

238
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,987
You told the officer your
assailant was Caucasian?

239
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,239
Yeah, that's right.

240
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,707
Did he wear a
yellow windbreaker?

241
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:43,543
Uh, yeah, you know.
How did you know that?

242
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,144
I think he might have
shot some people

243
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,546
at a foster-care facility.

244
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,136
Same guy? And... three.

245
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,635
Can you remember
your license plate?

246
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,670
No.

247
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,704
Pressure's down to 90.

248
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,339
Two liters saline, wide open.

249
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,557
But it's a black Acura
Legend, correct?

250
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,260
Ahh. What's wrong?

251
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:02,545
You'll have to do this
later. Check with DMV.

252
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,297
You might be bleeding
in your abdomen.

253
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,531
How do you know for sure?

254
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:06,983
Let's get an ultrasound in here.

255
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,735
It's a black Acura Legend?

256
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,186
What? Yeah.

257
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,622
We have to put a tube in
your chest to help you breathe.

258
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,161
Prep the chest.

259
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,162
You okay from here?

260
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,963
Got it. Lidocaine.

261
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,465
Pulse ox is 98.

262
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,601
You almost missed
your deadline. What?

263
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,739
I was eating breakfast
and saw your med school

264
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,575
reinstatement form
on your counter.

265
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,559
What did you do?

266
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,694
Ten blade.

267
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,694
You were lucky.

268
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,096
Lady in the registrar's office

269
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,498
has a daughter who is a nurse.

270
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:39,798
The registrar's office?

271
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,784
I told her you had a
bunch of night shifts,

272
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,953
and she slipped it
in with the others.

273
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,488
32 French. Wait.

274
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,956
You, uh... You handed it in?

275
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,491
Yeah. This morning.

276
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,360
Luka, why'd you do
that? It was due Monday.

277
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,695
I didn't want to turn it in.

278
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,729
I thought you forgot.

279
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,593
No. I changed my mind. Why?

280
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,651
Now they'll come after
me for summer tuition.

281
00:10:58,675 --> 00:10:59,952
I can help you with the money.

282
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:00,953
I don't want help.

283
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,521
I just wanted to let it go.

284
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,323
Then why did you fill it out?

285
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:05,613
I'll get you some Xeroform.

286
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,680
Lesion by the shoulder.
The bullet passed mid-shaft.

287
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,981
This is much more proximal.

288
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,982
Mm. Look at the lateral.

289
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,050
It's in front of the bone.

290
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,351
Could be soft-tissue sarcoma.

291
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,503
Get a biopsy.

292
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,504
Is your kid stable?

293
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,039
Yeah. I just have to do an FNA.

294
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:21,673
Clear the room.
Next round coming in.

295
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:22,841
Two more gunshot wounds.

296
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:23,909
One chest, one neck.

297
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,211
Two more? It's not even 10:00.

298
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,212
It's the same guy again.

299
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:27,446
What?

300
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,082
CPD tracked a carjacked
Acura to a private residence.

301
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,917
Found a mother
and son shot inside.

302
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,985
Did they get the shooter?

303
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,720
Not yet. Do we have the ORs?

304
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:35,854
Cleaning two now.

305
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:37,023
Peter still needs to go up.

306
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,057
That leaves one.

307
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,758
And Anspaugh should
be finishing soon.

308
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,960
Psych nurses aren't trained
to handle ostomy care.

309
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,263
If they need ostomy care, he
can check his own damn bag.

310
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,864
We need you. Two
more GSWs rolling up.

311
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:46,865
In a minute.

312
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,267
Abby, let's go outside.

313
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,086
And when I call you,
you get on the phone!

314
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,121
She was helping with
the mass casualty.

315
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,256
We needed her down here.

316
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,057
I needed to clear
Recovery for the barrage

317
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,709
of gunshot wounds
you keep accepting!

318
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,511
I'm not taking responsibility

319
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:00,513
for post-op complications
in the psych ward!

320
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,180
Well, then we'll have
to find somebody

321
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:03,849
who's interested
in responsibility.

322
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,150
What is that supposed to mean?

323
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:06,418
DeRaad can finish your shift.

324
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,375
What? Nice knowing you.

325
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,674
GSW through the right
lateral neck. Airway's clear.

326
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,577
What's his pressure? 110/70.

327
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,745
Hi. What's your name?

328
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,746
Ted.

329
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,481
Ted, can you swallow for me?

330
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,765
Where's my mom?

331
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:20,783
Is all this his?

332
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:21,851
Dr. Greene?

333
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,352
No. His mom was
wrapped around him.

334
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,371
The bullet went through
her and hit his neck.

335
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,706
Mommy! Dr. Greene.

336
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,940
Get Dr. Weaver to scope him.

337
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,575
He may need an esophagram.

338
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,261
We're gonna take
you inside. Okay, Ted?

339
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,295
I think this is the lady

340
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,898
that brought in your
abused kid last week.

341
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,234
Simple gunshot wound
to the back. BP, 128/74.

342
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,436
Mrs. Shayatovich.

343
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,521
Where's Ted? Where's Ted?

344
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:43,556
He's gonna be okay.

345
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,757
There's a doctor with him.

346
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:47,343
Please, help him.
He was bleeding.

347
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,728
His neck was bleeding.

348
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,546
Who shot you, Mrs. Shayatovich?

349
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,916
Derek. I told the policeman
it was Derek Fossen.

350
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,818
Your neighbor. He
was looking for Ben.

351
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,986
I told him I didn't
know where he was.

352
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,690
He said if I was gonna
take his boy away from him,

353
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,275
he was gonna take mine from me.

354
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:05,495
Please, please help
him. He was bleeding.

355
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,696
We're gonna take care of him.

356
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,748
Let's get a HemoCue
and a pulse ox.

357
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:10,238
Roll her, roll her, roll her!

358
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,770
Oh, God! That looks
like about two liters.

359
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,389
May be an
aorta-esophageal fistula.

360
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,907
She's out. Okay, bag her.

361
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,226
I'll intubate her inside.

362
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,985
Get a thoracotomy tray
and all the O-negative we got.

363
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,485
Fossen. Derek
Fossen. F-O-S-S-E-N.

364
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,653
Looks like it was contained

365
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,255
until it blew through
the esophagus.

366
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,238
Do you have an address?

367
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:34,841
He lives next door to her.

368
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,175
Can't get a pressure.

369
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,476
Squeeze in two units of O-neg.

370
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,728
I'm in.

371
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,363
We put his son into
protective custody.

372
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,614
His name is Ben.

373
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,850
He should be somewhere
in the foster-care system.

374
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:45,868
Lost the pulse.

375
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,320
All right. Rib spreader.

376
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:50,156
Find the son. That's
who he's looking for.

377
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,357
Abby, get the infuser.

378
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,176
Pressure's up to
120 after two liters.

379
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,078
Do you need this? No.

380
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,114
Liver and spleen are intact.

381
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,882
So maybe I'm not bleeding.

382
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,952
No. You've got a slow
leak from a small vessel.

383
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,120
You're gonna need surgery.

384
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,922
I don't want surgery.

385
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,523
Look, we'll make
a midline incision,

386
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,458
find the bleeding
artery and then tie it off.

387
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,511
Doc, I'm already dying.

388
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:13,312
Your infection might
slow your recovery,

389
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,247
but it's routine surgery.

390
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,832
People live with HIV.

391
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,185
I know that. I've been fighting
this disease since 1986.

392
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,920
I responded to the AZT,

393
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,523
and the protease
inhibitors were a miracle.

394
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,726
They gave me
an extra five years.

395
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,496
But my T cells have
been dropping since July.

396
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,298
My viral load's gone
through the roof,

397
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,234
even with all these antivirals.

398
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:38,726
Mr. Jeffries, I, uh...
I need your consent.

399
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,524
No.

400
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,793
I had pneumocystis
three months ago.

401
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,778
If we don't operate, you'll die.

402
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,031
I am already dead, doc.

403
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,223
This may just allow me
to skip a very painful end.

404
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,807
Another Satinsky.

405
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:58,874
Unit number eight is up.

406
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,676
Heart's not filling.
Clamp the aorta.

407
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,078
Greene, the injury
is high and posterior.

408
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,680
Just trying to bring
you more light.

409
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,848
Oh, that'll help.

410
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,450
Can't you get your
finger in the hole?

411
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,518
If I could see it. More light.

412
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,919
Just call for FFP and platelets.

413
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,988
Forget it, forget it. I
can't close this defect.

414
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,523
Another amp of epi.

415
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,560
She'll go out of thoracic aorta
and exsanguinate in seconds.

416
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,627
Let's try bypass.

417
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,932
It's too late for that. Call it.

418
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,534
Time of death, 11:40.

419
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,118
0 for 2 and it's not even lunch.

420
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,178
We pull the sample
out with a needle.

421
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,880
And then we look
under a microscope.

422
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,181
You think it's cancer?

423
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,883
No, it could be scar
tissue. It could be a cyst.

424
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,769
Cancer's only one possibility.

425
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:45,972
My mom died of cancer.

426
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:47,390
How old was she?

427
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,325
35. I'm 12.

428
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,694
Okay, well, let's
see the biopsy first.

429
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,597
That way we can talk
about what we know,

430
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,815
as opposed to
what we don't know.

431
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,800
Do you have anybody
that you'd like me to call?

432
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,969
I'm in foster care.

433
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,453
Yeah, I know. Foster parents?

434
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,372
No. I'm between homes.

435
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,396
Right.

436
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,079
She make it? No.

437
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,680
Scary. This guy's on a rampage.

438
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,781
They didn't catch him yet?

439
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,782
I don't know.

440
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,185
They're gonna go to his house.

441
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,975
So much violence, huh?

442
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,359
Were you gonna tell me?

443
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,360
Tell you what?

444
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,361
I heard a rumor.

445
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,862
Oh, yeah? A good one?

446
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:30,032
Dr. Rosen called.

447
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,035
You know, from the emergency
department at Northwestern.

448
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,036
You took the message?

449
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Yeah, he wanted to
set up an appointment.

450
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:38,974
Just looking at options.

451
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,876
Are you leaving?

452
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,078
I still have to make up three
months of my residency.

453
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,547
Well, after that?

454
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,314
I don't know.

455
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,484
I'm not even being
considered for Chief Resident.

456
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,304
I have to write this damn
peer review for Chen.

457
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,874
They're not even talking to
me about an Attending position.

458
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,141
Read the writing on the wall.

459
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:58,494
You talked to Weaver
about an Attending position?

460
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,779
No. Why not?

461
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:01,847
Because if she wanted me,

462
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,249
she would have
asked me about it.

463
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,150
Maybe she doesn't
think you're interested.

464
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,457
Maybe I'm not.

465
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,772
Carter, is your
cirrhosis patient

466
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:10,906
ready to go to the floor?

467
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,842
No. I have to do a
paracentesis first.

468
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,777
We need the bed. Got it.

469
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,412
What's the chest tube
output on the gardener?

470
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,872
300 cc's. He's third
in line for a tele.

471
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,120
You still angry at me?

472
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,121
I wasn't angry.

473
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,322
You seemed angry.

474
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,224
It's my fault. I should
have ripped it up.

475
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,993
I thought you wanted
to go back to school.

476
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,928
Maybe I do. Just not now.

477
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,830
What happened? Nothing.

478
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,566
You don't wanna be
a doctor anymore?

479
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,734
I don't know.

480
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,103
You don't know? I don't know.

481
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,171
It's $40,000 in tuition.

482
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,473
It's lost wages.

483
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,475
It's another six years
of me killing myself.

484
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,711
Then it's over, and you'll
be doing what you want.

485
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,312
Maybe I'm doing
what I want right now.

486
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,915
If that were true, you
would have never started.

487
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,217
Maybe I realized being
a nurse is good enough.

488
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,886
Is it not good enough for you?

489
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,843
No, no. It's fine.

490
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,727
Okay. You did great, Ted.

491
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,696
The bullet went through
a muscle in your neck.

492
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,365
But you're gonna be okay.

493
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,266
Can I see my mom now?

494
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,402
Uh, let me find out.

495
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,004
Do you know your
dad's work number?

496
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,005
No.

497
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,439
Okay. Do you know
where he works?

498
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,440
Abysco.

499
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,476
Abysco? Is that a company?

500
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,576
He makes binders.

501
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,777
He makes binders. All right.

502
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,513
You wanna draw some more?

503
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,537
Yeah. I'll be right back.

504
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:36,074
The mom didn't make it?

505
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,844
The proximal aorta was shredded.

506
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,446
I have to track down his father.

507
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,014
What do you wanna tell the boy?

508
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,382
I'll stall.

509
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,966
Dr. Greene?

510
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:49,910
This him?

511
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,259
Yeah. He has a record?

512
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:54,760
One arrest. Domestic dispute.

513
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,028
He hit his girlfriend.

514
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,980
He wasn't at his house?

515
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,015
I'll let you know when
we have him in custody.

516
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,066
What about his son?

517
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,335
We tracked down
the foster parents.

518
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,887
A patrol car's
picking him up now.

519
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,922
I think he's coming here. What?

520
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,423
Well, he was pissed
at the neighbor

521
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,591
for bringing him to the ER.

522
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,211
I mean, you took his
kid away from him, right?

523
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,595
Right.

524
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,779
Thanks, Frank.

525
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:16,787
I'll send in some extra units.

526
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,535
Mark, he couldn't come here.

527
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,537
He knows there's
too many cops around.

528
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,907
He hasn't displayed a lot
of sound judgment so far.

529
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,208
What is he shooting with?

530
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,610
Semiautomatic
pistol, 13-round clip.

531
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,778
He's been reloading.

532
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,713
Probably picked it up
at Kmart on the way.

533
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,016
It's not the guns.
People kill people.

534
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,884
Yeah, right. Only not as fast.

535
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,485
He would have
found another weapon.

536
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,221
Fourteen shots so far, Frank.

537
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,522
Six deaths.

538
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,890
You can't affect mass murder

539
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,926
with a Chinese throwing star.

540
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,860
Rescue 78 coming
in with an injured cop.

541
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,230
Motorist dragged
him for half a block.

542
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,299
See? There you go.
He hit him with a car.

543
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,900
That's assault with
a deadly weapon.

544
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,852
Frank, shut up! Shut up!

545
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,154
Free air under the diaphragm.

546
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:57,956
Must have nicked the bowel too.

547
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,224
His crit's down to 23.

548
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,893
I can't dilute him much further.

549
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,962
I checked his viral
load. It's over 50,000.

550
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,765
He'll die of an opportunistic
infection within a year.

551
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,269
Well, that doesn't mean we
should help him commit suicide.

552
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,954
He didn't shoot himself.

553
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,088
If we let him refuse
surgery, it's the same thing.

554
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,374
Get a court order then.

555
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:17,376
He'll be dead by the
time it's approved.

556
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,682
Then it's his choice.

557
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,931
All right.

558
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,800
I went over there.

559
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,652
She was upset. She was crying.

560
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:28,853
She came on to me.

561
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:30,455
I didn't do anything.

562
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,974
I didn't want to do anything.

563
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,976
Maybe she felt guilty
and she told Roger,

564
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,394
and she put a spin on it.

565
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:36,679
You wouldn't put a spin on it.

566
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,530
No. Then why didn't you tell me?

567
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:39,598
To avoid this. What?

568
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:41,066
You looking at
me like I did wrong.

569
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,803
I see. You didn't trust me,
and I'm supposed to trust you.

570
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,572
I didn't think it was
worth getting into.

571
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,274
Good. At least I
know where I stand.

572
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,042
Cleo, that's not what I
meant, and you know it.

573
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,661
Peter, his pressure's dropping.

574
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,812
Go.

575
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,465
Run in another liter of saline.

576
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,667
Any chest pain or dizziness? No.

577
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,335
Let's get two units
from the blood bank

578
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,154
and transfuse each over an hour.

579
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,307
No, no, no. I don't
want a blood transfusion.

580
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,710
Your hematocrit is
drifting dangerously low.

581
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,544
I understand.

582
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,002
No. Thank you.

583
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:14,933
What about your family?

584
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:18,921
I mean, if you don't care about
yourself, what about them?

585
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,541
I haven't spoken to my
mother in over 30 years.

586
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:25,644
I outlived the two people
that I loved in the world.

587
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:29,565
I've lived longer
than I expected.

588
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,116
Just let me go.

589
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,541
I'm ready.

590
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,190
Hi. Hi.

591
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:55,541
How are you feeling?

592
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,209
My neck hurts.

593
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,978
I'll ask one of the nurses to
come give you some medicine.

594
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:02,214
Can I see my mom?

595
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,900
Not yet. I'm trying
to reach your dad.

596
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,885
Can I stay with
her until you do?

597
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,304
I don't think so.

598
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,039
She's having an
operation right now.

599
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,575
Is she okay?

600
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,176
We're having a little trouble

601
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,980
trying to get the bleeding
stopped around her heart.

602
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,532
She was hurt bad.

603
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,039
I know.

604
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,454
You hungry? No.

605
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,006
Where's all this blood from?

606
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,007
Tore off part of his ear.

607
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,275
Give him more pain medicine.

608
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,028
Titrate 10 of morphine. Sir,
did you lose consciousness?

609
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,096
I don't think so.

610
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,197
You got him, Luka? Yeah.

611
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,598
Trauma panel, portable chest...

612
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,966
Get a good look? Not really.

613
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,034
Yellow windbreaker?

614
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,020
Yeah, Colby said he
saw blood on the collar.

615
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:43,122
Fossen did this? Just a minute.

616
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:44,756
Colby asked him to step out.

617
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,226
When he opened the door, the
guy smashed our unit and took off.

618
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,095
Colby's jacket must
have got snagged.

619
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,913
He was screaming.
He got dragged forever.

620
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,014
But he didn't stop.

621
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,017
Where did he get the
car? Probably boosted it.

622
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,385
Jeep Grand Cherokee, first
three license numbers G74?

623
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,370
That's all I got.

624
00:22:58,394 --> 00:22:59,838
Maybe G79? You got him?

625
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,240
Shots at 823 Piedmont.

626
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:03,041
Jeep Grand Cherokee
parked at the corner.

627
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,827
License number G79-6L5.

628
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,596
Woman found down
inside. Oh, God. Here we go.

629
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,883
- Easy, easy. Is she dead?
- Called the paramedics.

630
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,684
We're all overworked, Robert.

631
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,452
You can't insinuate
you'll fire someone

632
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,988
every time you get frustrated.

633
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:17,522
I'm not. She's fired. Robert.

634
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:20,125
Cleaning out her locker
now. You can't do that.

635
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,594
I just did. This is
a county facility.

636
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,829
Employees cannot
be summarily fired.

637
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,665
Dr. Legaspi was already on
probation for that other matter.

638
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,134
And she was exonerated.

639
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,636
She's had a history of
violation of institutional policy.

640
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,838
Like what? What do you care?

641
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,640
She's a good doctor.

642
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,943
A good doctor who has
had 30 delinquent charts

643
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,444
awaiting discharge summaries.

644
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:40,678
And so does half the staff.

645
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:42,447
She used the
telephone watts line

646
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,349
for personal calls.
You gotta be kidding.

647
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,551
She yelled at a patient
in a public setting.

648
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,220
You're trying to
find a way to fire her.

649
00:23:48,244 --> 00:23:50,188
Plenty of documentation
has been reviewed

650
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:51,589
by the disciplinary committee.

651
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:52,891
Dr. Weaver. Give me a minute.

652
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,326
Adele's been shot. What?

653
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,194
Adele. That maniac
shot her at her house.

654
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:57,463
The social worker?

655
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:00,165
Chest x-ray, T and L spine.

656
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,567
Let's set up an ultrasound.

657
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:03,368
Can you feel this? Yeah.

658
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,354
Miss, did you get a look
at the man who shot you?

659
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,456
Yeah, he... He looked familiar.

660
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,274
He said something about his son.

661
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,810
We put his son Ben into
protective custody last week.

662
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,612
Oh, my God.

663
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:15,180
Okay. Adele, can you feel this?

664
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,348
No.

665
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,817
Cord injury, 1.8
grams Solu-Medrol

666
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,486
over 15 minutes.

667
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,719
Hi, Adele. Hi.

668
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,156
She was shot mid-back.
She can't move her legs.

669
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,375
Was it a white male, late
30s, yellow windbreaker?

670
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,743
Uh, yeah. I... I think so.

671
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,745
Any pain in the belly?

672
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,880
BP, 92/65. Pulse, 110.

673
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,782
Adele, any pain in
your belly? Not really.

674
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,250
Could be a pneumothorax.

675
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,252
Lungs sound
good. Pulse ox is 99.

676
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,754
For an intra-abdominal bleed?

677
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,222
There's spinal shock.

678
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,724
How did he know
where I lived? What?

679
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,894
How did he know where I lived?
I only saw him at the hospital.

680
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,180
They can find anything
on the Internet. What?

681
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:51,233
Get someone over
to my house. What?

682
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,185
Send someone over
to my house now.

683
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,242
1211 Dupont Drive.

684
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,320
She's hypotensive. Dopamine?

685
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,344
Start her on five mics.

686
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,629
Come on, Elizabeth. Pick up.

687
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:19,066
Pick up.

688
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,515
Does this feel sharp? - Yes.

689
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:26,151
What's her crit? Working on it.

690
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,470
How about here? Yes.

691
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,872
Do you have voice mail
or a machine? Machine.

692
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,758
Would she hear a
message? I don't know.

693
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,226
How about here?

694
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,727
No.

695
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,663
Were you already home
or was he waiting for you?

696
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:39,831
He came in.

697
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:42,067
I was sitting at my
desk doing my bills.

698
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,570
Patellar reflexes are absent.

699
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:47,239
No one's answering the door.
You want 'em to search the house?

700
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:48,907
Yeah. They'd
have to force entry.

701
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:50,275
Search the house.

702
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,043
942, go ahead.

703
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,012
Still hypotensive.
Up her to 10 mics.

704
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,852
She needs volume.
I'm not in yet.

705
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,290
Adele, can you bend your knee?

706
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,292
I can't. I can't move
it. Look, I don't care.

707
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,961
We may have an
emergency laminectomy.

708
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,462
Fine. Check. Go.

709
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,383
Doc, they'll call it in
when they have it secured.

710
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,550
Am I paralyzed?

711
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,970
Hopefully, it's only temporary.

712
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,471
That's it. Give me a new kit.

713
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,273
Check for sacral sparing.

714
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:22,941
Come on, now. Now.

715
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:25,243
Set up the microscope.
We're coming up.

716
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:26,862
Maybe she went
out, went to the store.

717
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,163
Did you page her? What?

718
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,698
Did you page her? No.

719
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,167
I need you to page Dr. Corday.

720
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,202
I don't... I know
that. Page her.

721
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,204
Mr. Jeffries.

722
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:53,589
Mr. Jeffries.

723
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,557
What's his HemoCue?
Down to five.

724
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,292
Barely responds
to painful stimuli.

725
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,477
Hang two units of blood.

726
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,728
He doesn't want that.

727
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,197
Where's the consent
form? On the cart.

728
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,898
You can't take him
without consent.

729
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,734
Well, he's unable
to give consent now.

730
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,435
I just need two
physicians' signatures

731
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,536
for emergency surgery.

732
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,804
No.

733
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,857
You'd have him die?
I'll respect his wishes.

734
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,926
Good, Adele.

735
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,028
The spinal injury is
incomplete. We can operate.

736
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,880
I need an emergency
signature. Not now.

737
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:38,683
- IJ's in. Get another chest.
- He's bleeding out.

738
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,552
Run the Solu-Medrol.
325 an hour.

739
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,688
Gunshot wound
to the belly. He's...

740
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,672
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever. Whatever. Go.

741
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,016
Systolic's up to 100.

742
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,144
All right. Let's get him up.

743
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,546
Can you get a repeat CBC?

744
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,349
Whatever you want, Peter.
I've got my two signatures.

745
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,818
He made himself clear.
Look, he has advanced AIDS.

746
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,387
He probably has an
HIV encephalopathy.

747
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,523
No. He was alert and oriented.

748
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,025
You should have called Psych.

749
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,544
I did. They never showed up.

750
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:08,079
Laura called. They're
still... Ow! Damn it.

751
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,049
Oh, God. I'm sorry. Hold
on. Did you cut yourself?

752
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:13,985
I don't think so. The
glove just tore there.

753
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:15,486
Peter. Hold on. Hold on.

754
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,472
Let me get some
gauze pads. Come on.

755
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,075
Let me see it, all right?

756
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:39,077
Oh, God. BENTON:
Keep irrigating it.

757
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:41,446
- Where are the Zerowets?
- Bottom drawer.

758
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,031
Pharmacy? Yeah,
this is Dr. Benton.

759
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,367
I need you to pull
a PEP kit for me.

760
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,502
All right. And use two liters.

761
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,205
What? No, no, no, no. Look,
I'm on my way up there right now.

762
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,596
What about the patient?
Keep transfusing him.

763
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,965
Talk to Neuro? They're
doing a craniotomy.

764
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,133
Watch it, Peter.

765
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,085
I need help with a
thoracic decompression.

766
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,088
Adele, there's a piece of bone
in your 9th vertebrae, mid-back,

767
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,857
that's pressing on
your spinal cord.

768
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,559
That's why I can't move my legs?

769
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,361
Yes. But if they remove the
fragment, you may recover.

770
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,529
Doc, no one's at your house.
We did thorough sweep.

771
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,232
Check my garage?
Yeah, yeah. Nothing.

772
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,533
Call me if you find
her. Will I be paralyzed?

773
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,987
Not if I can help it. I
still need to talk to you.

774
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,288
Drop it, Kerry. It's over.

775
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:24,923
Is my van still there? What?

776
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,325
The garage. Was my
van there? Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,627
But you have two cars,
right? Hers is in the shop.

778
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:30,929
Does she take the baby out?

779
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:33,765
She's been going for
walks, usually around 3.

780
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:34,833
It's 1:05.

781
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,334
It depends on the
baby's schedule.

782
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,736
Can you keep a unit there
until she gets home? Yeah.

783
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,105
Nick. Yeah.

784
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:42,707
Nick, listen. WOMAN:<i>
Shot in the head.</i>

785
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,309
<i>The guy was riding
in the back seat.</i>

786
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,844
Cab driver on Roosevelt.

787
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,645
<i>Roger that, 27.
Rescue's en route.</i>

788
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,514
Okay, that'll be us.
Can you give it to Luka?

789
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,016
I have to go upstairs.

790
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,618
Think it's him?
Yeah, that's him.

791
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,720
Dr. Greene, I can't
reach this boy's father.

792
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,322
I think he's
figuring it out. Who?

793
00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:59,958
The neck wound. His mother
died. You need to talk to him.

794
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:01,793
I'll be right there.

795
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:04,062
Carter, we got a GSW
to the head coming in.

796
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:06,564
I want you to prep Trauma 1.

797
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:09,634
Get some, uh, Dilantin,
mannitol and, uh, Decadron.

798
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:11,469
ETA? Check with dispatch.

799
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,038
Ewing seems pretty aggressive.

800
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,539
We'll need a chest
and abdominal CT

801
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,174
to rule out metastatic disease.

802
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:17,675
You sure? It's a
soft-tissue mass.

803
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:19,711
Extra-osseous Ewing. It's rare.

804
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,113
You might wanna write it up.

805
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,982
Thank you. Want me
to talk to the parents?

806
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,672
He doesn't have any parents.

807
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,222
Where is she? Where's my mom?

808
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,162
Where's this operation?

809
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:36,695
The bullet...

810
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,917
Uh...

811
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:42,100
She was shot in the back.

812
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:45,036
The bullet passed
through her heart.

813
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,454
She lost so much blood

814
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:49,279
that her heart stopped beating.

815
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,927
We opened up her chest

816
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,901
for an emergency surgery.

817
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,454
Gave her blood transfusions.

818
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,676
Best surgeon in
the hospital did it.

819
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,663
She wasn't in any pain.

820
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:14,065
She didn't suffer.

821
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:16,790
We worked on
her for a long time.

822
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:24,758
We couldn't stop the bleeding.

823
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,317
And we couldn't get
her heart to beat again.

824
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,389
Ted, your mother died.

825
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,850
I'm sorry.

826
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,115
Here. You need
to take these now.

827
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,984
Shouldn't we draw
baseline labs first?

828
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,853
No. Now. The sooner the better.

829
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,522
Peter, two units are in. I can't
get his pressure above 80.

830
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,857
All right. Hold on. He's
already drug-resistant.

831
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,727
You don't have a large
viral load. He does.

832
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,111
Cleo, listen to me.

833
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:03,114
The conversion rate with
meds is less than 3 in 1000.

834
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,599
Crit is 14.

835
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,143
If he's going, he has to go now.

836
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,287
Okay?

837
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,772
All right. Get
another two units.

838
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,473
I'll meet you at the elevator.

839
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,875
See if Infectious Disease needs

840
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,332
to modify the
post-exposure regimen.

841
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm surprised my
code still works.

842
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:44,889
It's not gonna happen, Kim.

843
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:46,023
What isn't?

844
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,827
Th-they can't let
you go, not legally.

845
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:51,095
No. They always
intended to fire me.

846
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,497
They would have done it sooner,

847
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:55,199
but they needed a nice,
thick human-resource file first.

848
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,752
Which is completely bogus.
They'll never get away with it.

849
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:00,388
They already have.
Only if you let them.

850
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,756
It's not worth the effort.

851
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,524
I'm not interested
in working for a place

852
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,676
that doesn't want me here.

853
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,144
You have the right
to due process.

854
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,513
We... We can find
a-a civil-rights attorney.

855
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:09,719
We?

856
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,271
It's not right, Kim.

857
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:19,039
You know why they're firing you.

858
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,408
You have to fight it.

859
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,010
You have to fight this.

860
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,912
I'm supposed to fight?

861
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,765
You're hiding, but
I'm supposed to fight.

862
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,735
Well, I'm sorry. But
I don't wanna fight.

863
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,136
I just wanna move on.

864
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
So should you.

865
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:40,562
Hey, Chris and Hillary.
It's Mark Greene.

866
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,096
I'm looking for Elizabeth.

867
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,466
If you see her, could you
ask her to give me a call?

868
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,233
Thanks. Dr. Greene, we got him.

869
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,936
Where? He opened
fire in Lincoln Park.

870
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,905
Shot three people before being
shot by a civilian with a 9mm.

871
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,775
Is he still alive? So far.

872
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,077
- What's he had?
- Two of epi and atropine.

873
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,446
Is this the cabby?

874
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,148
Shot at the base of his
skull. Cleo, jump in on this?

875
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,384
High cervical injury.
Blew out his brains.

876
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,287
Cleo. Uh, uh, any
vitals in the field?

877
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,590
No, just brain matter.
Durcy, any witnesses?

878
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:10,758
No, but we think it
was Fossen. Well, why?

879
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,061
1211 Dupont was the last entry
on the driver's log at 1:14 p.m.

880
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,930
What? The house
you had searched.

881
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,799
Fossen must have been
on his way over there.

882
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,134
Cabby probably heard
his description on the radio.

883
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,769
Dr. Greene? Bang.

884
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,971
Fossen blew his brains out.

885
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,639
Dr. Greene? Don't worry, doc.

886
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:27,375
That means he never got there.
- Dr. Greene.

887
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,399
He's coming in.

888
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:38,152
Was that a record number of
gunshot wounds for one shift?

889
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,389
By the same guy? Absolutely.

890
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,725
He has a good chance.

891
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,893
Like you said,
you found it early.

892
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,162
It's more that he has to go
through it alone, you know?

893
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,865
As if having cancer as
a kid wasn't bad enough.

894
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,201
He could get passed
over for Chief Resident.

895
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,469
That's true. Or he could
get kicked out of med school

896
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,405
and be forced to
work as an ER nurse.

897
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,741
I was not kicked out. Really?
What would you call it?

898
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,043
Suspended for being a deadbeat.

899
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,533
Hmm.

900
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,465
Do you know he
offered to pay my tuition?

901
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:09,655
Who? Luka.

902
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,320
And I know he means well.

903
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,423
It's just frustrating
for me sometimes

904
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,525
'cause I have to explain
my every feeling to him.

905
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:21,162
And normally when you're
with someone for a while,

906
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,630
they get to know your moods.

907
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,734
But he doesn't do
that. You know what?

908
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:27,402
Stop it.

909
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,792
What?

910
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:33,293
Don't talk to me about Luka.

911
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,312
I'm not your girlfriend.

912
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,197
And I shouldn't really
even be here with you.

913
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,221
Why not?

914
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:47,755
Because I don't wanna wish
bad things for you and Luka.

915
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,690
And I don't wanna
sit on the sidelines

916
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,154
waiting for you two to break up.

917
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,046
And I don't wanna
be your friend.

918
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,784
It might be convenient for you,

919
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:02,187
but it's not doing much
for me. What are you...?

920
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:03,610
What are you talking about?

921
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,145
Where did you put him?
Where did you put my son?

922
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:30,347
How much O-neg you want?
- Four units.

923
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:33,284
You can't take me from
him! Quiet! So we can listen.

924
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:35,486
Two entrance wounds on
the right. One on the left.

925
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,622
Another two in the
belly. A total of five.

926
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:39,891
You. You did this.

927
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,894
Set up for bilateral chest
tubes and a central line.

928
00:36:42,918 --> 00:36:44,963
Systolic's low at
80. I'll intubate.

929
00:36:44,987 --> 00:36:47,265
This is your fault.
Ready for the chest tubes.

930
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,766
Now. Paralyze.

931
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,519
One of Pavulon, 100 of sux.

932
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,187
You stole my son.

933
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,489
You destroyed my family.

934
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,191
Ambu-bag.

935
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,859
He's my son!

936
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,494
What gives you the right to?

937
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,082
You can't take my son away.

938
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,617
It starts with one bad
cell that multiplies.

939
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,018
And then it grows
out of control.

940
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,487
You usually don't
know it's there

941
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:12,790
until the mass is big
enough that it causes pain.

942
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,192
We're very lucky
that we found it today.

943
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,011
So you're saying
I'm lucky I got shot?

944
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:19,013
In a way, yeah.

945
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,849
It's just gonna
take longer to die.

946
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,735
No. That's what I'm telling you.

947
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:25,503
We caught it early.
There's a good chance

948
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:26,638
you're not gonna die.

949
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,306
What...? What's a good chance?

950
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,441
70 percent.

951
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,644
You know what 70 percent is?

952
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,529
Yeah. It leaves 30.

953
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,899
Well, let's concentrate
on the 70, okay?

954
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,235
Dr. Carter, GSW's rolling in.

955
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,591
Okay. Be right there.

956
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,822
So, what happens to me now?

957
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,391
Now I'm gonna have a
cancer doctor, an oncologist,

958
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:48,826
come down and
take a look at you.

959
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,383
No. I mean, where do I live?

960
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:53,030
Oh.

961
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:55,321
I don't know. I'll find out.

962
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,090
When was your
last tetanus booster?

963
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,593
I don't know. Do
I need an x-ray?

964
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,029
No, it looks like just a
graze. Is that the guy?

965
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:11,532
Yes. Multiple GSWs to
the chest and abdomen.

966
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,235
At the range, they teach you
to shoot for the center mass.

967
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:16,170
It's not always fatal,

968
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,355
but it takes 'em down.

969
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,625
You shot him? I got
mugged last year.

970
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:24,612
Same park. I don't go
there now without protection.

971
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,464
He started shooting people.
Someone had to do something.

972
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,167
Yeah, we should
arm the whole city.

973
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:31,886
Hey, I stopped him. He
would have kept going.

974
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,455
You're lucky.
Lucky I was packing.

975
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,924
Carter, you free? Uh, sort of.

976
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,592
GSW to the right flank.

977
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,628
Vitals are stable, but
I need you to check

978
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,679
for gross hematuria.

979
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,781
Okay. I... I'll be right there.

980
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,083
I handed it in to her. What?

981
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:47,451
Your reference. Should
put you over the top. All fives.

982
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,986
Wow. Thanks. I had to lie.

983
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,570
- Now, Carter.
- Coming.

984
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,323
First two are in.

985
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:56,343
Another subclavian. Put
the next two on the infuser.

986
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,812
How's your chest tube output?

987
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,614
Couple hundred cc's.

988
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,733
Only 50 on my side.

989
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,067
Is he gonna make it?

990
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,236
Probably. Didn't hit
any vital structures.

991
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,822
After five shots?
Some guys get lucky.

992
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,458
Nineteen shot. Eight,
maybe nine dead.

993
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,092
He's lucky we
didn't take him down.

994
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,861
Dr. Greene,
Dr. Corday's on line four.

995
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,413
Could you get it for me?

996
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:16,680
Pressure's up to 85.

997
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,816
3-0 nylon. What's in the Foley?

998
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,001
Seventy cc's.

999
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,003
Dips are negative for heme.

1000
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,554
Dr. Corday? Hold on.

1001
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:26,290
Can you cut this? Elizabeth?

1002
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:28,559
<i>Mark, what's going
on?</i> Where were you?

1003
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,595
I was at the Farmer's Market.
There were police in the house

1004
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,765
and the front door's
been kicked in.

1005
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,233
I told them to. <i>Why?</i>

1006
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:37,602
Uh, long story. Vaseline gauze.

1007
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:41,038
<i>You're not gonna tell
me what happened?</i>

1008
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,741
Nothing. It's just
a bit of a scare.

1009
00:39:43,765 --> 00:39:44,975
You're all right?

1010
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:47,867
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh, call you later?</i>

1011
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:51,616
I told the policeman to
stay with me till I called you.

1012
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,251
Yeah. Yeah, he can go now.

1013
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:55,787
You're not gonna tell
me what's going on?

1014
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,388
Not right now.

1015
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:59,207
Everything's okay.

1016
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,663
Okay, then.

1017
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,544
Will you be off at 7?

1018
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,713
Yes. I will be there.

1019
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,748
Okay.

1020
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,850
I love you.

1021
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,240
Me too.

1022
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,227
Elastoplast.

1023
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,893
Get ready for a portable chest.

1024
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,262
Keep the dopamine at 10
mics. Neuro checks, 30 minutes,

1025
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,430
and a CBC in an hour.

1026
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,632
Any cord contusion?
No, extrinsic hematoma.

1027
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,567
Did they find
Elizabeth? She's fine.

1028
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,936
Ah, good. What
about her paralysis?

1029
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,671
Ask me in 24 hours. What's this?

1030
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,474
GSW to the renal parenchyma.

1031
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,110
Marge, clear OR 2. We
got another customer.

1032
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,745
I'll be right back.

1033
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,280
Robert, I need to talk to you.

1034
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,181
Yeah, sure.
Anything but Legaspi.

1035
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,117
You're making a mistake. Look,

1036
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,887
my main mistake was not
firing her three months ago

1037
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:46,987
when I first found out.

1038
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,790
Found out what? That
she is incompetent.

1039
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,459
That's not what you were
gonna say. Oh, really?

1040
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,260
In addition to your
diagnostic skills,

1041
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,595
you're a mind reader.

1042
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,565
It's because she's
gay. Of course it's not.

1043
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,568
That would be wrong, or
at least politically incorrect.

1044
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:03,905
She's a pain in the ass.
Like Maggie Doyle was?

1045
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,372
Okay, let's stop right there.

1046
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,308
And avoid your history
of discrimination?

1047
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,709
If you don't rethink this,

1048
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,812
there's a good chance
you'll be out of a job.

1049
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,681
Dr. Legaspi has demonstrated
not only poor judgment,

1050
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,917
but a reckless attitude
towards her patients

1051
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,618
and a blatant
disregard for authority.

1052
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,343
She's out. She's fired.
End of discussion.

1053
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,159
If she goes, I go. What?

1054
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,562
You heard me.

1055
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:30,130
Are you giving me an
ultimatum? I swear to God, Robert.

1056
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,966
I will walk out if
you don't back off!

1057
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,568
I do not respond
well to ultimatums!

1058
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,303
You had better choose
your battles very carefully.

1059
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,055
You're the Chief of
Emergency Medicine,

1060
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,623
not the county's
lesbian advocate.

1061
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:41,659
That's where you're
wrong, because I am both.

1062
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,427
I am the Chief of
Emergency Medicine,

1063
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:44,828
and I am a lesbian.

1064
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:46,730
And if you pursue
this matter any further,

1065
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,199
I will take it to the County
Board of Supervisors,

1066
00:41:49,223 --> 00:41:51,001
the ACLU, the press

1067
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,469
and anyone else who will listen.

1068
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:55,744
So I suggest you choose
your battles very carefully.

1069
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,178
BP's 100/60.

1070
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,779
Going in the right direction.

1071
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,248
Last HemoCue? 9.5.

1072
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,021
You want me to bring him up?

1073
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,803
Mark? What?

1074
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,855
You want me to bring
him up? No, no. I got it.

1075
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,974
They are sending
cross-matched blood to the OR.

1076
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:33,711
Good. Could you bring a
copy of the chart back down

1077
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:35,012
so I can write my note?

1078
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:36,697
Sure.

1079
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,255
He's gonna need
some more Pavulon.

1080
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,070
Damn it. I forgot the drug box.

1081
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,493
Be right back.

1082
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:48,866
Whoa!
