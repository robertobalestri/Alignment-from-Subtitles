1
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:08,118
<i>Can't keep me here.</i>

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,253
<i>I need to go!</i>

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,022
You've got to let me go.

4
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,524
My kids are coming
home from school.

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,361
I meet them at the bus
stop at 3:30 every day.

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,463
Relax. It's only
10 in the morning.

7
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,298
My icebox is empty.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,400
I've got nothing
to cook for dinner.

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,685
You're in the hospital, ma'am.

10
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,453
We're going to take care of you.

11
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:28,822
I could get some ground chuck.

12
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:30,890
But they want 69 cents a pound.

13
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:31,891
Peter!

14
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,694
Have ya heard of such a thing?

15
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:36,596
I remember paying
29 cents a pound.

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,597
Where have you been?

17
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,166
Don't even think about T-bone.

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,935
I had to put a Swan in
upstairs. This the consult?

19
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,536
Mrs. Howard.

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,771
So, what's the problem?

21
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,607
Nursing home sent her in
because she's not eating.

22
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,009
Doesn't sound surgical.

23
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,444
Could be. You took out
her gallbladder last month.

24
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,346
But there's macaroni and cheese.

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,598
Hello, Mrs. Howard.

26
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:57,433
Oh, so nice to see you.

27
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,202
I'm Dr. Benton.

28
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,355
I know. I never forget
a handsome face.

29
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,475
Simon?

30
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,745
She's afebrile. I've
ordered a hemogram...

31
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,702
Simon! Simon!

32
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,491
Simon!

33
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,492
Who are you? CARTER: Simon!

34
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,245
Are you Simon? No?

35
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:27,748
Yosh, you seen a little guy
running through here alone?

36
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:28,749
Sorry.

37
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:30,583
Hey, Carter.

38
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:31,684
Lose something? Simon.

39
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,053
Where's his mom?

40
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:35,421
Mom went to the cafeteria
to get some chocolate milk.

41
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,257
But Simon's not
getting any treats

42
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,625
until he lets me draw his blood.

43
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:40,994
I don't want you
to take my blood.

44
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,979
We're only gonna
take about this much.

45
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,214
If you sit still,
this won't hurt.

46
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,084
I don't want a needle.

47
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,085
How about a papoose?

48
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,086
I think we're okay.

49
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,088
You sure? Hate for
you to lose him again.

50
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,490
Will you just
hold his arm still?

51
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,657
Okay.

52
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,482
Be brave and do not move.

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,696
Good one at the wrist.

54
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,997
Antecube looks better.

55
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,983
No!

56
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,051
Want to try an arm board?

57
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:06,686
No. Let's take a break.

58
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,555
Abby, I need another nurse.

59
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,408
You okay here? Go.

60
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:12,409
He kicked me in the face.

61
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,344
We need some Haldol.

62
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,513
Careful. He bit a
nurse's finger in Psych.

63
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,597
What's he doing down here?

64
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,299
He cut up his face.

65
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:20,433
You want some help?

66
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,639
Yeah.

67
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,594
Hey! Man, what'd
you do that for?

68
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,775
It was an April Fools' joke.

69
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,143
April Fools'?

70
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,611
Was that Haldol?

71
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,897
The board is full,
gurneys are lining the halls,

72
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,367
we got another 30 in the rack.

73
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,669
We desperately need
to clear out the rooms,

74
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,338
and you're wasting your
time on April Fools' pranks.

75
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,340
No more shenanigans
for the rest of the day.

76
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,642
Have I made myself clear?

77
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,544
Yes, ma'am. Uh-huh.

78
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:38,568
Dave!

79
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:41,037
Yeah.

80
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,382
How much did you give him?

81
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:44,484
Ten milligrams.

82
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,552
Okay. I want you to take a nap.

83
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,621
I'm fine.

84
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:48,788
What did I just say?

85
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,789
Go take a nap.

86
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,224
Before that?

87
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,391
No more fooling around.

88
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,949
That's right. Now,
get back to work.

89
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,714
Malucci!

90
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,933
It wasn't me, I swear.

91
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,523
What?

92
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,224
Nothing.

93
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,559
What's the matter with him?

94
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,726
Ten of Haldol.

95
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,750
Oh, yeah?

96
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,276
Hey.

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,632
Dr. Carter.

98
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,448
You were supposed to
get this after we took blood.

99
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,317
I'm sorry. I can
get another one.

100
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,318
No. That's okay.

101
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,786
You want another chocolate milk?

102
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,021
No, really... I don't mind.

103
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,278
Be a good boy,
Simon. I'll be right back.

104
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,227
You know, I didn't
call you down here.

105
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,228
The nurses did.

106
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,963
They said you were
having some trouble.

107
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,348
Not me.

108
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,450
Well, he's ready now.

109
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:51,751
Malik, can you give me a hand?

110
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:52,885
Yeah, sure.

111
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,554
It's better if you
don't hold onto him.

112
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:56,889
Yeah. We tried that once.

113
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,224
Ended up in the closet.

114
00:04:58,248 --> 00:04:59,248
Trust me.

115
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,795
Purple and a red top.

116
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,132
Okay, Simon. Are you ready?

117
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,968
You might want to give
Simon here a, uh, friendly hug.

118
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,638
Keep blowing bubbles, Simon.

119
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:13,502
Blow right through
the pain, okay?

120
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,246
Fine.

121
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,132
Good. That's it.

122
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,933
Good boy.

123
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,135
What do you want for the labs?

124
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:30,724
A CBC, lytes, BUN,
creatinine and glucose.

125
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:34,327
Okay. We are done.

126
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,045
You were very brave.

127
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,496
Let me hook you
up with a Band-Aid,

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,654
and you are good to go.

129
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:42,268
Thank you.

130
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,269
No problem.

131
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,637
So how's your internship going?

132
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:45,705
It's good. Yeah?

133
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,306
I haven't seen
you around lately.

134
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,474
You been busy?

135
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,676
Yeah.

136
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,846
I should probably
get back upstairs.

137
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,947
Nice to see you again.

138
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:55,703
You too.

139
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,517
Is this the trauma?

140
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,685
Yeah. Eddie Palcynski, 32,

141
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,420
single gunshot
wound to the belly.

142
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,622
Hypotensive initially.

143
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:04,224
I take it he's not
an innocent victim.

144
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:05,792
Tried to hold up a liquor store.

145
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:08,678
It wasn't me. That
other dude had a knife.

146
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,679
Any pain in the chest?

147
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,930
Just my stomach.

148
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:11,931
What happened to you?

149
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,132
Chased his partner.

150
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,601
Did you get him? Not exactly.

151
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,636
No, you actually
would have had to run.

152
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,537
Heard you had a GSW.

153
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,606
Right upper quadrant.

154
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,923
Can you get this? No problem.

155
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:21,941
Need a hand?

156
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,643
Take a look at that arm injury.

157
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,944
You just need a Band-Aid.

158
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,312
Yeah, over your mouth.

159
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,480
Officer?

160
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,348
Be good, they'll
give you a lollipop.

161
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:31,934
On my count. One, two, three.

162
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,937
Where is my purse?
I've lost my purse!

163
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,138
Hey, who's got the screamer?

164
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,740
Dr. Finch. Benton
cleared her belly.

165
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,141
Can we put her in a room?

166
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,142
If we had one.

167
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,078
Nurse, I need my
wallet and my car keys.

168
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,779
Nice outfit you
got there, Randi.

169
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,014
Thanks, Dr. Carter.

170
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,083
I can't go anywhere
without my keys!

171
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,685
You look nice too.

172
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,654
So are you Dr. Carter
now or Mr. Hyde?

173
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,855
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

174
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,124
I guess I just needed
a cup of coffee.

175
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,094
And I suppose seeing, uh,
Miss Bubbles had nothing to do

176
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,829
with your sudden
mood change? No.

177
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,849
No? Come on. You've been
moping around here for days.

178
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,316
And then the
minute she shows up,

179
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,151
you turn into Mr. Congeniality?

180
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,653
I was just being friendly.

181
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,655
I was!

182
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,328
Did somebody order a school bus?

183
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,250
Grace Linden.

184
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,752
Stuart's having
an asthma attack.

185
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,186
Get a gurney and
a hand-held neb.

186
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,789
You use an inhaler?

187
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,590
Empty. How long's he been bad?

188
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,259
About 10 minutes. There
are fumes on the bus.

189
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,028
Exhaust fumes?
No, something else.

190
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,663
Some of the kids
are throwing up.

191
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:34,764
We can't bring them in.

192
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,831
It's a HAZMAT situation.

193
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,967
Until we know there's
no contamination

194
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,034
you have to wait outside.

195
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,019
In the cold?

196
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,020
A gram of cefotetan

197
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,955
and repeat the CBC in pre-op.

198
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,123
What's this?

199
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,125
Small-caliber
gunshot to the liver.

200
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,728
I want four units of
type-specific in the O.R.

201
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:49,729
Thought Benton was on.

202
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:52,632
Yeah. You need something?

203
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:54,033
How long's the case?

204
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,300
Couple of hepatic drains,

205
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:57,236
couple of sutures
and we'll be done.

206
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,971
Sounds quick. Should be.

207
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,862
Hope so. Mm-hm.

208
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,560
He needs 125 of Solu-Medrol...

209
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,531
We are walking.
We are not talking.

210
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,800
Let's get him into a
gown and bag his clothes.

211
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,124
Okay. Can you hop up here?

212
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,174
Stu, Stu, stupid!

213
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,710
I think you broke your
ass. I can see the crack.

214
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,878
When the hand goes
up, the mouth goes shut.

215
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,063
Arms up.

216
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,632
You guys on a field trip?

217
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,000
Art Institute.

218
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,769
Oh, yeah? The Gauguin exhibit?

219
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:31,270
We never made it.

220
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:32,271
Hey, nice rack, Stu.

221
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,272
Make 'em bounce.

222
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,340
Okay, that's enough!

223
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:36,659
Hey, doc, you do liposuction?

224
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,162
Toby, next time it is
you, me and the principal.

225
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,763
Keep moving. We are walking...

226
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,221
Don't even listen to them.

227
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,669
Anything else?

228
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,004
Some number-one
chromic on a liver needle.

229
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,874
Lizzie, I heard you're
doing an ex-lap on a GSW?

230
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,908
You heard correctly.

231
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,045
Sure you can still
reach the table?

232
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,146
Least I can see the table.

233
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,884
Well, I was gonna offer
to assist after my AV shunt

234
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,388
but not if you're gonna
go prenatal on me.

235
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,322
Actually, if you
really want to help,

236
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,146
you can order me some
pizza and ice cream.

237
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,745
Think you need it?

238
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,617
Razor wire.

239
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,985
More like a cyclone fence.

240
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:19,986
It's pretty deep.

241
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,987
We can help you.

242
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,088
I need to use the toilet.

243
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:25,959
We're gonna move
you to a quiet room.

244
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,726
I need you to
spread your fingers.

245
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,230
Dr. Weaver, we got
a status asthmaticus.

246
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:33,732
Chuny, can you help her
with the bedpan, please?

247
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,900
He needs continuous nebs.

248
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,436
Where do you want to put him?

249
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,437
One second.

250
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,072
Sit up for me, Stuart.

251
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:40,906
Hey, your guy is seizing in 2.

252
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,875
Okay.

253
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,644
Cock your wrist back like this:

254
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,178
I'll go by myself.

255
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,579
Can't keep me
here or where to go.

256
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,265
Stand up.

257
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,600
You can let me
go if I want to go.

258
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,602
Hold your hands like this:

259
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,636
A prisoner I'm not.

260
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,088
I'm gonna press down.

261
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:56,356
Just keep them up, all right?

262
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,492
Let me go. I don't
need to be here.

263
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,493
Hey!

264
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,927
This is not right.

265
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,413
Drop the gun, ma'am.

266
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,647
Can't do this to me.

267
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,048
Drop the gun,
ma'am. Drop it now.

268
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,868
Just leave me alone!

269
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,269
Everybody calm down.

270
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:12,271
Put it down now and
no one will get hurt.

271
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:16,342
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone!

272
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,598
Drop the gun.

273
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,522
Leave me...

274
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,335
10 blade. Set up a cell
saver and try for a pulse ox.

275
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:44,437
Central line is in. Two
units on the infuser.

276
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,438
Rib spreader.

277
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,439
We asked three times.

278
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:47,540
Yeah. She didn't respond.

279
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,541
Asystole.

280
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,858
Start internal compressions.

281
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,460
How'd she get your
gun? I don't know.

282
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,461
What are you gonna say?

283
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,829
Put the suction on high.

284
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:54,814
We'll talk about it.

285
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:56,683
Right atrium is
completely shredded.

286
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:58,434
We should figure it out.

287
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,054
Aortic root is blown away.
Guess one shot wasn't enough.

288
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,188
Come here.

289
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:03,923
Another amp of epi.

290
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,691
Side-biting clamp and pick-ups.

291
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,510
I need a cordis
introducer for the atrium.

292
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,395
I need a lap pad. Let's go!

293
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,819
Hope they get
their story straight.

294
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,286
It's okay.

295
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,655
All clear. No carbon
monoxide, no flammables.

296
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,090
The kids smelled something?

297
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,093
Maybe, but it's gone now.
Probably just mass hysteria.

298
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,294
That's it?

299
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,029
Kids smell nail-polish remover,

300
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,931
pretty soon everybody
thinks they're sick.

301
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,199
Do we need to scrub them down?

302
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,834
No one's contaminated.

303
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,258
All right. Let's split 'em up.

304
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,172
Who had vomiting?

305
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,406
Me. So did I.

306
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,610
Luka, postural
vitals and a pulse ox.

307
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,311
Okay. Come with me.
What's your name?

308
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,312
Emily.

309
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,713
Are you still nauseated? Yeah.

310
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,449
Any stiff neck or double vision?

311
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,450
No.

312
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,684
Are you really a doctor?

313
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,819
When I'm not out
fighting crime. This way.

314
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,022
All right, guys. Let's go.

315
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,023
We like it out here.

316
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,824
They say fresh
air's good for you.

317
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,925
Put out your cigarette.

318
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,827
You got a spare ashtray?

319
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,496
Come on.

320
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,814
Beck's suture.

321
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,215
Fifth and sixth units are in.

322
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,483
How's she doing?

323
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:07,019
Heart's empty. Not so good.

324
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,854
Looks like hamburger in here.

325
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:11,857
Officer Kimball, did you
discharge your weapon?

326
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,059
Go with Detective Westland.

327
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,760
Satinsky.

328
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,145
Officer Grant, you're with me.

329
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,913
Push another atropine.

330
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,082
I need the names of
the treating physicians.

331
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,217
Dr. Weaver.

332
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,802
12 French Foley.
Let's move, people.

333
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,103
And Dr. Benton.

334
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,571
Okay. Inflate balloon.

335
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,372
Did you witness the shooting?

336
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,391
We both did.

337
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,825
B-E-N-T-E-N?

338
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,060
O-N.

339
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,266
Okay. Hold compressions.

340
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,796
Still asystole.

341
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,115
Is she gonna make it?

342
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:37,755
Not if you don't
let us do our job.

343
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,485
Let me know if she expires.

344
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,921
Resume compressions.

345
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,722
You want some more blood?

346
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,208
How long has she been down?

347
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,210
Half an hour.

348
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,278
All right, let's get,
uh, two more units,

349
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,779
and I need some
more 0 silk. Come on.

350
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,986
I'll get some.

351
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,617
Deep breath.

352
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,385
Excuse me.

353
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,320
Once again.

354
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,956
Is that stuff still in my lungs?

355
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,291
I don't think so.
Everything sounds good.

356
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,659
What kind of chemical was it?

357
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,594
We don't know.

358
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,964
Well, then how do
you know it's safe?

359
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,531
Because your
oxygen level is normal

360
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,533
and your lungs are clear.

361
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,425
Do you think it
could hurt my baby?

362
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,606
You're pregnant?

363
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,909
I think so.

364
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,944
Laura Beckton, 23. Put
her car into a hydrant.

365
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,613
She's altered. No
response to verbal.

366
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,831
This is a crime scene.

367
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:25,881
We have a critical...

368
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,450
Gotta go around. Let us through!

369
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,485
I can't.

370
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,521
BP, 120/85. Pulse, 90.

371
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,689
What's with all the cops?

372
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,991
We had a shooting.
Let's get X-ray down here.

373
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,659
Laura, open your eyes.

374
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,361
Pupils are equal and reactive.

375
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,231
Let's get a portable
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

376
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,233
Head CT to follow.

377
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,101
Looks like Peter's
patient didn't make it.

378
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,102
What patient?

379
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,272
Little old lady from the hall.

380
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,807
That's my patient.

381
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,808
Cop shot her.

382
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,197
What?

383
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,015
Feeling better?

384
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,687
Starting to. Did that lady die?

385
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,022
Think it'll be on the news?

386
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,392
Yeah.

387
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,694
She could have
blown my head off.

388
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,029
Weren't you scared?

389
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,398
A little.

390
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,367
Then why'd you
get in front of me?

391
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,436
Guess I wasn't thinking.

392
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,505
I was really scared.

393
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,529
Me too.

394
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,415
You're still wheezing.

395
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,016
Have you had a cold?

396
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,919
No.

397
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,188
Well, something
triggered your asthma.

398
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,056
Think it was the fumes?

399
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,576
Maybe. I don't know.

400
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,698
You're not sure?

401
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,982
I'm just trying to help.

402
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:51,286
It was the fumes.

403
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,024
Where'd they come from?

404
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,548
You know, anything that
you tell me is a secret.

405
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,117
Another 4.0 proline.

406
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,120
Shirley, can you
rub my back for me?

407
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,389
Excuse me?

408
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,624
Yeah, just above
the waist on the right.

409
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,778
Oh, yes. Yeah, that's it.

410
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:21,230
Okay. Release the vessel loop.

411
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,616
Oh, yeah. That's it.

412
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,201
I'm sorry. This
must be the day spa.

413
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,787
I was looking for the O.R.

414
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:29,388
Everything's under control.

415
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:31,840
I hope so. You've been
in here long enough.

416
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,911
I've repaired the liver, the
diaphragm and now the IVC.

417
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,018
Uh-huh. What about the
defect to the ascending colon?

418
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,105
Where?

419
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,856
Little lower.

420
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,745
Yeah, right there.

421
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,128
I hadn't fully run
the bowel yet.

422
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,664
Or maybe this is too big a case,
given your delicate condition?

423
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,357
We were doing perfectly well
until you came in, thank you.

424
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,904
Are you crying?

425
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,022
No.

426
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,189
We don't cry in the O.R.,

427
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,774
that's what the
ladies' room is for.

428
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,077
I'm not crying!

429
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,502
Good. Then you
won't mind if I scrub in.

430
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,987
Where's Malucci?

431
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,354
He's with his new fan club.

432
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,355
As if. Find him.

433
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,356
Right now?

434
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,159
No, sometime in
the next two weeks.

435
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,326
Don't be so snippy.

436
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,328
Some kids on the bus
had a can of solvent.

437
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,329
They were huffing?

438
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,330
Trying to get high.

439
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,498
I've got a pregnant girl.

440
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,499
What were they using?

441
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,667
I don't know.

442
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,269
They held a rag
over my patient's face

443
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,870
and forced him to take a hit.

444
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:35,971
Tox screens are negative.

445
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,739
Solvents. They don't show up.

446
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,740
We need to find out.

447
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,875
I know where to start.

448
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,943
Don't implicate Stuart.

449
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,178
He's afraid of payback.

450
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,545
Tell him.

451
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,981
Dr. Dave was talking to me
and he fell asleep in the chair.

452
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,122
Now he's drooling.

453
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:52,604
Okay, Mr. Gunderson, you
need to change into a gown.

454
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,173
The doctor will be
in to examine you.

455
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:56,341
Just have a seat on the bed.

456
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,776
Dave.

457
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,278
Dave. Dave!

458
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,002
I'm good.

459
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,669
I'm good.

460
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,403
No, man. You gotta
stick it up his butt.

461
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,589
Okay, guys. What
were you sniffing?

462
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,091
What? On the bus.

463
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,742
You smell something
on the bus, Eric?

464
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,111
Yeah, Mrs. Linden's farts.

465
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,947
We found chemical
solvents in your bloodstream.

466
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,255
Some of your
classmates are really sick.

467
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,537
Can I get another Band-Aid?

468
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:26,621
I need to know what it was.

469
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,363
Butane, paint thinner, adhesive?

470
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,615
Okay, fine. We'll do more tests.

471
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,874
Bo? Come here.

472
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:42,254
What kind of tests?

473
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,290
Just lie still, man.

474
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:51,847
We take the blood and label
it with radioactive hydrogen.

475
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,938
Then we re-inject
it into your body

476
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,937
and do a nuclear scan.

477
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,972
Really?

478
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,429
It's the only way to
identify the chemicals.

479
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,033
It was spot remover.

480
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,614
What kind?

481
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,732
Carbon tet.

482
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,034
Carbon tetrachloride?

483
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,369
Order liver panels
on all three of 'em.

484
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,371
Got it.

485
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,740
We gonna be okay?

486
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,643
I hope so.

487
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,549
Hey, can I help you?

488
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,784
Yeah, I'm looking for Rena.

489
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,786
She's just finishing
up with a patient.

490
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,988
Dr. Carter, right?

491
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,723
Yeah. Have we met?

492
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,714
No. I'll let her
know you're here.

493
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,120
We didn't have... We didn't...

494
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,039
Dr. Carter?

495
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,607
Yeah, hi. I...

496
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,675
Don't worry about it.

497
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,912
This is always falling apart.

498
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,815
Okay, actually,
it goes like this.

499
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,150
Are you sure you're a doctor?

500
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,318
I was a surgical
resident for a year.

501
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,254
I guess it's easier
taking things out

502
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,823
than, uh, putting it back in.

503
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:12,928
I was waiting and I
accidentally eviscerated this guy.

504
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,680
I heard about the
shooting. Are you okay?

505
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,136
Yeah.

506
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,889
Did you need something?

507
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,006
I've been doing some
thinking about you and me.

508
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,726
And I realize that
I may have been...

509
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,550
Stupid?

510
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,730
I was gonna say wrong.

511
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:36,068
But maybe I was
a little of both.

512
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,136
Look, I enjoyed the time
that we spent together.

513
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,605
I'd like to do it again.

514
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,129
So I was wondering if you
would have lunch with me.

515
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,543
What about the age thing?

516
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,295
Not an issue.

517
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,635
Anymore.

518
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,641
You dropped your spleen.

519
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,757
Right. So is that a no?

520
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,314
I'll think about it.

521
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,728
Okay.

522
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,263
I was just up at grand rounds.

523
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,497
Why didn't anyone get me?

524
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,333
There wasn't any
time. She arrested.

525
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,034
She wasn't that
agitated when I left.

526
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:10,836
What did she want with the gun?

527
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,971
She didn't want anything.
She was altered...

528
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:15,841
Dr. Benton, the cop is
still waiting for his sutures.

529
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:17,276
Yeah. I'll see you.

530
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,277
Got the film.

531
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,578
I have to get out of here now.

532
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:20,846
You need to sit down.

533
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,648
You were unconscious
from a car accident.

534
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:24,149
I'm gonna be late. For what?

535
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:25,150
For my gynecologist.

536
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,036
They have to harvest
my eggs by 6:00.

537
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,203
Are you on fertility drugs?

538
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,739
Yeah. I had 10 days
of FSH injections.

539
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,641
And yesterday they
gave me Beta HCG.

540
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,593
Look, I'm ovulating now.

541
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:36,861
There's only a two-hour
window to retrieve the eggs.

542
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:38,764
I don't think that's
gonna be possible now.

543
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,799
Why, did I damage my ovaries?

544
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,768
Head CT looks normal.

545
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,769
We think you may have had

546
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:45,837
a small blood clot in your brain

547
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,724
which caused you to pass
out and crash your car.

548
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,226
But I'm okay now?

549
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,144
We need to give
you blood thinners

550
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,279
to prevent more clotting.

551
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,197
I'll go to the clinic
and come back.

552
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,398
You need heparin now,

553
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,801
which means you can't
have an invasive procedure.

554
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,703
When I come back,
you can do whatever.

555
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,288
I have to harvest these eggs.

556
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,789
Hold on. Who's
your gynecologist?

557
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,741
Her name is Dr. Alexander.

558
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,815
Let's call her and
maybe she'll come here.

559
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,551
What is taking so long?

560
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,919
Have a seat.

561
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,656
Did you do the test?

562
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,358
You are pregnant.

563
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,492
I knew it.

564
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,160
What about the fumes?

565
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,729
Shouldn't be a problem.

566
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,064
Good. I want a healthy baby.

567
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,100
Have you thought
about your options?

568
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,769
What do you mean?

569
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,405
Can you take care of a baby?

570
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,940
Well, there's daycare
in high school.

571
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,760
And my mom can help
out until I'm in ninth grade.

572
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,064
Does your mom know?

573
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:45,681
Maybe you should tell her.

574
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,082
No. Don't tell her.

575
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,907
She'll freak out completely.

576
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,372
It's a big decision.

577
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,240
No, it's not.

578
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:57,364
All my life I wanted a baby.

579
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:04,287
She's a good cop. Saved
my ass a couple of times.

580
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,302
No one ever wants
to draw their gun.

581
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,805
She was forced to make
a split-second decision.

582
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,706
Was she?

583
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,508
She followed the guidelines.

584
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:17,946
Mm. They teach you to
shoot little old ladies, huh?

585
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,782
She could have shot anyone
in that hallway. You know that.

586
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,217
All I know is that an
elderly black woman is dead.

587
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,352
No, man.

588
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,322
Lisa's not like that at all.

589
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,592
I would have done
the same thing.

590
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,627
Yeah, well...

591
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,863
Hold still.

592
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,665
You don't know her.

593
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,666
You can trust her.

594
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,634
She's a good person. She...

595
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,103
Look. She's been raising
two kids on her own

596
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,772
ever since her husband died.

597
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:44,940
She's had it rough.

598
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm telling you,

599
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,742
this investigation
goes the wrong way,

600
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,211
you could ruin
a good cop's life.

601
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,280
She was trying to protect
you and your patients.

602
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,382
That's all she was doing.

603
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,918
You might wanna consider that,

604
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,376
maybe talk to these detectives.

605
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,064
I know she's in the
middle of a procedure.

606
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,966
Page Dr. Alexander.

607
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,834
Have her call Dr. Greene
at County General.

608
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,069
Hold on, Malik.

609
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,005
Yeah. The patient's name
is Laura Beckton. Thanks.

610
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,506
Robert Borsellino? Yeah.

611
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,675
This is Bo? Yeah.

612
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,677
We need a ProTime,
type and cross for four.

613
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,678
You gonna admit him?

614
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:23,712
Pedes ICU.

615
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,080
She's in seventh grade.

616
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,582
They're emancipated
for a reason.

617
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,750
When they're pregnant,
you can't tell her mother.

618
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,918
She'll have to eventually.

619
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,252
Yes, she will.

620
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,121
Don't you think it's
better to tell her now?

621
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,122
Well, yeah. I do.

622
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,423
So you'll talk to her?

623
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,424
What?

624
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,593
Maybe she'll listen to you.

625
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,061
What room? Exam 2.

626
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,096
I don't need this. I can
just go home and rest.

627
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,231
What we need is
to find your parents.

628
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,266
They don't get back till 8 or 9.

629
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,902
They have a cell
phone or a pager?

630
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,187
No. Don't even bother.

631
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:50,522
We really do.

632
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:51,979
Well, what is it?

633
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,349
You're in liver failure.

634
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,413
How'd that happen?

635
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,781
You need to huff pretty much
every day to hurt your liver.

636
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,149
People drink every day.

637
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,284
This is worse.

638
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,169
We have to start
looking for a donor.

639
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,193
A donor?

640
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,079
You could die if you don't
have a liver transplant.

641
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,883
Is this another one
of your scare tactics?

642
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,651
No.

643
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,701
Mark, Laura's crashing.

644
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,103
I'll be back. What happened?

645
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,771
She slumped over,
stopped breathing.

646
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,539
I should have heparinized.

647
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,008
Pavulon and sux. Let's paralyze.

648
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:28,476
I don't think you have to.

649
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,531
Number 8 ET tube, suction.

650
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,050
No muscle tone
in the legs either.

651
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,986
Blood clot knocked out
the corticospinal tracts.

652
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,126
She's a quadriplegic.

653
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,541
How about TPA? Maybe
we can bust the clot.

654
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,776
Not after a car crash.
Pulmonary contusions.

655
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,378
She could bleed into her lungs.

656
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,113
Dr. Greene? I took a message.

657
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:49,998
Dr. Alexander can
come see the patient.

658
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,156
Forget it. She stroked out.

659
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,222
And you also
heard Officer Kimball

660
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,925
ask the woman to
drop the weapon?

661
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:01,014
Yeah.

662
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,550
What happened next?

663
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,267
Mrs. Howard was startled,
and she raised the gun.

664
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,102
Pointed at anyone in particular?

665
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:12,771
There were patients around,
but, no, no one specifically.

666
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:14,961
Okay.

667
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:20,245
We'll notify you if we
need anything else.

668
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,813
That's it?

669
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:24,149
Yeah.

670
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:25,534
Something you'd like to add?

671
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,558
Yeah, they could
have grabbed the gun.

672
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:29,922
What makes you say that?

673
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,590
She was a frail, frightened,
demented elderly woman.

674
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,793
She didn't know
what she was doing.

675
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,011
She still could have fired.

676
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,679
Maybe.

677
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,785
But?

678
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,739
They didn't need to shoot her.

679
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,842
Was she huffing?

680
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:51,843
No. No.

681
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,211
I've talked to her about drugs.

682
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,813
But you never know.

683
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:57,649
I don't think she does drugs.

684
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:59,617
I shouldn't have let
her go on that field trip.

685
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,420
Why? She's been sick.

686
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,990
She tells me she's been
throwing up every morning.

687
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:07,425
Could that be gallstones?
My mother had them.

688
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:10,228
Do you know when
was her last period?

689
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:11,963
I don't keep track.

690
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,900
She has a boyfriend?

691
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:17,836
Is she pregnant?

692
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,755
Oh, that little slut.

693
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,807
Mrs. Perault. How
could you be so stupid?

694
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,508
What? This is your mother?

695
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:24,776
Yes. I'm her mother.

696
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,678
If you're gonna sleep
around, use a condom!

697
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:27,679
He didn't want to.

698
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:28,680
No need to shout.

699
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:30,298
Who is the little bastard?

700
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,483
You're getting an abortion.

701
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,902
I am not. Yes, you are!

702
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,902
Leave me alone.

703
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,137
Why don't we all calm down.

704
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,406
You can't take care of a baby.

705
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,575
You can't even
take care of yourself!

706
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,659
Get her out of here.

707
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,793
I need you to step outside.

708
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,361
I need you to mind
your own business.

709
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:44,529
Mrs. Perault.

710
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:46,498
Told you not to tell
her. She's a psycho.

711
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,200
She is not leaving
here pregnant!

712
00:26:48,224 --> 00:26:50,419
Yes, I am. I'm having this baby.

713
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:55,007
And I'm gonna be a much
better mother than you, you bitch.

714
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,508
You doing your homework?

715
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,909
No, that lady brought it in.

716
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,144
What lady?

717
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:01,480
The really cute one
with the curly hair.

718
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,780
She works in Pediatrics.

719
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,849
Oh, yeah. Rena. Yeah.

720
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,585
Hey, we found out exactly
what caused your asthma.

721
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:08,586
You tell them I told you?

722
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,355
Didn't have to. They told us.

723
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,789
They told you, or you asked?

724
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,458
Either way, it's not a problem.

725
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:14,526
They think I squealed.

726
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,461
Bo is gonna kick
the crap out of me!

727
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:17,762
Don't worry about Bo.

728
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,231
Everything is
gonna be all right.

729
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:21,366
No. It won't. They saw me naked!

730
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,901
They just saw you
from the waist up.

731
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:24,503
They're gonna make
fun of me forever.

732
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:26,971
Listen, I knew a boy
who was a little husky.

733
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:28,240
He didn't have many friends

734
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:30,342
and all the kids used
to make fun of him.

735
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:33,811
So he spent most
of his time studying.

736
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:38,216
And he went on to college
and he became a surgeon.

737
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,586
And at his high-school
reunion, he took out his scalpel

738
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,188
and he cut the
tongues off of every kid

739
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:45,223
who ever made fun of him.

740
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,687
That supposed to
cheer me up, doc?

741
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,930
Okay. Help me immobilize
the small intestine.

742
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:53,815
Pancreas is fine.

743
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,351
Uh-oh. Take a look at this.

744
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,752
It's a hematoma of the duodenum.

745
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,754
Yeah. The bullet went
through the medial aspect

746
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,223
of the second portion.

747
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,858
You're kidding.

748
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:03,959
Have you known me to kid?

749
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,862
Okay, open a
pancreaticoduodenectomy tray.

750
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:07,863
He needs a Whipple.

751
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,331
That's a five-hour procedure.

752
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,166
I'll call in Peter.

753
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,085
No, no. It's my
patient. I'll finish.

754
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,003
No, no, no. No need
to torture yourself.

755
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,755
I just need a bathroom break.

756
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,040
A bathroom break?

757
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,542
Well, I am seven
months pregnant.

758
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,945
Should have considered
that before you started.

759
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,464
I'll be back in five minutes.

760
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:28,717
Fine. Shirley, call in
another scrub tech.

761
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,085
I need an extra pair of hands.

762
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,603
Okay. Forget it. I won't go.

763
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,688
Go.

764
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,832
No! I won't!

765
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,225
Bovie, pickups.

766
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:42,280
Shirley, can you crawl between
my legs and insert a Foley?

767
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,082
All right, all right, go
on. Go on. Get out.

768
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,589
Go on. Get out
of here. Go ahead.

769
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,341
Don't you need a
cable or something?

770
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:56,411
Nope. It just sends it
right to your phone. Done.

771
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,913
Okay, okay. Call me.

772
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:59,336
Okay.

773
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,719
Papa Roach. That is so cool!

774
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,822
Stuart, do one
for me. Blink-182.

775
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,557
Looks like he's found
some new friends.

776
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,748
How'd you do that?

777
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,365
Well, I guess it's a
little late for lunch.

778
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,967
Well, we got busy
with all these kids.

779
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,468
How about dinner?

780
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,470
I'll probably grab a Happy
Meal on the way home.

781
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,006
Okay, I deserve that.
Now you can forgive me.

782
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,441
I don't know.

783
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,277
Come on. I'm starving. You,
me, a couple of big steaks.

784
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,278
I'm a vegetarian.

785
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,546
Or Brussels sprouts.

786
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,415
It's a school night.
No, seriously.

787
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,682
I've got a midterm tomorrow.

788
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,052
Well, I can help you study.

789
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:40,555
Might have to
pull an all-nighter.

790
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,290
So is that a yes?

791
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,125
Excuse me.

792
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,149
So where and when?

793
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,696
Let me think about it.

794
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,588
I'll call you when I know
something more specific.

795
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,003
I thought you were
over this age thing.

796
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,004
I am.

797
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,373
So, what was that about?

798
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,374
Do you know Abby?

799
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,925
No, but she seems nice.

800
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:03,862
She's nice. Yeah.
No, she's just...

801
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,431
She's always had
this thing for me.

802
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:07,616
You used to go out with her?

803
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,451
She's got some issues.

804
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,320
She gets a little weird
around other nurses

805
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,889
and stuff, so it's probably
best not to let her on...

806
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,113
Let on about us.

807
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,629
I'll meet you down
here after your shift.

808
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,165
Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

809
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,469
Okay.

810
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:36,116
When you have a chance,
her family wants to talk to you.

811
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:40,665
Peter.

812
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:42,667
Hey.

813
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,069
Mrs. Howard's sodium was 172.

814
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,304
What?

815
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:49,307
She was delirious because
of profound dehydration.

816
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,075
Did you check her
mucous membranes?

817
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,511
I examined her abdomen
for post-op complications.

818
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:54,512
That's it?

819
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:56,715
Well, didn't you examine her?

820
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:59,150
I shotgunned her labs
and gave her to you.

821
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:01,007
Come here.

822
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:04,944
This whole thing
was preventable.

823
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,561
If I had recognized the
problem and started an IV

824
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:10,962
hell, given her
a glass of water,

825
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:12,063
she might still be alive.

826
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,298
You don't know that.

827
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:15,400
It takes time to make a
diagnosis when we're busy.

828
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:16,918
She wouldn't have
grabbed the gun.

829
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,553
No reason for them to shoot her.

830
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:22,290
You'll see a tube in her
mouth hooked up to a ventilator.

831
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,059
Well, she's not breathing?

832
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,826
The stroke affected
the part of her brain

833
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,429
that controls breathing.

834
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:28,896
Will that get better?

835
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,965
We'll have to wait and see.

836
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,435
Here.

837
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,492
You can sit down.

838
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:42,599
Laura? It's Greg.

839
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,403
I'm right here.

840
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:50,919
God, she's only 23.

841
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,888
How could she have a stroke?

842
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,148
We think the fertility
drugs caused the blood clot.

843
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,146
Fertility drugs?

844
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,681
The injections.

845
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,104
What are you talking about?

846
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,187
I talked to her gynecologist.

847
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:11,745
Your wife was trying
to be an egg donor.

848
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,365
She was selling her eggs?

849
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:22,121
There was an infertile
couple willing to pay $80,000.

850
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:35,313
We have this, uh,
little hardware store.

851
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:36,915
Bills are stacking up.

852
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:39,884
Business is down...

853
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:42,842
We're about to
file for bankruptcy.

854
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,450
I guess she was trying to help.

855
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,450
I'm sorry.

856
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,736
You didn't have
to do this, honey.

857
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,193
You didn't have to do this.

858
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:14,385
Is Dr. Carter around?

859
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,453
He was here a minute ago.

860
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:16,754
Will you tell him I'll be late?

861
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:18,589
There's a new
admission to the PICU.

862
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:20,646
No problem.

863
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:24,628
Hi. Hi.

864
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:26,698
I'm Rena. Abby.

865
00:33:26,722 --> 00:33:27,899
You're Dr. Carter's friend?

866
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,043
That's right.

867
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,636
I hope you don't mind me
spending time with John.

868
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,538
Why would I?

869
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:35,674
Well, he told me.

870
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:37,676
Told you what?

871
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,798
About you and him.

872
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,179
Me and him?

873
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,982
I don't want there to
be any hard feelings.

874
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:46,050
I understand how some
relationships take longer

875
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:48,987
to get over than others.

876
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:51,795
He told you we
had a relationship?

877
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:55,542
I find his honesty refreshing.

878
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,944
He's different than most guys.

879
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,446
Oh, yeah.

880
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,032
He's special.

881
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,502
Good view of the
heartbeat. There's the head.

882
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:06,004
"It's time to
explore new places.

883
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,372
"Even though Taureans
cringe at the thought of change,

884
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:11,092
trust what lies ahead as a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."

885
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,494
That's so perfect. What?

886
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,864
My horoscope. What's your sign?

887
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,849
I don't know.

888
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:20,284
Well, when's your birthday?

889
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,987
Looks like you're
about 10 weeks along.

890
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,355
So when will I have it?

891
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:25,522
November.

892
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:27,726
Early Christmas present.

893
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,715
Oh. Look, how cute.

894
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,481
Babies are a lot
of responsibility.

895
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,517
I know.

896
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:40,254
It's hard work getting up
in the middle of the night.

897
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,224
It's easy if you love them.

898
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,592
How old was your mom
when you were born?

899
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,261
Sixteen.

900
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,930
Maybe if she had
waited a couple years,

901
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,898
she would have
been a better mother.

902
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,482
I'm way more mature
than she was at 16.

903
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:59,974
I'm gonna have a social
worker stop by to see you.

904
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,593
Good. I need to sign up.

905
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:02,617
For what?

906
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,180
Money. When my
friend Gina had her baby

907
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,188
she started getting
a check every month.

908
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:14,239
Your wife wanted...

909
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:15,873
Randi, any word from the O.R.?

910
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:16,874
They're still working.

911
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,175
No, no! I said no!

912
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,377
We won't harm her in any way.

913
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,779
Stay the hell away from my wife!

914
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:24,215
Dr. Alexander, Mark Greene.

915
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,039
Could you keep her
out of here, please?

916
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:31,456
What are you doing?

917
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,258
Discussing his wife's condition.

918
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:35,526
Right now you're a
consultant. Talk to me first.

919
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,761
I couldn't find you.

920
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:38,763
I was reviewing her
records when he walked in.

921
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:39,964
No, you were twisting his arm

922
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:41,633
because you want
to harvest the eggs.

923
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:43,384
I was presenting
it as an option.

924
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,886
He'll never let you do it.

925
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,350
She's already given her consent.

926
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,975
He just lost his wife.
Leave him alone.

927
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:53,511
Dr. Greene, she's gonna
need a lengthy hospitalization.

928
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:55,646
And then round-the-clock
home nursing care.

929
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,448
That's a tremendous
financial burden.

930
00:35:57,472 --> 00:35:59,650
Thanks to your fertility drugs.

931
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:00,819
I don't think so.

932
00:36:00,843 --> 00:36:03,454
I've been doing IVF for 12 years

933
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:05,323
and I've never seen this happen.

934
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:08,559
She must have a protein S
or an anti-thrombin deficiency.

935
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,211
Those are pretty
rare conditions.

936
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,486
Not as rare as a vascular
occlusion from FSH.

937
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,052
I'll send up the labs.

938
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,054
There's an hour left
to retrieve the eggs.

939
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,522
It's a 10-minute procedure

940
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,175
but it'll give them a
nice financial cushion.

941
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,044
Why don't you try
and calm him down,

942
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:27,951
discuss the situation.

943
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,470
Mm-hm.

944
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,771
Another Vicryl.

945
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,974
Why don't you go take a nap?

946
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,359
Because I've got my second wind.

947
00:36:41,383 --> 00:36:43,161
Well, it's about time.

948
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:44,612
I'm happy to close.

949
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,581
Be my guest.

950
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,282
Skin stapler.

951
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,883
Dr. Greene called again.

952
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,885
He'd like you to phone
him when the case is over.

953
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,387
Oh, how sweet.

954
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,611
You are one lucky lady.

955
00:36:56,198 --> 00:36:58,092
Couple of ABDs.

956
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,078
You gonna write post-op orders?

957
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:01,445
Yes. Leave the clipboard for me.

958
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,071
Okay. Here we
go. One, two, three.

959
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,987
ABG in 20 minutes.

960
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:12,123
I'll meet you in Recovery.

961
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,624
His brother's in
the Waiting Room.

962
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,460
Can you talk to him?

963
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,218
Yeah.

964
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:33,411
Hey, Abby. Can you update
the tetanus on my foot lac?

965
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:35,613
Sure, why not?

966
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:36,664
You okay?

967
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,432
Oh, yeah. I'm peachy.

968
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,469
What's wrong?

969
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:44,777
I don't know, maybe I'm
still getting over our breakup.

970
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,009
You talked to Rena.

971
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,565
Yeah.

972
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,232
I'm sorry. I panicked. I...

973
00:37:54,256 --> 00:37:56,922
What did you say to her?

974
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,786
Nothing. No, really.

975
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,523
Really. Against
my better judgment

976
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,159
and everything I
hold sacred in life

977
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,400
I covered for you.
So you owe me one.

978
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,897
Thank you.

979
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,699
Sure.

980
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,035
Also, I told her I dumped you.

981
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,671
Ha. You dumped
me? She believe you?

982
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:18,511
Of course she did.
Why wouldn't she?

983
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,682
Well, it's just... You'd
never dump me.

984
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:25,195
I would dump you
like a bad habit.

985
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,297
Oh, no.

986
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,965
I definitely think
I'd dump you first.

987
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:28,966
In your dreams, maybe.

988
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,967
I would dump you.

989
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:31,635
No, you wouldn't.

990
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:32,859
You're acting crazy now.

991
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:44,699
What's that?

992
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:48,191
Pulse ox came off.

993
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:52,411
That's it for the right side.

994
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,344
She in any pain?

995
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,413
No.

996
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,183
Left ovary looks good.

997
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,608
She wrote children's books.

998
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,778
Did you know that?

999
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:35,516
Those were our bedtime stories.

1000
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,052
I still can't believe
this is happening.

1001
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,588
She's had dementia
for such a long time.

1002
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,056
I know.

1003
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,324
Usually she's forgetful

1004
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,426
or thinks she's
still living at home.

1005
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,465
But she's never been
agitated or violent.

1006
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:54,602
I can't imagine her
fighting with the police.

1007
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:57,405
So you're sure it's
nothing from the surgery?

1008
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,441
No, no. Dementia is
a progressive illness.

1009
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:05,034
Over time there's worsening
psychiatric symptoms.

1010
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:11,069
You know, it's been so
hard to watch her deteriorate.

1011
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:13,938
Even little things
can lead to agitation.

1012
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:17,942
Sleep deprivation,
a bladder infection.

1013
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:20,244
Actually, we think
it was dehydration.

1014
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:21,712
From not drinking enough?

1015
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:24,332
There's too many people
at that nursing home.

1016
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:26,200
They weren't even
giving her water.

1017
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,169
I never should have
moved her out of the house.

1018
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,370
It was too much for you.

1019
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,639
I could have done it. I
could have cared for her.

1020
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,057
I was the one who
put her in there.

1021
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:35,565
This is not your fault.

1022
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,815
Thank you, Dr. Benton.

1023
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,874
I know she appreciated
your kindness.

1024
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:53,833
I was looking
everywhere for you.

1025
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:58,671
Is that Dermabond?

1026
00:41:05,147 --> 00:41:07,725
How's he gonna get it off?

1027
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:10,750
Maybe he'll find some acetone.

1028
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:26,877
Carter, could you pitch in
with some chart reviews?

1029
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:27,945
It's okay.

1030
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,697
I promised Rena
I'd help her study.

1031
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,232
Tutoring?

1032
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,367
Yeah. It's a
midterm, right? Yeah.

1033
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,708
Family Studies. Psychology.

1034
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:38,878
Good night, Dr. Carter.

1035
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:41,909
Randi, could you
call up to the O.R.?

1036
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,243
Again? Yes.

1037
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,445
Don't bother.

1038
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:45,746
I thought you'd never get out.

1039
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,747
Neither did I.

1040
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,048
How are you?

1041
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,149
If I don't get off my feet,

1042
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,420
my ankles are going to explode.

1043
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:54,221
Did your patient make it?

1044
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,823
Yeah. How was your day?

1045
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,124
The usual.

1046
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,125
You save any lives?

1047
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,694
I hope so.

1048
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,830
Oh, thank you. That's wonderful.

1049
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,214
Dr. Corday, your
dinner has arrived.

1050
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,372
"Nice work, Mom."

1051
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,676
It's from Robert.

1052
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,711
Maybe we should have
someone taste it first.

1053
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,713
I'm so hungry.

1054
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,248
Pepperoni pizza.

1055
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:21,332
And ice cream.

1056
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:22,917
Cherry Garcia.

1057
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,941
Oh. Let's go with
the ice cream first.

1058
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:31,592
Oh, I had the most
difficult case today,

1059
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:33,727
and I got through it.

1060
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,596
Mm. Mm!

1061
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,122
That's good. Have some.

1062
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:41,769
Mm.

1063
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,705
Now that it's over, I'm thinking

1064
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,743
why do I have to prove that
a pregnant surgeon can...

1065
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,144
Can be competent?

1066
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:51,784
I don't know.

1067
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:56,633
I can operate until
the day I deliver.

1068
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,958
But what the hell for?

1069
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:07,817
So, as of now, I'm
officially on maternity leave.

1070
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,146
I'm going to rest,

1071
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,922
I'm gonna take care
of myself and my baby.

1072
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,837
Oops. No napkins.

1075

Mark, can I just sleep here?

1076
00:43:26,454 --> 00:43:28,999
I don't think I have
the strength to move.

1077
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,469
I don't think I have the
strength to carry you.

1078
00:43:33,395 --> 00:43:35,273
Keep it coming. Sorry.
