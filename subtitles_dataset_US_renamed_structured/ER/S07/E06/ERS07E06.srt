1
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:33,298
Dr. Kovac.

2
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,613
We couldn't find the left arm.

3
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,482
BP's 100/60. WOMAN: Pulse 120.

4
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,151
Okay. Sir!

5
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,453
Sir, you're gonna
have to settle down!

6
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,855
Settle down!

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,155
Fluids in the field?

8
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,758
Bolused a liter of saline
and gave him 10 of morphine.

9
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,077
Okay, now...

10
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,912
get another IV going.

11
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:55,231
Pre-op labs, serial crits,
type and cross times four.

12
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,266
Who's on for Trauma?

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,267
Benton's on at 7.

14
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,835
Okay, see if he is here yet.

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,969
I don't have a hand!

16
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,237
Where's my hand?!

17
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,439
Titrate another 10 of morphine.

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,275
Sir, you've gotta calm down!

19
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,426
Oh, man, that's gotta hurt.

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,961
I... I don't have a hand!

21
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,612
Not gonna be
playing the flute again.

22
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,931
That bastard shot me!

23
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:11,982
With what? A howitzer?

24
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,283
Shotgun, point-blank range.

25
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,267
Page Ortho. Get an O.R.

26
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,369
I need my hand! I need my hand!

27
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,638
Found it, but I don't know
what you're gonna sew it to.

28
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,275
Sir, settle down. BENTON:
Get some restraints.

29
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,544
Out on the corner, 6:30
in the morning, selling rock.

30
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,462
You've got a regular
pharmacy, don't you?

31
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,580
My... My hand!

32
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:28,899
And a gun.

33
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,466
Selling drugs is dangerous.

34
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,550
Malucci, get over here.

35
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:33,320
Do you have this now?

36
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,438
Yeah, go.

37
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,473
All right. Deflate the BP cuff.

38
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,230
I had a tough week with my kid.

39
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:47,466
He's 14, and he's
been getting high.

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,836
It's tough for me
to lecture him.

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,204
He knows I'm sober now,

42
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:55,909
but it was only two years
ago I was high all the time.

43
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,212
Now when I try to talk to
him, he just walks away

44
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,814
or he screams at me.

45
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:05,301
Tells me I have no right
to talk to him about it.

46
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,304
I think he's probably
right, you know,

47
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,690
after all I put them through.

48
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,409
Hey, I got the perfect
plan for killing off Romano.

49
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,811
We wrap the hand around
the gun, pull the trigger,

50
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,747
it's got this guy's
prints on it. Huh?

51
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,382
Put down the hand, Malucci.

52
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,618
When do we get another
opportunity like this?

53
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,486
Put down the damn hand.

54
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,988
Listen, when there's
a patient on the table,

55
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,223
I want respect, all right?

56
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,392
Respect for the patient
and respect for me.

57
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,027
Respect for a
drug-dealing banger?

58
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,512
The only thing I wanna
hear from you is the medicine.

59
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,137
You say so, Pete.

60
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,933
When you're addressing me,

61
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,802
it's "Yes, Dr. Benton.
No, Dr. Benton."

62
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,904
Are we clear?

63
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,646
Hey, Brian. Sign my card?

64
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,815
Yeah.

65
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,250
There you go. Thanks.

66
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,451
You were doing a crossword.

67
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,754
I was listening.

68
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,856
You know, this isn't
my first meeting.

69
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,124
I had months of this in rehab.

70
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,159
When's the last time you shared?

71
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,527
I'll get up tomorrow.

72
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,895
There are other meetings.

73
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,631
No, you're right.
I'll share tomorrow.

74
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,232
I used to go to one
at Saint Michael's.

75
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:10,834
It seemed like it
had more addicts.

76
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,103
I like this one.
It's convenient.

77
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:15,805
I thought you might feel more
comfortable around NA people.

78
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,540
I go to meetings,
I take my meds,

79
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,208
I pee in cups when
they ask me to.

80
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,577
If you want me to get up
and share, I'll do that too.

81
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,768
I'll do it tomorrow.

82
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,463
Hey. Hi.

83
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,221
Busy night? Mmm. Not bad.

84
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,785
Any messy leftovers?

85
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,688
Well, there's a hypersexual
dementia guy in Curtain 3.

86
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:39,689
He's fast.

87
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,146
Thanks for the warning.

88
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,600
Hey, uh, you and
Kovac still going out?

89
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,385
Not many secrets down here, huh?

90
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,754
No.

91
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:56,122
Is he doing okay?

92
00:04:56,146 --> 00:05:00,065
It's just he seems a little off.

93
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,883
I'm sure he's fine.

94
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,482
Good. See you later.

95
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,754
Bye.

96
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,119
I always hate
mornings like this.

97
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,255
Good and slow. Just
the way I like 'em.

98
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,723
Calm before the storm?

99
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,593
Always means it'll get crazy
before the end of your shift.

100
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,928
Hey, Frank. Call Security.

101
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,730
Mike passed out in
the linen room again.

102
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,231
Mad Mike? He's back?

103
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,133
Back and unbelievably stinky.

104
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,301
No need for Security.

105
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,604
I threw him out of
there twice yesterday.

106
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:32,475
And tell Housekeeping to
keep that damn door locked.

107
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,810
Frank, what do you got?

108
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,212
Ah, a little homeless helper.
Just speeds things along.

109
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,280
Give me that.

110
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,314
I'm not gonna hit him.

111
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,404
Give me it.

112
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,019
Kerry, remember
I'm off today at 6.

113
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,522
How could I forget? You
mentioned it three times.

114
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,957
Well, uh, actually
just two, counting now.

115
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,759
Cutting school early
today, Dr. Greene?

116
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,160
It's on the schedule.

117
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,162
Going to a professional
conference, I hope.

118
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,564
No, a personal one.

119
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,850
Oh, you and Lizzie going off
somewhere romantic again?

120
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,519
I put in the request weeks ago.

121
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:00,853
No doubt.

122
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,023
Frank, those films
back on my elbow lac?

123
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,457
Wha...? Where's Frank?

124
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,892
Out harassing the homeless.

125
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,893
What?

126
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,917
Old cop habits
are hard to break.

127
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,432
Good morning.

128
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,534
Hi.

129
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:15,968
You wanna get some lunch?

130
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,670
Kerry, paramedics
have a 13-year-old.

131
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,472
Fell on her way to
school. Two minutes out.

132
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,508
Okay. Luka, you take
it. Chuny, go with him.

133
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:22,509
Sure.

134
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:23,910
Lunch?

135
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,678
Yeah, sure.

136
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:27,880
If there's time.

137
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,382
Abby, page Corday.

138
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,084
She might have a
herniated disk in 3.

139
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,569
Kerry? Yeah, I know. Six.

140
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,904
I should have grabbed a coat.

141
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,906
It's gonna be snowing
again before you know it.

142
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,109
Excuse me. Hi.

143
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,311
Is this the way to the
ER? I'm just a little lost.

144
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,712
This is the ambulance entrance.

145
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,046
Walk-ins are in front. Oh.

146
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,399
Thirteen-year-old
girl, ground-level fall,

147
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:48,501
oriented times three, no LOC.
- I'm okay.

148
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:51,588
School wouldn't let her back
until she got checked out.

149
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,838
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

150
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:53,940
What's her name?

151
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:55,074
Teresa.

152
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,376
Did you pass out when you fell?

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,511
No. Around the front, ma'am.

154
00:06:58,535 --> 00:06:59,512
No, no. It's all right.

155
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,780
Authorized personnel only.

156
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,019
My daughter works here.

157
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,067
Excuse me. Hi. Hi.

158
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,269
I'm Maggie. You are?

159
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,671
Uh, Chuny. Your
daughter works in the ER?

160
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,772
Yes, she's a doctor.

161
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,774
Frank, can you
help this lady? Yeah.

162
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,676
Chuny, come back
later. I've got bagels.

163
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,877
Okay.

164
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,129
I've got lots of 'em.

165
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:17,513
Catch you sleeping there again,

166
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,115
I'll chain cinder
blocks to your legs

167
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,068
and toss your worthless
carcass off Navy Pier!

168
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,269
Do you have any pain?

169
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,171
No, please, I just
wanna go back to school.

170
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,074
Let the doctor check
you out. She loves school.

171
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,175
What grade are you in?

172
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,327
Seventh. I'm missing a test.

173
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,663
Yeah. CBC, Chem-7 and UA.

174
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,631
Is there something
wrong with her neck?

175
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,932
Just a precaution.

176
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,919
She has some pain,
but it's probably nothing.

177
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,807
Okay. This is gonna
take a few minutes.

178
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,191
Mr. Ruiz, why don't
you get a cup of coffee?

179
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,845
I wanna stay with my daughter.

180
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,346
You can come right back.

181
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,999
Deborah, will you show Mr. Ruiz
where the coffee machines are?

182
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:54,067
This way, sir.

183
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,185
Honey, I'll be back in a minute.

184
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,689
Sir.

185
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,844
Any chance you're pregnant
before I get an x-ray?

186
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,251
No.

187
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:10,449
Do you have anyone
you'd like to designate

188
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:11,583
as the adoptive parents?

189
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,820
I need to find someone
to adopt my child?

190
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,122
No, but a lot of women
already have someone in mind.

191
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:19,091
Uh, a family member,
an acquaintance.

192
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,093
No. No one.

193
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:22,516
Can I be candid?

194
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,565
In my experience,
it's very unusual

195
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,267
for a woman of Asian descent

196
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,838
to offer a child
up for adoption.

197
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,505
We've found that
most Asian women

198
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,374
end up changing their minds.

199
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,798
Oftentimes at the last minute.

200
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,117
Did you bring me out
here just to make sure

201
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,918
I wouldn't change my mind?

202
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,405
Lots of women never
make it past this bench.

203
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,173
I can't keep this child.

204
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,397
Have you discussed
adoption with your family?

205
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,283
No. You really should.

206
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:59,014
And what about the father?

207
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,656
Is he prepared to sign
away his parental rights?

208
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,026
Does he know you're pregnant?

209
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,896
Well, he may want
to keep the baby.

210
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,677
What if I don't want him to?

211
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,102
He's the father. He has rights.

212
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,052
Hi. Hi.

213
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,220
Can I, uh, help you?

214
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:22,922
I'm making a fresh
pot. Be ready in a sec.

215
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:25,090
It's Kenyan,
fresh-ground. Smell that.

216
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:26,993
Excuse me. Excuse
me, who are you?

217
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,060
Lord!

218
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:29,629
Maggie Wyczenski.
You want a bagel?

219
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,930
I've got lots of bagels.

220
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:33,165
Let's see, what kind would
you like here? Any kind.

221
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:35,134
No, no, it's not
ready yet. In a minute.

222
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,235
This area's for ER staff.

223
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,236
Bagel? Yeah.

224
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,604
Sesame? The area is for staff.

225
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:39,805
No. Raisin. You got raisin?

226
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,508
Malik, go. Get out of here.

227
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,610
Excuse me, you are not
supposed to be in here.

228
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,562
Now, it's fine. Really.

229
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,549
My daughter's a doctor
here. Abby Wyczenski...

230
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:51,116
Uh, no. Lockhart, actually.

231
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,953
Abby Lockhart.

232
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:56,005
I just heard this loud pop.

233
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,440
How would you describe
the pain, Mr. Patterson?

234
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,209
Al, please.

235
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,979
Is the pain sharp or dull, Al?

236
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,580
Well, it's a bit of
a bastard, really.

237
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,315
It's like a burning
down my right leg.

238
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,217
Mm-hm. Any numbness?

239
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,085
Yeah, a bit.

240
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,888
What were you doing
when you heard the pop?

241
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,372
Surfing.

242
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:14,840
I know I'm a bit old for it,

243
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,126
but I've been
surfing all my life.

244
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,260
Is this tender?

245
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,928
Oh, yes. Very.

246
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,232
Oh, it's hard to give it up.

247
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,635
Have you ever
paddled out yourself?

248
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,136
Can't say I have.

249
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,654
You were surfing Lake Michigan?

250
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,197
No. Kauai. That's,
uh, where I live.

251
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:38,531
I'm in town for the, uh,
sportswear convention.

252
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,968
Plane trip nearly
killed me with this back.

253
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,472
Will you get me a
safety pin, Abby?

254
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:47,774
That's London, is it?

255
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,709
Just trying to pick...
Pick the accent.

256
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,179
Sussex. I went to London
for university. Yours?

257
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,448
Zambia. Born and raised.

258
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:56,849
My father was a doctor.

259
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,634
You're gonna feel a
couple of pinpricks.

260
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,502
Tell me if they feel the same.

261
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,571
Abby. Yeah?

262
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,872
Your mother's here.

263
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,640
Duller on the right
than on the left.

264
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,008
Your mother. She's out front.

265
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,977
Pull on my hand
with your right foot.

266
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,144
No, she's not.

267
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,728
Nice lady. Kind of a looker.

268
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,236
My mother's in
Florida. Maybe she was.

269
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,705
Right now she's serving
breakfast out of Admit.

270
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,673
Doesn't seem to know
you're back to nursing.

271
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:23,609
You two don't stay in
touch much, I guess.

272
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,778
You know, he's
flying in the air...

273
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,713
That's not my mother.

274
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,215
Ooh, yeah.

275
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,450
Like, 65 miles
an hour. And the...

276
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,394
I have no idea
who that woman is.

277
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:37,828
So I'm walking down
the aisle like this...

278
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,879
Looks clear. Okay, Teresa.

279
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,863
Now this terrible
thing can come off.

280
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,584
So she's okay. Can we go?

281
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,818
Her neck is fine,

282
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,388
but I need to do a
complete neurological exam.

283
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,856
Well, how long is
that gonna take?

284
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,624
I gotta get back to work.

285
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,928
It may take a few hours.

286
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,128
I'm sorry, Daddy.

287
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,513
Forget about it.

288
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,398
I gotta call them. Is
there a phone around?

289
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,988
Pay phone in the waiting area.

290
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,176
I need to examine your face.

291
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:12,091
Any pain here?

292
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:13,592
No.

293
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,499
Here? It doesn't hurt anymore.

294
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,635
You worried about your father?

295
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,719
I'm sure he wants us to be
certain that you're all right.

296
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,342
Will you stand up, please?

297
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,167
Okay, now lift your arms
up, keeping your eyes shut.

298
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:36,916
Higher?

299
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,172
No, that's fine.

300
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,290
Keep your eyes
closed for a little longer.

301
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,662
<i>All right, final calls.</i>

302
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,665
Everybody finished
with these bagels here?

303
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,434
Wait, wait. There's still some
fresh-squeezed orange juice.

304
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,736
Fresh-squeezed?
Yes, fresh-squeezed.

305
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,072
Think I'd use that
concentrate? There you go.

306
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,340
Try that. Thank you.

307
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,774
Frank?

308
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:05,611
Frank?

309
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:08,046
How much longer do you
think my daughter will be?

310
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,415
I don't know. I...

311
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,149
I think she's still
with a patient.

312
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,184
All right.

313
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,552
She'll be out as
soon as she can.

314
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:14,820
I'll be over here.

315
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,589
May I? Yes. Eat up.

316
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,591
Thank you.

317
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,991
Who's that?

318
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:22,561
Some nut job, claims
she's Abby's mom.

319
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:23,929
Weaver called Psych.

320
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:26,131
No kidding? Nice legs, huh?

321
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:28,834
Mmm. Mother-daughter
fantasies come instantly to mind.

322
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:33,305
Dr. Malucci, I think we have
patients needing your attention.

323
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,573
Actually, chief, we don't.

324
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,992
Rescue 54 is two minutes
out. GSW to the chest.

325
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,160
There. Now you're busy.

326
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,928
Gunshot wound. Yes!

327
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,314
Not on your own.
I can handle it.

328
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:43,482
Where's Benton?
Surgery. Corday's around...

329
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:44,817
Okay, find her. Go.

330
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,386
I'm ordering a CT on a
girl while I call the police.

331
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,454
Head trauma?

332
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:49,989
No. I'm just stalling for time.

333
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,590
I think her father's
abusing her,

334
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:52,992
and he wants to take her home.

335
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:54,026
Okay, send her up.

336
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,828
When the cops show,
cancel the procedure.

337
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:57,696
Okay. Still no Psych?

338
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,332
I could page 'em again.

339
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:00,766
Abby has no idea who she is?

340
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,550
Said she'd never
seen her before.

341
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,975
Hi. Hi.

342
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,610
Well, I think the
bagels were a hit.

343
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,611
Everybody loved them.

344
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,246
I put everything in bags.

345
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,914
I put it in the refrigerator.

346
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,315
Great. Go in there whenever.

347
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,951
Can you stop for one minute?

348
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,552
There was a lot of
leftovers in there.

349
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,320
I took them all out
and threw them away.

350
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:23,321
You can't leave that...

351
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,824
Can I talk to you
for just a minute?

352
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,509
Oh, my God.

353
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,012
Look how pretty you are.

354
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,113
You have a beautiful face.

355
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,782
Just pick your
hair back a little bit.

356
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,101
Maggie, I need you to
stay in our waiting area.

357
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,321
Could I work on you?
That's what I do...

358
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,308
I can't have you
back here by yourself.

359
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,143
I'm an artist. I do
collages and things.

360
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,794
But I do makeovers
to make money.

361
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,812
I could make you over.

362
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:49,531
I cannot have you
back here by yourself.

363
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,599
I'm waiting for Abby.

364
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,634
Okay. It's just right
across the hall.

365
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,237
There are sick people
there. Maggie, the thing is,

366
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,406
Abby says that you
are not her mother.

367
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,009
Of course I'm her mother.

368
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,628
You know, why don't we
gather up your things...

369
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,797
No, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

370
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,099
So she...

371
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:09,757
She... She said she's
not my daughter?

372
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:11,737
Please, let's go.

373
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:13,355
No!

374
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,724
Where is she? Abby!

375
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,808
Damn it! Damn it! Maggie?

376
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,812
Abby! Abby, where are you?!

377
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,112
Maggie, take it easy.

378
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,414
Abby, it's your mother!

379
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:23,415
Maggie, it's all right.

380
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,416
Abby!

381
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,984
Maggie, you cannot
go back there!

382
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,986
Abby! Frank, call Security!

383
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,722
Get Psych down here now!

384
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,023
Abby!

385
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,259
God, please pick
up. Please pick up.

386
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:35,761
<i>This is Eric. Leave a
message after the beep.</i>

387
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,998
Eric, if you're there, could
you pick up the phone, please?

388
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:45,438
It's Abby. Eric? Hello? Hello?

389
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:47,806
Okay. Eric, Mom is in Chicago.

390
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,408
What the hell is she
doing in Chicago?

391
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,378
Because I can't... I
can't take her now.

392
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:55,403
Okay? She can't be here. I...

393
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,302
Well, Al, I'm afraid
you've herniated a disk.

394
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,538
That doesn't sound too good.

395
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,123
With the weakness in your foot

396
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:07,359
you'll need surgery to eliminate
the pressure on your nerve.

397
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,594
Can it wait till I get home?

398
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,836
I wouldn't suggest it.

399
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,489
I don't want back surgery.

400
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:19,938
Then I'd recommend
an outpatient procedure.

401
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,395
Endoscopic surgery.

402
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,541
And how long will that take?

403
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,044
An hour.

404
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,930
I'd insert a small endoscope
into your spinal column

405
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,549
and remove fragments
of the herniated disk.

406
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,518
Couple of stitches
and a Band-Aid.

407
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,338
Dr. Corday, got a
GSW to the chest.

408
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,473
Benton's still upstairs.

409
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,241
Okay.

410
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,109
Will I be able to surf again?

411
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,029
I don't see why not.

412
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:45,686
If you'll excuse me...

413
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,135
Call the O.R.

414
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,937
Book a room for an
endoscopic discectomy.

415
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:55,874
Abby! Abby! Abby Lockhart! Abby!

416
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:58,911
Maggie! Maggie.
Maggie, calm down.

417
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,279
What the hell is all that about?

418
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,114
Abby! Abby!

419
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,115
You need to calm down.

420
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,183
Abby!

421
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,484
Calm down, ma'am. Abby!

422
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:07,069
Somebody... No, there's...

423
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,637
Hey, I think
someone's calling you.

424
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,671
Abby! Abby!

425
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,356
Is there someone we can call...?

426
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,310
Maggie! Maggie! You
need to calm down.

427
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,311
Have a seat, ma'am.

428
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,345
Calm down.

429
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,847
Have a seat.
All right. All right.

430
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,948
Take a breath.

431
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,083
Okay. All right.
All right. I'm fine.

432
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,267
Abby!

433
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,955
Abby.

434
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,419
There she is.
That's my daughter.

435
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,720
Hi, Mom.

436
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,232
Abdomen's soft. No rebound.

437
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,368
Please! I don't wanna die!

438
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,438
Hey, hey, partner, pipe down.
I can barely hear anything.

439
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,039
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

440
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,074
Trachea midline.

441
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,425
Trauma panel,
O-neg, cross times 10.

442
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:48,627
He needs a chest tube.

443
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,196
Mother, may I? Huh? Chest tube?

444
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,340
Step in.

445
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,567
Look at you. Look at you.

446
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,336
You're still so pretty.

447
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,737
What are you doing here, Maggie?

448
00:17:58,761 --> 00:17:59,804
Came to see you.

449
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,173
How'd you get here? On the bus.

450
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:02,191
I came on the bus.

451
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,176
Does Eric know where you are?

452
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,978
Oh, you know how busy
your brother always is.

453
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,313
So you just left?

454
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,949
And... And you didn't call.

455
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,584
Why...? Why didn't you call
me and tell me you were coming?

456
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,320
I was worried about you.

457
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,288
I heard about you
and Richard separating.

458
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,592
A year ago. I...

459
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,448
Yeah. I'm divorced.

460
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,797
Oh, my God.

461
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,632
What about your job?

462
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:30,369
The department store.

463
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:34,206
My daughter is more
important than any stupid job.

464
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,575
Oh, you know what? I left
all my stuff in the coffee room.

465
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,928
I'm gonna go get it. And
you and I are gonna talk.

466
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,896
I'm working.

467
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,766
I know. I know. I know. I know.

468
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,168
But I'm gonna wait for you.

469
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,059
And we're gonna
talk. I'll be back.

470
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,650
Frank said that you
said you didn't know her.

471
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,797
How long has she been bipolar?

472
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:13,834
Since I was a kid.

473
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,716
And she's off her meds?

474
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,486
Apparently.

475
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,971
I called the inn. They
said the weather's great.

476
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,239
Getting away for the weekend?

477
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,808
Pending any
last-minute complications.

478
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,611
He means me. And there won't be.

479
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,246
Hemoglobin's 11.

480
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,469
How much you get out?

481
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,751
Only 700 cc's.

482
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,002
He's losing blood somewhere.

483
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,386
Pressure's dropping, 60 palp.

484
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,805
No breath sounds on the right.

485
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,442
Bullet must have tumbled
to the right side. Malucci...

486
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,694
Intubate and put in
a second chest tube.

487
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,912
Right you are.

488
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,280
Okay, we need a chest tube tray.

489
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:49,798
Tension hemopneumo?

490
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:50,971
Yeah. Let's find out.

491
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,386
So where you guys going?

492
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,604
Wisconsin. Lake Hatteras.

493
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,089
Heard you had a kid.

494
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,957
GSW. It's surgical.

495
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,158
So you've got it?

496
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,649
Three docs, no waiting.

497
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,914
Oh, oh.

498
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,648
He's bleeding
into his right chest.

499
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,284
Lost his pressure.

500
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,286
God, I love this guy.

501
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,686
He's an entire medical education

502
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,950
in one convenient
package, you know.

503
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,060
Jackie?

504
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,697
Oh, God. Cleo, do you
know where Peter is?

505
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,766
I think he's up in the O.R.
Why are you down here?

506
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,268
I've been trying to reach
him. I told the man at the desk.

507
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,003
What happened?
What's the matter?

508
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,372
Well, they called me at
work and I came right away.

509
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,774
It's Jesse.

510
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,542
They said that he
was brought here.

511
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,060
Jesse? Your son?

512
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:38,080
Man over there said that he
was brought in a few minutes ago.

513
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,130
That he was shot.

514
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,773
Somebody shot my boy.

515
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,727
Where's Dr. Benton?

516
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,851
Um, 2, with Spencer on a hernia.

517
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,537
What the hell are you doing?

518
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,456
Found a hole in
the right ventricle.

519
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,146
Let's cross-clamp the aorta.

520
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,793
Thank God for bangers, huh?

521
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,278
Better than a good shooting
war. Come on. Get out of my way.

522
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:29,982
Hey. Hey, that's my patient.

523
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:31,049
Peter, we've got it.

524
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:32,667
All right, I'll oversew it.

525
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,785
2-0 silk. Move!

526
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,637
Peter, Dr. Malucci's assisting.

527
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,022
The guy's not
even gonna make it.

528
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,123
It's his nephew. What?

529
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:42,583
- It's Jackie's son, Jesse.
- Oh, my God.

530
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:48,508
Where the hell's the 2-0 silk?

531
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,037
Hey, Frank. Half day?

532
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,239
Twelve to 12. Much going on?

533
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:55,941
Pretty slow.

534
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:58,143
My mother's here.

535
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,477
Y-you weren't expecting her?

536
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:03,248
No. Um, do you
have a few minutes?

537
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:04,316
Sure.

538
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,485
Pregnancy test
on that Ruiz girl.

539
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,144
Damn it. Where the
hell are the police?

540
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:15,027
I'm a few minutes early. You
want to grab some coffee?

541
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,628
Yeah. That'd be great. Okay.

542
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:17,829
<i>Still not filling.</i>

543
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:19,197
There has to be another hole.

544
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,567
Left ventricle is macerated
on the posterior surface.

545
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,001
More 2-0 silk. Come on!

546
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,703
Blood's pouring
out of the right chest.

547
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:25,937
Crack open his other side.

548
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:27,272
Hold on. Peter!

549
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:30,041
I can get it. Somebody
cut off that damn alarm.

550
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:31,109
There's no time, Peter.

551
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,845
Another thoracotomy tray?

552
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,681
Lizzie, you ordered a
percutaneous discectomy

553
00:22:35,705 --> 00:22:37,315
on a 50-year-old?
Robert, I'm busy.

554
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:40,085
It looks like Doctors Greene
and Benton have this covered.

555
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,709
Why don't you step out, please.

556
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:52,964
That's Peter's
nephew in there. Whoa.

557
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:55,934
And you've opened up
both sides of his chest, huh?

558
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,252
Well, anyway...

559
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,888
Patterson is a candidate
for open lumbar disk surgery.

560
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,074
Endoscopic surgery's
the best treatment.

561
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:03,508
And it's faster too.

562
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:06,761
Yes, it is. No dramatic muscle
dissection, no bone removal.

563
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,513
And you can still
ditch out of here in time

564
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:11,099
for your romantic weekend.

565
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,168
What the hell are
you insinuating?

566
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,370
That I'd choose an
inappropriate course of surgery

567
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,938
to accommodate my weekend plans?

568
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,673
You said it, not me.

569
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,925
I've got to get back.

570
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:23,127
Gloves.

571
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,464
The bullet tore up the
hilum. Foley catheter.

572
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,784
I'll throw in a purse
string. No. I'll do it.

573
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,119
What was going on out there?
- Nothing.

574
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,505
Heart's not filling.

575
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,607
All right. Uh... We're
going to bypass.

576
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,709
I'll take the aorta. You
take the femoral vein.

577
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,094
We need ice!

578
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:42,181
Malucci, get four
basins full. What for?

579
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:44,366
We'll pack the head to
preserve brain function.

580
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,018
That'll work? Just get it!

581
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,110
She sold cosmetics.

582
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,746
But she used to
get fired all the time.

583
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,615
What about your dad?

584
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:03,073
He split when I was
7. Couldn't take it.

585
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,056
She's an artist.

586
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,724
And when I was little
and she was manic,

587
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,560
it was fun, actually.

588
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,728
'Cause we would
do stuff like, uh,

589
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,964
camp out in the living room.

590
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,067
Actually really camp
out with tents and stuff.

591
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,320
We painted the walls
of the living room once.

592
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,810
This whole landscape. It was...

593
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,025
And then suddenly
everything would change.

594
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,061
She would start
screaming, crying, and...

595
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:30,595
Eric took the brunt of that.

596
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:32,331
He was much more
of a rebel than I was.

597
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:35,133
Eric is your brother? Yeah.

598
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:37,552
She<i> was</i> living
near him in Florida.

599
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,521
He's in the Air Force.

600
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,872
He's an air traffic controller.

601
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,913
Really? Yes.

602
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:51,149
And then she would get depressed
and just go to bed for weeks.

603
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:54,519
So by the age of 10 I had
figured out how to scam meals

604
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:57,444
off the neighbors so
Eric and I could eat.

605
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:00,843
Could get her some
help, you know.

606
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,728
Could get her on
lithium or Depakote.

607
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:06,119
No. She won't take the drugs.
She likes it when she's manic.

608
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:13,026
But I-I can't do this again.

609
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,017
I'm not strong enough.

610
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,823
Jackie? Jackie.

611
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,225
Did you find Peter?

612
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:35,977
Yes, he's in with the trauma
team working on Jesse now.

613
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,913
Oh, thank God. How is he?

614
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,266
He was shot in the chest.

615
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,085
We found some
bleeding around his heart

616
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,888
and Peter's trying
to repair it now.

617
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,422
His heart?

618
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,875
His condition is very grave.

619
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:54,535
They're working to stabilize him
so they can move him to the O.R.

620
00:25:56,906 --> 00:26:00,836
Oh, Lord. I...

621
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,538
Can I get you anything? No.

622
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,173
No. I should try Walt again.

623
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,474
He's out on a parts run,

624
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,543
and I don't know
what's keeping him.

625
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,979
Mrs. Robbins?

626
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,148
Is Jesse okay?

627
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,317
Get out.

628
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,824
Is he all right?

629
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:22,741
You don't get to
be here. Please...

630
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:25,410
Get out. Get out!

631
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,145
I don't want you here.

632
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,553
You get away from him.
You stay away from my son!

633
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,595
All right. The aortic
clamp is released.

634
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:47,537
Stop the bypass. Sponge
stick. Still has oozing.

635
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:52,320
I can't see.

636
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,806
I'll suction. All right.

637
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,797
Move the light.

638
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:01,680
He's bleeding out everywhere.

639
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,349
All right, uh, let's get a...

640
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,218
Uh... Give him a...

641
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:08,336
Give him a...

642
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,373
Give him two liters
of FFP and a...

643
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,691
A-a 10-pack of platelets.

644
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,692
He's not clotting.

645
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,794
We can reverse it.
Uh, more suction!

646
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:18,146
Pump's running dry.

647
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,166
We're not keeping
up with blood loss.

648
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,472
Well, squeeze it in faster!

649
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,626
Finally! Where you been?

650
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,361
Been waiting here for hours.

651
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,263
You said you were
gonna run a few tests,

652
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,882
and then you disappear.

653
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,768
My eye is just a little
sore. Otherwise, I feel okay.

654
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,603
I'm gonna lose my job,

655
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,705
and we've been
sitting here for hours.

656
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:44,806
Mr. Ruiz.

657
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,491
Mr. Ruiz, would you
step out in the hall?

658
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:47,993
Who the hell is this?

659
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:50,497
Please, sir. Out in the hall.

660
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:53,286
Teresa, you wait here.

661
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,837
I'm Detective
Tancredi, Chicago P.D.

662
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:01,840
Dr. Kovac here is concerned
about the extensive bruising

663
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:05,710
he discovered on your daughter's
body when he examined her.

664
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:06,878
What?

665
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,681
She has bruises all over
her back and stomach.

666
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:10,865
Yeah, from her fall.

667
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,940
They're at least a week old.

668
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:15,909
You think I beat my little girl?

669
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:20,146
Oh, my God.

670
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:26,987
I love my daughter.
I would never...

671
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:32,103
No. Mm-mm.

672
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,629
You're wrong.
You are very wrong.

673
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:41,468
More lap pads. I can't see.

674
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,683
If I can put one more suture in,

675
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:48,141
I can stop the
ventricular bleeding.

676
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:52,145
Cut.

677
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:59,612
Chest cavity's
filling with blood.

678
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,634
He's oozing everywhere.

679
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:07,222
Come on, Jesse. Come on, man.

680
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,612
Don't give up on me.

681
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,662
Jesse...

682
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:16,164
Come on, man.

683
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,255
Don't give up, please.

684
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,424
Come on, Jesse.

685
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,848
Peter...

686
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,422
Peter.

687
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,493
No!

688
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:15,829
No!

689
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:22,781
No!

690
00:30:22,805 --> 00:30:24,537
No!

691
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,618
Oh, Peter. Shhh.

692
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,974
If I work Christmas
Day, I get Christmas Eve

693
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,509
and New Year's Eve off.

694
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,077
New Year's Day too.

695
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,113
Yeah, right. You buy that?

696
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,369
Hi.

697
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,885
Uh, hey.

698
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,753
D., can you...? Can you
guys give us a minute?

699
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,377
Yeah. You bet.

700
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,223
Um...

701
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:01,920
So...?

702
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,693
Uh, yeah.

703
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:07,247
I'm sorry. I...

704
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,316
Guess I shoulda told you sooner.

705
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,261
Well, I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to say.

706
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,653
I wanna give him
up for adoption,

707
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,423
but I need your
permission to do it.

708
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,647
Him?

709
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,014
Will you sign the paperwork?

710
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:31,888
Please?

711
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,577
Where's Peter?

712
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,912
Still talking to his sister.

713
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,814
God, what a tragedy.

714
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,281
You didn't recognize him?

715
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,751
I only met him
once. You all right?

716
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,469
Headache.

717
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,205
Oh. Your neck's still
sore from hockey.

718
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,974
Next time I'm gonna
go early and warm up.

719
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:59,294
My O.R.'s free.

720
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,779
You still wanna go?

721
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:03,965
I have an outpatient procedure.
Should take less than an hour.

722
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,184
Okay. You know, it's
Friday. If we leave before 6...

723
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,308
One hour, I promise.

724
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,890
Dr. Greene? Yep?

725
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:14,492
What should we do with the body?

726
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,361
It's a mess. I don't
know where Benton went.

727
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,429
Police been here?
Not that I've seen.

728
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,831
You can't do anything
until they sign off on it.

729
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,200
It's a real freak show, though.

730
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:24,768
Well, why don't you
pull a sheet over it?

731
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,354
You think he heard me? Who?

732
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,607
Benton. You know, all that stuff
I was saying about his nephew

733
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,242
before I knew.

734
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,732
I don't know.

735
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,681
Excuse me. Yeah?

736
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,400
Is Teresa Ruiz
here? Who are you?

737
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,303
A friend. They brought
her here from school.

738
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,537
She never went
back. I got worried.

739
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,823
Up in Radiology.
You can't miss it.

740
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:48,225
Just look for a long
line of pissed-off people.

741
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:50,411
Could you tell her
Vinnie stopped by?

742
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,231
Yeah, Vinnie. Right.

743
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:55,738
So where's the best surfing
spot for a beginner like me?

744
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,453
Waikiki.

745
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,322
But you've got to
get out there early.

746
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,125
Damn. It's bleeding. Cautery.

747
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,311
It's 10 to 6. I know.

748
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:09,480
Pressure's dropping, 100/80.

749
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,984
Okay. Let's run
in another liter.

750
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,708
I can see the disk.

751
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,910
Can't get a good hold of it.

752
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,016
There we go. Got it.

753
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:32,203
Oh, we got some leaking fluid.

754
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:34,138
It's just irrigation solution.

755
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:35,957
It's looking good.

756
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,994
Let's get ready with 4-0 Vicryl.

757
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,561
We're almost
there, Mr. Patterson.

758
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,763
You'll be hanging 10
again before you know it.

759
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,466
Hanging 10.

760
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,768
So you do know
something about surfing.

761
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,238
Only what I've picked up
watching Frankie Avalon movies.

762
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,146
What are you doing?

763
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,349
Waiting for you.

764
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,672
Can I see?

765
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,612
They're beautiful. Yeah.

766
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,816
May I see?

767
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,753
This is Dr. Legaspi.

768
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,533
Psychiatrist?

769
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,003
Yes.

770
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,672
I don't need you.

771
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,191
Abby tells me you
have bipolar disorder.

772
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:28,943
How long have you
been off your meds?

773
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,611
Am I off my meds?

774
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,829
Why'd you stop?

775
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:34,415
I don't like lithium, all right?

776
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,668
It makes me tired. It makes
me sick to my stomach.

777
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:40,922
I can't do these on
drugs. I can't do anything.

778
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:44,463
What medication are
you on now? Prozac.

779
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,045
Uh, I was depressed.

780
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:50,532
A-a doctor at my HMO,
he gave them to me.

781
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,384
Stay away from antidepressants.
They trigger manic episodes.

782
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:54,719
She knows.

783
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:57,488
Okay, I'll write you a
prescription for Depakote

784
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,873
if you promise me that you'll
stay away from the Prozac.

785
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:00,992
Sure.

786
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,827
Great.

787
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,378
I will go get you the scrip.

788
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,781
You okay?

789
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,204
Thank you.

790
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,793
So are you gonna take it?

791
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,250
You bet.

792
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,026
What's this?

793
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,431
I called. That's enough for
a bus ticket back to Tampa.

794
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:39,147
Oh, don't. Really,
don't. Don't start.

795
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,681
Mom, I can't have you here.

796
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,883
I told you that last time.
I can't do it anymore.

797
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,385
Honey, I... I came
here to be with you

798
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,087
after what happened
with Richard.

799
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,406
I'm fine. Just please go home.

800
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,326
Why do you wanna hurt
me? Why do you wanna...?

801
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,194
I didn't ask you to come here.

802
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,929
You just showed up.

803
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,097
Off your medication again,

804
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,965
wearing a dress that
would look ridiculous

805
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,200
on a woman half your age,

806
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:02,386
running around the hospital
screaming, humiliating me.

807
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,721
Why, why, why?

808
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,473
Oh, now the crying
and... And the depression.

809
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,809
And you know what comes next?

810
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,710
Weeks of me worrying
that I'm gonna come home

811
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,095
and find you dead in my bathtub.

812
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,114
Or maybe with your
head stuck in my oven.

813
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,616
All right!

814
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,972
All right!

815
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,586
All right.

816
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,690
Fine.

817
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,624
I'm out.

818
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:37,791
Dr. Benton?

819
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,472
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry. I...

820
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,500
I didn't know he
was your nephew.

821
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:51,223
Get away from me.

822
00:36:52,594 --> 00:36:54,939
Look, I-I just thought
he was some banger.

823
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,593
Six o'clock on the dot.

824
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,394
You're ready to go?
I'm waiting for you.

825
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,930
What is that?

826
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:03,932
Hey, stop it!

827
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:07,552
Stop it! Peter! Hey!

828
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:10,287
Kerry, you okay? You all right?

829
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,789
Peter!

830
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,992
Whoa. Hey! Hey, easy!
What the hell's going on?!

831
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:16,749
Malucci! Stop.

832
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,853
I was just trying to apologize.

833
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,177
Says her father
never touched her.

834
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,712
Says she falls down a lot.

835
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,281
And you believe her?

836
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,016
Doesn't matter what I believe.

837
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,718
Court's not gonna remove her
from the home when he denies it

838
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,220
and she says it's not him.

839
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,122
Can I talk to her?

840
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,445
Sure.

841
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,594
What happened this morning?

842
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,231
I fell down.

843
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,301
What about the other bruises?

844
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:30,773
My father wouldn't hurt me.

845
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:35,138
Sometimes people who love us

846
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:37,508
hurt us anyway.

847
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:40,644
Sometimes they can't
control their anger.

848
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:43,981
No, they don't mean
to, but they do hurt us.

849
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,417
It's a sickness.

850
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:49,341
And something
they need help with.

851
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:55,875
Do you know you're pregnant?

852
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,220
We ran a test.

853
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:09,406
I told him this would happen.

854
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,042
He wouldn't listen to me.

855
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:13,211
Listen to you about what?

856
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:14,946
He won't wear a condom.

857
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,263
He won't.

858
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,105
That's what we fight
about all the time.

859
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,954
That's when he hits me.
But he doesn't mean to.

860
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:25,156
Your father?

861
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,175
No.

862
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,710
Not my dad.

863
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,778
Then who?

864
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,947
Vinnie. Vinnie?

865
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,348
My boyfriend.

866
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,704
We're in homeroom together.

867
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:41,172
He... He's in the seventh grade?

868
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:43,557
He'd never hurt me on purpose.

869
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,993
He just gets upset.

870
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,366
He loves me.

871
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,799
<i>What is it?</i>

872
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:52,817
I was halfway to my car.

873
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:54,484
Patient's complaining
of backache.

874
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:56,787
What patient? Patterson,
lumbar discectomy.

875
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,088
Dr. Corday's case? Yes.

876
00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:59,924
Perfect. She signed
him out to me. Great.

877
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,591
Mr., uh, Patterson, I understand

878
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:03,060
you're having a
bit of a headache.

879
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:04,394
You want a couple of Tylenol?

880
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:07,198
Ugh. My back,
it's... It's killing me.

881
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:08,465
Okay. Roll over on your side.

882
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,038
I... I can't move my legs.

883
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:16,207
Can you feel this? No.

884
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:17,675
You, help me roll him.

885
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,398
Okay, you're
leaking spinal fluid.

886
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,500
It's probably a cord
compression. Get him to O.R.

887
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,157
And find me Elizabeth Corday.

888
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,307
Mark, it's lovely.

889
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,831
Nice big bed.

890
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,533
Let's see the bathroom.

891
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,949
Hey, the tub. It's huge.

892
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,517
We can both fit in it.

893
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,253
Hello?

894
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,621
Yeah. Elizabeth.

895
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,578
Who is it? I don't know.

896
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,232
Hello. This is Elizabeth Corday.

897
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:56,981
Elizabeth?

898
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:37,481
Where's your coat?

899
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:39,305
You look like you're
freezing to death.

900
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:43,504
I'm sorry.

901
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,344
All right? I'm sorry.

902
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:48,659
I've ruined everything. I know.

903
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:50,828
I've ruined everything.

904
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:54,365
And I've hurt you and
your brother so much.

905
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:56,951
I'm sorry. You have
every right to hate me.

906
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,936
Of course you hate me.

907
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,471
I don't hate you. I'm sorry.

908
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,406
I don't hate you,
Mom. I'm so sorry.

909
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,259
It's okay. I love you.
I love you so much.

910
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,262
You're my angel. My angel.

911
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:11,598
I never meant to hurt you.
I never meant to hurt you.

912
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,867
Please forgive me.
Oh, please forgive me.

913
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,458
I forgive you, Mom.

914
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:24,762
When you were born,
you were this little baby.

915
00:43:24,786 --> 00:43:27,097
It was like you were the
answer to all my prayers.

916
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:29,566
You were the answer
to all my prayers.

917
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,802
And I thought to
myself, I'll be okay now.

918
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:34,604
I'll be okay 'cause you're here.

919
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:39,109
I'll be okay. And I
held your little hands.

920
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,011
I loved you. God,
how I loved you.

921
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,846
I... I know. I'm so sorry.

922
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,815
I know. I'm so sorry.

923
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:45,938
Shhh.
