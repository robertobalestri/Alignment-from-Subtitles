1
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:31,992
Kerry. I'm gonna put a fresh
towel on the sink for you.

2
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:33,448
Okay, thank you.

3
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,396
What time does your shift start?

4
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,731
Uh... 9.

5
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:40,767
Oh. Yeah, you better hurry up.

6
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,991
Do you want some coffee?

7
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,738
Sure, thanks.

8
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,329
Okay.

9
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,839
That looks good on you.

10
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,142
What? My blouse.

11
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,928
Oh, yeah. It's not too long?

12
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,184
No.

13
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,687
It's a good thing I have
a 40-gallon water heater.

14
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:18,972
What?

15
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,223
You take long showers.

16
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,792
I'm sorry. Oh...
No. No. So do I.

17
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,145
Sometimes I have to stand
under there for 20 minutes...

18
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,564
just to wake up when it's cold.

19
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,872
Especially in winter.

20
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,152
Is it cold outside? Low 20s.

21
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,553
Do you want a bagel? No, thanks.

22
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:35,737
You know, I gotta... I'll
get something at work.

23
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,825
You okay?

24
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,427
Yeah, um, I got it. I got it.

25
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:42,929
No, I... I meant about us.

26
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,319
First time can be a little...

27
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:48,969
No. It's just...

28
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:50,303
It's just different.

29
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,659
That's true.

30
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,658
But good. Really?

31
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:55,763
Yeah.

32
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:58,562
I'll see you at work.

33
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,418
Yeah. Okay.

34
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,911
I'll see you later. Mm.

35
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,331
Hey, um...

36
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,545
I'm sorry, but I... I
know this is understood,

37
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,180
but I just...

38
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,724
This is just gonna
be between us, right?

39
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,123
Of course.

40
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,828
I'll get the door.

41
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,850
Open a GAI-50 and a
TA-55 on the resection.

42
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:38,918
No need, Peter.

43
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,386
I gave it to Henderson. What?

44
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,987
Page us if the CAT
scan shows free air.

45
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:43,323
Come on. Let's go.

46
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,124
Where are we going?
I got a chore for you.

47
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,526
You know what?
I'm a little busy.

48
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,590
Yeah, so am I. Let's go.

49
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,796
So, Peter...

50
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,533
how is this, uh, per diem
situation working out for you?

51
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:55,735
Could be a lot better.
Really? What's the problem?

52
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,836
Where are we going?

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,671
Are you, uh,
dissatisfied in some way?

54
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:01,040
Besides being grossly underpaid?

55
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:02,908
Ah. Well, would a
$10,000 a year raise

56
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,677
and a limited benefit
package help?

57
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,646
What? Okay. Let's
make it 20,000.

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,315
Final offer. And you'll have
to take on administrative work.

59
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,850
You're serious? Yeah.

60
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:11,917
Look, you've been, uh...

61
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,319
You've been doing your penance,

62
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:15,688
working hard, displaying
dedication and groveling.

63
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,057
I'd be a complete sadist if
I didn't ease up eventually.

64
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,025
What do I have to do?
A little of this and that.

65
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,994
It won't take you more
than a few hours a month.

66
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:23,285
What's in it for you?

67
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,232
Okay, fine, forget it.
Go back to Surgery.

68
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,433
Hey, I'm just asking.

69
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,937
Whoa. Do you want
the bump or don't you?

70
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,690
Sure.

71
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,824
So we have a deal?

72
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,414
Yeah.

73
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,913
Okay. Let's go.

74
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,436
This way, please.

75
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,085
Sorry for the delay.

76
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,187
Dr. Benton had to finish

77
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:50,990
a complicated surgery on a
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

78
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,425
Come on in, Peter. Don't be shy.

79
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,727
Come on, come on.

80
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,798
Okay. Now, as you are all aware,

81
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,932
we at the county level

82
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,134
are very concerned about
the declining numbers

83
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,321
of minority medical school
students and faculty physicians.

84
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,107
Not only here in
Chicago, but nationwide.

85
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,976
The medical school is
committed to addressing this issue.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,112
As part of that
commitment, I am appointing

87
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,380
a Director of Diversity
for the medical center:

88
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,116
Dr. Peter Benton.

89
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,785
Dr. Benton's bio and
résumé can be found

90
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,955
in your handout materials.

91
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,157
So... he's all yours.

92
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,742
Dr. Benton,

93
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,544
is your appointment
the direct result

94
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,363
of the investigative report
about the declining numbers

95
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:33,083
of African-Americans being
admitted to medical school?

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,208
I, uh...

97
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,214
Well, I mean,
you know, it, uh...

98
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,431
It-it could be a part of it.

99
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,417
How can you ensure
minority representation

100
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:54,003
at the medical school in this
post-affirmative action era?

101
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,459
- Is he drinking?
- Just water.

102
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,993
He had a little rice
three days ago.

103
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,994
Did you start an IV?

104
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,764
We can't without a court order.

105
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,166
Call Dr. Samson.

106
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,967
Dr. Samson doesn't
work here anymore.

107
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,235
What? Dr. Miller

108
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,403
treats your cousin now.

109
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,904
Fine. Call him.

110
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,307
Well, that's probably not
necessary since you're here.

111
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,308
Why's that?

112
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,052
I think he's just lonely.

113
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,446
Can you get me a, uh...

114
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,981
A protein shake or something?

115
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,205
Huh.

116
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,120
Hey, Chase.

117
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,377
It's John.

118
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,782
You mind if I sit down?

119
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,066
Hey, I'm, uh, sorry

120
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,390
that I haven't been
around here very much.

121
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,056
I've been busy.

122
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,626
For a year?

123
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,594
You're right.

124
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:44,018
You're right. That's
not an excuse.

125
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:48,134
Hey, your speech sounds good.

126
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,135
You been, uh...

127
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,504
getting around much?

128
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:53,028
No.

129
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,143
Here you go.

130
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,277
Oh, thank you.

131
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,348
You know, you gotta
eat something, Chase.

132
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,547
No. Why not? What's the matter?

133
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,455
Come on. Just take a sip. No.

134
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,319
Just take a little sip. No!

135
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,796
Maybe later.

136
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,452
Go away.

137
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,589
Okay, let me know if
this hurts. Ow! Hell, yes.

138
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,756
Ha. Wuss.

139
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,692
You want another
beating, keep talking.

140
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,026
I'm sitting right here.

141
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,761
This is his sparring
partner, Walter.

142
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,564
Lip lac and a
possible broken jaw.

143
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,566
Aren't you guys too
old to be fighting?

144
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,102
Never too old to
defend a lady's honor.

145
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,936
Was this was over a woman?

146
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,738
<i>Grace is in all her steps</i>

147
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,540
<i>Beauty in her eyes</i>

148
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,875
<i>In every gesture
Dignity and love.</i>

149
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,177
Yeah, don't let him fool you.

150
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,278
He stole that from a book.

151
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,746
At least I know how to read.

152
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,681
Yeah. With your lips moving.

153
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,683
Lip...? Okay, okay, okay.

154
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,652
Let's start with, uh, 6-0 nylon.

155
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,655
And let's try and keep
these kids apart, shall we?

156
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,591
Hey, Mark.

157
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,593
Morning, Kerry. How's it going?

158
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,862
Uh, well, ahem, snow blower
blew a rock into a guy's larynx.

159
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,063
I had to trache him.

160
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,366
No. I meant with you.
You know, first day back.

161
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,767
So far, so good.

162
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,436
Good. I'll let you
know in four hours.

163
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,070
We getting a little backed up?

164
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,140
Three patients waiting
for a surgical consult.

165
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,441
Who's on the service?

166
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,444
Peter. But she's stuck
in a press conference.

167
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,778
Who? Peter.

168
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,046
She's been in for an hour.

169
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,015
Who's "she"? What?

170
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,384
Wait, I mean... I mean, who's
giving a press conference?

171
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,287
Oh, I don't know what it's
for, but I heard Peter's in it.

172
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,921
Kerry? Yeah.

173
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,123
Can you call Radiology?

174
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,958
They sent this guy
back without his films

175
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,094
and they won't take him down.
Is there any bone exposed?

176
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,430
Yeah, I have to rongeur
it, and I need the x-ray.

177
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,799
How did it happen? I
don't know. They just lost it.

178
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,000
No. The finger.

179
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,935
I don't know. He won't say.

180
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,672
<i>Habla usted inglés?</i> No.

181
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,240
Chuny already tried.

182
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,813
Looks like some kind of saw.

183
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,851
What did he say?

184
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,495
I told you.

185
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:09,508
Did someone bring him in?

186
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,950
I think he took a cab.
What cab company?

187
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,581
Nobody saw him arrive?

188
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,332
Malik was out there. Why?

189
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,368
Okay. We should
put a call in to OSHA.

190
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,669
OSHA?

191
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,538
They monitor workplace
safety requirements.

192
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,807
He's probably illegal, and
he isn't saying anything

193
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,476
because he doesn't
wanna lose his job.

194
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,844
That's his choice, isn't it?

195
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,746
Until someone
gets seriously hurt.

196
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,647
I'll call, find out where
they picked him up.

197
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,433
I just need you
to call Radiology.

198
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:35,535
I gave you a promotion.
What are you crying about?

199
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,036
You should have
talked to me first.

200
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,771
I did. I said a
little extra money

201
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,072
for added responsibility.

202
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,442
I don't like being used.
Everyone is used, Peter.

203
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:43,976
It's what makes
the world go round.

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,679
The only reason you gave
me that job is because I'm black.

205
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:48,581
Well, you're discounting
your finely honed

206
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:49,749
public relations skills.

207
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,050
I don't want it. Sure you do.

208
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:53,052
Nope, I don't. You
should have thought of that

209
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,554
before your press conference.

210
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:55,555
Yes. I need a minority

211
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:56,956
to be the Director of Diversity.

212
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,724
But it's not gonna
require any real work.

213
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,025
It'll get you that much closer

214
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,494
to a full-time faculty position.

215
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,395
So please get over
yourself. You know what?

216
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,882
You can find somebody else
to be your little poster boy.

217
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,134
Well, I... I... The truth is
I don't have anyone else.

218
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,568
Which is a perfect example

219
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:10,770
of why the diversity issue

220
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,255
needs your immediate attention.

221
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,840
You don't even believe that.

222
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,224
Actually, I do.

223
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,875
But it doesn't really
matter, does it?

224
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,479
It's on your shoulders now.
Excuse me. I have a meeting.

225
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:20,969
Time's up, Peter.

226
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,150
Did I misread the schedule?

227
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,653
What schedule? You
canceled six elective cases

228
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,405
in the past week. They were
not canceled, rescheduled.

229
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,672
Which means canceled.

230
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,742
One had a fever, another
had a family emergency.

231
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,745
All of them happen to be
the more complex procedures.

232
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,114
If that's true, it's simple
coincidence, I assure you.

233
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,315
Look, I've been completely
slammed by this review.

234
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,385
Nothing seems to be up
to standard at the moment.

235
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,786
And I have every confidence that

236
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,154
you'll get them up to standard.

237
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,156
But I also need an
associate chief of surgery

238
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,857
who actually performs surgery.

239
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,559
I do.

240
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,895
I will, gladly, once I get
out from under all of this.

241
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,213
No. Today.

242
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,431
You're covering the ER.

243
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,133
Robert, they're
coming on Monday.

244
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,477
You only have to go
down there if they page you.

245
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,989
Are you married?

246
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,057
No.

247
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,559
Oh, a cute girl like yourself?

248
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,128
Well, he didn't
crack your skull.

249
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,196
What?

250
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,997
There's no blood
behind your eardrum.

251
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,767
He didn't crack your skull.
He couldn't crack a smile.

252
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,902
You know, I'm a big
proponent of marriage.

253
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,471
Of course, you gotta be
married to the right person.

254
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:21,040
Oh, is that a proposal?

255
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,308
Well, we have to get
to know each other first.

256
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,410
We're gonna have to wait
on the x-ray of your hand.

257
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,780
But I don't see any other
injuries. Anything else hurt?

258
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:30,750
Nothing I want to talk
about in mixed company.

259
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,968
Well, I'm a nurse.

260
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,869
Just the same, if
I'm gonna talk to you

261
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,304
about my private parts,

262
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,478
I'd prefer to do it
in a social setting.

263
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:40,677
Does it hurt when you pee?

264
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,311
Yeah. How did you know?

265
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,013
Do you have an
enlarged prostate?

266
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,315
It's large enough.

267
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,150
Well, it could be prostatitis.

268
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,952
I'm gonna need a urine sample.

269
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,588
You're gonna have
to hold it a little lower.

270
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,457
I am going to show
you to the bathroom.

271
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,493
You know, actually,
it feels more like, uh,

272
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,161
something you pick up.

273
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,230
Pick up? Yeah, a burning.

274
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,700
I got it once before when
I was stationed in Korea.

275
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,502
From... sex?

276
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,422
Well, I didn't get
it from dancing.

277
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:10,890
Abby, we need you.

278
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:12,024
Grab 100 of mannitol.

279
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,992
Gunshot wound to the head. Okay.

280
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,678
I'll be right back. Pee in that.

281
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:16,884
From here?

282
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,650
80 systolic after two liters.
What do you want for labs?

283
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,419
Full trauma panel.
Get a C-spine.

284
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,420
Cross him for four.

285
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,924
On my count. One, two, three.

286
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,791
Sinus at 65.

287
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:29,859
Rate's coming down.

288
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,594
What is it? Fifteen-year-old

289
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,363
with self-inflicted gunshot to
the right temple at close range.

290
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,765
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

291
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,116
Was there a suicide note?

292
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,702
No. His friend claimed they
were playing Russian roulette.

293
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,936
God. Guy's behind us.

294
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,105
Bullet blew through this
one and grazed his cheek.

295
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,990
No response to painful stimuli.

296
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,293
Smell alcohol. He
could just be drunk.

297
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,861
Dropped his systolic to 70.

298
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,363
Bradying down to 50.

299
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:52,749
Amp of atropine. Open
the fluids. Pump in O-neg.

300
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,133
What are you doing?

301
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,636
Massive blood loss. That
could be the cause of his low BP.

302
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,421
Or he could have
blown out his brain stem.

303
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,855
Crit's 39.

304
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,724
Doesn't sound like blood loss.

305
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,342
So do you want O-neg?

306
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,926
But if you wanna
try transfusing him...

307
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,865
Uh... Yes. Hang two
units on the rapid infuser.

308
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,966
I'll put in a central line.

309
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,890
What? Nothing.

310
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,337
Is this the other guy?

311
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,872
Yeah.

312
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,107
Superficial
abrasion, left cheek.

313
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,910
Cranial nerves intact.

314
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,678
You were playing
Russian roulette?

315
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:23,746
What?

316
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,347
They were playing
Russian roulette.

317
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,115
It was his idea.

318
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,051
How old are you? Why?

319
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,052
How old are you?

320
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,119
He wanted to play.

321
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,688
Mark, I got this. What, 20?

322
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,623
Nineteen. He's 15
years old. He's drunk.

323
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,425
I could smell the
alcohol across the room.

324
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,344
He came over that way.

325
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,429
You didn't give
her anything? Who?

326
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,265
Your friend.

327
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,350
He brought a case of beer
along with his dad's gun.

328
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:46,102
You made him hold
the gun up to his head.

329
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,521
I didn't make him do
anything. Hell, I went first.

330
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:50,606
It w... It was his idea,
but you went first?

331
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,891
Yeah. Better odds.

332
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,759
Better odds? That's
the point of the game.

333
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:56,312
The g... It's not a game!
She blew his brains out!

334
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,697
Who's "she"?

335
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,365
What?! You said "she."

336
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,067
He! He's dead.

337
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,357
He loaded the bullet. He
knew what could happen.

338
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,956
Where are the police, huh?

339
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,757
Why aren't they
arresting this idiot?

340
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,825
I didn't kill him.

341
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,089
The hell you didn't.

342
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,867
Did you call it?

343
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,070
Yeah. After six units of
blood and 45 minutes of CPR.

344
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,438
I should never have started.

345
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,806
You wanted to make sure.

346
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,108
Rubbish. You would have
called it from the beginning.

347
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,077
Yeah, but I'm lazy.

348
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,179
Mark, please.

349
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,403
You wanted to give it a
chance. No big failure.

350
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,084
All right. I'm going
back upstairs.

351
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,152
Later, gator.

352
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,853
Hey. Are you taking it easy?

353
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,955
Yes, Mom.

354
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,356
Sour milk? Yeah. It came back

355
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,041
from the dry cleaners
like that. Smell.

356
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:43,465
It's fine. Right?

357
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,762
So anyway, he's not psychotic?

358
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,264
Uh, no. Sociopathic, maybe.

359
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,716
But, no, I can't hold him.

360
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,117
We'll leave it up to the police.

361
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,135
Thanks.

362
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,909
Any time.

363
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,089
So, Elizabeth?

364
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,591
Yeah?

365
00:14:58,615 --> 00:14:59,892
Is Mark doing okay?

366
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,093
Very well.

367
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,261
There's no change
in personality or...?

368
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,147
He's a little tired. Why?

369
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,934
Uh, have you noticed that
he's mixing his pronouns?

370
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,653
Uh, mixing? How?

371
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,905
Well, like, saying she
when he means he.

372
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,940
Uh...

373
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,608
Well, it's nothing
that I've noticed.

374
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,193
Has he said anything
to you about it?

375
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,495
No, I don't think he realizes.

376
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,063
Well, maybe you've misheard.

377
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,453
Yeah. Maybe.

378
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,066
Dr. Weaver.

379
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,801
Yep. Starting my shift.

380
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,036
Okay.

381
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,372
You wanted to see me
before I started my shift.

382
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,173
Right. Well, uh...

383
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,608
I've been thinking about it.

384
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,478
And the fact that you told me
that you claimed responsibility

385
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,713
I... I... I think is
a positive sign.

386
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,581
Therefore, I... I feel that I...

387
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,873
I can't, uh, summarily
dismiss you.

388
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,621
But...? What chip are you up to?

389
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,156
What? Your AA chip.

390
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,058
Oh, uh... How many
days of sobriety?

391
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,276
Two hundred and forty.

392
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,580
Okay, give it to me.

393
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,086
It's, uh... It's at home.

394
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:56,882
All right.

395
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,818
Well. You're starting over.

396
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,853
Day 1. Another 90 days,

397
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,121
another 90 meetings.

398
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,956
And I need documentation.

399
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,993
And you'll go back to not
administering or distributing

400
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,160
any Schedule II narcotics

401
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:09,912
or benzos until further notice.

402
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,346
But that's it, Carter.

403
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,300
Even the smallest infraction,
and you no longer work here.

404
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:16,135
Is that clear?
Understood? Understood.

405
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,136
Good. Thank you.

406
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,680
Don't make me regret it, John.

407
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,595
How you doing, Mr. Nicolaides?

408
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,015
Call me Walter. Walter.

409
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,359
I'd be doing a whole lot
better with a sponge bath.

410
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:32,985
You want a bath?

411
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,175
Yes, please.

412
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,973
Malik.

413
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,107
Come here.

414
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,993
Yeah. What?

415
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:42,611
Oh, no.

416
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,678
I-I'm fine. Really.

417
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,880
I was just kidding...
Okay. Never mind.

418
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,464
Whatever. Jeez.

419
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,120
Boy, you're a real
firecracker, aren't you?

420
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,289
That's me. Nurse Firecracker.

421
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,356
Mm. Married?

422
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,508
None of your business.

423
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:58,127
Mm. My second
wife was a spinster.

424
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,296
Married her when she was 32.

425
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,265
Well, just waiting for
the right guy, I guess.

426
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,033
Yeah. Damn right.

427
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,002
We were married
for another 32 years

428
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,354
before she passed.

429
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,823
Yeah, but don't you worry,
because feisty gals like you

430
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,191
always take a little longer.

431
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:14,794
I wasn't the one who
was brought in for fighting.

432
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,795
Oh, well, Earl started that.

433
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,030
He was...

434
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,297
flirting with my Victoria.

435
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,241
Who's Victoria? My lady friend.

436
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,538
Are the two of you intimate?

437
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,272
Well, I...

438
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,674
still get up a full
head of steam,

439
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:30,298
if that's what
you're driving at.

440
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,260
I see.

441
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,162
Uh, tell me... Walter,

442
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,854
have you been experiencing
any burning when you pee?

443
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,669
I mean... it was cool at first,

444
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,237
but then my
girlfriend went to work,

445
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,606
and it just stayed... like that.

446
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,142
Have you taken any
drugs lately, uh, Gary?

447
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,644
Little coke.
Okay. That'll do it.

448
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,713
Have you tried masturbating?

449
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,249
No. I'm a Christian.

450
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,452
Oh. Well, too bad.

451
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,287
Sometimes that helps.

452
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,189
Guess we'll have to drain it.

453
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,590
How?

454
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,280
With a needle.

455
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,061
Do you have a men's room around?

456
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,297
Yup. Down the hall to the left.

457
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,664
I'll check back.

458
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,834
- How you know she's gay?
- It's obvious.

459
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,336
Are the fibroids
actively bleeding?

460
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,072
Crit is down to 28. I mean,
why risk multiple transfusions

461
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,540
if she's not gonna
use it anyway?

462
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,708
Use what? Her uterus.

463
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,576
Oh, come on. Come
on. You can tell.

464
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,945
Check her out.

465
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,213
These files are Dr. Benton's

466
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,981
on the med school
admissions committee.

467
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,033
He doesn't have a box
anymore, so they came back.

468
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:30,469
A hysterectomy is the
safest way to go, man.

469
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,503
Dr. Weaver?

470
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,355
- Uh... lounge.
- Fine, fine.

471
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,024
I mean, I... I'll just make
sure she understands the risks.

472
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,727
Hey, Malucci. Be careful.
I don't want a lawsuit.

473
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,262
Hey. I'm the king
of couth, chief.

474
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,796
Great. Storm's back.

475
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,931
Snowing again.

476
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,766
Is this my hand x-ray?

477
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,034
Does it have your name on it?

478
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,736
Yes. Then it's yours.

479
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,138
Uh, Orbie Coronado
from OSHA called back.

480
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,406
Said thanks for the address.

481
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,808
Said someone from
the INS may be calling.

482
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,011
Wait a minute. I didn't
want him to call the INS.

483
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,079
Is that my patient?

484
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,647
They've been having problems

485
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,799
with furniture
sweatshops in that area.

486
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,585
Call back. I need to
find out what he said.

487
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,170
That's great, Kerry. Hey.

488
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:05,437
We have a responsibility

489
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,306
to report unsafe
working conditions.

490
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,608
You don't know that. He
wouldn't even say how he cut it.

491
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,594
He was scared. Scared
of getting deported.

492
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,495
Nobody's getting deported.

493
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,097
Why the hell not?

494
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,365
If he's illegal, he's illegal.
Who's paying for him?

495
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,489
Shut up, Frank.

496
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,437
Hi. Hey.

497
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,972
Hey, I heard you got stuck
with a couple of grumpy old men.

498
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,574
Well, horny old
men is more like it.

499
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,942
They both have chlamydia.

500
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,310
How old are they? Late 70s.

501
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,546
Seems to be going
around their nursing home.

502
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,114
Nice to know there's more
than shuffleboard in our futures.

503
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,149
Do you want Mr. Baker,

504
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,652
20-year-old sickler in crisis?

505
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,754
Better not. Why not?

506
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,990
Because I'm back to
not pushing narcotics.

507
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,025
You told Weaver? Yeah.

508
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,360
She was okay?

509
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,429
Well, not okay,
but she let me stay

510
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,397
with a few...
reinforced restrictions.

511
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,833
Good for you.

512
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,233
I guess. No, I mean it. Really.

513
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,902
No. Thanks for the push.

514
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,871
Carter. Wound check in 5 has...

515
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,607
I'm coming. I'm coming.
He's getting difficult.

516
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:02,277
Both EKGs are normal.
Cardiac enzymes are normal.

517
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,879
I just talked to
his cardiologist.

518
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,547
He said he should
have a treadmill test

519
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,949
and maybe an angiogram.

520
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,617
Probably meant as an outpatient.

521
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,651
He didn't say that.

522
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,320
Well, that's what he meant.

523
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,539
Keep taking your
medications as directed

524
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:15,241
and come back if
there are any problems.

525
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:16,575
That's it?

526
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,328
Make sure you see your
cardiologist when you get home.

527
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,829
You're not gonna
admit him? Nope.

528
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,464
Georgia, honey, it's all right.

529
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,265
I want him checked
in. This isn't a hotel.

530
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,518
Told you we shouldn't have
gone to a county hospital.

531
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,387
Georgette. I want
a second opinion.

532
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:31,523
Okay. Here's your
second opinion.

533
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:34,693
Your husband's overweight.
He suffers from stable angina.

534
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,962
He needs to stop
drinking and smoking.

535
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,231
He needs to lay off the
pizza, burgers and fries,

536
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,532
and get some exercise.

537
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,935
Otherwise, all the second
opinions in the world

538
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,037
are not gonna keep
him from dropping dead

539
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,660
in the next two years.

540
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,128
I'll clear the Trauma rooms.

541
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,030
Notify the ICU. I'm
calling the blood bank.

542
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,399
Can I get eight units of O-neg
and every bag of Ringer's?

543
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,834
Carter, what's going on?

544
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,337
Rescue's bringing in multiple
victims of a basement fire.

545
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,904
Smoke inhalation
Crush injuries...

546
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,573
How many? They
were too busy to count.

547
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,442
Call the O.R.? Yeah,
and the burn unit.

548
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,306
ETA? They're rolling in.

549
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,947
Mark, you got this? I'll
take the one on the end.

550
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,933
Partial burn to the
right arm and face.

551
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,200
What happened? A raid.

552
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:17,136
Bunch of workers got
trapped. BP 120/60.

553
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,604
Pulse, 92. Better
keep her on O-2

554
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,556
and check the
carboxyhemoglobin level.

555
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,994
Give 0.5 of albuterol.

556
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,629
Mark, I thought you were off.

557
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,782
Not anymore. You
need to take it easy.

558
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,951
Not much chance of that.
Why don't you go triage?

559
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,295
See you in O.R. We'll
flush out the joint upstairs.

560
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,706
I just threw her in the
front seat as I pulled out.

561
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,541
Any burns? It's
a superficial lac

562
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,110
to the right calf and groin.

563
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,414
What's she saying? She's
saying she wants her mom.

564
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,255
Smoke inhalation
with pleuritic chest pain.

565
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,805
Malik, I need a blood
gas on this guy right away.

566
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:55,190
- Portable chest?
- Yeah. Get me a 12-lead.

567
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,309
Got an INS officer
who crushed his pelvis.

568
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,411
Any shortness of breath?

569
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,846
Did they get out? Who?

570
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,314
Well, we only got
half of them out.

571
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,649
They had the windows
barred shut. What place?

572
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:06,402
Oh, we got a tip on
an illegal sweatshop.

573
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,937
Uh, we went to case
it. It just started burning.

574
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,288
Sats are down to 82.

575
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:14,092
Dr. Weaver, his
pulse ox is falling.

576
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:16,829
Put him on 15 liters.
Open an intubation tray.

577
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:19,136
He needs a trauma
consult now. Move.

578
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:24,842
Sorry, doc.

579
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,177
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

580
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:33,178
Carter...

581
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:34,179
can you take this?

582
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:35,280
Possible pneumothroax.

583
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,532
Yeah. Trauma 2.

584
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,066
Luka? Thirty-year-old male,

585
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,968
full-thickness burns
over most of his body.

586
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:42,203
BP, 100/70. Pulse, 120.

587
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,238
Where should we go?

588
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,074
Just get him out of the hallway!

589
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,741
How much fluid in?
One liter Ringer's

590
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,511
and 10 of morphine.
Give another round of both.

591
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,979
I need a sterile
gown and gloves.

592
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,484
Do you know each other?

593
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:00,294
They work together.

594
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,692
Mark!

595
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,843
Mark, what's open?!

596
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,645
I don't know. Try
the Suture Room.

597
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,129
Suture Room. Go!

598
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,431
He needs an NG tube and a Foley.

599
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:10,899
Dr. Weaver, we're
out of I&D kits.

600
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,168
Use suture-removal
kits for débriding.

601
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,021
CBC, chem panel
and cardiac enzymes.

602
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:17,990
What do you got?
Possible electrical burns.

603
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:19,558
She may have
touched a hot power line

604
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:21,560
while she pulled some
rubble off her daughter.

605
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,097
She doesn't know
what happened to her.

606
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:27,165
How old? Five.
First name, Araceli.

607
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,433
Haleh, call Dispatch.

608
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,969
See if they have a
20 on a 5-year-old girl.

609
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,739
Good air entry,
scattered rales bilaterally.

610
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:36,174
Put her on a pulse ox.

611
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:37,576
Got an exit wound here.

612
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,677
Here's the entry.

613
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,345
She's burned from
the inside out, huh?

614
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,347
What was the voltage
on the line? I don't know.

615
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,682
Get on the phone with the
commander and find out.

616
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:45,683
Pulse ox, 89.

617
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,152
Put him up to five liters.

618
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,222
Just take it easy. Take
it easy. Just lay back.

619
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:52,590
<i>Cálmate. Cálmate.</i> Just lay back.

620
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,193
Titrate another 10 of morphine.

621
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:56,612
You got about 20 percent
partial-thickness burns.

622
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:57,896
He needs a chest tube.

623
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,065
Lily, I need to prep
for an escharotomy.

624
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:01,867
That doesn't sound very good.

625
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:04,203
Can you set up a fiber-optic
laryngoscope? In a sec!

626
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:05,504
I need it now! Go, go. I got it.

627
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,206
Carter, can you help
me prep the chest?

628
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,674
Hurry, I'm losing pulses.

629
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,075
How fast do you need the fluids?

630
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,212
I'm estimating 92 percent
surface-area burns.

631
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:16,098
Start Ringer's at
1700 cc's per hour.

632
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,482
Setting at 91 on 15 liters.

633
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:20,357
Okay, switch him to
humidified O-2, non-rebreather.

634
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:23,839
What?

635
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,640
He's asking how bad it is.

636
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,509
Tell him very serious.

637
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,679
"Am I going to die?"

638
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,331
Most likely, yes.

639
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:34,983
<i>Probablemente sí.</i>

640
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,269
His finger's swollen.
I can't get his ring off.

641
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,071
Get the ring cutter.

642
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,272
I'm in.

643
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:42,274
No persistent pneumo,
good tube position.

644
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:43,575
He's still hypertensive.

645
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,742
Do you know how it started?

646
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:45,777
Paint thinner.

647
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,579
I think someone kicked
over a space heater

648
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:48,780
when they were running out.

649
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:50,415
Where's that
crit? Working on it.

650
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,250
Borderline widened mediastinum

651
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:53,619
and a left pleural effusion.

652
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:54,675
Might be his aorta.

653
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,889
All right. Chest
CT. Let's move him.

654
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,847
Hold on. Crit's low at 31.

655
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,062
You want to take
him up to the O.R.?

656
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,130
No. I... I don't want to
open him if I don't have to.

657
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:07,850
It could just be an
intercostal artery.

658
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,587
Fine, fine. We'll do a
transesophageal echo.

659
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,790
Somebody call upstairs,
tell them we're on our way.

660
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,124
Neck is swollen.

661
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,592
So are the upper extremities.

662
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,593
Mamá. <i>Mi hija.</i>

663
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,695
Where did you find her?

664
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,596
She came in with Morales.

665
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,165
Sats are dropping. 86.

666
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,934
Put her on high-flow
O-2, open saline, 80...

667
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,885
High voltage fried
every cell in its path.

668
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,821
Look, her CK is over 2000.

669
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:30,956
<i>Cómo está mi hija?</i> Mamá.

670
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,491
<i>No me dejes.</i>

671
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:33,708
<i>Está bien.</i>

672
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,692
Did you check her out?

673
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:35,944
She's fine.

674
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,046
She has a non-displaced
fracture of the tibia.

675
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,635
Mamá. She's okay. See?

676
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,120
Pulse ox dropping, 82.

677
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,972
Okay, let's intubate.
Abby, take her out.

678
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,808
Abby, out.

679
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:52,060
She wants you to take
care of her, Abby. Abby, go.

680
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,695
Mamá. Okay.

681
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,464
Twenty of etomidate. 100 of sux.

682
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:58,199
Mamá!

683
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,005
8-0 ET tube.

684
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:06,057
Relax, relax, relax.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

685
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,027
Okay, okay. Carter,
hold him down.

686
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:11,229
Hold on. Watch the drape!

687
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,698
<i>Relájate.</i> No!

688
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:15,133
Sats are down to 78.
He's getting hypoxic.

689
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,535
All right, push some Versed.

690
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,636
What?

691
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,438
The Versed! Right
there on the Mayo stand!

692
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,439
Come on! I can't.

693
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:21,906
Why not? I'm not allowed to.

694
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,465
Carter, push the damn Versed!
I got to get this tube in him.

695
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:28,880
Carter, where are
you going?! Hold on.

696
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,482
Inflate the tube. Bag her.

697
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,883
Her complexes are widening.

698
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,885
Dave, go push some
Versed for Benton, will you?

699
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm busy. Sats
are still dropping.

700
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:36,921
I got this. Go ahead.

701
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:38,022
I'm not a nurse.

702
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:39,591
Give her 10 units
of insulin and D50.

703
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:40,859
Come on, just do it, will you?

704
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,060
You do it. Dave, go.

705
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:44,196
What? Now. Help Benton.

706
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,148
You've got a run of six.

707
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,582
Get a repeat potassium.

708
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,784
She's in V-tach.

709
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,485
Crash cart! Charge to 200.

710
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,787
Got a weak femoral pulse.

711
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,789
Get an amp of bicarb. Clear.

712
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,375
Still V-tach. Charging, 300.

713
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,927
Pressure's 60 palp.

714
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,951
Clear!

715
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,484
Pressure's 92/62. Pulse, 110.

716
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:08,653
Repeat crit is 28.

717
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,355
I can't isolate the aorta.

718
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,856
You got to go in now.

719
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,991
Oh, not blind, I don't.

720
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:15,295
Ah, come on.

721
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,091
Come on.

722
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,182
Okay. There.

723
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,683
There's extra lumenal fluid.

724
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,101
He's torn his aorta.

725
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,190
No kidding.

726
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,521
Set up a thoracotomy tray.

727
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,257
Call the perfusionist.
I'll scrub in.

728
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,525
Scrub fast.

729
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,693
How much blood?

730
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,495
Eight more units. Type-specific.

731
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,330
Clear.

732
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,664
Still in V-tach.

733
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,034
Three-sixty. 100 of lidocaine
and an amp of calcium.

734
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,203
Clear.

735
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,237
What happened?

736
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,472
Lost the pulse.

737
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,540
Damn it. She's in
V-fib. Let's start CPR.

738
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,809
I got it. Benton's
taking your patient up.

739
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,910
You get the chest tube in?

740
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:49,911
That's not all.

741
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:50,935
Clear.

742
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,015
You had to intubate, uh?

743
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,916
ARDS. His sats were
low after thoracostomy.

744
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,551
I'm taking him up to SICU.

745
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,221
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not allowed
to push controlled substances.

746
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,623
He was about to arrest. Part
of my diversion agreement.

747
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,625
You know what? Sometimes
you make exceptions.

748
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:04,792
No exceptions.

749
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,294
Then you don't
need to be in there.

750
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,862
What? If you can't
treat a patient,

751
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,230
you don't need
to be in the room.

752
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,598
I didn't set the rules this way.

753
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,467
Sometimes you gotta
use your own judgment.

754
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,936
It's not negotiable. If I push
the Versed, I'm out of here.

755
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,721
How long has it been?
Eight months? Yeah.

756
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,823
This is ridiculous. I'll
talk to Weaver. No, no.

757
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,408
Dr. Benton.
Post-intubation film.

758
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,943
I'll handle it. It's,
uh, you know.

759
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,411
It'll just piss her off anyway.

760
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,013
Yeah, well, you know what?

761
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,915
I'm pissed off. You
should be pissed off.

762
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,950
Well... it's my problem.

763
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,452
No, Carter. It's
everybody's problem.

764
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,139
Listen just don't talk
to Weaver. Please.

765
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:36,508
Swelling of the upper airway.

766
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:38,809
We'll intubate after
the escharotomy.

767
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,578
No. No.

768
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:47,852
When... When is he going to die?

769
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,254
In about a week. From infection.

770
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:53,691
Your body won't be able

771
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,360
to keep the bacteria out.

772
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,497
You'll also get, uh,
major fluid imbalances

773
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,032
and possible kidney failure.

774
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,371
We'll have to put a tube

775
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:07,972
down your throat
to help you breathe.

776
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,566
Can you find his wife?

777
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,850
Does he have a number?

778
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,523
No. She's...

779
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,758
She's in Guatemala, and
there's no phone there.

780
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,689
He has $520 in a
little box by his bed.

781
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:44,743
He lives in a garage
at 395 Landale Street.

782
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,601
"Can you get it to her?"

783
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:51,966
Can you get her the money

784
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,035
and tell her what
happened to him?

785
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,075
Yeah.

786
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,473
<i>Sí,</i> Ernesto.

787
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,093
"Can you tell her I love her?"

788
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,895
<i>Yo la quiero mucho.</i>

789
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,486
"I love her very much."

790
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:13,376
Okay, 30 of etomidate,
six of Pavulon.

791
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,331
Clear!

792
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,914
Fine V-fib.

793
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,783
Charge again. 360.

794
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:26,618
Potassium's 7.5.

795
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:27,819
Pulse ox is 60.

796
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:28,987
How long has she been down?

797
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:30,454
Twenty-five minutes.

798
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:31,511
Clear!

799
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,082
Asystole.

800
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:38,930
How much atropine
has she been given?

801
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:40,264
Two amps.

802
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:41,299
When was the last epi?

803
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,843
Uh, about three minutes ago.

804
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,708
Okay, that's it.

805
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:52,576
Time of death, 12:16.

806
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,879
There was too much
internal injury, chief.

807
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:55,947
Yeah.

808
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,381
There's more. Rescue found a guy

809
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,150
trapped inside with
a blunt head trauma

810
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:00,702
and blown pupil.

811
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,287
All right, let's go.

812
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:03,638
I'll clear the room.

813
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:57,708
I need better exposure.
Get a large Deaver in here.

814
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,677
That is a large Deaver.

815
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:02,113
Then give me more retraction.

816
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,648
I can't maintain his
pressure much longer.

817
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,334
Metz. LISA: We need
the pump in O.R. 4.

818
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,769
Where's the bypass machine?

819
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,237
Open hearts going in two O.R.'s.

820
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,222
First one will be off
the pump in 30 minutes.

821
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:12,890
I need it now. Right now.

822
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:14,080
These are my last two units.

823
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,845
DeBakey.

824
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,131
Lisa, you go in there, you
tell them we have an unstable

825
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,632
patient on the table. I did.

826
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:24,852
The pump's not available
for... Now it's 29 minutes.

827
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,044
Pressure's 80. You've
gotta cross-clamp him.

828
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,427
No, if I... I do that,

829
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,896
I'll cut off circulation
to his spinal cord.

830
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,564
Or you could let him bleed out.

831
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,850
I will not paralyze this man.

832
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:39,874
You want to kill him?

833
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,494
I can't isolate the aorta.

834
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,861
Find Romano. We can't wait!

835
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,334
Lisa, now! Go!

836
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,850
Carter, I've got to go home.

837
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,719
Girl in Exam 1 needs
a leg-burn débridement.

838
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,956
Uh, Burn Unit's full. Does
she needs admission?

839
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,824
No. Give him Thermazine
to use at home.

840
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,242
Boy or girl?

841
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:05,827
What? You just said "him."

842
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,145
Carter, I'm really tired.

843
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,914
So much for a
four-hour shift, uh?

844
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:11,515
See you Monday.
Have a good weekend.

845
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,117
It's none of your business.

846
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,719
It is when it
affects patient care.

847
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,487
Dr. Carter did what
he was supposed to do.

848
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:17,922
The guy's sats were dropping.

849
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,924
This one needs a tetanus
booster and dressing.

850
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:22,227
There was an unnecessary
delay. If I need a resident...

851
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,928
Peter, you are a
surgical consultant!

852
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:26,030
You do not dictate ER policy!

853
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,149
This is not policy,
Kerry. <i>This</i> is punishment.

854
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,417
Peter, we're not gonna
have this conversation.

855
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,721
This one needs Xeroform
and a tube-gauze dressing.

856
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,024
In a second. Fine.

857
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,575
What do you have
against him? What?

858
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,561
Oh, yeah. He made a
mistake. He got through it.

859
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:40,761
Peter, for the last time,

860
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,664
the terms of Carter's
diversion program

861
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,015
are not your concern!

862
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,783
You know what,
Kerry? It's time to let up.

863
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:47,452
He's been clean now
for what, 8 months.

864
00:33:47,476 --> 00:33:48,476
Has he?

865
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,341
Tenth unit's up.

866
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,876
Proximal aorta is dissected.

867
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,711
He's taching at 120.

868
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,813
Darn it. There's a
traumatic pseudoaneurysm.

869
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,015
Where the hell is Romano?

870
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,516
I paged him three times.

871
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,650
Did you check his office?

872
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,285
The staff lounge
and your cell phone.

873
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,104
Get the Resident on
call. The Resident?

874
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,473
Yes! Just get him.

875
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:10,308
BP's 70 and dropping.

876
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:11,309
Okay.

877
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,810
Well, give him two more units.

878
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:13,812
This is all I've got.

879
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:16,231
So call the blood bank.

880
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,316
They're out of
A-positive. I told you.

881
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,301
Then get O-negative!

882
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,870
For God's sake! Just
keep transfusing him!

883
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,772
Don't you understand
I need more time?!

884
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,958
You've got to
cross-clamp him now.

885
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,796
Do you want the
Zanger or the Crawford?

886
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,486
Dr. Corday?

887
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,389
Dr. Corday... what clamp?

888
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,707
Dr. Corday?

889
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:50,281
The Crawford. Crawford.

890
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,617
We'll establish
proximal control.

891
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:54,486
Open a 20mm Dacron.

892
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,454
Okay. We'll maintain

893
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:58,189
blood flow to the spinal cord

894
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:02,026
by sewing his intercostal
arteries into the graft.

895
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,361
BP's down to 60.

896
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,330
Okay. The clamp's on.

897
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:08,955
Dr. Babcock, I need another
hematocrit. Eleven blade.

898
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:14,572
Okay. Pressure's up to 80.

899
00:35:14,596 --> 00:35:15,873
Better work quick.

900
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,997
I'm okay. I'm okay.

901
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,847
Collateral flow should
reduce the risk of paralysis.

902
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,249
Okay, cut.

903
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:26,553
3-0 Prolene.

904
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:30,744
Hey.

905
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,259
Boy.

906
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:37,528
Days like today, you
look down at your watch,

907
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,992
and suddenly your shift is over.

908
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:42,936
What are those?

909
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,836
Med school applications.

910
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,360
Oh, yeah? Where
are you applying to?

911
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,144
Why the two separate stacks?

912
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:56,435
Interviews. No interviews.

913
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,637
You have a special,
uh, secret formula there?

914
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,341
GPA times competitive
factor plus MCAT scores.

915
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:09,344
Over 25, you get an interview.

916
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,346
You don't read the
letters of recommendation?

917
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,485
After the interview.

918
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,100
Poor kids.

919
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:17,702
I don't know if I
would have made it in,

920
00:36:17,726 --> 00:36:19,787
if I had the interview with you.

921
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,656
How'd you get on the committee?

922
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,596
I'm busy, Carter.

923
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,444
Did you talk to Weaver?

924
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:27,567
Yep.

925
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:31,949
It was nothing.

926
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,986
I mean, it was a
slip. Not even a slip.

927
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,443
You know? I threw them up.

928
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,328
Urine output 75
in the last hour.

929
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,997
Hemoglobin's 10.8.

930
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,467
Less than 100 cc's
of chest tube output.

931
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:50,702
Is that good?

932
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:52,369
All good.

933
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,393
Just need to do a
quick neuro check.

934
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,241
For what?

935
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:58,898
To check sensation.

936
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,102
Ow.

937
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,501
What's so funny?

938
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,258
Let me see you wiggle your toes.

939
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:10,771
That's excellent.

940
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,540
Lizzie, you called for me?

941
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,175
Yeah. Over an hour ago.

942
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,212
Well, I'm here now.
What's so emergent?

943
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,735
Will you excuse me?

944
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,918
We had a little trouble
with an aortic graft,

945
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,220
and I...

946
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,006
I wanted a second pair of hands.

947
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,475
Do I need to worry
about another lawsuit?

948
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,810
Uh, no. No.

949
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,518
Things got hairy for a moment,
but I pulled him through.

950
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,433
Well. That's your job, isn't it?

951
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,602
Yes, it is.

952
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:43,192
And I am now late for
dinner. Thank you, Elizabeth.

953
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,262
Thank you.

954
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,822
It's a good thing
they didn't frisk me.

955
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,113
It's chocolate.

956
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,283
Go away.

957
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,207
There's a reason I didn't
come to see you, Chase.

958
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,169
I thought about coming...

959
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:16,804
but I didn't.

960
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,038
And I didn't...

961
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,740
because I was afraid.

962
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,084
And I was afraid because
I didn't want to ad...

963
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,680
When I got stabbed
last year at work,

964
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,104
a friend of mine got
killed. And I, um...

965
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,321
ended up addicted
to painkillers.

966
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:34,922
And it caught up to me.

967
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,125
And I started to, um...

968
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,692
shoot morphine

969
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,128
and Demerol and fentanyl, and...

970
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,631
And whatever else I
could get my hands on.

971
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,334
And I don't know what would
have happened if I hadn't got busted.

972
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,591
But I did, and I went to rehab.

973
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,540
But I wasn't like
any of those people.

974
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,408
I mean, I got into this
because of an injury,

975
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,943
because of circumstance.

976
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,612
Because a near-death experience.

977
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:58,712
And they...

978
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,448
Anyway, it wasn't me.

979
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:03,417
I mean, it was me, but
it... It wasn't... Anyway.

980
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,874
I did the program.

981
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,289
Mm, I pretended
that I bought into it.

982
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,513
I did everything that I
was supposed to do.

983
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:13,284
Except...

984
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,298
believe that I
had anything to do

985
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,299
with what had happened.

986
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,468
And then...

987
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,703
I almost relapsed.

988
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,804
Or I guess I...

989
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,307
I guess I did relapse. Anyway...

990
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,342
I didn't come to
see you, Chase...

991
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,680
because I didn't want
to admit to the fact that..

992
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,103
I was just like you.

993
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,339
In fact, the truth is...

994
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:43,608
there's not a day that goes by

995
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:46,192
that I don't think
about getting high.

996
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:48,545
It's the first
thing I think about

997
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:51,009
when I wake up in the morning.

998
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,683
And it's the last
thing I think about

999
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,147
when I go to bed at night.

1000
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:57,729
And I think about it all day.

1001
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:09,022
I'm a drug addict.

1002
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,095
Tsk.

1003
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,489
Did you bring any french fries?

1004
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,059
Huh.

1005
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,887
Did the mom say anything

1006
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,289
about any relatives in Chicago?

1007
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,024
No. How about in Guatemala?

1008
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,392
We didn't have time to ask.

1009
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,426
All right, thanks.

1010
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,928
Hey, um...

1011
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,930
What's gonna happen to her?

1012
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,053
Put her in a group home for now.

1013
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,969
Will she be deported?

1014
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,171
Not unless we know
she's going back to family.

1015
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,524
If we don't find anyone, she
becomes a ward of the state,

1016
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,960
and then we look for a
Spanish-speaking foster home.

1017
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:11,194
You okay?

1018
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,378
