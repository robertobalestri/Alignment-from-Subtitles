1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,070
If you'd like I could come
in for another interview.

2
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,138
As a matter of fact, I
could come in this morning.

3
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:15,108
Yes, I know. But you
said you were interested.

4
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:17,910
Well, you... Actually, you
said you were very interested.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,479
Right. But if you could just...

6
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:20,613
Well...

7
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:24,150
Right, right, right.
Uh, thank you.

8
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:26,786
Thank you.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,154
Want some breakfast?

10
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:30,123
No.

11
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:33,159
Going over applications? Yep.

12
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:35,462
I thought you took
the position at Loyola.

13
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:36,829
Withdrawn. Why?

14
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,798
I don't know. Maybe
because I took another job

15
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:40,166
somewhere else.

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,668
Have you tried
Northwestern? Fully staffed.

17
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:44,270
U. of C.? What do you think?

18
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,174
Right now, I think
you're being an ass.

19
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:50,594
You barely say anything.
And when you do, it's rude.

20
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,462
I talk to you, Cleo.
Not about this.

21
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,765
Why don't you let
me help, Peter?

22
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,399
I don't need your
help, all right?

23
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,068
I need a damn job.

24
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,642
I should have left County
when I had a chance.

25
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,677
Out for fresh air?

26
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,313
Man found down.
ETA is any minute.

27
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,081
Ah, they're letting
you work on traumas.

28
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,284
Provided I only handle
two patients at a time.

29
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,253
Really? Weaver's rules.

30
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,988
Ah. Play by 'em or
die by 'em. Thanks.

31
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,814
She didn't exactly ask me if I
wanted to be assigned to the ER.

32
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,996
What are you supposed to
do while you wait for labs?

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,966
Catch up on medical
journals. That sucks.

34
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,425
Showtime.

35
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:36,389
You with me on this one? Yep.

36
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,675
Fifty-year-old male found
in the park. Full arrest.

37
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,977
That's one well-fed bum.
How'd you load him on a rig?

38
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,512
Paid a bunch of
his buddies 5 bucks.

39
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,232
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

40
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:46,900
One, two, three.

41
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:49,668
Large lac to the
occipital scalp.

42
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,670
Not sure if he was rolled
or fell out of his tree.

43
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,672
What's he doing in a
tree? Maybe he lived in it.

44
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,441
In asytole. Why didn't
you intubate him?

45
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:57,944
His neck's like a power pole.
We couldn't find the cords.

46
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,479
It was 40 degrees last
night. He's hypothermic.

47
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:01,680
We might still get him back.

48
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,482
Oh, yeah? With
what, a blowtorch?

49
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:04,750
No. Active core rewarming.

50
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:06,837
Let's set up for pleural
and peritoneal lavage.

51
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,206
I'm in. Bag him.
Who's got scissors?

52
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,807
Good air bilaterally.

53
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,909
So, Carter, you know
anyone who plays hockey?

54
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,577
Nope. Get me some warm blankets.

55
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,047
I need an extra guy for
a game tonight. I'm busy.

56
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,382
Yeah, I was asking
if you knew anyone.

57
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,117
Okay. Looks like
we're in fine V-fib.

58
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,887
Core temp is 86.
So is his pulse ox.

59
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,723
Charge the paddles to 360.
Why? He's a frozen dinner.

60
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,292
Excuse me. Put two
chest tubes in on the right.

61
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,194
Run warm saline
through the rapid infuser.

62
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,947
You're kidding, right? Not
dead until warm and dead.

63
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,649
I'll prep the chest.
32 French okay?

64
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:37,172
Yep. Okay, everybody clear.

65
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,552
What the hell?

66
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,605
Where did the pigeons come from?

67
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,375
Give me an amp of epi. All
right. Charge again. Clear.

68
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,893
They must have been in
his coat. They're attacking.

69
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,312
Still in V-fib.

70
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,632
Damn it, Dave! Get over here
and do CPR. Charging to 360.

71
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:54,417
Do CPR? The guy's brain-dead.

72
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,303
Not until I say so. Clear.

73
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,242
A bunch of beauty contestants

74
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,110
were in the salon
getting final touches.

75
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,412
A worker mixed the wrong
chemicals, and boom.

76
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,513
Who's the worst?

77
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,448
Ah, that would be
Audrey Hoffman.

78
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,050
Miss Skokie.

79
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,419
She's got lacerations
and partial-thickness burns

80
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,988
on her legs, and
smoke inhalation.

81
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:08,391
Hi, Audrey. I'm Dr. Greene.
My legs. Are they bad?

82
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,093
I'm gonna check
your breathing first.

83
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,228
Can you lean forward?

84
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,497
Any shortness of breath? No.

85
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,399
Uh-huh. Any chest pain?

86
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,434
Not really.

87
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,087
Miss Tri-State is tonight. Mm.

88
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,677
Is it bad?

89
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,927
Well... nothing that won't heal.

90
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:28,595
Does this mean that I'm out?

91
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,313
We're gonna do
everything that we can.

92
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,457
What's your talent?
Rhythmic dancing.

93
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,853
With hoops and ribbons. Mm.

94
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:43,609
Malik, how many times you
gonna pass by with the same cart?

95
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,745
I got a spot on my hockey
team. Do I look like I play hockey?

96
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,115
What about your pal in
cards? Big East-Indian dude.

97
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,950
Malucci, I can skate.
I played in college,

98
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:51,951
if you're in a pinch.

99
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,186
Yeah, yeah. Sure thing, G.

100
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,554
Dr. Chen. Hey, hey, hey.

101
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:57,123
Cute guy, Curtain 3. Daddy
material. Just say thanks, okay?

102
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,191
Oh, Malucci, wait...

103
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,525
Chen. What?

104
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,527
Your mother's been
holding for 10 minutes.

105
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,513
Not very pleasantly,
I might add.

106
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,715
Oh. Just tell her I'm
with a patient. Thank you.

107
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,934
Lying might be part
of your job description.

108
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,438
It's not part of mine.

109
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,506
Yeah. Hello, Mommy.

110
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,274
I... Well, I've been busy.

111
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:16,559
Morning, Dr. Weaver.

112
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,328
Frank, any messages?
Yeah. Quite a few.

113
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,330
Thank you. Power
meeting today, huh?

114
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,866
Yeah, I have a seminar
that I do not have time for.

115
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,436
Could you remind me
to leave by 6, please?

116
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,438
Seemed like a
good idea at the time.

117
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,738
Superglue.

118
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,341
I hope that's one of two.
The bird man still dead?

119
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,843
It's one of one, actually. Is
there any traumas coming in?

120
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,580
No. But I've got a guy in Exam 3

121
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,333
who cut his hand
on a tin can. Ooh.

122
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:42,435
Dr. Gottschalk... do
you have a minute?

123
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,537
Uh, unfortunately, I'm on my way

124
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,439
to a conference,
and I'm very late.

125
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:48,541
I'll make this quick. I'd
like to discuss with you

126
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,076
the faculty position here.

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,745
I really have to go.
I just need a minute.

128
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,947
I apologize for bothering
you like this, but...

129
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,017
After you turned us down,
we offered it to someone else.

130
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,820
Well, has it been
accepted? Well, not officially.

131
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,355
Well, then you can withdraw it.

132
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,357
Our candidate's
credentials are excellent.

133
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:06,026
Well, so are mine.

134
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,594
He has positive
recommendations. And I don't?

135
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,697
I'm not at liberty to discuss
your current standing.

136
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,833
Which means Romano
said something, didn't he?

137
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:14,868
I can't get into this.

138
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,635
No, what did he tell
you? Dr. Benton...

139
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:19,019
No. I need to know what that
man said and who he said it to.

140
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:22,459
You may have difficulty
finding work locally.

141
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,843
That's all I can say. I'm sorry.

142
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,266
It's 1100 hours. Excuse me?

143
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,801
I need to ship out.

144
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,971
Okay. Sir, if you're
waiting for a... A transfer

145
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,474
to another facility... Why
don't we have a nurse help you.

146
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,642
We're taking
Inchon. I... Inchon?

147
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,412
Korea. Huge battle,
if memory serves.

148
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,547
Sorry. He's a wanderer.

149
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,015
What's his story?

150
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,818
Seventy-two years old. From
the Golden Glen Nursing Home.

151
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,120
Altered mental status.

152
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,422
He became combative
and got punched in the nose.

153
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,656
History of dementia?

154
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,725
Uh, no. The military talk
started a few days ago.

155
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,428
Anything on exam?
His nose isn't broken.

156
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,762
But he's got a low-grade temp

157
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,364
with no obvious
signs of infection.

158
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,233
CBC, Chem-7 and UA.

159
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,802
And if his pulse ox is
low, get a chest film.

160
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,186
Ah. Damn tab busted off.

161
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,840
You ever think about
using a can opener?

162
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,575
Yeah, sure. But then what's
the point of having a tab?

163
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:17,480
I started digging
around the edges there.

164
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,150
Well, it looks to me like
you may need a few stitches.

165
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,984
Of course then the
tuna juice leaks out.

166
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,653
And then it gets
greasy all over.

167
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,711
And then, bam. The knife
goes right into my hand.

168
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:32,162
I'm going to do a regional
block to numb the, uh, area

169
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,746
around where I'm
gonna be suturing.

170
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,115
You sure you've
done this before?

171
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,539
Sorry. I need some I&D kits.

172
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,257
You might feel a
little burning. Uh-huh.

173
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm going to the 8:00
tonight, Abby. How about you?

174
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,283
I don't know. Maybe.

175
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,585
The exact same thing
happened when I tried

176
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,271
to open a milk carton
with a pair of scissors.

177
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:00,573
The bruises just sort
of sprang up overnight.

178
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,375
That's why I brought
him in here. Hm.

179
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,843
He has Niemann-Pick's Type A.

180
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,580
I have some material here...

181
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:08,847
if you're not familiar.

182
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:11,351
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

183
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,871
Hm, his liver and
spleen are both enlarged.

184
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,007
That's from the sphingomyelin
deposits in both organs.

185
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,042
Yeah, well, a big spleen
chews up platelets.

186
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,610
That's why he's bleeding.

187
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,279
Is there anything we can do?

188
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,248
Well... we can make
him more comfortable.

189
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,667
I'll order an IV and start
him on some morphine.

190
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,636
Would that make him unconscious?

191
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,903
Because I want him to be lucid

192
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,805
for as long as he can be.

193
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:35,841
Um. It'll be a very
small dose of medicine.

194
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:36,909
What about the spleen?

195
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,511
You said that's
causing the problem.

196
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,015
Well, if it's taken out, that
might help stop the bleeding,

197
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,769
but... you do know
your son is end-stage?

198
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:47,942
Yes.

199
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,159
We'll get an ultrasound
of his abdomen,

200
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:56,029
and... I'll have a
surgeon come take a look.

201
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:58,286
Thank you. Okay. You're welcome.

202
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,356
Dr. Chen? Yes?

203
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,857
I usually wait for
labs to come back

204
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,125
before consulting Surgery.

205
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,493
He's got splenomegaly.

206
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,463
Pretty clear case of bleeding
due to thrombocytopenia.

207
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,231
I thought you said
he was end-stage.

208
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,199
That doesn't mean
he can't have surgery.

209
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,870
I'd think about whether
it's appropriate at this point.

210
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,710
Hi. Hi.

211
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,113
I need to get...

212
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,837
Thanks.

213
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,685
Abby? Yeah.

214
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,444
You... You have a
feather. I have a...

215
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,024
Oh.

216
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,726
We had these...

217
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,794
It's not...

218
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,718
Thank you.

219
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:52,575
What?

220
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,926
Um...

221
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,073
I was just thinking... uh...

222
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,344
I... I was just wondering, if
you wanted, maybe we could...

223
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,648
Could, um...

224
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,320
We could... what?

225
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,689
Go out sometime.

226
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,661
Oh, you mean,
uh, l... Like a date?

227
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,709
Uh, yeah. That's...

228
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,053
sort of what I was thinking.

229
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,787
Tonight?

230
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,370
Sure. Tonight works.

231
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,505
Okay. Okay.

232
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,089
Okay. Yeah.

233
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,785
See you then. Okay.

234
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,719
Romano.

235
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:45,355
Peter. Back for a
visit? How are you?

236
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,639
How the hell do you think I am?

237
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:48,508
Well, judging by your demeanor,

238
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:49,976
I'd say you were
a tad dyspeptic.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,361
Been trashing me all over town?

240
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,396
Oh, having trouble
landing a job, huh?

241
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,631
Thanks to you. Oh,
I'm offended, Peter.

242
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,767
You've made enemies
all over this hospital.

243
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,735
Why assume I'm the
only one with something...?

244
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,670
You're preventing me
from earning a living.

245
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,773
No. No, actually,
I'm willing to help.

246
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,307
What?

247
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,943
Look... your personality sucks.

248
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,312
But you don't have to prove
that you're a great surgeon.

249
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,696
Now, I am willing to offer
you a per diem position.

250
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,834
Per diem? Yeah.

251
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:17,003
It has no benefits
and even less stature,

252
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:19,243
but, uh... it's yours
for the asking.

253
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,177
You can kiss my ass.
I take it that's a "no"?

254
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,245
You couldn't pay me
enough to work for you again,

255
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,713
you arrogant little prick.

256
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,505
Fair enough. Just keep working
on those people skills, Peter.

257
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,305
Labs are back on
Mr. Mellonston. Oh, good.

258
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,374
Great color. Thanks.

259
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,842
UA's full of white cells.

260
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,011
He's got a rip-roaring
urinary-tract infection.

261
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,846
Sorry I called you
down here prematurely.

262
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,915
Always happens with
nursing-home patients.

263
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,717
Take an old guy,
give him a bad UTI,

264
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,002
next thing you know,
he's General MacArthur.

265
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,955
I called the home, and they've
already given his bed away.

266
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,691
Hey! Any family members
who can take him in?

267
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,261
No, he's at the mercy
of Social Services.

268
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,762
Hey. Back to work.
Get back to work.

269
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,347
Come on. The show's over.

270
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:03,850
Maybe not. He talks like a vet.

271
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:05,985
If he is one, he could
qualify for the VA.

272
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,137
Yeah. That'll take
days to process.

273
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,756
I know a caseworker at
North Chicago with pull.

274
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,276
Maybe we can transfer
today. Do you want me to call?

275
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,043
Sure. If you think it
can be done. Mm-hm.

276
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,880
Anybody missing an old
man looking for brass cleaner?

277
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,249
He just walked
into a pelvic exam.

278
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,901
Mr. Mellonston!

279
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,670
Mr. Mellonston?

280
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:27,373
Hey, Kerry. Hold on.
Peter. I thought you'd left us.

281
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,475
I could be talked into
coming down to the ER.

282
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,177
As an Attending? As
a liaison to Surgery.

283
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,614
As a surgical resident
you went out of your way

284
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,549
to take every
procedure away from us.

285
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:39,218
But think about this. If you had
a surgeon teaching residents,

286
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,686
more procedures would stay here.

287
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,388
How? I could expedite
cases to the O.R.

288
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,989
We have surgical
residents for that.

289
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,559
Could you tell me if there's
an elderly gentleman in there?

290
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,795
Uh, does 47 count?
No. Thank you.

291
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,496
Right. See, I could
do scheduling and...

292
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,198
God knows we could use
the help. Kerry, hire me.

293
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,234
Look, I'd love to. Get
Romano to pay for it,

294
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,537
you got yourself a job.

295
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:59,881
Trolling for work, Peter?

296
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,126
Dr. Chen. Uh.

297
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,260
I'm interested to see

298
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,162
what required the
interruption of my lunch.

299
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,364
As I explained on the phone,

300
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,132
splenomegaly and
thrombocytopenia.

301
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,668
So you'll operate? Well... no.

302
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,470
I would if he didn't
have Niemann-Pick's.

303
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,805
Snow him and wait.

304
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,906
No, we can't just let
him slowly bleed to death.

305
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,375
It's a terminal disease.

306
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,744
Surgery will only slightly
delay the inevitable.

307
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,679
Well, if the surgery
were successful,

308
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,648
then the family would
have more time with him.

309
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,784
Yeah. And if wishes were horses,
we'd all be knee-deep in crap.

310
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,520
Look. I didn't become a
surgeon to torture dying children.

311
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,657
Let the boy die in peace.
But the mother wants it.

312
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,727
No surgery, Dr. Chen.

313
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,532
What the hell is this?
Explosion at a hair salon.

314
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,801
Sad cultural
commentary, isn't it?

315
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,692
Pursuit of beauty at all costs.

316
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,272
Nice legs, though.

317
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,576
There you go.

318
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,511
Oh, God. What am I going to do?

319
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,945
It probably won't scar.

320
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,648
Yeah, but they look hideous.
I can't go on-stage like this.

321
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,452
Can you wear pants? Not
in the swimsuit competition.

322
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,988
You know, you probably
think this is so stupid.

323
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,646
I'm just trying to win a
scholarship. I'm premed.

324
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,095
So I can give you something
for the pain if you'd like.

325
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,898
It's okay. They look
worse than they feel.

326
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,768
Okay. Excuse me.

327
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,336
Malik, can you get ahold of
Miss Pruitt at Abbott and Sons?

328
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,038
Oh, yeah, Miss
Pruitt. You mean that...

329
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,640
Don't ask. Just do it.

330
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,941
Hey, Dave? Yeah.

331
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,309
Did you find anybody yet?

332
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,078
Uh, for what? For
hockey tonight.

333
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,214
Oh, uh, yeah. A friend
of mine. He might sign on.

334
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,283
Former pro. Just
looking for some exercise.

335
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,517
Oh, okay. Yeah.

336
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,452
It's kind of a rough
game we play, actually...

337
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,088
So y-you don't
think I can handle it.

338
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,222
Oh, I didn't say that. I...

339
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,792
I used to play
varsity, second line.

340
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,049
Well... if he can't
make it, I'll call you then.

341
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:47,546
Type and cross for four.

342
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,982
Start two units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser.

343
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:51,183
What happened?

344
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,886
Multiple GSWs. One to the chest.

345
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,855
Looks like a
hemopneumothorax on the right.

346
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,106
Five hundred cc's out.

347
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,943
Lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.

348
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,112
We need to crack her chest.

349
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,432
Right-sided GSW's an
indication for the sternal saw.

350
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:07,533
Can I do it?

351
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:09,290
Next time, Carter. Ten blade.

352
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,028
Hold CPR.

353
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,531
Sternal saw.

354
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,731
She needs a
central line. I'll do it.

355
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,203
Mr. Mellonston?

356
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,893
Mr. Mellonston?

357
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,508
Mr. Mellonston.

358
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,645
He said he lost his
razor on Old Baldy.

359
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,714
Wanted to borrow mine.

360
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,983
Gil didn't really
need it though.

361
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,519
All he had was peach fuzz.

362
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,421
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

363
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,056
A... mortar shell

364
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,592
took his head off.

365
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,862
Why don't we take you back to
your bed so you can rest? Mm.

366
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,418
Okay? Here we go.

367
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,868
You... You've seen
war, haven't you?

368
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,558
Actually, no. I have not. Mm.

369
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,610
But you've seen men die.

370
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,732
Yes. Mm.

371
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,481
Mr. Mellonston,
I-I-I'm afraid I have

372
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,784
some... rather unfortunate news.

373
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,653
Uh, you've lost your
bed at the nursing home.

374
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,356
But we've already
called the VA... No!

375
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,823
To see if there's a placement.

376
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,226
No. They won't take me.
Well, I'm sure that you qualify.

377
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,994
I won't go there! Please try...

378
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,529
I can't go there. I won't!

379
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,482
Please, calm down.
We're only trying to help.

380
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:32,535
I can't go there. I won't.
Malik! Malik, come over...

381
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,988
Mm. No, please!
Don't let them take me.

382
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:39,980
Don't let them take
me away. Please.

383
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:47,254
His nose stopped bleeding.
What did you find out?

384
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,571
Well, the surgeon feels
that it's too great a risk

385
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,807
to operate on Kenneth.

386
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:57,108
But he's suffering.
Can't you see that?

387
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,978
Miss Stein, Kenneth
is barely conscious.

388
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:02,981
That's not true. He
squeezes my hand.

389
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,350
He understands me.

390
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:07,486
That means everything that
can be done should be done.

391
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,155
Yes. But there's a good
chance that Kenneth

392
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,460
won't survive the operation.

393
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,560
I know what you're thinking.

394
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,613
I'm selfish.

395
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,449
I'm keeping my son
alive for me, not him.

396
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,090
Miss Stein, I'm not
thinking... He's my child.

397
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:26,594
I want every minute
I can with him.

398
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,542
Wait till you're a mother.

399
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:32,628
Then you'll know.

400
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,986
Get him this surgery.

401
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,720
Looks like a small-caliber
GSW to the right ventricle.

402
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:43,310
Okay. That should do it.

403
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,880
Heart's not filling.
She's had five units.

404
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,749
We need more volume.
Prep the paddles.

405
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,308
Ooh. Can't shock an empty
heart. You'll never get her back.

406
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,424
Run in another two
units. Give me some 0 silk.

407
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,808
Hold compressions. What
are you doing, Carter?

408
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,213
Beck's suture.

409
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:09,749
All right. Keep
traction on that.

410
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:12,635
I'll check the back
side of the heart.

411
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,674
What do you see?

412
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:18,808
Exit wound in the left
ventricle. Give me 2-0 silk.

413
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,476
I can repair it.
Not from that side.

414
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,845
I have a better angle here.

415
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,013
Hm.

416
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,981
I saw blood welling
up behind the heart.

417
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,151
I thought there
might be another hole.

418
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,425
Okay. Charge to 20.

419
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,261
Okay. Now cut it.

420
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,661
Okay.

421
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,629
Clear.

422
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,747
Still V-fib.

423
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:44,717
Okay. Charge to 30. Clear.

424
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:49,371
Got a rhythm. Sinus tach.

425
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,041
Got a pulse. Nice job, Carter.

426
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,292
Notify the O.R.

427
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:55,710
She's got a septal
defect they need to repair.

428
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,580
Dr. Kovac. Mrs. Danzer's
having more chest pain,

429
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,965
dropped her pressure to 90.

430
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,968
I'll be right there. You
gonna take her up? Mm-hm.

431
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:05,375
Sterile saline dressings
and hang the FFP.

432
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:10,226
Great save, Carter.
Very slick. Thanks.

433
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,452
Ativan? Yeah, 0.5.
He's pretty subdued.

434
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,154
Excuse me.

435
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,573
Did you hear from the VA?
There's good news and bad news.

436
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,241
I found Mr. Mellonston a bed.

437
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,245
But it's in a brig. He's AWOL.

438
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,964
AWOL? From where?

439
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:35,634
Korean War. 1951. Army corporal.

440
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:36,868
Deserted on leave.

441
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,371
Unfortunately, my VA
contact took it upon himself

442
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,973
to notify the active military.

443
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:43,976
Why care about someone
who deserted 50 years ago?

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,578
Who knows? They may
want to slap him on the wrist.

445
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,147
They may want to
court-martial him.

446
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,649
Oh, for God's sake.
He's 72 years old.

447
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:51,989
I know.

448
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,737
Is there anything we can do?

449
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:58,162
Legally? No.

450
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,285
Hey. Peter. What
are you doing here?

451
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,501
Did you get any of my messages?

452
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,737
Yes. Uh, and I
meant to call you.

453
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,972
I've just been incredibly busy.

454
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,925
Uh, I just didn't
know what to say.

455
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,047
Yeah, well... it's okay.

456
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:23,115
No. No, it's not<i> okay.</i>

457
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,459
I've been avoiding you for days.

458
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,041
Yeah. I got that.

459
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,707
I'm sorry. What
Robert did was wrong.

460
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,476
And I've told him as much.

461
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,412
I just wish there was
something I could do.

462
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,698
Yeah, well, I didn't exactly
expect you to resign in protest.

463
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:42,042
That's a relief.

464
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:44,937
There is something
you can do though.

465
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:46,272
You can put the word out.

466
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,656
I know you've got a lot of
contacts at other hospitals.

467
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,058
Of course.

468
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,845
I'm surprised you haven't
been snapped up already.

469
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:55,413
Yeah, well... it
seems that lately

470
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,833
my reputation has taken a hit.

471
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,953
He's a horrid
little turd, isn't he?

472
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:04,523
You know what?

473
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,591
I spoke with a friend
of mine in Philadelphia

474
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:08,093
who's looking for someone.

475
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,995
I just wasn't sure
you'd care to move.

476
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,931
At this point, I'm
open to anything.

477
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:14,016
Dr. Benton, they
need you in the ER.

478
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,902
I no longer work
at this hospital.

479
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:19,043
Weaver called. Your
sister Jackie is down there.

480
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,577
What was the last BP? 100/60.

481
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,934
Okay, let's go. I'll
grab the drug box.

482
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,916
How is she? Who are you?

483
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,151
Her sister.

484
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:35,287
She was shot in the
chest. She's critical.

485
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:37,105
She needs surgery.
You can go wait in...

486
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,345
Oh, Lord. What happened?

487
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,065
Call Security now!

488
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,668
Oh, my God! Carter!
Carter? Are you all right?

489
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:53,005
Heart stopped beating.
I'll start compressions.

490
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,441
Any rhythm? Agonal
at 34. Looks like P.E.A.

491
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:59,044
Amp of atropine, amp of
epi. Mix up the dopamine.

492
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,279
That girl must've
been a gangbanger.

493
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,032
Chest is dry.

494
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:07,336
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
There's gray matter everywhere.

495
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,072
You won't get her back.
Blew her brains out.

496
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,374
Hyperventilators,
70 of mannitol.

497
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,742
Check cold-water
calorics, and we'll call it.

498
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,646
Somebody call the police!

499
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,319
What happened?
Jesse got into a fight.

500
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,787
You don't know, all right?

501
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,689
I was surprised when
they said<i> you</i> were here.

502
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,758
I had to take care of
something. How is he?

503
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,943
Superficial lac
above the eyebrow,

504
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,612
mild periorbital swelling.

505
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:36,031
But no bony deformity
or tenderness.

506
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,299
- Nothing serious.
- Told you.

507
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,068
He was bleeding pretty bad.

508
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,987
Did you hit your head? Pass out?

509
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:46,125
He slammed me into the
locker once, all right? That's all.

510
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:49,161
You get a CT? No.
You think he needs one?

511
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:50,295
Maybe.

512
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,665
There was no LOC,
no focal neuro deficits.

513
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,085
They say with head injuries,
you can't be too careful.

514
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,953
Jackie. He's fine.

515
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,257
He's fine.

516
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,225
Come on. Hey, Jackie.

517
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,027
How about I buy
you a cup of coffee?

518
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,895
Are you sure? Yeah. Come on.

519
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,661
How are you doing? I'm okay.

520
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,411
They found the shooter. Good.

521
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,212
Only 15 years old.

522
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,564
Why don't you go home?

523
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,085
I'll be all right.

524
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,888
Go home.

525
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,879
You've probably seen
enough trauma for one day.

526
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,398
I'll tell Kerry.

527
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,460
He's a teenager.
It's normal stuff.

528
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:56,795
No. He's changing.

529
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:58,897
You're just not around
enough to notice anymore.

530
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,298
What does that supposed to mean?

531
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:03,167
He's got a girlfriend
now. She's pretty rough.

532
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,537
You try talking to him?
We've tried everything.

533
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:08,006
Grounding him is a joke.
Doesn't care. Goes out anyway.

534
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,808
I can't have him locked up.

535
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:11,443
The other day he
shoved his father.

536
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,947
Took everything
Walter had not to...

537
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:17,504
You all right?

538
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,789
Can you talk to him?

539
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,123
Can you try?

540
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,113
Uh, talking to him? Mm.

541
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,695
Maybe he'll listen to you.

542
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,086
Yeah.

543
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:37,135
Hey. Hey.

544
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,293
You look nice.
Thank you. You too.

545
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,607
So, uh, what did
you have in mind?

546
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:43,942
Dinner? Movie?

547
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:46,878
I was thinking of something
a little more physical.

548
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,114
Well, not if you go
in laparoscopically.

549
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:51,649
Recovery time is reduced,
and he gains back weeks,

550
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:54,319
maybe even months of his life.

551
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:56,788
No, I don't understand. Are
you saying that it's too risky

552
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,011
for you or for the patient?

553
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:03,194
Yeah, whatever. Thank you.

554
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,696
Problems? Can't find a surgeon.

555
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,866
Is our department booked?
No. Just uninterested.

556
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,668
This your kid with
Niemann-Pick's?

557
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,903
Yeah.

558
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,072
Tough situation.

559
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,408
I all but promised his
mother I'd make this happen.

560
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,842
Now you can't?

561
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:20,178
Well, there are a few
other people I can try. Ah.

562
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:22,847
But you know
they'll... turn you down.

563
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:25,817
You know, sometimes as
much as we like to give it...

564
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:27,941
hope can be cruel.

565
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,478
Dr. Greene.

566
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,247
Think fast!

567
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,473
Eight o'clock...
tonight. You're in.

568
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,071
I can't believe the VA
is moving this quickly.

569
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:49,173
They're not. I got
him into another home.

570
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:50,675
Borrowed a Social
Security number

571
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:51,909
from a corpse at the morgue.

572
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,878
Sour cream and
onion? No. Thank you.

573
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:55,947
Y-you borrowed a number
from a deceased person?

574
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,783
Yeah. We do it all the time.
Oh. I don't wanna know this.

575
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,486
You said you felt bad.
Hey, that is not the point.

576
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,388
I work with a lot of
elderly homeless.

577
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:04,456
You learn a few tricks...

578
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,358
Not another word,
please! You have to.

579
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:08,059
Dr. Weaver. Time
for that seminar.

580
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,126
Thank you, Frank.

581
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,946
"Advances in
Neuroleptic Therapy"?

582
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,364
Yeah. How did you know?

583
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:14,950
I'll be there. Save you a seat.

584
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:19,787
So where is this body?
The patient is right here.

585
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,522
Audrey? Can I go home now?

586
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,258
Not yet. This is Miss Pruitt.

587
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,492
And she's here to help you.

588
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,178
She's an expert cosmetologist.

589
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:28,297
Can you cover all of this
in time for the pageant?

590
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:31,717
Honey... I've worked
on worse. Trust me.

591
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,351
Yeah, but I've got open wounds.

592
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,587
You're on antibiotics.
But afterwards,

593
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:37,856
no makeup until
you're fully healed.

594
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,791
Thank you,
Dr. Greene. Good luck.

595
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,093
Thanks.

596
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:43,561
Isn't that the gal who does
makeup on dead people?

597
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:44,730
Whatever works.

598
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,598
Mark. There you are.

599
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:48,600
You know we were meant
to leave half an hour ago?

600
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:49,701
For what?

601
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:51,502
We're looking at
artwork tonight.

602
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,638
Oh. I'm subbing in a
hockey game. What?

603
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:55,540
Malucci. He asked
me to play hockey.

604
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:56,992
Malucci? Are you mad?

605
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,394
Wha... What?

606
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,796
Well, you never said one
word to me about hockey before.

607
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,887
You never asked.

608
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,268
Do you play well?

609
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,772
Well, why don't
you come find out?

610
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:13,508
You could wear your sweater.

611
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:14,876
You could bring some pom-poms.

612
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,744
I'd be in uniform.

613
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,147
I didn't know sports
had this effect on you.

614
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,398
Has something happened?

615
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,542
No, why?

616
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,701
You're home early.

617
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,769
Yep.

618
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,738
You never leave
the hospital early.

619
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,562
Someone fax you my schedule?

620
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,577
I know when you
left this morning.

621
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,663
And I know the kind
of hours you put in.

622
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:53,849
Yeah, it was slow,
so they sent me home.

623
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,734
So it's been all right? Yep.

624
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,856
What you expected?
Ooh. I'm hungry.

625
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,473
How about you? Have you eaten?

626
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:03,942
I'll take you to Dominic's.

627
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:06,928
John... to be honest...

628
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,731
I hoped that you would
feel so uncomfortable there

629
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,499
that you wouldn't want to stay.

630
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,701
I know.

631
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,969
So that I wouldn't
have to ask you not to.

632
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,437
Well, then don't.

633
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,339
Just give me five
minutes. I'll get changed.

634
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,473
John.

635
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,745
I know your heart
is in the right place.

636
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,164
I know you enjoy being a doctor.

637
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:27,899
Start a practice.

638
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,334
I'm not fighting you
on that anymore.

639
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:32,436
Can't we just agree
to disagree on this?

640
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,541
No. There<i> are</i> other
ways to help people.

641
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,343
You don't have
to destroy yourself.

642
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:39,444
Gamma...

643
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,097
That place nearly
killed you, John.

644
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,365
It killed your friend.

645
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,518
It drove you to drugs.

646
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:47,936
No. I did that on my own.

647
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,371
You don't owe them anything.

648
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,774
You don't have
to <i>prove</i> anything.

649
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,776
You have a beautiful spirit.

650
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,812
I've seen them beat
that spirit out of you.

651
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,081
Gamma. I'm gonna be fine.

652
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,506
I promise.

653
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,511
I wish I could believe you.

654
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,815
Gamma?

655
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,052
Wait. Stop spinning.
You're not supposed to spin.

656
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:23,771
How am I supposed
to keep you from...?

657
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:26,279
Ah!

658
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,478
It's all in the wrists, really.

659
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:30,846
I-I think I pulled a muscle.

660
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,380
Oh. Maybe we
should take a break.

661
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,104
Good idea.

662
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,471
Draft, please. Abby?

663
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:42,574
- Oh. Can I have a club soda?
- Club soda.

664
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:43,909
Okay.

665
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,711
So, uh, next time
I choose the sport.

666
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,497
You know, something
more civilized.

667
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,915
Uh. Such as?

668
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,750
There's a pool
table at my hotel.

669
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:53,301
Your hotel?

670
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:57,139
Yeah. I mean. I don't own
it. I just... Just live there.

671
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,724
You live in a hotel?
Yeah. As a doctor.

672
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:01,359
I take care of the tourists.

673
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,703
They give me a
break on the rent.

674
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,514
Huh.

675
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,048
No, it's a good deal.

676
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,873
I mean, maid service,
laundry, amenities.

677
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,904
No, it's... It's... It's great.

678
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,772
You'll have to come see it.

679
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:16,676
Your hotel room? Yeah.

680
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,328
I-I mean... I
mean, no. I mean...

681
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,481
I'd never ask such
a thing of a lady.

682
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,951
Well, especially
after just one kiss.

683
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,852
No. I should hope not.

We out of here or not?

693
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:56,247
Yeah.

694
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,548
After we talk.

695
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:58,549
About what?

696
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:00,217
Ahh.

697
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,720
Your mom says you've
been hanging out a lot lately.

698
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:05,790
So? So she worries about you.

699
00:31:05,814 --> 00:31:07,158
She worries about everything.

700
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:08,376
That's what she does.

701
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,715
You got new friends?
New girl. That's it.

702
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:17,218
Using a condom? Uncle Peter...

703
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,554
I'm serious.

704
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,861
I'm not stupid.

705
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,513
Good.

706
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,764
I'm not doing
anything, all right?

707
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:30,788
It's just...

708
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,818
I'm a man, you know?

709
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,693
And my folks just can't
get used to it. That's all.

710
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,026
Well, maybe they would if
you treated them with respect.

711
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,827
You mean do what they say.

712
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,696
Look...

713
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,231
sometimes you gotta do
what you don't wanna do.

714
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,833
That's part of being a man.

715
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:51,336
Peter. Do you have a minute?

716
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,059
Uh, yeah. Hold
on a second, okay?

717
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,507
Just...

718
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:58,315
Just do what your
mother says, all right?

719
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:10,471
That job's yours if you
want it. Are you serious?

720
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,908
You're a full Surgical Attending
on the academic track. Oh, man.

721
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,843
Thank you. I'm so happy for you.

722
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,745
What's all of the
celebrating about?

723
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,013
I got a job.

724
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,348
That's great.

725
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,017
Yeah. Uh, Elizabeth pulled
some strings with her friend.

726
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,552
Where? Hahnemann.

727
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,187
They made me a full Attending.

728
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,455
In Philadelphia.

729
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,990
Anyway, um, he's
expecting your call.

730
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,292
Oh. Oh. Right, right. Thanks.

731
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,615
Sure.

732
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:35,914
I didn't have much of a choice.

733
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,499
I mean, I'm being
blackballed here.

734
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,301
When will I see you?

735
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:42,903
Well, it's only an hour by air.
We'll, uh, work something out.

736
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,105
I guess so.

737
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,307
You coming home with
us? No. I gotta make a stop.

738
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,709
Can you do me a
favor and take him?

739
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,776
Of course.

740
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:55,021
I'll, uh... I'll call you.

741
00:32:57,092 --> 00:32:58,092
Okay.

742
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,722
What? All I'm saying is:

743
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,424
You were at four and
then you were at six.

744
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,293
That's because I
scored very quickly.

745
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,894
You're a bad sport.

746
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,230
I can't handle
losing to a girl, okay?

747
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,665
Oh, no.

748
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,702
I'm... I'm kidding. I actually
enjoyed losing to you, Abby.

749
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:17,104
Thank you. Thank
you. That's much better.

750
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,106
Your hands are freezing.
You wanna catch a cab?

751
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,176
No. This is strolling
weather in Minnesota.

752
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,646
Is that where home
is? It's where I grew up...

753
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,514
Luka!

754
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,851
Give me your purse.
Give me the purse.

755
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,042
Give me the damn...
Give me the purse!

756
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,114
Luka!

757
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:45,033
Luka! Stop!

758
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,801
Stop! Luka! Stop!

759
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,542
Stop it!

760
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:09,841
Let's play the game.

761
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:11,664
You okay, Dr. Greene?

762
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,231
I thought you said this
was a no-check league.

763
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,099
There's no such thing
as a no-check league.

764
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,222
Thanks for the tip.

765
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:28,743
Hi. I thought you'd
left. Um, briefly.

766
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,967
You know, you don't
need to finish your shift.

767
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,470
I still got a couple hours left.

768
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,986
Carter. I think that
you'd be better served

769
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,672
by taking it easy.

770
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:42,640
I'll go to a meeting
after my shift's over.

771
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,664
If that's okay with you?

772
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:47,295
I need to finish.

773
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,330
All right. But not too much.

774
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,049
Keep it to minor medical.

775
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:52,883
Thank you.

776
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,667
Have a nice night. You too.

777
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,342
What's open? Trauma 2.

778
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,143
I thought you two went home.

779
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,645
This guy attacked us.

780
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:06,231
Blunt head trauma
with LOC. GCS of eight.

781
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:08,566
Three seizures en route.
He's had four of Ativan.

782
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,468
Luka, you're
bleeding. I'm all right.

783
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:11,769
BP 180/100.

784
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,439
I'll take it from here. Luka.

785
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:16,474
Get someone to take care of him.

786
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:18,660
Hey, Carter. I need you in here.

787
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,261
Uh, Dr. Weaver doesn't want...

788
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,630
I don't care. Get in here.
We've got a major head trauma.

789
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:26,801
On my count. One, two, three.

790
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,370
He's seizing.

791
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,507
Two of Ativan. CBC, chem panel,
coags, type and cross for four.

792
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,259
Give me some suction
now. He's vomiting.

793
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:36,728
Get X-ray in here for a C-spine.

794
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:38,730
All right. I'll
stabilize the neck.

795
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:41,699
Ativan's on
board. Still seizing.

796
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:47,004
Hey, Carla.

797
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,242
Peter. Uh, we need to talk.

798
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:54,145
Here, okay? Really
busy tonight. Sure.

799
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:57,615
Here you go. Pick it
up. Table eight first.

800
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,617
I called the hospital.
They said that Reece

801
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:01,218
could stay until the
end of the month.

802
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,821
Good. That gives us more time
to find another daycare center.

803
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,291
It'll be hard finding him
a place he loves more.

804
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:09,427
Yeah, I know. Listen, uh, I
just got an Attending position

805
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:10,795
at Hahnemann in Philadelphia.

806
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:12,029
Really? Yeah.

807
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:13,398
Good for you.

808
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:16,166
So we just need to work out
Reece's visitation schedule.

809
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,352
Uh, maybe he could fly down

810
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:18,853
every other weekend
or something.

811
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,691
I'm sorry. You're not really
suggesting I put my son

812
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,193
on a plane by himself, are you?

813
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:28,980
Carla... we have joint custody.

814
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:30,836
In Chicago.

815
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,018
I already took the job.

816
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:36,920
Mm. Wish that had worked
for me when I wanted to move.

817
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,756
That was Germany, nine
hours away. Completely different.

818
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,459
No. It is completely the same.

819
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:42,926
What is this about? Payback?

820
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,080
No, it's about our agreement.
Now, either you stay local

821
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,665
or you give up custody.

822
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,551
I can't find a
decent position here.

823
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,886
Oh. That's right. You
have your career to think of.

824
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,688
The rest of us just have jobs.

825
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,289
Table six needs more bread.

826
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,508
This is the only way for me
to keep my momentum going.

827
00:36:57,532 --> 00:36:58,893
Yes. And Germany was Roger's.

828
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,812
No, Carla, I'm asking
you not to do this.

829
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:04,704
I'm not doing anything. I'm
just playing by your rules.

830
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:20,898
Hang Dilantin. One
gram per 1000 of saline.

831
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,474
Looks pretty deep.
You need suturing.

832
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,498
I'm okay.

833
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,280
Someone should sew
it up, Luka. I'm okay.

834
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:37,584
Dr. Kovac?

835
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,159
Detective Stetler.
Can I have a moment?

836
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,342
Can you tell me
exactly what happened?

837
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,912
We were walking by
the river. He jumped us.

838
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,536
Was there only
one assailant? Yeah.

839
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,620
Seizing stopped at 2142.
Lateral neck looks good.

840
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:01,656
We need some more Kerlix.
He's soaked through these.

841
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,409
Whoa, we got a
pumper. Curved Kelly.

842
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:08,162
Pressure's sky-high,
260/140. Pulse down to 42.

843
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:11,599
Start the Nipride. Blown
right pupil. He's herniating.

844
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,336
Eighty of mannitol. Prep
for a posterior burr hole.

845
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,171
Hurry up, Carter. I
need you to assist.

846
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:20,308
Perforator drill with
a chisel-point bit.

847
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,426
Damn it, Carter, tie
that off! I'm trying!

848
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,261
Well, stick a finger
on it, for God's sake.

849
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:26,914
V-tach. No pulse. Starting
chest compressions.

850
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,417
Charge to 200. HALEH:
Carter, can you grab paddles?

851
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,236
I'm controlling the bleeder.
Get a pressure dressing on it.

852
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,587
Give me those four-by-fours.

853
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,931
Haleh, I need that
drill. Come on, come on.

854
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,342
Okay. Clear.

855
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,802
I didn't see him coming.

856
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:46,250
After he hit you from
behind, what happened?

857
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:49,003
I went down.

858
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,707
Did he take your wallet? Yeah.

859
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,258
And you felt your
life was in danger.

860
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:55,960
Mine and hers.

861
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:57,995
V-fib. No pulse.

862
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,539
Did he threaten to hurt you?

863
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,267
I'm not sure.

864
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,137
Did he say, "Give me
your money, or I'll kill you"?

865
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,338
He had a pipe.

866
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:09,140
Uh, uh...

867
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,430
He was going after Abby.

868
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,530
And you can corroborate that?

869
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:18,149
Yeah.

870
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:19,916
Okay. Let's wait

871
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,917
and see what happens.

872
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,386
Seems clear it was self-defense.

873
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,930
Shouldn't be a problem, doc.

874
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:41,339
There. That's the inner table.

875
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:42,974
Irrigate the bone dust.

876
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:44,175
Looks like a subdural.

877
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,227
More irrigation,
Carter. Eleven blade.

878
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,229
Five minutes since the
last epi. Give another amp.

879
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,854
Opening the dura.
Get ready to suction.

880
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,486
Can you see the source?

881
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,272
No. Let's just pack it off.

882
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,942
What's the rhythm?

883
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,244
V-fib. Charge to 300.

884
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:04,862
I need saline gauze.

885
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:06,552
Clear.

886
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,635
Sinus brady at 50. Got a pulse.

887
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,254
Excellent. Decompress the brain.

888
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,878
Amp of atropine.
Let's check the pupils.

889
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,244
How about phenobarb?

890
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:22,913
Go with pentobarb...
200, slow IV push.

891
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:24,331
That'll induce a coma, you know.

892
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,795
It's either that
or watch him die.

893
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:32,423
Luka, Abby told me about what
happened. Can I take a look?

894
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:33,691
It's superficial.

895
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:36,749
Did you lose consciousness?
For a moment, yeah.

896
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,947
Come on. Let's fix you up. No.

897
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,721
Do you have a
headache? Leave me alone!

898
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:49,128
I'm... I'm fine,
okay? I'm... I'm fine.

899
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,116
Clear.

900
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,938
Still V-fib.

901
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:58,943
How long's the
bretylium been on board?

902
00:41:58,967 --> 00:41:59,967
Five minutes.

903
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,052
Clear.

904
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,802
Asystole. What now?

905
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,571
Open up the dopamine.

906
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:11,672
It's been 45 minutes.

907
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,274
Ah.

908
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:14,630
I know.

909
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:46,107
Luka.

910
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:49,110
Luka, wait!

911
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:54,770
Luka, wait.
