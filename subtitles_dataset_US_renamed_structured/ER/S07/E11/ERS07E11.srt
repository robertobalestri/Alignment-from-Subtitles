1
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,650
Hello?

2
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,420
What?

3
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,954
Who is this?

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,405
Okay, tell me what happened.

5
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,707
Who is it? Kynesha, slow down.

6
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,169
Hey, it's me. What's wrong?

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,940
Did he put his hands on you?

8
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,821
All right.

9
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,511
Where are you now?

10
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,893
What intersection?

11
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,861
All right. No, no, no,
just... Just wait there.

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,085
I'll pick you up.
Yeah, I'll be there.

13
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,866
You're going?

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,036
She got into it with somebody
at the halfway house.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,171
She got scared and took off.

16
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,407
Did she report it
to the manager?

17
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,143
I don't know. I guess there's
some kinda problem there too.

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,878
So where is she?

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,780
South Federal.

20
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,049
I thought that wasn't
a safe neighborhood.

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,453
That's all she knows, Cleo.

22
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,255
Peter, don't you think
that it's a little strange

23
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,859
that she waited until 4:00
in the morning to call us?

24
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,061
Yeah, but what you
do you want me to do?

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,832
Leave her out on the street?
It's 10 degrees outside.

26
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,416
You're never going
to get rid of her.

27
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:51,938
Hey.

28
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:54,908
Mark, go to sleep.

29
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:56,977
You feeling nauseous?

30
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,333
No.

31
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,414
Have a bad dream?

32
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,049
Please, Mark.

33
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:05,485
You've gotta get your rest.

34
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:06,842
So do you.

35
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:11,491
You shouldn't be walking
around. You could fall.

36
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:13,248
Good thing you're a doctor.

37
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,081
How long have you been up?

38
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,375
I never went to sleep, really.

39
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:26,005
No point worrying about it.

40
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,607
There's nothing you can do.

41
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,676
Gordon didn't say
anything else? Any...?

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,647
Any indication why this
meeting was so urgent?

43
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:36,872
Just that Patterson's
lawyers called it.

44
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,453
It's probably not bad.

45
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,955
They wanna talk.

46
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,241
Yeah, but what about?

47
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,131
You'll know soon enough.

48
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,198
Hurry! Open up! Open up!

49
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,733
Hurry up. Kynesha, what the...?

50
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,601
Go! MAN 1: Hey, hey!

51
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,604
Open up! Hey,
hey, right here. Go!

52
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,907
Hey!

53
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,275
You owe me, girl! MAN 2:
Hey, man, come back here.

54
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,194
I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you.

55
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,295
What the hell was that?

56
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,065
A bunch of fools
used to be my friends.

57
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,617
I told them you a doctor.

58
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,070
Ain't nothing on this radio?

59
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,506
<i>♪ ...trash Getting all Pampers ♪</i>

60
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,543
<i>♪ Looking like some old
Washed-up exotic dancers ♪</i>

61
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,797
I don't understand.
You don't like the food?

62
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,133
The room-service guy
has seen all my pajamas.

63
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:34,567
So we'll just get up earlier.

64
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:36,770
Or we could sleep
in, at my place.

65
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,672
Dr. Kovac, the paramedics
are 10 minutes out

66
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,240
for a possible hip
fracture. Can you take him?

67
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:44,132
Yeah. Guess you're
having breakfast alone.

68
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,513
John, how'd it go last night?

69
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,815
With what?

70
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,483
Weaver. Did you tell her?

71
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,152
Right. Uh, I think
I'm gonna wait

72
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,087
until after my
midyear evaluation.

73
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,723
When's that? Sometime today.

74
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,591
You're procrastinating.

75
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,026
You're nagging.

76
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,227
No, I'm being your sponsor.

77
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,996
It's different than
being my mother.

78
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,564
Don't you think? Okay.

79
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,933
Mr. Lambert's in Curtain
3 with fever and cough,

80
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:09,402
Mr. Mohlsick in
Exam 1 with frostbite.

81
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:11,738
Carter, you got evaluation
at 11:00 in the lounge.

82
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:13,106
Yes, ma'am. Don't be late.

83
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,441
So you want Mrs. Furtado?
She has vaginal bleeding.

84
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,078
She had it last month too. It's
called her period. What else?

85
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:20,379
Oh, Roger Pilarsky's back.
He has abdominal pain.

86
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,915
Oh, no. Again?
It's the cold snap.

87
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,083
When it dips below 20...

88
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:25,173
I know. Where is he? Exam 2.

89
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,771
Like a "bishop" bishop?

90
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,572
Yep. I think he may
have confirmed me.

91
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,774
Oh.

92
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,976
Started a line and gave
him four of morphine.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,695
Sir, were you able to
get up after your fall?

94
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,430
He tried, but several
of us had to help.

95
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:39,999
I can speak for myself.
Peripheral pulses plus two.

96
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,452
Call him "Your
Excellency." Bishop is fine.

97
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,655
All right. Let's get him inside
and get him into a gown.

98
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,626
All right. You have a
rear window in stock?

99
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,362
Great. Great. All right, thanks.

100
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,820
That shower felt good.

101
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,938
Don't worry about the
window. I'll pay for it.

102
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,142
With what? I don't
know. Something.

103
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,910
You know what, Kynesha?

104
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,313
You need to learn how
to start respecting people.

105
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,115
I respect you.

106
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,317
I called the halfway house.

107
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,486
They said you started
a fight and then took off.

108
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,604
I hate that place.

109
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,489
The lady that runs it's a bitch.

110
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,741
That's where you live now,
so you better make it work.

111
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,277
Well, I'd rather live with you.

112
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,445
We've been over this.

113
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,013
You can't stay
here indefinitely.

114
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:30,049
I could if you had
your own place.

115
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,902
Be a lot easier.

116
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,920
What do you think
you're doing? Depends.

117
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,289
What you want me to do?

118
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,924
Kynesha, you better...

119
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:40,381
Where she at? At work? Hey.

120
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,802
It's all good.

121
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,187
I'm too tired now anyway.

122
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,811
Mr. Pilarsky, you
haven't stopped taking

123
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,680
your Mellaril, have you? No.

124
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,515
How long's your belly
been bothering you?

125
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,884
A few days, but it's
definitely gotten worse

126
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,018
since I've been here.

127
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,354
He's afebrile. BP's 180/70.

128
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:11,424
Blood pressure's a little high.
Are you upset, Mr. Pilarsky?

129
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,359
Depressed mostly.

130
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:16,362
I haven't had intimate
contact in 11 years.

131
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:18,298
It takes its toll after a while.

132
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:20,333
Well, why don't we
take a look at your belly,

133
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,835
find out what the problem is?

134
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,037
Oh, oh, for God's sake. Conni?

135
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,389
Mr. Pilarsky, why do
you do this to yourself?

136
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,558
I'm an only child, you know.

137
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,293
Are those ours? Yeah.

138
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,795
Start a line, draw
a trauma panel

139
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,347
and set up the SonoSite.

140
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,015
Never did get married.

141
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,967
Want a Psych consult? No.

142
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,101
Put my career first.

143
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,404
Let's clear him
surgically first.

144
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,528
You wanna catch a movie later?

145
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:51,865
You didn't get my
message, I take it.

146
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,667
No. Did something change?
The meeting was canceled.

147
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,135
We took a
conference call instead

148
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,653
and agreed on a
settlement figure.

149
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,088
Does that mean we accept guilt?

150
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,740
The hospital's
taking it in the shorts

151
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:03,481
to the tune of $1.5 million.

152
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,763
But our insurance will pay that.

153
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,631
And so will we, with
sky-high premiums.

154
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,065
It could've been worse.

155
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,302
We're not getting off
cheap. She didn't pay a dime.

156
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,271
There was a recall on
the curettes that you used.

157
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,307
I didn't have trouble
with the curette.

158
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,443
Nonetheless, there was a recall.

159
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,395
We also signed a
confidentiality agreement

160
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,264
keeping the details
of the suit private.

161
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:25,865
So you can't speak
to anyone about it.

162
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,033
But there was nothing
faulty with the equipment.

163
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,618
Apparently, there was.

164
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,626
And the manufacturer
has deeper pockets.

165
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,411
Well, that's wrong.

166
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,710
Look at it as a gift.

167
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,046
We pay up the nose
and you get a little ding

168
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,164
at the National Data Bank.

169
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,720
How lucky is that?

170
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:48,054
And then my parents went through
this whole charismatic phase.

171
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:50,723
But they're still pretty
Catholic. I mean, you know.

172
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,476
So, uh, what religion do
they practice in your country?

173
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,777
This is my country, Dave.

174
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,279
That's not what I meant.

175
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,303
Smooth.

176
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,985
Excuse me. I need...

177
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,435
Fill out your name
and complaint.

178
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,904
No, I need a laxative.

179
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:08,162
Uh, Amira, why don't you get
an emesis basin for Miss...?

180
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,599
Never mind.

181
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,114
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

182
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,083
Why don't you just take
a seat right over here?

183
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:18,952
My stomach hurts.
Thank you very much.

184
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,020
I just need to go to the
bathroom and I can't.

185
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,121
Tell me your name.

186
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,756
Anne. Anne, I'm Dr. Carter.

187
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,959
Has anything like this ever
happened to you before?

188
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,593
It started on the plane.

189
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,579
From where? Texas.

190
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,747
You just flew in?

191
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,849
Did you eat anything unusual?

192
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,934
Airplane food.
Well, that could do it.

193
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,202
Let's get you in a room
and find out what's going on.

194
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,857
Oh, my God. It's blood. It's...

195
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,226
I'm gonna need a
little help over here.

196
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,961
Did you land on your
side or on your back?

197
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,230
On my keister.

198
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,532
Several small children
found it amusing.

199
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,934
We were quite worried.

200
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,653
Any tenderness here?

201
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,355
Not so much.

202
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,991
Joe, you're making me nervous.

203
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,660
Go get yourself a cup of coffee.

204
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,550
Please.

205
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:07,215
Last thing I need
is an entourage.

206
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:11,638
Any physical conditions
I should know about?

207
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:14,741
Osteoarthritis.
Runs in the family.

208
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:16,926
Are you currently
on any medications?

209
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,193
Tylenol.

210
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,152
And the occasional
glass of wine.

211
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,517
Where are you from?

212
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,768
You have an accent.

213
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,353
Croatia.

214
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,310
Ah.

215
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,908
Any numbness in this area?

216
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,212
No.

217
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,178
Do you have a
primary care doctor

218
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,680
I should notify?

219
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,334
He's playing golf in Arizona.

220
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:46,104
Okay. Someone
will take you to X-ray.

221
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,848
Would you like
anything for pain?

222
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,482
I have a high threshold.

223
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,654
Croatia is a very
Catholic country.

224
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:59,054
Yes.

225
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,471
Are you Catholic?

226
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,944
No.

227
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,881
That's it? That's all
you're going to tell me?

228
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,851
She got into a fight and took
off to hang out with friends.

229
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,686
So this whole "I was attacked"

230
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,220
was blown out of proportion.

231
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,755
A little.

232
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,624
Did you take her back
to the halfway house?

233
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,242
Uh, not yet.

234
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,128
Then where did you take her?

235
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,135
Well, sh-she needed
to take a shower.

236
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,717
Uh, Cleo, it's just for the day.

237
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,969
That's what you said when
she stayed three weeks.

238
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,225
I'll handle it.

239
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,261
Small Mallory-Weiss tear.

240
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,896
No active bleeding, though.

241
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,598
Temperature's higher, 102.

242
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,100
Wait.

243
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,435
Foreign body obstructing
the gastric outlet.

244
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,059
Good call on the
ultrasound. Okay. Grasper.

245
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,992
Reminds me of one
of those big claw things

246
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,360
they have at the arcade.

247
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,112
What do you call 'em?

248
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,136
Big claw things.

249
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,669
What the heck is that?

250
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,955
Got it.

251
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,290
Okay, slowly extracting.

252
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:15,678
BP's rising. 160/100.

253
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:16,834
Up.

254
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,120
Up.

255
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,019
And out.

256
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,639
Pulse is 140.
BP's high, 240/100.

257
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,024
Is that a condom?

258
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,858
Probably cocaine.

259
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,894
Uh, must have leaked.

260
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,579
I need phentolamine
and esmolol drips.

261
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:34,914
50 grams of charcoal

262
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,537
and four of Ativan
in case she seizes.

263
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,092
She's a drug mule.

264
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,323
Hey, Kerry. I just heard
that Roger Pilarsky

265
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,125
was treated for a
self-inflicted injury.

266
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,395
Yeah, with a pair of our
suture scissors no less.

267
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,430
You sent him home?
It was superficial.

268
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:53,232
Didn't breach the peritoneum.

269
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:55,268
There should have
been a Psych consult.

270
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,703
He's a frequent flier. Has
a new injury every week.

271
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,605
Could be part of an
accelerating pattern.

272
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,808
Look, he's never had a
serious suicide attempt.

273
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:04,644
Your department's refused to
admit him on three occasions.

274
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:07,847
He tried to harm himself.
We're supposed to be called.

275
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,416
All he wanted was
food and company.

276
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,584
Frankly, I thought you'd...

277
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,536
Kerry, I...

278
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,873
I think that we should not let
what happened between us

279
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,692
interfere with patient care.

280
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,160
What?

281
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:23,029
We're both professionals.

282
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,832
Excuse me. I did what I thought
was medically appropriate.

283
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,766
And it had nothing
to do with the fact

284
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,835
you've been avoiding me?

285
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:31,904
It doesn't, and I haven't.

286
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,739
But if you'd like me
to call you every time

287
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:35,341
someone the least bit disturbed

288
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,543
comes into the
ER, you've got it.

289
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,283
Thank you.

290
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,089
Hey, where'd you really
fly in from? South America?

291
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:53,692
Belize.

292
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:57,763
Well, you're lucky you
didn't pop at 35,000 feet.

293
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,165
You might've died.

294
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:01,506
Maybe that would
have been better.

295
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,777
Hey, you mind, uh, telling
me how you got into all this?

296
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:09,347
I was robbed.

297
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,512
They took everything:

298
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:16,181
My money. My
passport. My clothes.

299
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:17,517
Even my shoes.

300
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:22,021
So you decided to
smuggle drugs to get back.

301
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,940
I met this man.

302
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,442
He was very nice to me.

303
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,244
He said he would help.

304
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,445
All I had to do

305
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,348
was stop here in the
United States for him.

306
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,871
But you knew what he
was asking you to do.

307
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:42,608
I just wanted to go home.

308
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,626
That's all.

309
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,694
I wanted to go home.

310
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,318
That whole celibacy
thing was always

311
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,020
the sticking point
for me, though.

312
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:57,089
Yeah, me too. But I got over it.

313
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:59,558
Heh. Yeah, well...

314
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:03,150
Hey. Dr. Kovac, did you know
that St. Peter was married?

315
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,966
Anyway, I should get going.

316
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,950
It was nice talking to you,
Bishop Stewart. Same here.

317
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,307
You have a lot of
degenerative changes,

318
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,142
but no fracture.

319
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,744
There will be
bruising, but the worst

320
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:20,479
should be over in a few days.

321
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,497
Yeah, I know the drill.

322
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,416
You fall a lot?

323
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,518
Damned arthritis
makes me wobbly,

324
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,702
especially when it's cold.

325
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,588
Ever use a walker?

326
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:30,790
Now, that would cramp
my style, don't you think?

327
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,559
Might save your hips.

328
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,662
Last time I had a flareup,
my doctor put me on this IV,

329
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,031
gave me some, uh...

330
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:40,683
some kind of steroid.

331
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,302
Solu-Medrol? That's it.

332
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,604
The stuff worked wonders.

333
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,023
You realize it's
a temporary fix.

334
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,690
I'll take whatever I can get.

335
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,792
Just so it gets me
through the hard bits.

336
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,561
Okay.

337
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,398
I'll give you the Solu-Medrol
if you promise to use a walker.

338
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,983
What? Are we negotiating?

339
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,617
Not really.

340
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,069
Do you want the steroids?

341
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,742
I'll use a cane.

342
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:07,276
Yosh? 125 milligrams of
Solu-Medrol for the bishop

343
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,296
and order a cane
from Central Supply.

344
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,600
You got it.

345
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:15,304
What was your confirmation name?

346
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,421
Mihael.

347
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,757
After the patron
saint of the sick.

348
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,231
How appropriate.

349
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,063
"On occasion, he has
questioned the decision-making

350
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,499
of more senior physicians
in critical-care settings."

351
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,968
Yeah, I have a more
detailed list if you're interested.

352
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,703
Probably not.

353
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,173
Interpersonal skills, dealing
with patients and staff,

354
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,640
all excellent.

355
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,115
In fact, it's hard to find
fault with your work.

356
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,612
Really?

357
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,364
You've made a
remarkable comeback

358
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,166
from a serious addiction.

359
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,334
And I think I speak for everyone

360
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,170
when I say that
we're proud of you.

361
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:53,122
Thank you.

362
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,990
Good. We're pretty
jammed up out there,

363
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,092
so unless there's anything
you wanna talk about,

364
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,549
sign the bottom of the form.

365
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,349
Is there something
you wanna talk about?

366
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:07,908
Sorry. Multi-victim trauma.
We're gonna need everybody.

367
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:10,644
Let's go.

368
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,043
Seven-year-old hit in the
crosswalk by a pickup doing 30.

369
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,313
Complains of chest pain
and shortness of breath.

370
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,448
Tachy at 120. BP 90/60.

371
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,916
Honey, can you
tell me your name?

372
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,453
Amy. Where's my
mom? Next ambulance.

373
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,572
Take a breath, Amy.
Does your tummy hurt?

374
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,958
No. Is my dad okay?

375
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,892
We'll find out as soon
as we finish with you.

376
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,912
Let's go. We need a
chest tube on the left.

377
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:35,915
Julie Hembree, 32 years
old. Chest and abdominal pain.

378
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:39,084
I thought there were three.
Father was DOA at the scene.

379
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,587
Systolic of 80 in the
field. Up to 100 after a liter.

380
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:44,256
Where's Amy? Where's
my husband? Ah!

381
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,175
Sorry. Looks like it
might be a rib fracture.

382
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,478
Okay, she needs an ultrasound.
Let's get Surgery down here.

383
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,014
Mandy, can you push
the cholecystectomy

384
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,182
to next week for me?

385
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,516
Sure. These are lovely.

386
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,060
Glad you think
so. They're for you.

387
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,056
From Dr. Greene?

388
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Yes.

389
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,028
O.R. Hold on.

390
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,929
Dr. Corday, they
need you downstairs.

391
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,564
I'm on my way.

392
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,066
Should I put these
in your office?

393
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,590
Please.

394
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:19,908
Mr. Patterson, what
are you doing here?

395
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,210
I came to see you.

396
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,213
I've been called to the
Emergency department.

397
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,931
I'll ride down with you.

398
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:27,621
Okay.

399
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,941
Please allow me to
say that I feel terrible

400
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,264
about what's happened.

401
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,928
Which part?

402
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,731
Me being crippled or you
getting sued for malpractice?

403
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,152
My concern was for
your situation, not mine.

404
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:49,076
Yeah. Doesn't really
compare, does it?

405
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,215
Strange how it all comes
down to faulty equipment.

406
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:59,453
My lawyer tells me I
can't really blame you.

407
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,924
But I can't quite
forgive you either.

408
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,892
Imagine I'll always
remember your face.

409
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,811
I wonder whether
you'll remember mine.

410
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:13,095
Start in Trauma 1.

411
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,985
Weaver needs that in 2.

412
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,499
They'll need you right away.

413
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,768
I'm really sorry. Go, go.

414
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,258
I'm so sorry.

415
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,173
What is it, Conni?

416
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,941
Auto versus peds.
Mother and daughter.

417
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,010
Any critical? The kid
in Trauma 1 looks bad.

418
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,545
Where's Benton? I don't know.

419
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,214
What is it? Blunt chest,
hemopneumo on the left.

420
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,651
Did you scan the belly?
It seemed pretty benign.

421
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,819
Where's ultrasound? Next door.

422
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,322
Why don't you examine her first?
- Where's my mom?

423
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,958
Why don't we take this collar
off? You'll feel a lot better.

424
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,343
One percent with epi.

425
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,911
Sats are down to 82.

426
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,963
Put her up to 15 liters.

427
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,098
Ten blade.

428
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,233
How's the abdomen?

429
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,386
Non-tender. I can't clear her
until we have an imaging study.

430
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,804
Ow, that hurts.

431
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,890
Amy, it's okay. You
wanna intubate?

432
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:59,725
No, let's wait for
the chest tube.

433
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,193
Green zone on the Broselow.

434
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,527
Give me a curved Kelly.

435
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,246
I want my mom!

436
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,830
Slow breaths, Amy.
Slow, deep breaths.

437
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,623
Pressure's down to
60. She's bleeding out.

438
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,225
Okay. Hang two units of
O-neg on the rapid infuser.

439
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,678
We need to intubate. Let's
pre-medicate with atropine.

440
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,846
Dr. Corday, Dr. Weaver
needs you right now.

441
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,916
Okay. Let's keep up
with the blood loss.

442
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,317
Kerry, you need me?

443
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,585
Rebound and guarding
in the right upper quadrant.

444
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:28,921
Looks like a surgical belly.

445
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:31,340
Please, how is she? My daughter.

446
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,592
I'm afraid there's some
bleeding in the chest.

447
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,644
What does that
mean? Is she okay?

448
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,347
She's stable for right
now, but it is serious.

449
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,989
And what about my
husband? Is he here too?

450
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,611
Oh, God. No.

451
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,243
Hey, we don't know
anything for sure yet.

452
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:53,245
We've got a liver laceration.

453
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,948
You have some internal
bleeding from the abdominal injury.

454
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,950
We need to get you up
to the O.R. right away

455
00:20:57,974 --> 00:20:59,368
so that we can
stop the bleeding.

456
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,036
Type-specific's up.

457
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,255
Squeeze in two units. Tell
the O.R. we're on our way.

458
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,446
Connie, get her
upstairs. Let's go.

459
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,461
Over a liter out on the left.

460
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,063
Get another two units of blood.

461
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:12,764
Push the etomidate.
We need to tube her.

462
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,668
No, wait. J-just bag her.

463
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,003
Bring your patient in here.

464
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,606
I'm red-lining her to the O.R.

465
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,891
We're not maintaining
pressure. What are you doing?

466
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,443
Her daughter
should see her first.

467
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,228
Please. I wanna see her.

468
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,948
She has a critical laceration.
How much blood do you have?

469
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:31,066
Four units. You'll be just fine.

470
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,802
Listen. Her
systolic's down to 80.

471
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,604
Okay. Get two pressure
bags for the blood.

472
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,706
Push the etomidate,
then the sux.

473
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,126
Amy, it's Mommy.

474
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,912
You're gonna be all right.

475
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,665
They're gonna take
me to surgery now.

476
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:50,219
But I'll see you
real soon, okay?

477
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:53,305
She's out. Five-and-a-half tube.

478
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:56,842
Amy? That's it.
We're going. Now!

479
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:59,595
Cricoid pressure right there.

480
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,096
I'm in. Bag her.

481
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay, call X-ray
for a portable chest.

482
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,102
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

483
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,638
Pulse ox is up to
92. Set up a vent.

484
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,424
FiO2, 100 percent. Rate of 20.

485
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:14,776
Damn it! Lost her pulse.
Starting compressions.

486
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,244
Charge the paddles to 100.

487
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,313
And get another 8 units
from the blood bank.

488
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,782
Keep pouring it in.

489
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,166
Charged and ready.

490
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,756
Clear.

491
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:26,421
This the ex-lap?

492
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,824
Yes. Still a little
shocky after five liters.

493
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,725
Did you give FFP? Not yet.

494
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,296
What are you waiting
for? We were rather busy.

495
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,298
Will you be doing
an atrial-caval shunt?

496
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,167
I won't know
until I open her up.

497
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,435
It would help if I knew
what you were planning.

498
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,743
Yes. Well, when I
decide I'll tell you.

499
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:49,928
Shirley, I think
Anspaugh's in the lounge.

500
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,163
Can you ask him to assist?

501
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,998
He's ready to go
on a fem-pop in 4.

502
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:55,567
Any other Attendings around?

503
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:58,392
They're all scrubbed in.
It's just you on this one.

504
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,140
Give another epi.
Sats are down to 70.

505
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,541
Two more liters
out of the chest.

506
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,310
Autotransfuse and
hang another two.

507
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:08,547
She's losing it too fast.
Hold the compressions.

508
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:09,998
P.E.A. rate of 49.

509
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,900
Set me up for
pericardiocentesis.

510
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:12,885
Take over here.

511
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,253
You think she's in tamponade?

512
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:16,255
It's our last chance
for treating P.E.A.

513
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,589
Give me the alligator clip.

514
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:20,592
Hook it up to the V-1 lead.
JVD's four centimeters.

515
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:23,145
She's still hypovolemic.
Bradying down to 40.

516
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,230
Watch for any injury current.

517
00:23:25,254 --> 00:23:26,353
There. Back off.

518
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,435
Anything in the pericardium?

519
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:33,260
Nothing. Resume compressions.

520
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,663
What's this?

521
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:45,033
I called for a consult.
I'm admitting her.

522
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,120
Why? Danger to self.

523
00:23:48,144 --> 00:23:51,006
Does the pound of cocaine
she swallowed figure into this?

524
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,340
It wasn't a pound.

525
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,626
We don't have to report
drug use to the authorities.

526
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,762
But I'd imagine in the
case of drug smuggling

527
00:23:57,786 --> 00:23:58,830
we'd make an exception.

528
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,181
She's not a dealer. She's a kid.

529
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,434
She made a stupid mistake
and she almost got killed.

530
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,186
Maybe, but she's not suicidal.

531
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,026
What's your problem, Kerry?

532
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:09,563
What? She's 18 years old.

533
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,278
Could you excuse us, Dr. Carter?

534
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:17,032
Her going to prison isn't
going to, uh, benefit anybody.

535
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,405
Excuse us.

536
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:26,291
Don't you ever
talk to me like that

537
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:29,328
in front of a resident again.

538
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:31,363
I wouldn't have to
if you didn't insist

539
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,081
on interfering
with my admission.

540
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,283
She's an ER case.
Which I was called into.

541
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,074
I'm admitting her.

542
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,944
Agonal rhythm, rate of 29.

543
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:49,013
Has she had two
doses of atropine?

544
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,282
Fifteen minutes ago.

545
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:51,749
What about thoracotomy?

546
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:55,753
No. She had a fatal injury.

547
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:58,690
Probably tore
her aorta. That's it.

548
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,348
Asystole.

549
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:04,279
Call it.

550
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:07,699
Time of death 1:47 p.m.

551
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:10,035
Paramedics just brought
in another trauma.

552
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,955
We need a doctor in here.

553
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,512
I've got it.

554
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:21,496
Let me out of here! I gotta go!

555
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,871
Let me out!

556
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,118
Kevin Poole, 42, very drunk.

557
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:29,721
Under police pursuit until
he hit a concrete column.

558
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:31,190
Needed the Jaws
of Life to get him.

559
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:33,208
Vitals are stable, but
he's a pain in the ass.

560
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,277
Settle down. Huh?

561
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm Dr. Kovac. I'm going
to examine your injuries.

562
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,732
I need you to stay
calm. What injuries?

563
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,118
Lovely. Why were
the police chasing him?

564
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,219
Hit-and-run. Took out
a family at a crosswalk.

565
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,621
They come here or Mercy?

566
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,629
Here. MAN: I
gotta... I gotta go.

567
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:53,911
I gotta find my wallet.

568
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:55,797
I'm gonna put a
tube in your nose.

569
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,299
You want me to
numb him up first?

570
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,072
No. Just hold his head still.

571
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,228
Swallow, sir.

572
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:11,930
I can spray the
back of his throat.

573
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,432
Just keep swallowing.

574
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,017
Hey.

575
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,569
This is good.

576
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:37,672
What's wrong? You ain't hungry?

577
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,796
Hi, Kynesha.

578
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,162
Who is she? This
is Adele Neuman.

579
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,131
She's a social worker.

580
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:47,583
Nice meeting you.

581
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:51,119
I thought you called me
here so I could be with you.

582
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,144
Kynesha, I'm trying to find
you a permanent place to live.

583
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,827
I have a husband
and wife in Riverside

584
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,695
who are both African-American.

585
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,320
And they have two other
foster children your age.

586
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,602
I thought you said
you cared about me.

587
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,555
I said I care about
what happens to you.

588
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:12,157
Yeah, right.

589
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:14,175
You only doing all
this 'cause of Jesse.

590
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,677
You think I don't know that?

591
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,862
That's not true.

592
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:20,015
I know that bitch
Cleo don't like me.

593
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,983
Kynesha. I knew
that from jump street.

594
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,736
You are underage without
a way to provide for yourself.

595
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,722
Now, it's either foster care or
becoming a ward of the state.

596
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,079
Which would you prefer?

597
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,417
Fine. You don't
want me. I'm gone.

598
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:39,951
Kynesha. Kynesha.

599
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,295
Just let me take it from here.

600
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:48,743
She's got a stage-three
stellate fracture

601
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,212
into the deep parenchyma.

602
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,280
More suction,
Shirley. Canister's full.

603
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,382
Well, change it.

604
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,986
She's oozing all over the place.

605
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,421
How about platelets?
Already gave 'em.

606
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,257
You need to correct
her coagulopathy.

607
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:06,383
ET and bleeding time are
normal. It's your problem, not mine.

608
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,365
All right. Right.

609
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:13,674
I'm gonna try and pack
the liver and get out.

610
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:18,206
Okay, uh, gel foam, Penrose.

611
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,510
Come on. BP's dropping. 90/60.

612
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,880
Dr. Corday, you have
to control the bleeding.

613
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,048
The injury's too extensive.

614
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,438
Maybe I can get caval control.

615
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,021
Um... Bovie, pickups.

616
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,692
I can't maintain her vitals
unless you get hemostasis.

617
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,111
I know that. She's
lost another liter.

618
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,896
Two more going
up on the infuser.

619
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,865
Call. Call for six more.
BP's still dropping.

620
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,033
Heart rate up to 120.

621
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,702
There's too much
blood in the field.

622
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,204
I-I can't isolate the vena cava.

623
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,573
She's bleeding out.

624
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,075
Get Romano.

625
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,376
I don't know if he's available.

626
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,129
Get Romano. Get
Benton! Get somebody!

627
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,964
Come on, more laps.

628
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,631
How's he doing?

629
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,719
Blood alcohol level is
0.35, but he's stable.

630
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,004
You're under arrest for
vehicular manslaughter.

631
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:10,425
What? Your
Morrison's Pouch is dry.

632
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,144
Liver intact. Three
DUIs, revoked license

633
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,079
and the idiot still
gets behind the wheel.

634
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:17,182
Let me out of here, damn it.

635
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:18,800
Sir, you have to hold still.

636
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,235
His spleen looks good.

637
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,087
She said stop.

638
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:23,521
All right, what do we got?

639
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,656
MVA with a lot of ETOH.

640
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,858
And no free fluid?

641
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:28,193
Crit is 42.

642
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:31,079
Excellent. Sir,
does it hurt here?

643
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,614
Who the hell are you?

644
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,583
Okay. How about here? All right.

645
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,117
Some periumbilical tenderness.

646
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,981
Okay, let's call
Radiology, order a CT.

647
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,123
Do you think it's necessary?

648
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,858
It's hard to assess them
when they're drunk like this.

649
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,182
I like to be sure.

650
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,065
Hey, it's Abby in the ER.

651
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,768
Yeah, I can hold. How'd it go?

652
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,712
The evaluation?
It went very well.

653
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,878
And? What?

654
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,177
Forget it. I didn't
get a chance.

655
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,396
You interrupted with
the trauma. Forget it.

656
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,734
Yeah, hello. What's going on?

657
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:11,736
Sorry. Can you
hold on? With what?

658
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,305
With you and Carter. Nothing.

659
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,991
It seemed like
you were fighting.

660
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,015
We were.

661
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,201
I'd tell you, but it's a
privacy thing. His, not mine.

662
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,720
Hi. Yeah, Benton's on his way
up with a blunt abdominal trauma.

663
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,555
Better be good.

664
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,857
Liver fracture with
uncontrolled hemorrhage.

665
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,459
You called me out of a lunch

666
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:36,094
because you
can't tie off a liver?

667
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:38,863
BP's 80/40, pulse rate 120.

668
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:42,017
Ten units already in. Shirley,
set up the argon beam.

669
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,602
I tried to get caval
control, but I...

670
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:46,404
You try the Pringle maneuver?

671
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,274
You learned it in grade
school, Dr. Corday.

672
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:52,910
Ligate with 4.0 chromic while
I occlude the hepatic artery.

673
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,078
Get out.

674
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,665
Argon's ready. All right.

675
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,451
I'll coagulate the parenchymal
surface. Tie off the vessels.

676
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:01,235
Robert... Not now, Lizzie.

677
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,672
Get to work. You
need another assistant.

678
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,523
Make yourself useful and sew.

679
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:07,626
Robert, I'm sorry. I can't stay.

680
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,294
I'll send in a resident. Where
do you think you're going?

681
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:11,429
I'm sorry.

682
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:15,455
Lizzie, get your ass
over here now! Damn it.

683
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,354
Mark?

684
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,621
Hey, Luka.

685
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,622
Need some help?

686
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,724
No, no, no. I'm fine. Thank you.

687
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,061
So, what are you doing here?

688
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:29,630
Radiation therapy.
Every day for six weeks.

689
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,232
Elizabeth's giving
me a ride back,

690
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,569
but she's stuck in surgery.

691
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:37,405
Doctor Chen still out
on leave? Yeah. Yeah.

692
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,959
You coming back to work
soon? Next week, I hope.

693
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,744
Wow. Fast recovery, huh?

694
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,233
Yeah. Speed of light.

695
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:48,466
I heard you were
doing immune therapy.

696
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,007
As soon as the
tumor vaccine's ready.

697
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,674
So everything okay around here?

698
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:58,565
Okay as ever. Don't worry.

699
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:03,899
I don't. Honest. Life's
too short, you know?

700
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,089
I know.

701
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,209
So how are you, Luka?

702
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,246
The same.

703
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:19,586
Good to see you. You too.

704
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:28,839
Where is he? Who?

705
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,142
The bishop. I think
he went to Trauma 1.

706
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,177
What for?

707
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,561
To give someone
their last rites.

708
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,817
Are you sorry for your
sins? What happened?

709
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,252
He crashed during CT. Yes.

710
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:43,388
May our Lord Jesus
Christ grant you absolution,

711
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:45,807
and by his authority...

712
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,059
I can't hear. May our
Lord Jesus Christ...

713
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,694
Cross match another six.

714
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,197
Pressure is 60. I absolve
you of all your sins.

715
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,415
Put him in Trendelenburg.
Needs a central line.

716
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,067
Let's get an eight
French trauma kit.

717
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:58,135
Okay, prep for a subclavian.

718
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,871
Sats down to 75.

719
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,124
He's not moving any
air. Bag him. I'll intubate.

720
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,459
You should leave.

721
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,969
Okay, one of
Pavulon, 100 of sux.

722
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,171
I need a sterile drape in
here. Come on, let's move.

723
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:29,767
Hey. You taking off? Yeah.

724
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,269
I know a guy

725
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,538
playing in a blues club
later, if you're interested.

726
00:33:33,562 --> 00:33:35,407
No, I think I'm just
gonna go home.

727
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,308
Maybe tomorrow.
He'll be here all week.

728
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:38,432
Hey.

729
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,936
I need to talk to you
about this Weaver thing.

730
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:46,551
Look, nothing really
happened. I threw them up.

731
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:47,818
Carter. I know I'm fine.

732
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:49,637
You know I'm fine.
Weaver thinks I'm fine.

733
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,806
So why give her
any reason not to?

734
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,974
I don't know.

735
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,144
Maybe you can take that
up with your next sponsor.

736
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,395
What?

737
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,719
I don't want to be
your sponsor anymore.

738
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,702
Whoa. Where's that coming from?

739
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:04,769
I care about you.

740
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,137
And I care about your recovery,

741
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:08,406
but I can't keep saying the
same things over and over.

742
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,575
Because it's hard enough
for me to do it for myself.

743
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:13,016
You serious? Yeah.

744
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:17,070
Fine. I'll get another
sponsor. Okay.

745
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:21,374
I'll see you tomorrow.

746
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:28,042
Dr. Finch, you
lose your compass?

747
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,679
I'm here to see Julie
Hembree. One lucky lady.

748
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,147
A Pringle maneuver
courtesy of me

749
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,315
kept her from bleeding out.

750
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,984
I thought Corday
did the surgery.

751
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,453
Long story. I'll tell you
over cocoa sometime.

752
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,177
She's all yours.

753
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,329
Mrs. Hembree?

754
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,698
You were one of the
doctors for my daughter?

755
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,668
Yes.

756
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,107
Is she all right?

757
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,729
Amy was hit in the chest
at a very high speed.

758
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:02,882
I know. I was there.

759
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:06,714
She needed help
breathing, so we intubated.

760
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:10,518
We gave her transfusions
to treat the blood loss.

761
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,744
But despite all that, her
heart stopped beating.

762
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:18,109
No.

763
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,777
We used intravenous drugs

764
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:22,981
and shocked her
heart for an hour.

765
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:25,883
But her injuries
were too severe.

766
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:27,569
No.

767
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:29,370
And she died.

768
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,073
No.

769
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,541
I'm so sorry.

770
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,176
No.

771
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,745
Okay.

772
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,647
With the type of
injuries she had

773
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,215
and the massive blood loss...

774
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,051
No! I'm sorry.

775
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,920
No. No! Calm down. Calm down.

776
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,056
Just calm down.

777
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,509
I'm sorry.

778
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,711
I'm gonna have
you take prednisone

779
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,179
for the next four days.

780
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,015
Bishop, our car is here.

781
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,373
Thank you. I'll be right there.

782
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,572
What happened to Kevin Poole?

783
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,112
The drunk?

784
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:10,495
He died on the table.

785
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,118
At least he found absolution.

786
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:15,783
You don't believe that.

787
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,218
He ran down a
family in the street.

788
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,038
The mother's
upstairs in surgery.

789
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:22,306
I see.

790
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,875
Does that make him any
the less worthy of salvation?

791
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,828
He was more afraid than sorry.

792
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,964
Yes. But he found God
in his final moments,

793
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,516
and he asked for forgiveness.

794
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,951
So any fool can get into heaven

795
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:37,443
if he's scared enough to say
he's sorry right before he dies?

796
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:40,479
Dr. Kovac...

797
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:44,733
Everyone deserves to be
comforted in their darkest hour.

798
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,449
Too bad you weren't
there to comfort

799
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,285
the little girl he killed.

800
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,911
I didn't need to
be. God was there.

801
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Was he?

802
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,418
You should arrange to
see your doctor this week.

803
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:10,743
And use the cane for stability.

804
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:20,514
Okay. Haleh, I am outta here.

805
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,016
Good night,
Dr. Weaver. Good night.

806
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,585
Hey, can I give you
a hand with those?

807
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,919
Uh, thank you.

808
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,621
You going home? Yeah, shortly.

809
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,858
Hey, do you, uh, do you
have a minute to talk?

810
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:31,992
Of course.

811
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,718
In there? Okay.

812
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:44,922
Look, if you're concerned
about what happened earlier,

813
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,124
you don't need to be.

814
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:48,380
I respect your judgment
enough... A couple weeks ago,

815
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:53,030
I took some Vicodin out of
a patient's prescription bottle

816
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:55,032
and I swallowed them.

817
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:56,467
And then I went
into the bathroom

818
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:59,292
and I stuck my
finger down my throat.

819
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,976
Did you successfully expel them?

820
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,966
Yes.

821
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:16,320
I don't know... I don't know
why I did it. I really don't.

822
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:20,847
I just found myself... Doing it.

823
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,066
I just thought you should know.

824
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,166
I appreciate you telling me.

825
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,536
I'll see you tomorrow, Carter.

826
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,909
What are you gonna do?

827
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,996
Give it some thought.

828
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,315
Meanwhile, keep
going to your meetings.

829
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:50,388
I can't believe you waited.

830
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,557
I thought you would
have taken a cab.

831
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:56,227
Well, I thought you
could use some company.

832
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,562
Are you all right?

833
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,330
Yeah. You should have
seen me an hour ago.

834
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,666
I could've danced a jig.

835
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,590
How did the meeting go?

836
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:08,339
Oh, we settled rather cheaply.

837
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:10,974
Um, something
to do with a recall.

838
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:14,945
Great. Shall we go
out and celebrate?

839
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:17,515
Get a bite to eat?

840
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:19,049
What? With you like this?

841
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:22,720
Or we could just, uh,
go home, take a nap.

842
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:26,257
I don't feel like
celebrating anyway.

843
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,793
You're off the hook.
It's okay to be happy.

844
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:32,896
I can't. It's my fault, Mark.

845
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,066
Elizabeth, we're
not saints, okay?

846
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,203
We just try to get it
right as often as we can.

847
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:41,672
I don't want to talk
about it. Elizabeth...

848
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:44,130
Mark, please.

849
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,547
You know what I noticed?

850
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:51,849
What?

851
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:55,485
Amy's shoes. They
were brand-new.

852
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:58,789
When she woke up this
morning, she had no idea.

853
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,524
It's always harder
when they're young.

854
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:03,194
Yeah. So, what am
I doing in Pedes?

855
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:04,995
You're good at it.

856
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:07,497
You know what I want tonight?

857
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:10,101
Climb into a hot bath,

858
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,769
get in bed and be taken care of?

859
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:14,273
I won't hold you
to the last part.

860
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:27,773
Oh, my God.

861
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,787
Look what she did to my house.

862
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,172
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

863
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,809
No, it is not okay.

864
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,060
Look at this.

865
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,202
I know. Come here.
I'll take care of it.

866
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,154
Hey. Oh, hi.

867
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,657
I was just about to leave,
if you want the table.

868
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:27,344
Actually, I called your office
and they said you might be here.

869
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:28,980
I was hoping that we could talk.

870
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:31,983
I don't know, Kerry. We've
already talked a lot today.

871
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:34,718
Look, I know that it's
been tense between us

872
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,604
and I really don't
mean it to be.

873
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,489
I'm sure it'll pass.

874
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:41,909
Kim, I want you to know that
I respect you as a colleague.

875
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,744
Today notwithstanding?

876
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,746
I miss you.

877
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,148
Well, that'll pass too.

878
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,516
In a few weeks we'll just be

879
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,536
friendly co-workers
all over again.

880
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,872
Yeah, I've been thinking,

881
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:57,129
and I'm not sure
that's what I want.

882
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:04,069
You have a good night.
Okay? Kim, please.

883
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,130
I'd like you to stay.

884
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,893
Look...

885
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:51,651
I know you might not
want to hear this right now.

886
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:57,022
I know it's been
rough with everything...

887
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:02,361
Between us.

888
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:08,350
I'm not easy.

889
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:13,205
I haven't been there for you.

890
00:43:14,442 --> 00:43:16,322
Not the way you've
been there for me.

891
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,731
I've never worked at
being with someone.

892
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,534
I've never even wanted to.

893
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,972
But I want to with you.

894
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,611
I love you.
