1
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,390
Again.

2
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,497
It hurts when I breathe.

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,387
Could it be my heart?

4
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,869
Something wrong?

5
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,270
Hey.

6
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,304
What?

7
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,006
Is there something
wrong with my heart?

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,674
Probably a bruise
to your chest wall.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,576
We'll get an x-ray to make sure.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,044
You were lucky.

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,946
We'll probably
be sifting through

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,382
the walking wounded
until morning,

13
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,850
but I think we're over the hump.

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,752
Carter just brought
up the last critical.

15
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,820
How many came in?

16
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,188
Thirty-seven. Five in surgery.

17
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,457
Only two ER deaths.

18
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,225
That's not too bad, considering.

19
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,093
If you don't count the DOAs.

20
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,529
You did a great job.

21
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,196
You should go home.
We got it from here.

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,197
The board's backing up.

23
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,433
We're fine. Go home.

24
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,722
We'll see you tomorrow.

25
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:35,355
Hey. You leaving?

26
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:38,275
Uh, no, I thought I'd
check on the bishop.

27
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,176
Another critical come in?

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,066
No, no, no. That's it.

29
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,282
Is she stable?

30
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,917
Yeah. After three
rounds of terbutaline.

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,386
Good. It was scary, though.

32
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,509
Yeah.

33
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,724
So are you heading home soon?

34
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,182
Um... I don't know.

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,740
You okay?

36
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,220
Yeah.

37
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,105
Any change?

38
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,609
He didn't want the
breathing mask.

39
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,860
Has he been awake?

40
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,283
Napping on and off.

41
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,763
What time is it?

42
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,961
Eleven-thirty.

43
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:49,629
You're here late.

44
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:52,253
You'll have to be
intubated soon.

45
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,856
On a ventilator?

46
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:00,489
Your oxygen level is down
to 65 on 100 percent oxygen...

47
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,443
I've seen what happens
after a ventilator.

48
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,195
If it drops below 50...

49
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,052
Thanks. But no thanks.

50
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,559
Anyway, my bags are packed.

51
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,180
Water! I need water.

52
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:15,181
Mr. Martin!

53
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:16,215
Ugh, it stings.

54
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,150
Mr. Martin, just
give it a few seconds.

55
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,452
No, it stings.

56
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,020
A few seconds and
the pain will fade.

57
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,088
Need some help?

58
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,457
No. I just put in
a drop of Alcaine.

59
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,425
Mr. Martin fell asleep
under a tanning lamp.

60
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,493
I wasn't tanning.

61
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,295
I was depressed
due to lack of sunlight.

62
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,362
Tell me about it.

63
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,931
Got back from
lunch and it was dark.

64
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,833
UTI in 4 is gone.

65
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,602
Groundhog see its
shadow this year?

66
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:37,403
Seeing his shadow
has nothing to do

67
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,771
with how much sunlight we get.

68
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,707
Yes, it does. Six
more weeks of winter.

69
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,675
Seven-year-old with
diarrhea and wheezing.

70
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,777
Ordered Solu-Medrol
and breathing treatments.

71
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,912
Any history of asthma?

72
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:46,913
Nope.

73
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:48,514
Fever or cough? Nothing.

74
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,083
Carter, want to
figure this one out?

75
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:51,450
Bring it on.

76
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:52,451
Okay, that's it.

77
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,786
Weaver's on at 6:00.

78
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,589
Could you tell her that
I'm finished testing tonight

79
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,190
so she can stop avoiding me?

80
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,726
How'd your personality test go?

81
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,794
I scored somewhere
between serial killer

82
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,062
and talk-show host.

83
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,631
I thought they
were memory tests.

84
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:05,665
Ahem. That was Monday.

85
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,800
What's next,
Rorschach? Spelling bee?

86
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:10,670
Swimwear competition,
sudden-death Twister.

87
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:12,805
Who knows? Maybe
a chili cook-off.

88
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,040
The needle goes in,

89
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,942
but you can squeeze on
the owie ball. See that?

90
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,244
What's up? Hold that for me?

91
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:21,347
Kid freaked out when
I tried to start an IV.

92
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,681
Who's, uh...?

93
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,250
She's a new intern for Pedes.

94
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:25,551
Huh.

95
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,387
And then it won't
hurt anymore, okay?

96
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,654
Hey, Jason. I'm Dr. Carter.

97
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,956
I understand you're having
some trouble breathing.

98
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,658
You mom? Yes.

99
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,077
Any history of asthma here?

100
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,445
Uh, no.

101
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,547
Mrs. Fabrone works as a
cleaning lady at a church.

102
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,115
She found a bottle of holy
water in the sanctuary and thought

103
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,717
it might help with
Jason's diarrhea.

104
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,036
Holy water, huh?

105
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,703
Only it tasted funny.

106
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,705
When Jason started
coughing, she checked.

107
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:47,707
It was lamp oil.

108
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,843
He aspirated holy oil?

109
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:50,867
Guess so.

110
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,264
That's the common
duct. We don't cut that.

111
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,288
What time is it?

112
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,601
Four fifty-five. No, no, no.

113
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,969
Your interview tomorrow.

114
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,437
Oh. Ten a.m.

115
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,372
Get there by 9:30.

116
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,474
Right.

117
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,610
So why do you wanna
be a doctor? What?

118
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,213
It's a common
question in the interview.

119
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,280
Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,282
Clips.

121
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,285
So, what's the answer?

122
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,319
I wanna help people?

123
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,255
No?

124
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,057
All right.

125
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,527
Now we dissect the
gallbladder from the liver.

126
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,594
What's the right answer?

127
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,595
You tell me.

128
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,619
The money?

129
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,417
I wanna be a role model.

130
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,251
If you're not gonna
take this seriously...

131
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:33,803
I am. I just don't know.

132
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,772
I guess I always
thought it'd be cool.

133
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,407
Well, at least that's honest.

134
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,391
So I should say that?

135
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,976
Of course not.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,661
Dr. Benton, how much
longer do you have?

137
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,828
Are you timing me, Shirley?

138
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:44,830
Mass-cas called in.
They need you downstairs.

139
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:45,831
What happened?

140
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:47,016
They didn't give details.

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,718
All right. Let me get
some more suction.

142
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,769
I'll be maybe 15 minutes.

143
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,254
Okay.

144
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,488
You should hang out.

145
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,190
You never know what you'll see.

146
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,191
Great job, Jason.

147
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,894
I'll stop by and
see you later, okay?

148
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,996
You're admitting him?
Yeah, just for a day.

149
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,565
Keep him on continuous
nebs and monitor his sats.

150
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,632
Where's mom?

151
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,919
She went to go
talk to her priest.

152
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:07,220
Could've used you, actually.

153
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:08,854
She got a little
upset after you left.

154
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:11,724
About her kid or because
she stole from the church?

155
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:15,628
My friend used to lift
communion wine for us.

156
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:18,014
He just went to confession.

157
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,281
What about you?

158
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,050
Me? I just got sick.

159
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,284
So you're a heathen.

160
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,285
Protestant.

161
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,221
Is there a difference?

162
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,523
Will you sign this for me?

163
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,524
What is it?

164
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,358
It's for my supervisor.

165
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,060
If you think I did a
good job with the kid.

166
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,562
"Child Life Specialist."

167
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,063
Intern. First day.

168
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,566
Oh, yeah? Hey,
welcome. John Carter.

169
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,651
Rena Trujillo. Nice to meet you.

170
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,608
And you.

171
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,373
Don't forget your voodoo doll.

172
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,774
It's a procedure doll.

173
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,076
They make 'em life-size
for really big kids?

174
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,161
Why, you lonely?

175
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,913
Yeah. I work a lot.

176
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,414
That's too bad.

177
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,549
John, Luka needs you.

178
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,533
Abby, this is Rena.

179
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,034
Hi. A train derailed
by Lakeshore.

180
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,003
They need to set
up a triage center.

181
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:59,005
Excuse me.

182
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,240
Any passenger
cars? Commuter train.

183
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,475
How many? They don't know.

184
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:03,676
They're pulling bodies out.

185
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,044
They need docs on-site.

186
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,514
Prep trauma rooms, set up
Curtain 2 and 3 for majors.

187
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:08,548
And call everybody in.

188
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,749
Carter, let's go.

189
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:11,117
Chopper already here?

190
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,318
They'll meet us on the roof.

191
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:13,586
We don't have an Attending.

192
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,921
Kerry's due in 15.

193
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:16,288
Call me if you have any problem.

194
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:18,825
Four units of O-neg.

195
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,843
Move all stable
patients into the hall.

196
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:21,844
Double up the rooms.

197
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,679
Anyone walking waits in Chairs.

198
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,948
Put all surgical teams
on alert and notify the O.R.

199
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,783
Already did. We're low on vents.

200
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,318
Then grab some from the ICU.

201
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,319
Found it.

202
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,555
Randi, call the
nursing supervisor

203
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,156
and float some
nurses from the unit.

204
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,391
They'll need 'em up there.

205
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,559
Get 'em from Med-Surg.

206
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,599
Oh, my God.

207
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:10,476
Captain Davis,
incident commander.

208
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,812
We were evacuating
the first car when it rolled.

209
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,748
I got a man crushed
underneath. His legs are pinned.

210
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,517
Fourteen DOAs so far,
we're still pulling 'em out.

211
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,819
Two middle cars are the worst.

212
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:20,887
What happened?

213
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:22,589
An automobile
stalled on the tracks.

214
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,390
We think the brakes
on the back cars failed

215
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:25,959
when the train tried to stop.

216
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,462
Blunt chest trauma over
here, dropping his pressure!

217
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,646
I've got it. You
take the crush injury.

218
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,100
What's on the monitor?

219
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,267
Sinus tach. Vitals?

220
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,336
BP, 90/60. Pulse is 120.

221
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,056
I was supposed to fly. My
damn flight was canceled.

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,490
Okay. Rales on the left.

223
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,494
My chest. Feels like
something tore inside.

224
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,563
Try a 14-gauge and
bolus a liter of saline.

225
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,064
Mitch! Mitch, I'm sorry, man!

226
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,933
Don't apologize to me.

227
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,835
I didn't know it was
gonna tip over like that.

228
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,205
BP, 85/60. Pulse, 110.

229
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,074
Doc, I need something
more for the pain.

230
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,760
What did you give
him? Ten of morphine.

231
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:02,561
Held off when he
dropped his pressure.

232
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,135
Give him five more,
but after the liter.

233
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,819
How long till you
can get him out?

234
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,620
We couldn't lift
it with the jacks...

235
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,621
How long?

236
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,773
How long do you have?

237
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,408
Get a jack on this.

238
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:16,442
That's not gonna hold.

239
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,466
She conscious? Yeah.

240
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:21,147
I'm Dr. Kovac. What's your name?

241
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:22,282
I couldn't get out.

242
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:23,683
Your name? Do you
know your name?

243
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,684
Shannon.

244
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,819
Okay. Does your neck hurt? No.

245
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,954
Hey, Luka!

246
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:29,956
What?

247
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,207
We may need a surgeon.

248
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,330
Call it in.

249
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,877
We might not be
able to get him out.

250
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,145
I need a surgeon with
a field amputation kit.

251
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,247
<i>He's on stand-by.</i>

252
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,682
No, not on stand-by. Here now.

253
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,155
He's losing a lot of blood.

254
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,030
Ma'am, has someone examined you?

255
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,633
They're looking for my son.

256
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,802
He wanted to go to
the bathroom by himself.

257
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:33,970
Okay, let's get you out.

258
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,605
I can't move my legs.

259
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,606
Does your neck hurt?

260
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,708
Please, you have to find my son.

261
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,709
Okay, lean forward.

262
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,115
I can't!

263
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,199
Doris!

264
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,467
Are you allergic
to any medicines?

265
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:50,503
He's wearing a blue sweater.

266
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,305
Doris! In a sec!

267
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,173
I need a line
and a set of vitals!

268
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,108
He's 7.

269
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,344
He wanted to go to
the bathroom by himself.

270
00:11:58,368 --> 00:11:59,612
Saline, wide open.

271
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,048
Nasal O-2, and get
me if she's hypotensive.

272
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,138
Please, you have to find him!

273
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,391
Are you looking
for a little boy?

274
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,310
He's pinned. We
have to cut him free.

275
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,595
Can you get a BP?

276
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,296
No room. Pulse is thready.

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,831
How do I get in there?

278
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:20,016
The roof.

279
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,250
Systolic's 95.

280
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,352
Make it two liters.
Radio the IC.

281
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,421
I need the metal cut
before we transport.

282
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,455
Did they find him?

283
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,391
I think so. Is he okay?

284
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,159
I don't know yet.

285
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,193
What's his name?

286
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,583
Myles.

287
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,390
Where is he? Over here.

288
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,487
Got an airway?

289
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,290
Breathing on his own.

290
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,625
We're waiting on a circular saw.

291
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,017
Myles? Myles, can you hear me?

292
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:28,233
Pupils, poorly reactive.

293
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,669
Looks like a closed head injury.

294
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:30,837
We need to get him out.

295
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:33,005
I told you,
equipment's on its way.

296
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,309
Get it here, now!

297
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,145
She's throwing PVCs.
Do you want us to treat?

298
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,179
What? Ectopic beats.

299
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,280
Can we give lidocaine?

300
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,099
What's the injury?
Train hit her car.

301
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,500
Possible pubic ramus fracture.

302
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,602
Not at her age. Just
get her to County.

303
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:04,937
Where's the amputation?

304
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,038
Over here.

305
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,606
We've got a crush
injury to the legs.

306
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,809
BP's 90/65 with fluids.

307
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,977
I don't know how much
longer we can keep it that way.

308
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,346
They can't get him out?

309
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,747
They're trying to, but...

310
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,268
You all right?

311
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,854
You okay? Damn it.

312
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:24,445
I'm fine. I'm fine.

313
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,361
What's his name? Who?

314
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:30,446
The firefighter. Lorcan.

315
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,415
I had to inflate two BP
cuffs to use as tourniquets.

316
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,439
Watch your step.

317
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,153
Right. You okay?

318
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,687
Yes.

319
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,190
Lorcan, I'm Elizabeth Corday.

320
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,425
I'm a surgeon.

321
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,293
You gonna cut 'em off?

322
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,795
Only if I have to.

323
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,896
Now, listen.

324
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,798
We can't give you
more pain medication

325
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,800
because we need to keep
your blood pressure up.

326
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,852
So I'm going to give
you a nerve block, okay?

327
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,186
Do it fast.

328
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,071
Prep the groin area. Betadine.

329
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,273
How much fluid in?

330
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,975
Three liters saline,
two of O-neg.

331
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,110
20-gauge for the injection.

332
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,678
These cuffs aren't holding.

333
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,713
I'm gonna reinflate
'em and then clamp 'em.

334
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,248
Lorcan, you want
me to call Patty?

335
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,382
No! You sure?

336
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,951
I'm not dying, man.

337
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:09,975
All right, buddy.

338
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:11,704
Who's Patty?

339
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,322
Patty's my ex-wife.

340
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,707
Guys and I were going out after

341
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,608
to celebrate my
divorce going through.

342
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,578
Get back. We're gonna
hammer through this.

343
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:19,829
Just a second!

344
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:20,812
Come on, let's do this!

345
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,080
Hold on, Lorcan.

346
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,749
Get me out!

347
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,468
Get it?

348
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,752
Done.

349
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:28,142
Thanks.

350
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:37,763
That's it!

351
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:41,722
Okay, on three. One, two, three.

352
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,340
Where's the backboard?

353
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,924
Paramedics are bringing it in.

354
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:53,135
All right.

355
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,107
Is he still breathing?

356
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,521
Yes. Good air entry.

357
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,989
How many did you
say we could take?

358
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,191
I didn't. They're
transporting all over the city.

359
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,527
We're two docs down
and a surgeon in the field.

360
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,162
You want me to page Dr. Greene?

361
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,730
He's at his competency testing.

362
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,499
Find out how many
they're sending us.

363
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,467
Malucci's on his way
with the first air-evac.

364
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:16,568
Possible aortic rupture.

365
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,036
Peter, you're up first. Got it.

366
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,905
No, elevator. Call CT.

367
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,674
Have them cancel
all elective cases.

368
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,342
I don't want them
jamming up on us.

369
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:24,343
Stay close to me.

370
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,445
If you have any questions, ask.

371
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,814
Don't be surprised if the
nurses push you out of the way.

372
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,749
It's their job. Don't
knock anything over.

373
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:31,750
I don't need to stay?

374
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,118
Only if you want to.

375
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:35,153
Blunt chest trauma,
asymmetric BPs.

376
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:38,223
Dropped his pressure en
route. 60 palp. Tachy at 120.

377
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,525
Sir, do you know where you are?

378
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:40,526
I was taking a plane.

379
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,827
Oriented times one only.

380
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:44,162
Marked tachypnea. Pulse ox, 88.

381
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,331
Heart sounds muffled.

382
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:46,998
What's that mean?
Trashed his aorta.

383
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:48,767
The major artery from the heart.

384
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,068
Neck veins are distended.

385
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,087
He's in tamponade.

386
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,505
Have the O.R. prime bypass.

387
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,506
You our new third-year?

388
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,507
No, I'm just applying.

389
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:55,830
Come on. Get over here.

390
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:57,543
Move!

391
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,145
Let's prep for
pericardiocentesis.

392
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,380
Too late. Lost the pulse.

393
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:02,548
Argh! Thoracotomy tray.

394
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:03,549
You better put on a gown.

395
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:04,922
It's gonna get bloody in here.

396
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,189
What do you got?
Abdominal wound.

397
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,357
BP's 120/90.

398
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,724
We're taking her to Lakeshore.

399
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,693
Are you kidding me? She
needs a trauma center.

400
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,328
All right. Reroute to County.

401
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,530
Give her 10 more of MS.

402
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:19,031
We're supposed
to rotate... Do it!

403
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:20,966
Doc! Doc! Yeah?

404
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,869
Tracheal shift to the
left. I need to stick him.

405
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:25,504
What's his pulse ox?

406
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:27,194
88 on high-flow O-2.

407
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,212
I can't hear anything
with all this noise.

408
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:35,765
Did you get it?

409
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,137
I don't know.

410
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,471
Are these all ours?

411
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,773
No, it's the damn news.

412
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,858
Okay, he's moving
air. Take him to County.

413
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,326
Not Lakeshore. County.

414
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,633
Tell them he needs a
chest tube, maybe a vent.

415
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,534
Stop! Stop! You okay?

416
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,403
I think I may have
strained my back.

417
00:17:57,427 --> 00:17:58,870
Come on! Keep digging!

418
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:01,373
We can't. The weight of
the train will shift on you.

419
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:02,875
That crane coming? From Indiana.

420
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:03,876
What?!

421
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,943
It's on its way, Lorcan.

422
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:05,944
What's his pressure?

423
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:08,469
85 palp. Pulse
110. Four units in.

424
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,666
Can you assist?

425
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,084
Yeah. I can start.

426
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,419
Lorcan, listen to me.

427
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:14,486
I'm gonna have to proceed

428
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,289
with amputating both your legs.

429
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:19,491
No! I've had people
trapped for hours

430
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,559
before we got 'em out!

431
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,760
I appreciate that.

432
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,529
But you've lost too much blood.

433
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:25,514
If I don't amputate and
control the bleeding,

434
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,238
you're going to die.

435
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,654
Okay, then. I'm gonna start.

436
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,655
Do you understand?

437
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,745
I have to start now.

438
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Prep the area.

439
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,056
10 blade.

440
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,738
Can you tell my
fortune with these?

441
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,007
Pick up each card from
your pile and put it under

442
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,542
the card to which it belongs.

443
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,877
Is that the death card?

444
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,312
I'll tell you if you're
right or wrong.

445
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,547
Are you ready to begin?

446
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,748
Hit me.

447
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,134
Begin.

448
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:05,225
No. No, just try the next card.

449
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,130
No.

450
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,278
Yes.

451
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:14,413
Third one's a charm.

452
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:15,469
Yes.

453
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,817
Yes.

454
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,986
Yes. Look, two hands.

455
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,554
Yes.

456
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,572
No.

457
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,429
No? No.

458
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,162
No.

459
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,631
Do you ever say anything
besides yes or no?

460
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:33,655
No.

461
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,922
I've isolated the
femoral artery.

462
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,257
Retract distally.

463
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,260
Got some oozing from the SFA.

464
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,895
Can't do much
about that in the field.

465
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,231
Mitch!

466
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,399
I'm right here, buddy.

467
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,185
I think maybe you
should get Patty.

468
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,319
You got it.

469
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:57,078
I need to dissect
this vessel out. Metz.

470
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,260
What? What is it?

471
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,462
Carter, quick.
Clamp that. Clamp it.

472
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,597
What, what, what, what?

473
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,067
Medial to the muscle
bed. Clamp it now.

474
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:09,084
Is it your back?

475
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,287
It's coming and going.

476
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,454
Intermittent pain?

477
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,789
Yes.

478
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,558
How often?

479
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,860
What's her pressure?

480
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,713
Dropping. 80 palp. Myles.

481
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:22,514
Start her on dopamine.
Titrate to 100.

482
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,449
Save him, please.

483
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,018
How long till you are through?

484
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,482
I don't know. Ten
minutes, maybe.

485
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,292
Pupils are still sluggish.

486
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,528
Okay. 0.3 of atropine.
Do you have any mannitol?

487
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,630
On board. Hang 40 grams.

488
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,099
He's hypertensive
and bradying down.

489
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,368
I know.

490
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:44,872
He could have a bleed.
You're not coming with us?

491
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,480
Okay, load him.
I'll be right back.

492
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,065
Carter, I have to
take this boy in.

493
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,434
There is a woman back there
impaled, with spinal shock.

494
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,136
And I want you to
stay with... What is it?

495
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,055
She's having
contractions. What?!

496
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,391
She's having
contractions at 25 weeks.

497
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,359
I need tocolytics
and a fetal monitor.

498
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:10,396
I can keep on going if I
can just get them to stop.

499
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,630
Have any terbutaline? No.

500
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:13,265
In the rig? We don't carry it.

501
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,599
You should fly back with us.

502
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,986
Carter, take the mother.
The woman down there.

503
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,355
What about him? We opened
the interior compartment.

504
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,240
Call another surgeon!
We're out of O-neg.

505
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:22,941
We have to finish him now.

506
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,142
If we put you on the chopper,

507
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,111
could you monitor this
boy on the flight back?

508
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:30,082
Yes. But he could
exsanguinate from his left leg.

509
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,649
You were a surgical
resident, yeah?

510
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:33,674
Interned. For a year.

511
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:39,591
Trauma panel and get a HemoCue.

512
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:41,093
Sinus, rate of 95.

513
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:42,628
Any chest pain? No.

514
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:43,845
Mild guarding. No rebound.

515
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,265
Set her up for a CT
and put in a Foley.

516
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:47,516
Is that man from the train?

517
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,284
Yeah.

518
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,636
Is he dying? I don't know.

519
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,953
Abby, could you shut the doors?

520
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,722
Type and cross
for four. Dip a urine.

521
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,223
More O-neg on the infuser.

522
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,358
The heart's not filling.

523
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,427
Unit seven going
up. Got it. Cut.

524
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,095
Okay, you're done.
We gotta shock him.

525
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,397
Hold on. Couple more sutures.

526
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,780
Dr. Benton, Dr. Finch needs you.

527
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:03,781
Bad leg injury.

528
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,049
Got it.

529
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,152
Clear!

530
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:09,955
He's all yours. Get a rhythm,
send him up. White, with me.

531
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:10,989
Still in V-fib.

532
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:12,257
Another amp of epi.

533
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,243
Stand by with lidocaine. Clear.

534
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:17,178
Peter, I have a right orbital
trauma with loss of vision.

535
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,881
Set up the slit lamp,
tetracaine and fluorescein.

536
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,651
Dr. Benton, blunt abdominal
trauma. Possible liver injury.

537
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,719
What's the crit?

538
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,387
Thirty-four, but
he's pretty tender.

539
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,955
Do an ultrasound.
If you see fluid...

540
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,857
Chuny, I need
vitals now. Coming!

541
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,792
Traumatic
extrusion of the tibia.

542
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,926
You call Ortho?

543
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,846
Yes, but he's
looking pretty dusky.

544
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,963
Hold on, that's my bone!

545
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,915
All right. All the major
vessels seem intact.

546
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,233
Just try to get him up.

547
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,152
Peter, Carter
needs to talk to you.

548
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:41,219
Not now!

549
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,921
He's performing a
double amputation.

550
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,422
What?! A guy
pinned under a train.

551
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,024
Don't worry. That
can be reattached.

552
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,392
Give another 20 MS.

553
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,216
Okay, he's on Bravo 3.

554
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:51,730
Carter, what are you doing?

555
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,665
<i>Left anterior thigh.</i>

556
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,951
I've incised through the
fascia and muscle planes.

557
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,620
I need to isolate the
neurovascular bundle.

558
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,155
I thought Corday went with you.

559
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,156
<i>She did.</i>

560
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,374
Well, what is she doing?

561
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:04,276
We've got to control his airway.

562
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,347
BP's rocketing, 240/120.
Pulse, down to 30.

563
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:11,917
Another mig of
atropine and mix Nipride.

564
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:14,019
He's in respiratory distress.

565
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,589
I'll intubate. 6.5 ET tube.

566
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,191
Should we stay on the ground?

567
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:21,093
No, let's go.

568
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:25,463
Fifty of lido, one of
Pavulon, 50 of sux.

569
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,165
You okay?

570
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,451
No.

571
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,203
<i>Using the dull edge of the Metz,</i>

572
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,072
<i>let your finger
continue blunt dissection</i>

573
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,275
<i>of the artery from the
neurovascular bundle.</i>

574
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,259
What?

575
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,449
<i>Blunt dissection...</i>

576
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,249
You're gonna have to
shout. I can barely hear you.

577
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,185
Do you know what you're doing?

578
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,543
Does anybody know
what they're doing?!

579
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,193
What's he down to now?

580
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,862
190/100. Pulse,
44 after two migs.

581
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,063
Try 80 of Lasix.

582
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,965
Let them take him downstairs.

583
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,701
Go! Go straight to CT.

584
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,304
There's a case on the table.

585
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,206
He probably has an epidural.

586
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,141
I'll tell him.

587
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,811
How often you been
having back pain?

588
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,095
Every four or five minutes.

589
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,918
When's the last time
you felt the baby move?

590
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,723
I don't know. I haven't.

591
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,742
Okay.

592
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,992
Got it!

593
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,227
Can you call on the
radio and see how he is?

594
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,228
We'll be there soon.

595
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:49,653
BP, 95/65. Pulse is 110.

596
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:54,870
Am I gonna die? Am I?

597
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,104
We'll get you out.

598
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,455
If I die before I get there,

599
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,592
you have to make sure
they take care of Myles.

600
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,661
They will. He's 7.

601
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:03,862
I know.

602
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:06,197
His father's in Kansas
City on business.

603
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:10,034
We were coming
back from visiting him.

604
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:13,021
I thought it'd be fun for
Myles to take the train.

605
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,589
What about the sciatic nerve?

606
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,940
<i>Pull it down as far as possible,</i>

607
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:17,865
<i>then apply an Ochsner clamp.</i>

608
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,461
That one. Third to the right.

609
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:23,898
Okay. I got it. Now what?

610
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,540
Put a second clamp
five millimeters distally.

611
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,339
We're gonna get you
through this, Lorcan.

612
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,124
You're gonna be all right.

613
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:34,626
Remove the proximal clamp
and ligate the crushed area.

614
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,627
<i>0-Vicryl?</i>

615
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:37,529
No, no, no. Nonabsorbable.

616
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:40,215
Peter, this boy's herniating.

617
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,917
Use silk if you've got it.

618
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,001
<i>Okay. Done that. Now what?</i>

619
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:45,120
We've got to drain the hematoma.

620
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,505
Carter, I've gotta go.

621
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:47,639
<i>Call me on your cell phone.</i>

622
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:49,007
I don't have it. In my locker.

623
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:50,375
Find one. Peter, now.

624
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,610
Keep bagging him.

625
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:52,878
<i>What do I do about this nerve?</i>

626
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:54,730
Step off in the
right parietal region.

627
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,565
<i>Dr. Benton?</i> Pulse
ox is dropping.

628
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,317
Dr. Benton?!

629
00:25:58,341 --> 00:25:59,401
What is it?

630
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,668
You have a cell phone? Nope.

631
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,404
Do you? No.

632
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,605
Terbutaline's on board.

633
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,440
Repeat in another hour.

634
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:06,942
You sure McLucas
hasn't answered?

635
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,576
We just paged her.
Give her a second.

636
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,578
What about Mark?
He's on his way.

637
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,415
Okay. You're about
25 percent effaced.

638
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,717
But dimpled, not dilated.

639
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,985
Okay? We can control that.

640
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:17,986
You think so?

641
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,187
An OB Resident's on his way.

642
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,822
I don't want a Resident!

643
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:23,625
You have to calm
down. And focus, okay?

644
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,294
Give the terbutaline
a chance to work.

645
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:26,295
Mark's on the phone.

646
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,999
What line? Three.

647
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,648
Climbing again, 220/115.

648
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,649
Blown right pupil.

649
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,684
He needs a burr hole.

650
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,151
Where's your perforating drill?

651
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,152
Is 1 open?

652
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,354
Yeah. Malucci's calling it.

653
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:37,622
Connect the chisel bit.

654
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,491
Let's keep
hyperventilating. Let's move!

655
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,492
Coming through!

656
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,959
I gotta move this guy.

657
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:44,362
No, no, no. Shove him
up against the wall. Move!

658
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:47,164
Have somebody shave his
head. Give me 8.5 gloves.

659
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,467
Sit him up to 30 degrees.

660
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,469
Carter's on Line 3.
He needs to talk to you.

661
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,655
White, get over here and
hold the phone up to my ear.

662
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,823
10 blade.

663
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,541
Pressure's through
the roof, 260/140.

664
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,676
Not good. Up the
Nipride to three mics.

665
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,629
Put my glasses
down. All right, Carter.

666
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,830
<i>Talk to me. Where are you?</i>

667
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,048
Sciatic nerve.

668
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,916
All right, good. Cut proximally

669
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,552
<i>and let the muscle retract
into the muscle belly.</i>

670
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:09,338
Lorcan, they found Patty.

671
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:10,439
They're gonna send a truck

672
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,906
to take her to the hospital.

673
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,941
No, no. Forget it.

674
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,426
Okay. Cutting now.

675
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,595
Make sure you use a
scalpel instead of scissors.

676
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,963
<i>Otherwise you'll get a neuroma.</i>

677
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:20,983
She's on her way.
She wants to come.

678
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,484
No! No! Not now!

679
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,985
Would you please
hold him still?!

680
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,771
Okay, now what?

681
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:28,394
Take two Kellys and clamp
the femoral artery vein.

682
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,360
I don't want her
to see me like this!

683
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:33,028
Can you give him something?

684
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,079
Whoa! He's seizing!

685
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,364
Five of Ativan.

686
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:37,399
Five of Valium. Put
the phone right here.

687
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:38,900
I don't want her to see me!

688
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,786
You gotta hold him
still until it kicks in.

689
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,120
You're almost free.

690
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,373
Is that two clamps
each or altogether?

691
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:45,590
Two clamps altogether!

692
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:46,925
Two of Ativan? Five.

693
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:49,678
Am I clamping the vein
and the artery separately?

694
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,147
Carter, clamp the vessels
as one unit at both ends.

695
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,549
Ativan's on
board. Still seizing.

696
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,518
All right. You know
what? I gotta go in.

697
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,603
Just reparalyze him.

698
00:27:58,627 --> 00:27:59,620
<i>Both proximally...</i>

699
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,489
Don't do it!

700
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,974
And distally or
one proximally...?

701
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:05,148
Carter, just clamp
the damn vessels! Go!

702
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,179
How many liters in?

703
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:10,415
Two and a half. Lost a pulse.

704
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,083
She's in V-fib. Charge to 200.

705
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,285
Do you wanna run her inside?

706
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:15,241
No, here. Paddles.

707
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:18,211
Charging.

708
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:22,026
Clear!

709
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,027
Still in V-fib.

710
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,530
Charge to 300. Clear.

711
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,499
Mark, penetrating back injury.

712
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,167
Needs to go straight to the O.R.

713
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,991
All right, I'll tell Randi.

714
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,647
Mark.

715
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,395
You feeling any
more contractions?

716
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,297
I'm sorry. Don't be.

717
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,631
I slipped and fell.

718
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,333
I thought it was just backache.

719
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,634
Did you give her terbutaline?

720
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,702
Ten minutes ago.

721
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,004
Fetal heart tones?

722
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,206
One fifty-five. No decels.

723
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,190
Well, that's good.

724
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:54,125
They haven't stopped.

725
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,626
You gotta give it
some time to work.

726
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,029
Or maybe we should
try magnesium.

727
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:00,248
We will if we have to. Okay?

728
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,905
Let's just wait and see.

729
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,688
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

730
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,040
Irrigate. More Ativan?

731
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:10,642
No. Stopped seizing
once he relieved

732
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,060
intercranial pressure.

733
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,780
Suction catheter. Carter,
are you through the tibia yet?

734
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:17,349
Done. Almost there, Lorcan.

735
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:20,651
<i>Good. Use the rongeur
to bevel the anterior apex.</i>

736
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,686
Where is that?

737
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,087
Sharp edge at the
end of the bone.

738
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,223
What's his pressure?
Down to 170/60.

739
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:27,976
They're all sharp! Damn it!

740
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,528
It's the anterior surface.

741
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:30,612
Dr. Weaver, I need you.

742
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:31,947
What patient?

743
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:32,948
Girl whose car got hit.

744
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:33,982
I'm sorry. What?

745
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,283
The anterior surface.

746
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:36,902
Get him upstairs.

747
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:38,603
You're almost there.
When you're done,

748
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,322
use the rongeur
to crack the fibula.

749
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,907
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold on! Hold on!

750
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:45,610
<i>Dr. Benton!</i>

751
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:47,000
<i>Dr. Benton!</i>

752
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:49,303
Good luck.

753
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:53,451
BP's low. Want me to
put the dopamine back on?

754
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:54,653
Hold the elevator!

755
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:55,954
No. This one goes straight up.

756
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:57,288
Status, post-cardiac arrest.

757
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:59,872
I just opened up
this kid's head.

758
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,844
Did you evacuate the clot?

759
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,713
There's still active
bleeding at the site.

760
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:06,848
She's in shock.
Lucky he got her back.

761
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,683
All right, go.

762
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:11,269
No. Take the boy first.

763
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:13,204
Call Neurosurg, tell
them we're on our way.

764
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,807
I need two units of
FFP and an ICP monitor.

765
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,492
Eighty-five palp.

766
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,232
Start the dopamine.

767
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,732
What is it?

768
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,702
I wanted to ask you
something. He die?

769
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,071
Who? That man.

770
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,874
They cut open his
chest, but he died.

771
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,443
Yes. He had a fatal injury.

772
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,444
What about the boy?

773
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,146
He went up to surgery.

774
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,414
Is he going to die?

775
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:40,571
I don't know.

776
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,719
Is there someone
we can call for you?

777
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,521
Your mom or dad?

778
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,473
They won't understand.

779
00:30:48,497 --> 00:30:50,781
Won't understand what?

780
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,196
I thought it would be painless.

781
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,631
The train would hit my car,

782
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,140
I'd just be gone.

783
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,055
Yeah, don't talk to
me about saturated.

784
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,322
You haven't seen saturated.

785
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,725
Chuny, I need a trauma
panel. What's open?

786
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,493
I don't care. I'm
admitting them!

787
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,328
Carter, they're
holding O.R. 6...

788
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,697
I was just there. No surgeon.

789
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,565
Is he stable? Yeah,

790
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,266
but I had to sedate
him with 10 of Valium.

791
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,802
Carter, are you deaf? What?

792
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:36,204
I keep shouting, you keep
getting on the elevator?

793
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,572
Is this the pre-op amputation?

794
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,974
This is the post-op amputation.

795
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,541
What, in the field?
He was trapped.

796
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,876
What did they use, a chain saw?

797
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,244
Dr. Benton talked me through...

798
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,913
You did this? There
was nobody else...

799
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,315
Well, by all means, let's
get whoever's available.

800
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,349
You try next time.

801
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,951
Maybe if you'd
respond to your page...

802
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,552
I can't wear my
pager in the dojo.

803
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,587
Brenda knew where I was.

804
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,856
Should have
called her. Let's go.

805
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,057
Dr. Weaver, frail chest in 4

806
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,759
just dropped his
pulse ox down to 81.

807
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,927
Carter, can you take this?

808
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,495
Give him another one.

809
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,863
Maybe I should have let him die.

810
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,331
Stop cryin'. I'll clean up.

811
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,066
Good work, Carter. I know.

812
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,135
Really. He was lucky
that you were out there.

813
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,136
Thank you. Carter!

814
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,738
I'm coming!

815
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,305
Kerry? Yeah.

816
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,907
You have a suicidal ideation?

817
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,175
Young girl in Trauma 2.

818
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,176
Does she have a plan?

819
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,645
Parked her car
in front of a train.

820
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,079
Oh, I suppose that qualifies.

821
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,681
She's also in a
major depression.

822
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,850
Flat affect? No real remorse.

823
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,018
About the suicide attempt?

824
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,152
For the train wreck.

825
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,026
Oh, my.

826
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,575
Think you're gonna
get off before 12?

827
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,027
Mm. Probably not.

828
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,616
Okay.

829
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:36,247
Uh, I'll try to be quiet.

830
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:38,104
No. Wake me.

831
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,970
Something wrong?

832
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,739
Hey. What?

833
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,340
There something
wrong with my heart?

834
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,942
Probably a bruise
to your chest wall.

835
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,011
We'll get an x-ray to
make sure. You were lucky.

836
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,180
We're still sifting through
the walking wounded,

837
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,281
but we're over the hump.

838
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,717
Carter just took
the last critical.

839
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:56,818
How many came in?

840
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:59,453
Thirty-seven.
Five up in surgery.

841
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,555
Only two ER deaths.

842
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,856
That's not bad, considering.

843
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,558
If you don't count the DOAs.

844
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:06,260
You did great work today.
You should go home. We got it.

845
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,261
Board's backing up.

846
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,963
That's all right. Go home.

847
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,732
Shirley called for you. What?

848
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,133
O.R. nurse. You
asked her to call

849
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,935
when the mom and
son came out of surgery.

850
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,904
Did they? Yeah.
They're in Recovery.

851
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,305
Mom's got sensation in her legs,

852
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,407
and the kid's
neurologically intact.

853
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,275
That's good, right?

854
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,033
Yeah. That's good.

855
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,692
Ah. You still here, huh?

856
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:38,759
The nurses put me to work,

857
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,462
thought I was a
volunteer or something.

858
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:42,397
Good. Now you've
got an experience

859
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,799
to talk about in your interview.

860
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,667
I don't know.

861
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,236
It's yours. You
might as well use it.

862
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,639
I mean, I don't
know if I want to.

863
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,608
Want to what?

864
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,543
What I saw tonight...

865
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,530
Most people go their whole
lives without seeing stuff like that.

866
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,448
Drilling into a
little boy's head.

867
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,351
Guys having their legs cut off.

868
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,087
People dying
right in front of you.

869
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,956
You get used to it.

870
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,625
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

871
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,378
But thanks for helping
me find out early.

872
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,463
Go to the interview.

873
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,132
Dr. Benton... Go to it.

874
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,800
You may feel
differently in a few days.

875
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,834
I know, but...

876
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,218
Hey, give yourself options.

877
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:29,059
Anything?

878
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,496
No contractions
since the third round.

879
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,898
Fetal heart rate looks good.

880
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:35,400
So it's over.

881
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:37,067
Aside from bed rest.

882
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,404
How long do you think?

883
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:42,573
You can catch me up on my soaps.

884
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:44,180
It'll be okay.

885
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,112
When I felt the
baby move before,

886
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:49,447
obviously I knew it
was in there, but...

887
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:51,750
Suddenly this feels
real, you know?

888
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:53,918
Yes, Mom.

889
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:55,653
OB's waiting, and
Transpo promises

890
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,172
they'll be down
soon to take you up.

891
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:58,339
Thanks, Abby.

892
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,308
The monitor stays on
for at least 24 hours.

893
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,427
I'll keep it on
until I give birth.

894
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,395
You just have to slow down.

895
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:05,597
No more helicopters.

896
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:07,253
Right.

897
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:14,472
Hey.

898
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:15,490
Hey.

899
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,108
You leaving?

900
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,532
No. I thought I'd
check on the bishop.

901
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:21,946
Another critical come in?

902
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,187
No. That's it.

903
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:26,584
Is she stable?

904
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:30,321
Yeah. After three
rounds of terbutaline.

905
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,840
Good. Yeah. It
was scary, though.

906
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,074
Yeah.

907
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,876
You heading home soon?

908
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,683
Um, I don't know.

909
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:39,881
Are you okay?

910
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,537
Yeah.

911
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,497
Any change?

912
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,966
He didn't want the
breathing mask.

913
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,967
Has he been awake?

914
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,591
Napping on and off.

915
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,234
What time is it?

916
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:14,599
Eleven-thirty.

917
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:16,467
You're here late.

918
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,219
You'll have to be
intubated soon.

919
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,523
On a ventilator?

920
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:26,344
Your oxygen level is down
to 65 on 100 percent oxygen.

921
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:28,329
I've seen what happens
after the ventilator.

922
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,330
If it drops below 50...

923
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,688
Thanks, but no thanks.

924
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,090
Anyway...

925
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,676
my bags are packed.

926
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:44,684
How long do I have?

927
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:47,837
Maybe hours.

928
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,785
Then I'd better hear it now.

929
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,353
Hear what?

930
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,377
Your confession.

931
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,790
Bishop, I don't think...

932
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,334
That's what you came
up here for, isn't it?

933
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,399
I wanted to check on you.

934
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,284
You're searching for your faith.

935
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:06,351
You think you lost it,

936
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,940
but you only buried it.

937
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,993
It's never left you.

938
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,124
In the name of the
Father, of the Son

939
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,059
and of the Holy Spirit.

940
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,316
Amen.

941
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,865
May God, who
enlightens every heart,

942
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,974
help you to know your
sins and trust in his mercy.

943
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:43,921
Father, I can't...

944
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:44,923
Luka.

945
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:48,759
Your heart is burdened, Luka.

946
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,095
Talk to me.

947
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,400
Let me take that burden with me.

948
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,761
I don't know. I, uh...

949
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:06,532
Lost my family.

950
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,752
Danijela, my wife, she, uh...

951
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:16,253
wanted to move out of Vukovar.

952
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:20,291
But, um, I had to
finish my internship.

953
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:24,144
And, uh, soon it was too late.

954
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,147
It wasn't safe to move.

955
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,417
<i>I was gonna get some supplies</i>

956
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:35,022
<i>and I made them stay behind.</i>

957
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,824
<i>I was just crossing the street</i>

958
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:41,817
<i>when the mortar shell
hit the apartment building.</i>

959
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,857
Go on.

960
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:57,767
I ran inside.

961
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:01,249
<i>There were my neighbors.</i>

962
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,751
<i>Hurt. Bleeding.</i>

963
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,470
<i>Dying. But I passed them by.</i>

964
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:07,471
<i>I had to get to my family.</i>

965
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,140
Danijela!

966
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:10,980
Danijela!

967
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,971
Danijela!

968
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:21,474
Luka.

969
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,498
Luka...

970
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:41,472
Marko...

971
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:43,174
Luka! Marko...

972
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,245
<i>A piece of shrapnel had
torn into Danijela's spleen,</i>

973
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,464
<i>and she was bleeding to death.</i>

974
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,500
<i>When I turned
back to my daughter,</i>

975
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:28,669
<i>she wasn't breathing.</i>

976
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,304
<i>I lost her pulse.</i>

977
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:33,508
<i>But as long as I,
uh, kept doing CPR</i>

978
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:37,678
<i>and breathing for my daughter,
I thought she had a chance.</i>

979
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:42,354
<i>I could only pray that
someone would get there to help.</i>

980
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:55,980
If I had picked up
Danijela at that moment

981
00:40:56,004 --> 00:41:00,417
and gotten her to the hospital,
she could have had surgery.

982
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:02,719
You know, she could have lived.

983
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:05,845
But I couldn't
leave my little girl.

984
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Danijela.

985
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:14,465
<i>I waited and prayed.</i>

986
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:16,901
<i>I prayed someone would come.</i>

987
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:24,246
And no one came.

988
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,932
No one came.

989
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:32,555
Jasna. Jasna.

990
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:40,274
<i>I called out for hours
as I stayed there</i>

991
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:43,099
<i>breathing for her, doing CPR.</i>

992
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,541
<i>I finally had to stop
from exhaustion.</i>

993
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,916
I lost them all.

994
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,757
You couldn't sacrifice
the one to save the other.

995
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,111
Even if you had, you'd
still blame yourself.

996
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:20,603
These things can't be explained.

997
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,038
Why it happens.

998
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,686
The providence of God

999
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,622
and the mysteries
of life and death

1000
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,514
are the very fiber of our faith.

1001
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,734
They were gifts
of love and life.

1002
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:44,238
You are a gift of love and life.

1003
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,195
Don't turn your back on them.

1004
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:50,728
God,

1005
00:42:50,752 --> 00:42:53,731
father of all mercies,

1006
00:42:53,755 --> 00:42:55,299
through the death
and resurrection

1007
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:59,337
of your only begotten Son

1008
00:42:59,361 --> 00:43:02,240
was reconciled
himself to the world

1009
00:43:02,264 --> 00:43:04,041
and sent the Holy
Spirit among us

1010
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:07,345
for the forgiveness of sins.

1011
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:10,781
Through the ministry
of Holy Church,

1012
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:13,306
may God give you
pardon and peace.

1013
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:19,790
<i>And I absolve
you of all your sins</i>

1014
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:24,128
<i>in the name of the
Father and of the Son</i>

1015
00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:26,897
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1016
00:43:29,324 --> 00:43:30,623
<i>Amen.</i>
