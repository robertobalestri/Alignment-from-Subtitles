1
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:09,619
<i>Don't you pull
out, you dumb-ass.</i>

2
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,171
I asked you a question.

3
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:12,839
I just don't wanna play anymore.

4
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:14,741
Oh, you think I like
waking up at 5:30 a.m.

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,108
in the morning for 10 years

6
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:17,477
to drive you to a cold arena?

7
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,246
My toes are frozen,
my ass is numb.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,715
That damn coffee machine

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,433
gives me heartburn
all freaking day.

10
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,737
Wake up, Dad. I'm not
gonna make the NHL.

11
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,304
Not with that attitude.

12
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,441
You wanna end up
working in a factory

13
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,625
like me and your Uncle Don?

14
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:33,777
No.

15
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,278
No, you're damn right you don't.

16
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,147
You want a good job,
you gotta go to college.

17
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,533
If<i> you</i> want to go to college,
you'll need a scholarship.

18
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:41,167
I mean, you're a
bright kid and all,

19
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,986
but you're not gonna get a
scholarship with those grades.

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,222
Well, maybe my... My
grades would be better

21
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,175
if I wasn't playing
hockey all the time.

22
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,876
Oh.

23
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,816
Dad!

24
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,321
It's okay, keep it.

25
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,389
Nice tip. It's New Year's Eve.

26
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,858
He's got a long
day ahead of him.

27
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:06,093
Sounds okay to me.

28
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:09,362
Drive around Manhattan...
listen to the radio

29
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:11,932
talk to people,
no brain surgery.

30
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:13,867
Ha-ha-ha. Very
funny. It's weird.

31
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:17,137
You know, I've sent a couple
thousand people to the O.R...

32
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:20,373
And...? And I've
never been myself.

33
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:21,674
Well, you're a virgin.

34
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,643
I still have my
appendix, my tonsils.

35
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,946
The only general
anesthetic I've ever gotten

36
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,247
was in the dentist's chair.

37
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,415
Well, it's no different,
really. Oh, sure.

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,418
Pull a tooth, have
my skull sawed open.

39
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:33,887
It's pretty much the same thing.

40
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:35,288
I mean the anesthesia.

41
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,090
Except for that part
where they wake me up.

42
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:39,726
At that point, you'll know
things are going well.

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,199
Yeah. Right.

44
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,540
Are you ready?

45
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:51,307
Let's do it.

46
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,425
Come on. We gotta
get them out of there!

47
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,877
Cut the battery.

48
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,186
No. Take my dad.

49
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:20,600
We gotta get you
out to get to him.

50
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:21,902
All right.

51
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,770
Blunt head trauma,
open tib-fib fracture.

52
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,138
Dad? Dad, you okay?

53
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,440
Start a line... I
don't know. You?

54
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,726
I think I'm... I'm
hurt pretty bad.

55
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,366
Easy.

56
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,499
Paul?

57
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,251
Paul?

58
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,402
Let's get 'em.

59
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,426
Paul!

60
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:47,794
Paul, you hear me?
How are you doing, sir?

61
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,613
What's wrong with my son?

62
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,581
He's going to the hospital.
What's your name?

63
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,132
Uh. Dan Harris.

64
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:54,918
Can you tell me what
day it is, Mr. Harris?

65
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,220
December 31st.

66
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,871
That's good. Let's
get a C-collar.

67
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,724
I need another backboard. Paul!

68
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,492
Pupils equal and reactive.
Okay, let's roll him.

69
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,077
Did you pass out?

70
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,780
I don't know. It
happened so fast.

71
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,031
Are in you in pain?

72
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:00,317
That air bag gave my
chest a pretty good shot.

73
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,384
Another two of morphine.

74
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,069
You're doing a ride-along.

75
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,239
Residency requirement.
I've been putting it off.

76
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:07,907
I thought you'd make
a good paramedic.

77
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,242
Ha-ha. That's funny.

78
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,245
Dan Harris, auto versus garbage
truck. Restrained passenger,

79
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,246
air bags deployed.

80
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,881
I cleared his neck on the ride.

81
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:17,701
My son, Paul Harris.
Did they bring him here?

82
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,953
Yeah, I think so.
We'll find out for you.

83
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,421
You taking any medications?

84
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,039
No.

85
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,457
You got any drug allergies? No.

86
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,910
This the other MVA? MALUCCI:
Yeah, 46-year-old male...

87
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,129
Any past surgeries?

88
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:31,681
Appendix, when I was
a kid. Where's Paul?

89
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,883
That's his son.
Weaver's got him in 2.

90
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,719
Who's Weaver?

91
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,604
End of the line,
Mr. Harris. Good luck.

92
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:38,671
What? You're leaving?

93
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,607
Yeah. Gotta save
some more lives.

94
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,108
One, two, three.

95
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,661
Let's get a 12-lead
and cut these clothes off.

96
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,529
All right, C-spine,
chest and pelvis,

97
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,731
trauma panel and a UA.

98
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,482
BP 130/92, pulse 116.

99
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,884
My wife just bought those pants.

100
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,505
Have you ever been
in this hospital before?

101
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,341
No. I haven't been in a
hospital since my son was born.

102
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,126
Twenty cc's of 1
percent lido with bicarb.

103
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,245
Ooh. That's cold.

104
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,663
Who's your family doctor?

105
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,387
Ow. Ow-oh.

106
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,985
Klizowski at the
Morgan Family Clinic.

107
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,253
What are you doing?

108
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,590
Putting a tube in your
chest to reinflate your lung.

109
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,008
I got a collapsed lung?

110
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,675
It happens with
your type of injury.

111
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,595
But you'll breathe
easier once it's in.

112
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,013
Thora-Seal's ready.

113
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,731
Is there anyone we can notify?

114
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,350
Uh, my wife, Debra.

115
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,435
All right, 28 French. Do
you have the number?

116
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,437
Uh, I can't remember.
I... I got it on speed dial.

117
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,938
She works...

118
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,841
She teaches at, uh, Our
Lady of Perpetual Hope.

119
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,244
Let's culture the bone.
Got an extra Foley kit?

120
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,911
Gram of Ancef and 100 of gent.

121
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,614
Paul! Give me a large Kelly.

122
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,333
Paul! Dad. Is that you?

123
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:41,434
Uh. Can you...?

124
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,524
Can you open that
door? I-I need to see him.

125
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:48,541
What are you doing?
This is the father.

126
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:49,875
I'm right here, son.

127
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,245
Irrigation saline,
sterile four-by-fours.

128
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,180
Hey, Dad? Yeah, they...

129
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,899
They just stuck a
freaking tube in my chest.

130
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,685
I'm in. Hook me
up to low suction.

131
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,770
I'm okay, though.

132
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,755
You know, your mom's
gonna be really pissed off

133
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,440
about her truck.

134
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,476
I'm gonna tell her you
were driving, okay?

135
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,362
Hey, Cleo. Need some
Xeroform over here.

136
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:11,898
Paul? Don't be scared, Paul.

137
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm not. Be strong now.

138
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:17,025
Be strong.

139
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:20,707
He's gonna be okay, right?

140
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,047
Looks like a tough kid.

141
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,052
Yeah. Yes. He is.

142
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,106
Are you finished?

143
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,041
Yeah. Just need you to...

144
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,731
sign this.

145
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,349
It's a power of attorney.

146
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,051
Something goes wrong...

147
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,453
Something goes wrong, what?

148
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,358
No heroic measures.

149
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,060
No ventilators,
no feeding tubes.

150
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,864
If there's no hope of
meaningful recovery.

151
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,333
You're going to be fine, Mark.

152
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,335
Elizabeth, you're a surgeon.

153
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,703
You know that...

154
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,794
That you're going to be fine.

155
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,142
You don't want
the responsibility?

156
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,233
It's unnecessary.

157
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,785
I don't want to
end up like that.

158
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,243
Now you're being dramatic.

159
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,947
So if I end up in a
persistent vegetative state...

160
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,919
Fine.

161
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,983
Fine. Give it to me.

162
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,190
What's in the Thora-Seal?

163
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,658
Uh... minimal blood loss.

164
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,293
Oh, good. No hemothorax.

165
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:48,894
Mr. Harris? Yes?

166
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,397
Need you to sign this consent
for treatment for your son.

167
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,798
Where is he? Radiology.

168
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,300
What's he doing there?

169
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:55,868
We had to get x-rays of his leg.

170
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,337
He'll probably need surgery.

171
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,738
Can't you just put a cast on it?

172
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,207
The bone penetrated the skin.

173
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,409
But there's no joints
involved, and it's midshaft,

174
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,878
so it'll probably heal nicely.

175
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,014
Okay, Mr. Harris, I gotta
take you for a head CT.

176
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:09,415
What's that?

177
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,602
Head CT? Um, CAT scan.
It's a picture of your brain.

178
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,536
It's pretty standard
after you hit your head

179
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,671
and lose consciousness.

180
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,357
Did you tell her yet? Who?

181
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,591
Weaver.

182
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,993
Oh, um... No, not yet.

183
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:24,697
But... it's part of my
New Year's resolution.

184
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,441
Uh-huh. No, really. It is.

185
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,124
You okay?

186
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,994
Am I bleeding? No.

187
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,101
I'm fine.

188
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,919
Did you call the furnace guy?

189
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,219
Yep. Last week.

190
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:47,320
Is he coming over?

191
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,854
You don't want
the pipes to freeze.

192
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:50,022
Well...

193
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,090
Larry let him in.

194
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,992
Who's Larry?

195
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,016
You know, Larry
Corbin, the neighbor.

196
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,097
In the blue house?

197
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,699
No, in the brown, actually.

198
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,702
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,739
No. No, it's my fault.

200
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,658
Oh, damn.

201
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,960
You're gonna have to
put on scrubs anyway.

202
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,879
Scrubs?

203
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:14,783
You were planning on coming in.

204
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:18,566
Uh... don't you think
Burke might object?

205
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,921
You're probably right.

206
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,305
It's gonna be pretty
crowded in there.

207
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,815
Mark... do you
want me to come in?

208
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,839
No, I'll be fine.

209
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,903
You go get cleaned up.

210
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:39,026
I can finish this.

211
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,444
I'll be right back.

212
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:45,800
Okay.

213
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,939
I've never been so
claustrophobic before.

214
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:14,440
Happens to a lot of people.

215
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:15,525
Is everything all right?

216
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,692
Looks good,

217
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,528
but a radiologist has
to review the films.

218
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,447
Can I sit up? Sure.

219
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,449
Let me know if
you get lightheaded.

220
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,252
And we contacted the school.

221
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:27,686
They're trying to reach Debra.

222
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,288
Oh. God, I hope she doesn't

223
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,407
get in a car accident
rushing over here.

224
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,576
Hey, can we see Paul
before his operation?

225
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,979
That depends on when
the orthopedic surgeon

226
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,164
can schedule the surgery.

227
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:39,749
Oh, it's just his leg, right?

228
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,250
No, he had a head trauma.

229
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,169
Trauma? What do you mean trauma?

230
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,505
Well, he hit his
head... just like you did.

231
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,273
He's stable now, but we observe
head injuries very carefully.

232
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,575
You mean, he could be unstable?

233
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,544
I'm sure he'll be
fine, Mr. Harris.

234
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,146
Oh, God. She's gonna
think it's my fault again.

235
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,170
What?

236
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,853
Our first son died of SIDS.

237
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:03,144
He'd be about 20 now.

238
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:06,213
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,951
Yeah, he was 3 weeks old.

240
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,766
I'd sent my wife
out, you know, to...

241
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,967
get some rest,

242
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,703
you know, for herself,
for a couple hours.

243
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:21,340
The baby had been up
all night, finally fell asleep.

244
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:23,684
I must have dozed off myself.

245
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:29,015
Because I didn't wake
until I heard her scream.

246
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,041
She had come home to find
Nathan had died in his crib.

247
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:36,656
Well... I mean,

248
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,346
we didn't have the baby monitors
and stuff like you do nowadays.

249
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,150
I mean, she didn't blame me.

250
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,532
But I know...

251
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:49,869
I know that she thought if
she had stayed home that night,

252
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:52,171
he'd still be alive.

253
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:55,041
There's no way you
could have known.

254
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,293
Stick out your tongue.

255
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,213
Show me your teeth.

256
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:03,666
Repeat after me:
Ready to rock 'n' roll.

257
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,002
"Ready to rock 'n' roll."

258
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,791
And that we are.

259
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,739
So...

260
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,264
you know the procedure,
you've had your meds.

261
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,728
Anything on your mind?

262
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:17,768
That's why I'm here.

263
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,916
You won't see me in there,

264
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,180
but, uh, I'll be talking to you.

265
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,517
Good luck.

266
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,497
We don't need it.
But thank you, Mark.

267
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,155
So, what are you here for?

268
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,224
I'm Leo.

269
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:02,442
I'm Mark.

270
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,343
What are you here for?

271
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,546
I've got something
growing on my heart.

272
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,947
I'm not sure how
to say it right.

273
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:10,700
Myxoma? No. But
it sounds like that.

274
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,519
Teratoma? How did you know?

275
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,289
I'm a doctor. Yeah, right.

276
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,633
Doctors get sick too, you know.

277
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,879
I got something
growing on my brain.

278
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,413
What do they do for that?

279
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:28,918
Same as you.
Operate. Take it out.

280
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,987
Does it hurt? They
told me it wouldn't hurt.

281
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,578
You'll be asleep the whole time.

282
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:37,510
And when you wake up...

283
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,894
if you're sore, they'll
give you medicine.

284
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,850
This sucks.

285
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:45,902
It'll be over
before you know it.

286
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,759
It still sucks.

287
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,113
Yeah.

288
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:58,786
Yeah.

289
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,668
Is Trauma 1 still open, Randi?

290
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:04,170
No. Blast injury
to face coming in.

291
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:06,772
Some guy testing Roman
candles for a New Year's eve party.

292
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:09,675
I have to park you here until
I find you a room. I'll be back.

293
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,177
Uh, thanks.

294
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,478
Ask you?

295
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:16,282
No. I've been
waiting three hours.

Okay, okay, okay,
Gordy. Back to bed.

303
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,805
Hey, Randi. Randi. Get
Blue Beacon on the phone.

304
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,941
They cannot deny authorization

305
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,143
for a retinal-artery occlusion.

306
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,328
Excuse me?

307
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,895
I got a page for
a surgical consult.

308
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,631
A guy in Curtain 2 has

309
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,166
a beeper up his rectum.

310
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,134
- What?
- Has it on vibrate.

311
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,053
Can't figure out how
he slipped it in there.

312
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,087
Ma'am?

313
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,705
Never underestimate
the elasticity

314
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,906
of the anal sphincter.

315
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,342
Excuse me. Excuse me.

316
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,310
You... You're the doctor...

317
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,129
who's taking care of
my son, Paul Harris.

318
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,880
The car accident?
Yes. Is he, uh...

319
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,182
Is he all right?

320
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,750
Well... They've arranged to
have him sent up to the O.R.

321
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,452
Yo, Dr. Weaver, we need you now.

322
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,988
Sats are dropping. To what?

323
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,023
Seventy-four. He
was getting sleepy.

324
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,410
- But now we can't wake him.
- Heart rate down to 50.

325
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:18,977
Paul! You want atropine?

326
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,029
Push a milligram.

327
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,331
Rapid induction... Paul!

328
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,283
Number 8 ET tube.

329
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,067
Paul. WEAVER: Let's go.

330
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:29,872
BP's 90/60.

331
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,707
Bag him on 100
percent. Paul. Paul!

332
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,731
Call for a vent.
Cricoid pressure.

333
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,285
I'm in. Bag him. Paul!

334
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,574
Do you hear me? Be
strong, Paul! Don't quit!

335
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,743
Hey, Mr. Harris.
Feeling any better?

336
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,278
No.

337
00:15:52,302 --> 00:15:54,045
No? Well, you got
a collapsed lung?

338
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,514
Blood bank's low.

339
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,116
Weaver wants everybody to
donate before their shift's over.

340
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,319
I always do. Well, that's
very generous of you.

341
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,053
That, and I get
drunk for half as much

342
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:03,054
when I'm down a pint.

343
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,091
Take it easy. Uh, yeah.

344
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:07,359
Good news. Mr. Harris,
your CT looks normal.

345
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,594
I know, but this...

346
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:11,297
This... tube you stuck
in my chest is killing me.

347
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:14,132
Yeah? Abby. Give Mr. Harris
here another 5 of morphine.

348
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:15,217
We're gonna admit you,

349
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,552
and monitor you
for a day or two.

350
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,189
And then we'll take that,
uh, tube out. Okay. Okay.

351
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,558
Listen, uh, did you
find out anything at all?

352
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,726
Um, his oxygen level
was low for a while.

353
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,994
We're not sure why.

354
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,495
Is that your son? Yes.

355
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,132
What are his sats? Hundred
percent after intubation.

356
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,367
GCS is 10.

357
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,201
What, uh... What's that mean?

358
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,202
Um, it could be...

359
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,838
a bruise to the brain.

360
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,306
But we won't know for
sure until after the scan.

361
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,710
Well, when is that?
Any minute now.

362
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,014
Mr. Harris?

363
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,331
Yes? I'm Officer Darcy.

364
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:46,332
How you doing?

365
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:47,905
Uh, well, I've been better.

366
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,387
I have to write
an accident report.

367
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,722
Can you tell me what happened?

368
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,311
Well, I...

369
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,082
You know, I-I-I
honestly don't remember.

370
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,765
One minute, I'm driving the...

371
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:03,766
car with my son.

372
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,335
And then... the next minute,

373
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,726
the paramedics are
just dragging me out.

374
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,774
That guy came out of nowhere.

375
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,160
You failed to stop
for the red light.

376
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:15,215
I would never do that.

377
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:17,913
No, it wasn't my fault.

378
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,154
Several witnesses say it was.

379
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,386
Guess it's too late to
change my mind now.

380
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,311
Would you? No.

381
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,408
They took that kid in

382
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,912
for a teratoma resection
while you were gone.

383
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,402
He was pretty freaked out.

384
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,779
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

385
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,751
Okay. Time to go.

386
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,306
Okay, you need help?

387
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,965
Nope. I've got it.

388
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,425
You gonna go see a movie?

389
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,494
I'll be right outside.

390
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,781
Hey. Your hands are like
ice. Do you want a blanket?

391
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,582
Mark?

392
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,184
Mark, are you okay?

393
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,936
If I don't make it through...
Sh. Don't talk like that.

394
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,504
If I don't make it...

395
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,207
I left you the life insurance.

396
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,693
It'll pay for the house,
for you and the baby.

397
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,801
I'm sorry, Mark. I
can't go through here.

398
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,833
I love you, Elizabeth.

399
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,390
I love you too.

400
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,021
You're going to be okay,

401
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,212
and I'll see you
very, very soon.

402
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,407
Okay, Mr. Greene...

403
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,797
I'm gonna lower your head now.

404
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,666
Jesus. This is my
last guy. You done?

405
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,501
No, man. I gotta pull a double.

406
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,402
Happy-freaking-New Year, huh?

407
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,504
Tell me about it.

408
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,407
All this for me?

409
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,463
Yep.

410
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,543
Slide on over to
the table for us.

411
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,492
Okay, Mark.

412
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,958
I'm Dr. Hammond,
your anesthesiologist.

413
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,511
And you'll be looking at me...

414
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,313
and talking to me
throughout the surgery.

415
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:22,447
Okay?

416
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,549
Okay.

417
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:24,716
For the burr hole,

418
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,552
I'll need a Midas
Rex with an M-8 bit.

419
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:28,353
Then I'll switch to a
V-1 for the bone flap.

420
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:34,381
Excuse me, Dr. Burke?

421
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,396
Uh, you said you'd give
me a little something

422
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,199
to take the edge off.

423
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,452
Excuse me, Dr. Burke?

424
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,071
So, what? It's a coma?

425
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,506
It's not what you
think of as a coma.

426
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,293
He's having what we call
"purposeful movements."

427
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,361
And the CAT scan
shows there's no sign

428
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,825
of hemorrhage
or skull fractures.

429
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,586
You know, he's... unconscious,

430
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,988
but if you'd like
to talk to him,

431
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,712
I'm pretty sure he'll
be able to hear you.

432
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,871
Hey, son.

433
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,938
It's time to wake up now.

434
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,428
You ready to go home?

435
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,881
Well, you gotta open your eyes.

436
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,119
Every day I used to do
this to get him up for school.

437
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:37,122
Sometimes he'd fake it...

438
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,146
until I tickled him.

439
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,835
Son...

440
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,872
be strong now.

441
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,543
Mark? Mark?

442
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,050
Hey, Mark? Mark? Hey, Mark?

443
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,581
Mark.

444
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,983
Breathe for me.

445
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,818
Let's check the lapel mike.

446
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:07,919
Testing. One, two, three.

447
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:09,538
How you doing there?

448
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:10,639
Testing.

449
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,943
Tell me your name.

450
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,549
M... Mark.

451
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:17,918
Mark what?

452
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:20,332
Mark Greene.

453
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:21,633
Hi, Mark.

454
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:24,169
I'm Dr. Malcolm from Neurology.

455
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:25,504
How many fingers?

456
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:27,473
Can't see.

457
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:28,745
He needs his glasses.

458
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,765
Elizabeth?

459
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,318
Elizabeth?

460
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,107
Fingers first, Mark. How many?

461
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:43,217
Three. Good.

462
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,162
Elizabeth?

463
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,031
I thought you might
like some company.

464
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:53,949
Nice hat.

465
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,851
Thanks.

466
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,719
All right, Mark.

467
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,655
I'll be doing the
language testing

468
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,924
while Dr. Burke maps the brain.

469
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,009
I have an itch.

470
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,827
Where?

471
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,012
Behind my knee.

472
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:08,580
May I?

473
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:10,070
Sure.

474
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:12,885
Left or right?

475
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,053
Left.

476
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:16,460
Okay, Mark. Name
the months of the year.

477
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,192
January, February

478
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:22,527
March, April...

479
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:24,146
Ah.

480
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,866
That's it. Little lower.

481
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,208
Uh, May, June, July...

482
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,750
Mr. Harris? Mr. Harris?

483
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,187
Your wife is here.

484
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,601
Dan?

485
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,837
Debra.

486
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:49,888
What happened?

487
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,807
We got hit by a garbage truck.

488
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,209
O.R.'s ready.

489
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,178
No. You said he'd
wake up on his own.

490
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58,113
Yeah, the surgery's for his leg.

491
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,437
We'll take him up to
the O.R. in a minute.

492
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,153
He looks so big just lying here,

493
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,177
doesn't he?

494
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,557
Remember I used to
hold him in my hand

495
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:10,826
and rock him to sleep?

496
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,194
Yeah.

497
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,663
Used to think I was
gonna drop him.

498
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,253
Remember that? Yep.

499
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,389
Hey. Paul.

500
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,209
Debra, I ran a red.

501
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,607
We were arguing about
him quitting hockey,

502
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,059
and the music was really
loud like it always is, and

503
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,127
I don't know.

504
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,180
I must... have missed
the light change. It...

505
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:32,881
Honey, it was an accident.

506
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,549
Debra, I... I'm sorry. Don't.

507
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,719
Mr. Harris. You all right?

508
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:42,558
Ah, I think this tube is
getting my chest again.

509
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,143
Maybe we should
get you back to bed.

510
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:45,710
No. I wanna stay
here with my son.

511
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,579
Malik. I think you'd
feel more comfortable

512
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,114
if you were lying down.

513
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:50,649
No. No. I wanna
stay here, damn it.

514
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:52,034
How's your breathing? Debra.

515
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,569
Having any chest pain?

516
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:54,670
A little.

517
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,104
Yeah... He needs a 12-lead.

518
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,940
No! I wanna stay
with my son. Ten liters.

519
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,407
Let's get a BP.
Debra, I'm sorry!

520
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,610
Give him a nitro spray if
his systolic gets over 100.

521
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:02,634
So sorry.

522
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,797
Trumpet.

523
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:07,154
Hammer.

524
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:10,658
Dolphin.

525
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:13,994
Guitar.

526
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:16,298
Tent.

527
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,400
Pachyderm.

528
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:23,971
Another name for this one?

529
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:27,307
Elephant.

530
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:30,856
It's Dr. Burke, Mark.
You're doing great.

531
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,291
We're mapping
out Broca's just fine.

532
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:34,993
Glad to hear it.

533
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,115
Four milliamps, please.

534
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:41,488
Catapult.

535
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,708
Thermometer.

536
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,350
Bulldozer.

537
00:25:58,374 --> 00:25:59,768
Hesitation on that one.

538
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,375
Got it.

539
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:04,778
Window.

540
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:09,483
Hesitation again.

541
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:14,737
Try to read the card, Mark.

542
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,006
How are you doing there, Mark?

543
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,270
Mark?

544
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,932
My...

545
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,234
thumb.

546
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,966
He's diaphoretic.

547
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,874
I don't...

548
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:36,878
good.

549
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,260
Elizabe...

550
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:43,178
He's seizing. Oh, my God.

551
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,002
Cool saline, please.

552
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,881
<i>Sats are 92.</i>

553
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,333
<i>What's happening?</i>

554
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,602
<i>Electronic
stimulation-induced seizure.</i>

555
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:53,255
Dousing the brain with
saline should cool it down.

556
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,672
Mark, you said
you'd be home at 5.

557
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,690
Mark. It's now 9:00.

558
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,008
Give him some Ativan.

559
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,159
We can't sedate him,

560
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,561
or we won't be
able to talk to him.

561
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:02,025
Cancel the surgery.

562
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,583
Try propofol.

563
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:05,751
Well, what else can you do?

564
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,175
Give it a minute.

565
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,439
<i>Too severe.</i>

566
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,263
<i>Mark! Mark!</i>

567
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,943
He's postictal. What now?

568
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,445
Can't resect the tumor
until he's awake and alert.

569
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,631
Mark. Mark, it's Elizabeth.

570
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:21,082
Wake up.

571
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,386
<i>Mark, come on home.</i>

572
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,110
Mark, we need you
to talk to us. Mark.

573
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:35,513
That's a good
gag with the scope.

574
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:38,057
He might be lightening up.

575
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:39,806
Mark?

576
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,404
Come on, Mark.

577
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,878
Come on, buddy. Try
and wake up. Mark!

578
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:48,693
Ah. No response
to painful stimuli.

579
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:52,114
His eyes are open,
but he's out of it.

580
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,848
How long since the seizure?

581
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:54,882
Half an hour.

582
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,035
Still no significant
change in GCS.

583
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,337
Well, maybe we
should just close up

584
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:00,589
and come back in a few days.

585
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,959
In a few days? You've
just opened his skull.

586
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,177
Hey.

587
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:06,411
What...?

588
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,513
What's going on out there?

589
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:11,133
You had a seizure
during mapping, Mark.

590
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,667
We had to wait.

591
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,052
I'm okay.

592
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:16,438
Keep going.

593
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:19,373
You heard the man. Dr. Malcolm?

594
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,692
Okay, Mark.

595
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:24,001
Name things that
start with the letter B.

596
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,368
Baseball.

597
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:31,737
Broccoli.

598
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:34,622
Brazil.

599
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,826
Bamboo.

600
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,028
Burke.

601
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,396
Brain.

602
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,471
Broca.

603
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,206
You okay?

604
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,806
Fine.

605
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,174
How you feeling?

606
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:55,310
Okay.

607
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:56,667
I'm sleepy.

608
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,564
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

609
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:03,456
Come on now, Mark.
Things that begin with B.

610
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:05,637
Uh.

611
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,906
Baby.

612
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,641
Boy.

613
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,715
So you think we're
gonna have a boy, do you?

614
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,832
Just a hunch.

615
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,272
We could find out if you like.

616
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,972
Let's...

617
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,625
Let's wait. See.

618
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:29,449
Well, then we have to argue
about boy and girl names.

619
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,049
What about Jesús?

620
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,051
Jesús?

621
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,185
That's Jesus.

622
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,220
Jesus Greene.

623
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,154
I'm sorry, Mark, but I need you

624
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,057
to work with me here. More B's.

625
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,980
Okay.

626
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,897
Bobby.

627
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,220
Bill.

628
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:52,789
Bradley.

629
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,210
Bubba.

630
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,375
Any more pain, Mr. Harris?

631
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,327
Not since you put that
stuff under my tongue.

632
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:04,095
MVA with pneumothorax.

633
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,163
He had some chest pain,

634
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:07,199
but responded very
nicely to the nitro.

635
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,583
I'm going off duty.

636
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,351
Dr. Kovac here is gonna continue

637
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,920
to manage your care.

638
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,972
He flipped his T waves
in the anterior leads

639
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,724
waiting for a tele
bed. Is that bad?

640
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,959
You could be at
risk for heart attack.

641
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,644
We need to admit
you for observation.

642
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:21,596
Uh. Did they start his surgery?

643
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,931
My son.

644
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,033
They took him to the
Operating Room for his leg.

645
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,601
But nobody's told
me how he's doing.

646
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,237
Dr. Kovac can
find that out for you.

647
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,207
Good luck, Mr. Harris.
Happy New Year.

648
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,776
Were you having chest
pain before your collision?

649
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,477
No, I do... I don't
remember anything.

650
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,946
Did you pass out?

651
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,080
What do you mean?

652
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,416
With angina, you can
get an irregular heartbeat.

653
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,918
And that can cause
you to pass out?

654
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,319
Yeah.

655
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,827
Because your heart doesn't
pump enough blood to your brain.

656
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:50,926
What? Could that have
caused my accident?

657
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,349
It happens a lot.

658
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,799
So it wasn't my fault.

659
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,434
What?

660
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,052
The accident.

661
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,971
Probably not.

662
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,723
I gotta talk to my wife.

663
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:05,891
Does your chest hurt?

664
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:07,442
Like a son of a bitch.

665
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,394
Malik, I need some help here.

666
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:11,429
Pressure's down to 80 systolic.

667
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,730
ST elevation on the monitor.

668
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:14,933
Mix up the dopamine.
He's having an MI.

669
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:15,934
What's an MI?

670
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,369
A heart attack. Oh. Gee.

671
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:19,704
We need to go to
the cath lab now.

672
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:21,406
What are... What are
you gonna do there?

673
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,074
You got a blocked
artery on your heart.

674
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:24,209
We need to open it up.

675
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,193
First, I gotta talk
to my wife. Wait.

676
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,302
Dr. Burke. He's awake.

677
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,501
Hey, Mark. Do you
know where you are?

678
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,503
Hospital.

679
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,138
That's right.
You're in Recovery.

680
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,340
What's the date?

681
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:40,308
New Year's Eve.

682
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,464
And who's that?

683
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,431
I've never seen
her before in my life.

684
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,985
She's pretty darn cute.

685
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,674
Hold out your hands.

686
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,452
Wiggle your fingers.

687
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,354
Okay. Now wiggle your toes.

688
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:00,333
Very good.

689
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,331
How did it go?

690
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,333
Fantastic.

691
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,452
Resected the tumor
with clean margins.

692
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:09,120
Chemotherapy wafers are in.

693
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,923
You see? You
made it. I told you.

694
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:14,158
Now get some rest, both of you.

695
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,262
I'll be back in an
hour for a neuro check.

696
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:24,017
Do you remember anything?

697
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,404
Something about...

698
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:27,805
baby.

699
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:30,110
We discussed a boy's name.

700
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,768
We're gonna have a boy.

701
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,515
<i>God!</i>

702
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,151
Feels like someone
parked a Volvo on my chest.

703
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,319
He's still throwing PVCs.

704
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:43,621
Could be his chest tube.

705
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:45,690
Try to reposition.

706
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,192
I need to talk to my wife.

707
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,128
I'll explain what
happened. Just relax.

708
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:51,218
Oh, God.

709
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:55,000
Me and my son...

710
00:32:55,024 --> 00:32:56,751
had to be arguing
when this happened.

711
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:57,919
How old is he?

712
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,004
Fifteen.

713
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:01,939
Part of being that age.

714
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:04,926
He needs your support the
most when he wants it the least.

715
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,070
You a dad?

716
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,763
No.

717
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:10,432
Mrs. Harris would
like to come in.

718
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,655
For a minute.

719
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,575
You look like a nurse.

720
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:21,493
Paul's awake.

721
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:23,361
Is he okay?

722
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:25,296
Yeah. They... They
took the tube out,

723
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,366
and... he's breathing
on his own, and...

724
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,502
Well, he's asking
for a cheeseburger.

725
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:32,336
Oh... God.

726
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,089
Thank you.

727
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,091
Hey, honey.

728
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:39,193
What happened? You okay?

729
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,179
I got a blocked artery...

730
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:42,602
on my heart.

731
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,634
I guess those sliders
finally caught up with me.

732
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,068
Yeah.

733
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,105
Well, the docs figure
that the blockage

734
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:53,108
made me pass out this morning.

735
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,012
That's what caused the accident.

736
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,145
Oh, God.

737
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,181
I'm... really sorry
about downstairs.

738
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,949
I just...

739
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,568
He was lying there, and, uh...

740
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:05,570
And you thought I did it again.

741
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:07,288
Dan, stop.

742
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:10,130
I think it's time for
visiting hours to end.

743
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:11,933
Mrs. Harris.

744
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,965
Tell Paul I'll see him in a bit.

745
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,189
You better.

746
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,153
I'm going on break, Dr. Corday.

747
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,589
Can I bring you back a
frozen yogurt or something?

748
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:27,374
No, thanks. I'm fine, Terry. Oh.

749
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,163
I have to go now. I'm late.

750
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,799
Hey. It's good to see you
have your sense of humor.

751
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,034
I suppose that's a good sign.

752
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:38,803
Mark? Mark?

753
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,138
I left the oven on.

754
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,173
He's off the monitor.

755
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:44,709
I know. I know. He's altered.

756
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,211
Now, where are my car keys?

757
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,529
Can you give him some Valium?

758
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,863
I don't have an order for that.

759
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:49,964
Lie back down, Dr. Greene.

760
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,999
No. No, the lasagna,
it's gonna burn.

761
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,835
Look... he needs sedation
and a stat head CT.

762
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,137
No, I need to leave right now.

763
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,540
I can't take your orders.
You're not on the staff.

764
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,941
He could have an epidural bleed.

765
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,042
Get Dr. Burke.

766
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,710
He was called to an
emergency consult.

767
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,014
What do you think this is?

768
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,931
What's going on?

769
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:09,033
Trauma patient had a
coronary thrombosis.

770
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:11,002
Yeah. Why wasn't I consulted?

771
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,170
Cardiology is handling it.

772
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,338
Yeah, I can see that.

773
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,773
What about our glycoprotein
2B3A inhibitor study?

774
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,075
He didn't meet the criteria.

775
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,178
I decide who meets the criteria.

776
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,113
What? You mean, I
didn't have to have this?

777
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:24,215
On a low-fat diet, you
wouldn't need any of this.

778
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,316
Damn it! What's wrong?

779
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,985
There's a dissection
in the left main.

780
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,236
Nice work, Jack.

781
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,954
What... What's wrong?
What's happened?

782
00:35:29,978 --> 00:35:32,740
The catheter made a small
tear in your blood vessel.

783
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,725
What? He's
dropping his pressure!

784
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:35,743
Multifocal PVCs.

785
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,010
Hundred of lidocaine.

786
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,513
Looks like a
surgical patient now.

787
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,797
Up dopamine to 20 mics.

788
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:40,799
Notify the O.R.

789
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:41,999
Wh-wh-wh... What's wrong?

790
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:43,217
You've had a complication.

791
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,470
The only way to save your
heart is bypass surgery.

792
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:47,388
Open-heart surgery? Yep.

793
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,723
When? Right now.

794
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,857
Can't we talk about this?

795
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,897
Let's go. Go, go.

796
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,734
Mm-hm.

797
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,623
Hey, Mark.

798
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:08,087
You had us a little worried.

799
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,112
No. No sign of post-op bleeding.

800
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,848
But the steroids
made you a little crazy.

801
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,250
What did I say?

802
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,834
I've heard much worse.

803
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,920
Look, I'll check
on you in a little bit.

804
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,064
Call me if you need
me, okay? Mm-hm.

805
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,348
Mark, I'll be right
back. All right?

806
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:27,901
Dr. Burke.

807
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,994
Hey.

808
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,148
Hey.

809
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,250
Hey.

810
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:07,051
Pressure's down
to 70. Dr. Karis.

811
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:09,754
Put him in Trendelenberg.
Squeeze in two units.

812
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:10,821
Get me a staple remover.

813
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,257
A liter out of the chest.

814
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,558
Get him off the vent.
Bag him at 100 percent.

815
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,261
Tell the blood bank
we need another six.

816
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,095
Splash him with Betadine.

817
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,965
Open a thoracotomy
tray. Wire cutters!

818
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,150
He's tachy at 130.

819
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,739
Ready for rib spreaders.

820
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,758
He's ruptured his aortic trunk.

821
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,142
Side-biting clamp.

822
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,683
I'll see you in Recovery.

823
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,051
You're not coming with me?

824
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:41,552
You're with the
surgical team now.

825
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:43,521
Say goodbye to Dr. Kovac.

826
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:44,545
Good luck.

827
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:51,980
I don't want surgery.

828
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:53,615
Well, you don't
really have a choice.

829
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,899
I want a second opinion.

830
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,467
You could get that,
but you'd be dead

831
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,985
before a doctor
could examine you.

832
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,570
All right, let's move!
We got no time!

833
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:02,073
I wanna be cutting
in five minutes.

834
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:04,075
Okay, we're gonna
scoot you over now.

835
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:07,717
Ready and lift.

836
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,134
Mr. Harris, I'm Dr. Babcock,
the anesthesiologist.

837
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,469
Are you allergic to any drugs?

838
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,471
Uh, no.

839
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,589
Are you taking any medications?

840
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,357
Just the stuff they
gave me today.

841
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,358
What's he on, Shirley?

842
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,261
Uh, dopamine,
lidocaine and nitro.

843
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:26,580
Ever have a bad
reaction to an anesthetic?

844
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,565
Mr. Harris?

845
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:28,616
No!

846
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,084
Why isn't this guy under?

847
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,753
I had to throw in an art line.

848
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:32,904
Gown me.

849
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,605
You're the guy in
the Emergency Room.

850
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,039
Dr. Benton does it all.

851
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,775
You were in a
collision with your son.

852
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:40,194
Yeah. You're gonna
go to sleep now.

853
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:43,031
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I
got a bad feeling about this.

854
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:44,598
Pump primed and ready? - Set.

855
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,167
No. I'm not gonna
make it. I know it.

856
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,285
You'll make it.

857
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,120
You gotta tell my
son something for me.

858
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:50,787
You can tell him
after the operation.

859
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:52,889
Not if we don't
get in there soon.

860
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,593
Uh, please, tell
him that I love him.

861
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:58,129
And that I'm very proud
of him more than he'll...

862
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,681
All right, let's tube him.

863
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:00,815
Okay, let's go.

864
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,319
The clock's ticking,
his heart isn't.

865
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:04,635
Okay, Mark.

866
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,036
Follow my finger with your eyes.

867
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,538
Mark, follow his finger.

868
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:09,340
Mrs. Street?

869
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:10,841
Why don't we go to
the Waiting Room?

870
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:11,842
Sorry.

871
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,277
They'll call you with updates.

872
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:15,821
How. Okay.

873
00:39:21,176 --> 00:39:23,696
What were the three things
I asked you to remember?

874
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,475
Huh? The three items. Remember?

875
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,810
Um... giraffe,

876
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,234
beach ball, 123 Main Street.

877
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,982
Three for three.

878
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,384
Do you know what
happened to him?

879
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:37,384
Who?

880
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,491
The heart kid.

881
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,755
Uh, they got him to the O.R.

882
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,392
It's touch-and-go.

883
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:47,027
I'm gonna have somebody
from Psychiatry talk to you.

884
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,096
No, thanks.

885
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,564
I recommend it
to all my patients.

886
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,632
Depression suppresses
the immune system.

887
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:52,984
It can hinder recovery.

888
00:39:53,008 --> 00:39:54,585
Don't need a therapist.

889
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,154
Could get this Foley out.

890
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,406
Well... If you have
urinary retention...

891
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,790
Nurse can throw another one in.

892
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,825
Mark.

893
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:02,226
The sooner I get it out,

894
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,961
the sooner I can walk.

895
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,529
Sooner I can walk,

896
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,664
the sooner I get out of here.

897
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:08,699
No offense.

898
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:11,502
Okay, I'll take out the Foley.

899
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:13,371
Bathroom privileges?

900
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:14,560
Only if somebody walks you.

901
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,680
You're a lucky guy, Mark.

902
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:25,816
There has never been a
more successful treatment

903
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,960
for your tumor.

904
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,637
If you believe that...

905
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,939
and mobilize your
inner resources...

906
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,864
you're going to survive.

907
00:40:39,054 --> 00:40:41,765
Time of death 2048.

908
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,695
He didn't make it.

909
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,118
No.

910
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,767
But I did.

911
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,856
Yeah.

912
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,472
You fixed my heart.

913
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,890
Yep.

914
00:41:05,914 --> 00:41:08,309
I didn't even know I
had a heart problem.

915
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,743
That car accident

916
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,245
saved my life.

917
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,069
You never heard
of a yearly checkup?

918
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:18,436
Hey, son.

919
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,654
You okay?

920
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:23,212
Yeah, I feel like I got
hit by a truck. Again.

921
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:25,681
Did you sleep well?

922
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,863
Yeah. Except when you
were yapping in my ear,

923
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:29,997
asking me to wake up.

924
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,916
I notice you didn't listen.

925
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,201
I was in a coma.

926
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,185
You know, you
always got an excuse.

927
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,972
Hey, son.

928
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,541
I guess this means, uh...

929
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:41,759
you're not gonna

930
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,377
play hockey anymore
this year, huh?

931
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,979
Well, they said
the cast will be off

932
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,264
in six to eight weeks.

933
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:48,633
Uh. Your leg's
broken. It's weak.

934
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:49,867
Let it heal.

935
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:52,002
Well, I mean, I'll be
doing physiotherapy.

936
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:54,121
Maybe we can start
running together.

937
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,857
Trying to give me
another heart attack?

938
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:02,735
You gave me a scare, Dad.

939
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,772
You too.

940
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:09,720
<i>We're under a minute, Dick,</i>

941
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,044
<i>and Times Square
is raring to go.</i>

942
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,193
Some rocking New
Year's Eve, huh? Hm.

943
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:18,295
It'll do.

944
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:23,701
When are they gonna come
take this damn Foley out?

945
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:27,104
It's been over three hours
since he put in the order.

946
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,174
Oh, I think she's busy
with another patient.

947
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:33,477
I can't wait any
longer. I gotta pee.

948
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:34,600
Then go.

949
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:38,716
Mark.

950
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,874
Come on. You know how to do it.

951
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,415
I can't believe I'm doing this.

952
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:07,845
I don't think I can order those

953
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:10,150
for a patient ever again.

954
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,833
Are you sure you're up to this?

955
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,706
Nature calls.

956
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,889
Easy. I got it.

957
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:20,223
You're not supposed to do this

958
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,092
on your own, you know.

959
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:23,960
Once I get in there...

960
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:25,629
can I stand on my own?

961
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,753
No. You can sit. Ha.

962
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:32,124
Okay. Let me try. All right.

963
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:38,808
Ooh.

964
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:41,345
See? It's not a race.

965
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,379
You just be careful.

966
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:45,149
Okay. Small steps. Mm-hm.

967
00:43:45,173 --> 00:43:46,216
I know. Small steps.

968
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:50,876
That's it. See, you're doing it.
