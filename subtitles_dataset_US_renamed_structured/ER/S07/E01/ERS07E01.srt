1
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,530
Hi. Name?

2
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:38,531
Dr. Carter.

3
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,055
Somebody should
have called ahead.

4
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,349
Okay. All the
information is confidential,

5
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,974
and you can have
a seat over there.

6
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:02,217
Thank you. Mm-hm.

7
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:11,797
Ninety days? This is a
three-month program?

8
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,968
Yeah, I guess so.

9
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,236
Can you send me some clothes?

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,127
Or do they issue
prison garb here?

11
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,808
You okay?

12
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,809
This pen doesn't work.

13
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,800
Do you have a pen?

14
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:29,682
He's diaphoretic, cramping.
We'll take care of it.

15
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:31,150
When? Soon.

16
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,818
He's got tremors.
He needs something.

17
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,220
You should go now.

18
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:35,821
What?

19
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,646
It's important that
he checks himself in.

20
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,619
Right. Mm-hm.

21
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:47,166
Here.

22
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,795
You, uh... You good from here?

23
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,183
Yeah, I guess so.

24
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,421
Carter, you can do this.

25
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,637
Hey, you got any Compazine?

26
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,324
I'll give you something after
group if you're still nauseous.

27
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,325
Group?

28
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,059
Yeah. Group therapy.

29
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,528
When is that? Now.

30
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,946
In the middle of the night?

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,120
The entire group meets
whenever a new patient arrives.

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,897
Ready?

33
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,165
No, I need to lie down.

34
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,466
You'll make it.

35
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,835
Group therapy is not
what I need right now.

36
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,972
If you want to be in the
program, you do the program.

37
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:00,673
Otherwise, you can leave.

38
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:01,875
And when you want a fix,

39
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:04,077
you can score down
on 10th and Piedmont.

40
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,579
Which is six blocks
down, one block over.

41
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,043
Those guys are
out there all night.

42
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,732
John Carter?

43
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,290
Yes.

44
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,871
Security!

45
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,072
Security!

46
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,073
I put the needle down!

47
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,342
I said no needles!

48
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,243
I told you to put
him in restraints.

49
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,244
I did.

50
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,079
Lily, get extra
security down here.

51
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,048
On their way. Give him Haldol!

52
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,150
The toilet's clogged. Unclog it.

53
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,019
No plunger. Maintenance
closet's locked.

54
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,321
Hey, Malucci, what is
Mr. Hunter still doing out here?

55
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,489
Transpo's backed up.

56
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,092
Their guys are out
to support the janitors.

57
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,527
Then you take him down yourself.

58
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,929
Can't we give them their raise?

59
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,798
Yeah, I'll recommend you
for the negotiating committee.

60
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,366
What about the
maintenance closet?

61
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,935
Use some initiative.
Pick the lock.

62
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,636
Take a fire ax
to it. I don't care.

63
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,637
Okay.

64
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,905
Oh, my God.

65
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,708
Can somebody please put
Mr. Spencer in an Exam Room?

66
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,509
Excuse me. What?

67
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,078
We've been waiting
here for a while.

68
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,546
Shouldn't we be doing something?

69
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,014
Any plumbing experience?

70
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,183
What happened?

71
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,385
You know what, Mark, just
don't start with me, okay?

72
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,386
What?

73
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,787
Custodial staff is on strike.

74
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,756
So they had to
destroy the admit desk?

75
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,192
This is a remodel.
Open floor plan.

76
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,460
It's supposed to be safer.

77
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,828
I've already scratched
myself on a nail twice.

78
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,730
Make sure you
update your tetanus.

79
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,731
Where are my fans?

80
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,200
Working on it.

81
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,301
What's the deal?

82
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,635
I don't know.

83
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,004
The construction workers
won't cross the picket line.

84
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,140
You mean those three
guys I saw with signs?

85
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,808
Mark, how was your vacation?

86
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,943
It was good.

87
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:34,944
You go anywhere?

88
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,479
Wisconsin Dells. Camping.

89
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,414
I just drove back this morning.

90
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,149
Where's the board
supposed to go?

91
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,451
Don't ask.

92
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,352
They weren't supposed
to take out this wall.

93
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,288
And we're not
supposed to talk about it.

94
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,123
Cleo, you got that covered?

95
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,124
Yeah.

96
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,125
I hate needles!

97
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,560
Hi, Dr. Greene. Hey.

98
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,661
Is it me, or do
those med students

99
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,197
look like 12-year-olds?

100
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,364
How long they been waiting?

101
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,365
Three hours.

102
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,366
Two and a half.

103
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,634
I'll take 'em.

104
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,105
Be my guest. But make
sure you see some patients.

105
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,440
Malik? What?

106
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,026
Malik.

107
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,760
Strong, steady heartbeat.

108
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,762
The amount of
amniotic fluid is normal.

109
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,697
Everything looks fine.

110
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,800
I've got a good angle here
if you wanna know the sex.

111
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,702
Sure.

112
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:21,341
You are having a boy.

113
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:23,643
Congratulations.

114
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,667
Thank you.

115
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,649
Your, um, blood-sugar
level is normal.

116
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:30,850
But you're a little anemic.

117
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,974
You taking any iron? Yes.

118
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:34,820
You arrange with Kerry

119
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,973
to take some time off
after the baby's born?

120
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,713
Oh, um, no, not yet.

121
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,034
You still have time.

122
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:49,802
Actually, I haven't
told anyone yet.

123
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,605
I think you may want to.

124
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,497
I don't see how you can
keep this a secret much longer.

125
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,301
Yeah.

126
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,332
So, what are you
supposed to talk about

127
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,635
in an exit interview anyway?

128
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,287
That you don't
have all the answers.

129
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,843
No argument there.

130
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:10,612
You scared?

131
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,398
I don't remember the
last time I wasn't scared.

132
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:16,285
Good.

133
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,063
What, that's it?

134
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,667
"Be afraid. Be very afraid"?

135
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,468
We're like the Army, okay?

136
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,605
We break you down, make
you face your addiction,

137
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,373
then we build you up.

138
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:30,727
You start to function.
Feel healthy, confident.

139
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,529
Don't worry. Pride's
what got me into this.

140
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,399
Yeah. And deep down,
you feel like this is something

141
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,201
that just happened
to you, right?

142
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,737
No, I took responsibility.
I take responsibility.

143
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,440
But I'm gonna get my life back.

144
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,747
It's not gonna beat me.

145
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,796
Yeah, that's what I thought.

146
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,298
First three times.

147
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:55,668
But I hope you do.

148
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,804
Day or night.

149
00:07:57,828 --> 00:07:58,938
If you ever need to talk.

150
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,773
Are we done?

151
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:02,074
You're just getting started.

152
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,344
Is this where I'm
supposed to say thank you?

153
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,345
Some people do.

154
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:06,579
Thank you.

155
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:08,181
You're welcome.

156
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:11,484
Someone's still on
vacation time I see.

157
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:13,286
Sorry. That's all right.

158
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,754
Peter was just helping me
hang this straight. How's that?

159
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,122
Great. Yeah.

160
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:18,424
Did you finish the interview?

161
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:19,692
We're just getting there.

162
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,795
Okay, so where were we
before we left off last time?

163
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,531
You were just about
to give me the job.

164
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,633
Developing a sense
of humor, Peter?

165
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:29,285
That's progress.
You get points for that.

166
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:34,390
Uh, why don't we discuss
faculty responsibilities?

167
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,992
Peter, as an Attending,
you'd be responsible

168
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,195
for supervising
Resident research.

169
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,714
I look forward to that.

170
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:42,881
Liar.

171
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,283
I like working with Residents.

172
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,651
You mean you like abusing them.

173
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,220
You don't have the
best track record

174
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:48,438
in the research department.

175
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,772
That can change.

176
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,574
Uh-huh. Where else
have you applied?

177
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,559
What?

178
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,644
Where else did you apply?

179
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,696
You can't ask me that.

180
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,898
Oh, no. Someone call
the interview police.

181
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,833
Has anyone offered you anything?

182
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:02,652
You're not supposed
to ask me that either.

183
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,320
Come on, it's a simple question.

184
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,490
I've looked elsewhere
as a backup.

185
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,460
But I'd like to stay
here as an Attending.

186
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,094
Okay. Was that so difficult?

187
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,996
Elizabeth, what are you doing?

188
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,799
Uh, my hands itch
for some reason.

189
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,384
Cut it out. It's distracting.

190
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,452
Linear vesicles. Probably
a phytodermatitis.

191
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,004
Are you allergic to any plants?

192
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,005
I don't think so.

193
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,006
You have a garden?

194
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,124
I went camping.

195
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,260
Tell me you know what
poison ivy looks like.

196
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,896
Poison ivy? Is
that in Wisconsin?

197
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,464
Oh, boy. Sorry,
Peter, I gotta run.

198
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,849
We'll have to finish this later.

199
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,235
When?

200
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:38,071
My office will reschedule.
Good luck with that, Lizzie.

201
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,906
He's never gonna
give me this job.

202
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,908
Of course, he will.
He's just being Robert.

203
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:44,943
Don't scratch. Put some
hydrocortisone TID on it.

204
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,913
If it gets worse, get
a shot of steroids.

205
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:48,665
It won't spread, will it?

206
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,533
Well, that depends on
what you touched last

207
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,086
before you washed your hands.

208
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,338
Oh, dear.

209
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,873
These are your
orientation packets.

210
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,643
You guys have a seat over
there and read them over, okay?

211
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,177
Then we'll give you the tour.

212
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,312
We'll go over charts,

213
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,414
order sheets and
discharge instructions.

214
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,316
Any questions?

215
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,617
Remember, you're students.

216
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,086
The only stupid question
is the one you don't ask.

217
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,655
Dr. Greene? Well,
I have a question.

218
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,756
What?

219
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,624
Something wrong with
the Australian boys?

220
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,093
Who? You're
scratching down under.

221
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,764
Oh, yeah. Doesn't make
a good first impression.

222
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,832
Pickman, what do you got?

223
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,000
Mike Palmieri,
17. Wide receiver.

224
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,602
Got hi-lowed in
midair. Brief LOC.

225
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,136
Complains of neck
and chest pains.

226
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,438
Can he move extremities?

227
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,390
Yeah, but because of
the numbness in the hands

228
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,391
we left the helmet on.

229
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,226
Give the med students the tour.

230
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,394
I gave it last rotation.

231
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,229
Well, then you're
getting good at it.

232
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:40,383
Okay, Mike, I'm Dr. Greene.
Can you squeeze both my hands?

233
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,884
My neck's not broken, is it?

234
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,748
Now we're gonna check you out.

235
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,388
Mike, does your chest hurt?

236
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,522
A little.

237
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,125
The safety speared
me with his helmet

238
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,292
on the way down.

239
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,195
He's tachy at 120. BP's 110/68.

240
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,897
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

241
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,666
It's illegal. Second
play of the game.

242
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,001
Let's get him on a pulse ox.

243
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,653
They were looking
to take me out.

244
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,905
Who's that? The other team?

245
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,940
They're our rivals.
It's their homecoming.

246
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,409
<i>You want to push any drugs?</i>

247
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,944
Sure. One amp of epi
and a mg of atropine.

248
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,030
Does she have a pulse?

249
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,249
Oh, she's dead. I know.

250
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,017
Like, blue dead.

251
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,385
Pulse ox, 65.

252
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,537
That's because she's dead.

253
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:19,281
Her husband drove her in.

254
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:23,876
Oh, right.

255
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,294
Luka, you okay in here?

256
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,295
Yeah, I've got it.

257
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,547
Still asystole.

258
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:28,981
As long as we're faking it,

259
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,966
can one of the med
students practice CPR?

260
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,354
No. Go outside and tell him
we are doing everything we can

261
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:35,438
but his wife is very sick.

262
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,273
She can't get any sicker.

263
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,108
Malucci, please. Go on.

264
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,527
Go on. Give the poor man
some time to prepare himself.

265
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,661
No problem, chief.

266
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:43,962
I can act with the best of 'em.

267
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,064
Watch this.

268
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,133
Still flat line. Want
to do a fluid bolus?

269
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,402
No, that's okay.

270
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:51,103
Abby? Abby!

271
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,488
Yeah?

272
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,556
The registrar didn't put
your name on my roster.

273
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,475
You sure you're
back on ER rotation?

274
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:57,794
That's what my schedule says.

275
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,452
Okay. They must be backed
up because of the strike.

276
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,132
Checking out? Yeah.

277
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,782
Dr. Benton called
to confirm your flight

278
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,450
and said he'd pick
you up at the gate.

279
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,940
Thanks.

280
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,099
Goodbye, Margaret.

281
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,203
Good luck, Dr. Carter.

282
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,847
Where did he go?

283
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,273
He was in the hallway
with Malucci a minute ago.

284
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,525
Here's her medication.
I forgot it in the car.

285
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:06,562
She's on Elavil, and
codeine for arthritis.

286
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,153
Have a seat, Mr. Bristo.

287
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,724
You don't need these?

288
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:21,627
Mr. Bristo, your
wife has suffered

289
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:25,153
a massive heart attack.

290
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:32,138
We exhausted all medical
resources available to us.

291
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:33,305
But the damage to her heart

292
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:37,631
was beyond our
capabilities to save her.

293
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:44,550
She died, Mr. Bristo. I'm sorry.

294
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,853
You see? I should have
called the ambulance sooner.

295
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,605
I should have gotten
her here quicker.

296
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,809
There's nothing you
could have done differently

297
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,645
that would have saved her.

298
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,848
It was just her time.

299
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,538
Would you like to see her?

300
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,676
Okay.

301
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,829
How was I supposed to know?

302
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,697
Excuse us. Sorry.

303
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,667
Haven't you ever heard of
"leaves of three, let it be"?

304
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,169
What?

305
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,373
"Leaves of three, let it
be." As in don't touch.

306
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,943
Sorry. We don't have
poison ivy in England.

307
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,469
"Leaves of three"
or any other kind.

308
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,317
Oh, man. Let me see.

309
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,019
No, no. Mark, don't be shy.

310
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,787
You've done enough damage.

311
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,122
Well, do you have it?

312
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,246
Yes, I have it.

313
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,411
Who picks poison ivy?

314
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,346
I was making a
wildflower bouquet.

315
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,783
C-spine's back on
the football player.

316
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,084
Thanks.

317
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,920
When you went skinny-dipping
in the lake, I got bored.

318
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:57,422
You remember what
happened after you got out?

319
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,691
Yeah. It's a big price to pay.

320
00:14:58,715 --> 00:14:59,892
Mark.

321
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,694
I have to worry about
where you've been?

322
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:02,795
It's not that horrible.

323
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,698
Yeah, you've only
got it on your hands.

324
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:06,699
Mike, x-ray is normal.

325
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:09,602
His mom's here, out in Chairs.

326
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:11,937
Okay. Why don't you get
off the helmet and pads

327
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,038
and I'll be right back?

328
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:14,206
Does that mean I can go?

329
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,263
Not yet.

330
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,946
So do you want the
cream or the shot?

331
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,947
Probably both.

332
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,537
Fine. I'll get them.

333
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,689
Mrs. Palmieri?

334
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:31,741
Yes?

335
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,710
Hi. I'm Dr. Mark
Greene. Good news.

336
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,546
Mike's neck x-ray
came back normal.

337
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,965
No fractures or swelling.

338
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,417
Why were his hands numb?

339
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,518
He was hyperventilating.

340
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,136
That can cause
a little numbness.

341
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,804
But no nerve damage?

342
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,206
No. No broken bones,

343
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,441
no spinal-cord
injury, no paralysis.

344
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:52,011
Thank you. Thank
you. Can I see him?

345
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,678
Sure. Here you go.

346
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,679
What's your name again?

347
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,815
Priya Shailendra.

348
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,416
Do you remember
where Trauma 1 is?

349
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,517
I think so.

350
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,852
Could you take Mrs. Palmieri?

351
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,853
Certainly.

352
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,656
This way, please.

353
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,923
Malucci?

354
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,692
Hey, Dr. Greene.
How's that jock itch?

355
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,961
I told you to supervise
the med students.

356
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,030
You told me to give
them the tour. I did.

357
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,698
Show them the charting system.

358
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,199
I'm juggling eight
patients here.

359
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,223
Have them help you.

360
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,271
Hold this.

361
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:22,107
Hey, Cleo. You're up
with the med students.

362
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,508
Says who? Dr. Greene.

363
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,878
Then Dr. Greene can ask me.

364
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,345
It's not infected, Mr. Fletcher,

365
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,915
but I'm gonna have
to débride it again.

366
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,217
No. Leave it alone.

367
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,087
Well, I would if you
changed the dressing

368
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,588
four times a day
like I told you.

369
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:39,424
I'm not a damn nurse.

370
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:40,443
How'd it go?

371
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,945
It didn't. Romano postponed.

372
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,614
Again? What's wrong with him?

373
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,066
He's a maniacal sadist.

374
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,401
What did you call me?

375
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,869
Not you, Mr. Fletcher.

376
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:52,655
Is this machine working?
I feel like I'm drowning.

377
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,990
It takes longer when
you're fluid-overloaded.

378
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,326
Happens when you're
three days late for dialysis.

379
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,911
I told you my son
didn't have time

380
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,180
to drive me to the clinic.

381
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,817
What's wrong with this picture?

382
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:05,835
Those med students.

383
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,379
Not a black face in the bunch.

384
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,724
That doesn't concern you?

385
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:14,927
I see five. Not exactly a
representative sample.

386
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,464
Glad you take such
an active interest.

387
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:21,200
You're gonna have to hold
your foot still, Mr. Fletcher.

388
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,268
She your wife?

389
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,154
Hm? No. No, no, no, no.

390
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,273
She talk like she your wife.

391
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,297
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

392
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,630
Brought you a chair, Mr. Bristo.

393
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,398
Someone will be by
to take her downstairs

394
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,389
but it could take a while.

395
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,004
Do you have a funeral
home you'd like to use?

396
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,238
I could call them.

397
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,439
We have two plots.

398
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,143
But Florence took care
of it. I forget the name.

399
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,712
Okay, well, if you remember...

400
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,713
Can I stay with her?

401
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,302
As long as you like.

402
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,757
It was very decent of you
to work on his wife like that.

403
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,325
Part of the job.

404
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,028
Well, no. I mean,
he's really shaken.

405
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,597
It could be a lot worse if he
thought he was responsible.

406
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,598
He does.

407
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,736
He's alive, she's not.

408
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,303
Wonder how long
they were married.

409
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,373
I don't know. Forever, probably.

410
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,374
How long have you?

411
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,043
What?

412
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,445
Been married.

413
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,448
I'm not.

414
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,807
I thought someone told
me you were married.

415
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,958
I was. But my... My divorce
became final last month.

416
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:36,959
Sorry.

417
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,227
Don't be. I'm not.

418
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,729
Lockhart, is that
your name or his?

419
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,699
It's his. But I'm keeping it

420
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,985
because it's the only
good thing I got out of it.

421
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,104
Why? What was your name before?

422
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,822
Wyczenski.

423
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:52,291
Right. Lockhart is better.

424
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:53,359
Have you seen Dr. Greene?

425
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,960
Suture Room, I think.

426
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:56,928
Oh, Dr. Weaver's
looking for you.

427
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:57,929
Me?

428
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,653
Yeah.

429
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:06,605
Dr. Greene... Sorry. Sorry.

430
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,374
That's okay, Haleh.
Just getting a shot.

431
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,109
I didn't say anything.

432
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,443
What's up?

433
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,712
Mike Palmieri is
having trouble breathing.

434
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,215
Complained of chest pains
when we removed the pads.

435
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,582
All right. I'll be right there.

436
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,186
You done?

437
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,988
All done.

438
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:25,090
Keep laughing, flower girl.

439
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,892
You're welcome.

440
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,316
Thanks a lot.

441
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,782
Mike, how's your breathing?

442
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,184
A little sore.

443
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,651
Okay. Tell me if this hurts.

444
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,055
BP's stable.
115/70. Satting at 98.

445
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,056
There.

446
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,291
Okay. Any belly pain?

447
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,292
No.

448
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,793
Are you sure?

449
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,228
A little. Okay.

450
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,131
Haleh, book a CT.
And let's sit him up.

451
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,299
Where's your mom, Mike?

452
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,667
She went to check
on the score for me.

453
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,636
If we're losing, I
need to get back.

454
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,639
We need to take another
picture of your chest and belly

455
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,441
just to make sure
everything's okay.

456
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,942
How long does that take?

457
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,011
Relax, Mike.

458
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,515
You're gonna be
with us for a while.

459
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:06,531
Mrs. Palmieri?

460
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:07,832
What happened?

461
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:10,936
Nothing serious. Mike
might have a broken rib.

462
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,721
And I need a CAT
scan just to make sure

463
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,222
that it didn't nick his liver.

464
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,242
His liver? What...?
What does that mean?

465
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,543
Well, it all depends.

466
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,811
But it's really a
remote possibility.

467
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,030
I just wanna make sure.

468
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,999
I knew something like
this was gonna happen.

469
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,784
I hate that he plays
football. I hate it.

470
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:26,885
But it keeps his grades up.

471
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,904
He's not a great student

472
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,856
but he has to keep good
grades to play so I let him play.

473
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,992
I'm sure everything
is gonna be just fine.

474
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:36,895
I'll check back with
you after the scan.

475
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:39,048
Chen?

476
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,782
Chen! Yes.

477
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,251
You okay? Yeah. Great.

478
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,319
Can you find Dr. Corday
and have her meet me in CT?

479
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,021
Uh-huh. No problem.

480
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,990
BP, 136/88. Pulse, 125.

481
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,726
They nailed me after the
play. Refs didn't even call it.

482
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,763
Draw up some Demerol.
Open tibial fracture.

483
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,132
Titrate 100, slow IV push.

484
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,401
55. That's the number
of the guy who hit Mike.

485
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,402
It was a clean hit.

486
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,903
GSW on the way.
Crashing in the rig.

487
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,171
Frank. What's open?

488
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,241
Stiff in Trauma 2. Other
than that we're booked.

489
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,375
Clear it. Take this guy.

490
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,610
Got it.

491
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,011
You led with your helmet.
You're not supposed to.

492
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,113
Ma'am, wait in Chairs.

493
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,114
It was an accident.

494
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,249
It was a cheap shot.

495
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,351
What do you call breaking
my leg on purpose?

496
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,375
Payback!

497
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,725
Thank you.

498
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,309
Sir? Sir?

499
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,364
Oh, thank you.

500
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,982
Can I get a gin
and tonic, please?

501
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:30,983
Anything for you, sir?

502
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:33,140
No, thank you.

503
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,272
From Atlanta or Chicago?

504
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,607
Chicago.

505
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,376
Atlanta on business?

506
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
No.

507
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:43,568
Vacation?

508
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,354
I was just visiting a friend.

509
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,691
So, what do you do for a living?

510
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:57,992
I'm a teacher.
High school English.

511
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,347
Wow. And you fly first class?

512
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:05,951
They must pay teachers
pretty well in Chicago.

513
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,842
Excuse me.

514
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,606
Mr. Bristo?

515
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,347
They needed the room.

516
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,727
Oh, okay. Well, don't worry.

517
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:50,395
We'll find her another room.

518
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,496
Are they coming to get her?

519
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,299
Yeah. Soon. They're coming soon.

520
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:55,300
Lost the pulse!

521
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:56,501
Starting compressions.

522
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,137
What's on the monitor?

523
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,171
P.E.A.

524
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,705
Amp of epi.
Squeeze in the blood.

525
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,775
Malucci has an assaulted
cheerleader coming.

526
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,776
Bat to the face.

527
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,777
Okay. Get Mark.

528
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,012
He's in CT. Got a pulse.

529
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,381
Increase dopamine.
Get him up to the O.R.

530
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,049
You finished in the Trauma Room?

531
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,350
Yeah. Abby, I'm glad I saw you.

532
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:13,852
I need to talk to you.

533
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,220
Somebody find Kovac, please?!

534
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:16,454
This man's wife died.

535
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,991
We told him he could wait
until Transpo picks her up.

536
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:20,192
We'll lean on them.

537
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:22,394
I checked with the
medical-school registrar and...

538
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:23,395
Out of the way!

539
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:24,963
They retracted your clerkship...

540
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:25,998
What?!

541
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:27,732
Is that from the
football game too?

542
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,701
Yeah, someone jumped
her in the bathroom.

543
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:30,769
Dr. Weaver?

544
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,537
Something about
delinquent tuition.

545
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,240
My ex-husband was supposed
to pay that. I apologize.

546
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:36,241
No need to apologize.

547
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,110
I'll get it paid by tomorrow.

548
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,212
You don't understand.
You need to go home.

549
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:41,579
You're not covered to work.

550
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,849
I'll work it out
with the registrar...

551
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,884
Once a clerkship
is pulled, it's pulled.

552
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:48,921
Nothing I can do. You have
to wait till the next quarter.

553
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:49,922
In three months?

554
00:23:49,946 --> 00:23:50,989
Sorry. Dean's decision.

555
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:51,990
We got a blown pupil!

556
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,292
Turn in your lab coat to Frank.

557
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:54,293
Heart rate's dropping.

558
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:56,861
Okay. Prep for an intubation.

559
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:59,898
Hang the mannitol. 40 of
Lasix. She needs a Foley.

560
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,933
Give me some gloves,
somebody! Move!

561
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,802
Pressure's sky-high. 180/120.

562
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:07,972
Bolus her with 100 of
lidocaine, 75 of sux...

563
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,316
What's this for?

564
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,484
Sorry. Sorry.

565
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,403
Abby, what's wrong? Abby?

566
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,327
Abby?

567
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:36,435
You got cleaned up.

568
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:38,339
Looks good. Thank you.

569
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,590
I'd choose the
fish if I were you.

570
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:44,092
The steak looks, uh, ugh.

571
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,116
I'm not hungry.

572
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:48,697
Excuse me, Dr. Carter.

573
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,904
Were you smoking
in the lavatory?

574
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:56,538
Yes.

575
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,957
Then you're in
violation of federal law,

576
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:02,527
punishable by a $2000
fine and imprisonment.

577
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,529
Do I need to have the
marshals at the gate?

578
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:06,832
No. It won't happen again.

579
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:08,639
Do you have the butt with you?

580
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:22,303
All right then.

581
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,542
Doctor, huh?

582
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,529
Mrs. Palmieri?

583
00:25:33,883 --> 00:25:35,560
What is it?

584
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,628
Apparently, the blow
to Michael's chest

585
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,831
caused a little
internal bleeding.

586
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:42,951
Some of it in the sac
surrounding his heart.

587
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,204
Oh, God. That sounds serious.

588
00:25:45,228 --> 00:25:48,240
It can be, but right now
there's only a small amount.

589
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:50,576
But we need to operate
to drain the blood

590
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,377
before it restricts function.

591
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:54,179
Open-heart surgery?

592
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:56,247
No. We go through
the upper abdomen,

593
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,683
very small incision.

594
00:25:57,707 --> 00:26:02,420
It's a really simple
procedure. I just need you to...

595
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:03,421
Now?

596
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:04,956
I just need you to
sign the consent.

597
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,160
You're gonna do the surgery now?

598
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:11,647
Right now Mike's blood pressure
is stable, which is a good sign.

599
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,900
But more blood could accumulate.

600
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,601
We need to do the
operation immediately

601
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,071
to avoid an emergency
procedure down here.

602
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:21,039
You just need the
one signature, right?

603
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:25,460
I... I couldn't find his
father if I wanted to.

604
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,995
One is enough. All right.

605
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,396
What's the emergency? I'm here.

606
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,397
I didn't call you.

607
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,698
Robert.

608
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,634
If you're gonna leave
messages with my assistant,

609
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,635
don't also page me.

610
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,371
It gets annoyingly redundant.

611
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,973
Sorry to inconvenience
you, Robert,

612
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,408
but we have a real
crisis down here.

613
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,409
Yeah? And?

614
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,578
And it's become a health hazard.

615
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,813
If somebody calls the
county, we'll be fined.

616
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,983
But someone's not going
to call the county, is she?

617
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:51,819
Look, Robert, housekeeping
won't clean any sheets or towels.

618
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,254
I need the nurses here.

619
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,256
It's not their job
anyway to be doing...

620
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,058
What do you want me
to say? Troubleshoot.

621
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,293
It's called being a manager.

622
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,861
You need to end
this strike, Robert.

623
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,662
Find me the half-million
a year it'll take

624
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,964
to meet their demands, I will.

625
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,332
Peter, keeping banker's hours?

626
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,034
I've been on since 5.

627
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,202
Well, you got a sec?

628
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,004
I gotta go pick up somebody...

629
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,338
Let's finish this. What?

630
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,606
The interview. Walk with me.

631
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,673
What about Elizabeth?

632
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,476
I let her sit in to make
her feel important.

633
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,111
It's my decision.

634
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,212
Let's talk turkey.

635
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,880
I know you've got
the surgical skills.

636
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,081
I don't question that.

637
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,749
I do, however,
question your loyalty.

638
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,551
My loyalty lies
with my patients.

639
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,221
As it should. But don't
take this the wrong way

640
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,811
you have a real propensity
for being a pain in the ass.

641
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,534
I'm not gonna jump
you, you homophobe.

642
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,550
Damn janitors!

643
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,719
You should try paying them.

644
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,353
You see? That's
exactly my point.

645
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:44,256
Instead of trying to
understand my problems

646
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,124
you immediately
champion the opposition.

647
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:47,125
The janitors?

648
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,827
Whoever. Peter, look.

649
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:50,662
If I'm gonna give
you a faculty position,

650
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:52,831
I've gotta be sure you're
gonna be part of the team.

651
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:54,566
My team.

652
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,156
Of course. Of course what?

653
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,739
Of course I'll be
a part of the team.

654
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,478
Then I can expect
your full commitment?

655
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:08,913
No whining, no complaining

656
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:13,184
no excuses about your
kid or your cat or whatever?

657
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,786
I don't have a cat.

658
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,438
Splendid. You're hired.

659
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,573
Congratulations.
You are a free man,

660
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,709
delivered from the shackles of
your residency and fellowship.

661
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,911
Dry your hands first.

662
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,034
Yeah, right.

663
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,104
Oh, well. Wasn't me.

664
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,097
You selfish son of a bitch.

665
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,098
Well, hello, Abby.

666
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:44,199
Is this fun for you?

667
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,466
Or is it like an addiction?

668
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,035
Do you wake up thinking:

669
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,804
"How am I gonna
screw Abby today?"

670
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,189
Okay. What's the problem?

671
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,692
I lost three months of
school I can't make up

672
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:57,479
three months that put me exactly
one year behind on my residency.

673
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:58,646
This is about your tuition.

674
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,398
Yes, it's about my tuition.

675
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:02,133
Calm down. I was gonna call you.

676
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,869
The IRS disallowed our
'97 home-office deduction.

677
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:06,437
I don't want one
more lame excuse...

678
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:09,974
Call the IRS. They were
gonna hit us with a huge penalty.

679
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,493
This was important to me.

680
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,962
And you knew it,
so you ruined it.

681
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,247
Can you be more dramatic?

682
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:18,467
I put you through med school.
You were gonna put me...

683
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,068
You did not put me
through med school.

684
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,053
My student loans put
me through med school.

685
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,621
I only fed, clothed,
sheltered you.

686
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:25,389
Loans I'm still paying,

687
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,476
along with a house,
your condo and two cars.

688
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,166
And the apartment for the whore.

689
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:33,265
I assume you're
cheating on the whore.

690
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:34,266
All right, just stop it.

691
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,151
You stop it.

692
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,986
Haven't you done enough already?

693
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,255
I didn't make you unhappy,
depressed and miserable.

694
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,029
You did that all by yourself.

695
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,828
Screw you, Richard.

696
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:47,895
Right. Screw me.

697
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,963
That's right. Screw you.

698
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,232
Screw me. Screw you!

699
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,667
You're the one who wanted more.

700
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,303
You're a manipulative,
cheating, spineless...

701
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,704
You decided to change your life.

702
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,179
Spiteful ass!

703
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,010
Are you done? No.

704
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,112
You're in violation of
our divorce agreement.

705
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,465
I am hiring a lawyer and I
am getting my tuition money.

706
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:09,184
Hell, Abby, do me a favor.
Why don't you take it all?

707
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,919
Take the debt with it.

708
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,459
Shut up, jag-off.

709
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,794
Hey, Nat.

710
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,962
Hey, Dr. Benton.

711
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:21,963
Still plugging away?

712
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,448
You know it.

713
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:25,033
What are you doing?

714
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,818
Go around the other
way, would you?

715
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:28,453
Yeah. Nat, I'm late, man.

716
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:29,793
The news is here.

717
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,710
All right, brother. Good luck.

718
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,133
Thanks.

719
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,715
Chen?

720
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,049
I'm on break.

721
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,707
Right.

722
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,009
You all right?

723
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,732
Yeah. Yeah.

724
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,078
Good, you're still here.

725
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,713
We got a mass "cas" coming in.

726
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,315
Riot at a high
school football game.

727
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,783
I was just leaving...

728
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,490
Not anymore.

729
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,715
Blunt abdominal trauma.

730
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,084
BP's low at 90 palp.
Give two liters of saline.

731
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,686
What happened? Bleachers fell.

732
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,854
Give two units O-neg.
Draw pre-op labs.

733
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,022
Ultrasound? You bet.

734
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,523
Also, page me if
anything changes.

735
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,758
All right, go.

736
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,861
Drop an NG, check his
urine, shoot a chest and pelvis.

737
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,830
Sorry.

738
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:34,535
The game was too ugly.
Refs called it before the end.

739
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,571
And everybody just
started swinging.

740
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,039
You okay, Cleo? Yeah.

741
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,373
Doc. They need you.

742
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,375
Damn kids jumped a
teacher in the parking lot.

743
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,912
Head trauma, maybe
a collapsed lung.

744
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:46,715
Short of breath. BP
110/70. Pulse 120.

745
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,650
Mitch, do you have
any pain in your chest?

746
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,951
It hurts.

747
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:54,322
Titrate another six of morphine.
Page Ortho and Vascular.

748
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,890
Elizabeth, what
are you doing here?

749
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,158
I thought you'd be operating.

750
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,459
Mitch? What happened?

751
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,728
They're backed up.

752
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:03,364
Rooms are empty but filthy
because of this work stoppage.

753
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,699
Really? You doing okay?

754
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,101
They gotta operate. But who won?

755
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,401
Where are we going?

756
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,569
Nobody.

757
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,772
Try an exam room.
Get an EKG, chest x-ray,

758
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,774
and find me when
the femur film's up.

759
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,275
How long before
you get into O.R.?

760
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,576
The nurses are cleaning

761
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,612
but there's a leaking
triple-A going first.

762
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,913
We're gonna keep him down here

763
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,481
and do a pericardiocentesis.

764
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,084
All this so Housekeeping
doesn't get an extra dollar an hour.

765
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,653
I don't need the
operation anymore?

766
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,254
You just have to
wait a little longer.

767
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,906
Hang in there, Mike.

768
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,508
You chucked my guy with
your helmet. Don't whine.

769
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,143
Hold still. You
did it on purpose.

770
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,278
You want some more?

771
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,579
Hold still or I'll put
you in restraints.

772
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:36,680
What did they hit you with?

773
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,482
The pavement.

774
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,683
Frank. Frank, what's open?

775
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,108
Nothing. Nothing's open.

776
00:32:46,514 --> 00:32:50,328
I can't believe this. I
mean, it's just a game.

777
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:51,996
Is the nurse taking me up?

778
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,765
We're gonna have to drain
some of the blood down here.

779
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,700
You said he was going
straight to Surgery.

780
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,904
But it can take a while to prep
and drape and anesthetize him.

781
00:32:59,928 --> 00:33:02,273
His cardiac echo shows
the effusion's grown...

782
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,875
Crush injury at 70 palp,
despite a fluid bolus.

783
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,910
Respiratory status?

784
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,778
Intubated for
agonal respirations.

785
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:09,480
Two units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser.

786
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,782
Set up a supraumbilical
peritoneal lavage.

787
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:12,951
I'm never gonna leave.

788
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,218
Pulse 140. Satted at 92.

789
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,803
Hey, med student,
what's your name?

790
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,937
Ryan. Ryan Bradford.

791
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,081
Ryan, get over here. I
need your help. Move!

792
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,895
That's not so bad.

793
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,064
This is the little needle to
numb you for the big needle.

794
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,300
Oh.

795
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,769
But you're a tough
guy. You can take it.

796
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:32,793
BP's 90.

797
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,676
I can't believe all
this started over me.

798
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,348
You're a popular guy.

799
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,896
He looks so pale.

800
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,965
Mrs. Palmieri, perhaps
you should wait outside

801
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,266
during the actual procedure.

802
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,401
I can't stay?

803
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,485
I'm okay, Mom.

804
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,938
Just a little tired.

805
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:50,939
Haleh?

806
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,073
This way, ma'am.

807
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,408
I love you.

808
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,098
I love you too, Mom.

809
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,106
Alligator clip.

810
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:08,706
He's in tamponade, Mark.

811
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,675
I know. Mike, how
are you feeling?

812
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,293
Pulse ox down to 78.

813
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,846
Mike?

814
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,347
Mike? Mike, open your eyes.

815
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,516
8-0 ET tube. I'll intubate.

816
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,218
He's still breathing.

817
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,242
Not for long.

818
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,639
Just keep an eye
on the injury current.

819
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:25,845
Just get that needle in.

820
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,448
Dr. Carter? Are you Dr. Carter?

821
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:51,515
Yeah.

822
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,334
I'm Ryan Bradford.
I'm a third-year.

823
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,735
The ER got slammed
and Dr. Benton

824
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,421
asked me to come
down, pick you up.

825
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,422
Oh, great.

826
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:58,456
Need a hand with that?

827
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,674
No, no. I got it.

828
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,409
Okay. Right this way.

829
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,510
<i>Where you going?</i>

830
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:03,878
Pre-op. He needs an ex-lap.

831
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:04,879
There's no room.

832
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,481
He's stable. He
can wait upstairs.

833
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,216
What's his BP? BP's 140/60.

834
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,783
All right. Grab the
head injury in 3.

835
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,452
All right. Malik. You got this?

836
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,708
Yeah, I got it. Go on.

837
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,760
Hey, sir?

838
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,986
Sir, are you all right? Sir?

839
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:29,843
Malik. I need a gurney now.

840
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,982
Oh, my God. Malik.

841
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,231
You. Come here. What'd I do?

842
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:43,190
Help me move this
man. Now. Come on.

843
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:49,474
Sats are up to 92.

844
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:51,142
You want me to try?

845
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,477
No. He has weird anatomy.

846
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:55,046
I have to go more anterior.

847
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,081
I should be there.

848
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,582
Run of five. Pull back.

849
00:35:58,606 --> 00:36:00,184
Pressure's dropping down to 70.

850
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,886
Give him another
liter of saline.

851
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,322
Look at the monitor.
Profound ST elevation.

852
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:05,789
Damn it. He's having an MI.

853
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:07,125
More PVCs.

854
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:08,726
A hundred of lidocaine.

855
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,362
You must have transected
the coronary artery.

856
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,597
No, no, no, no, no.

857
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:14,765
It's a known complication.

858
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:17,168
You went in blind.
Prep the chest.

859
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:18,536
He should be upstairs right now.

860
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,971
Mark.

861
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,628
Thoracotomy tray.

862
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:24,792
What happened?

863
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,661
He swallowed a whole pharmacy.

864
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:30,197
I found empty bottles of
Elavil, codeine and lorazepam.

865
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,198
Did you give him Narcan?

866
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,866
Yeah. Two mgs times two.

867
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,670
Sats are dropping.
Resps eight and shallow.

868
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:39,139
Add an amp of bicarb.
Chem-7, CBC and a tox screen.

869
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,208
Yeah, I'm in. Who's Florence?

870
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,209
What?

871
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,111
Well, the pills say "Florence."

872
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,347
His wife. She
died this afternoon.

873
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:50,139
Pericardium's tight
as a drum. Metz.

874
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,624
Okay. Start internal
compressions.

875
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,058
Need suction in here.

876
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,993
We've got a crowd.

877
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:03,297
Someone close the blinds.
Can you see anything?

878
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,254
Sponge stick.

879
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,738
Right there.
Laceration of the L.A.D.

880
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:11,905
Can you repair it?

881
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,140
Not without bypass.

882
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,543
You got to do something.
I am not losing him.

883
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,578
Right. Open some
sterile IV tubing.

884
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,402
The blinds, now.

885
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:22,533
I don't know how you
guys do it every day.

886
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:23,818
It's pretty intense.

887
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:24,885
You sure get to do a lot.

888
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,487
You know, you
just jump right in.

889
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,222
I was interested in surgery.

890
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,556
But I don't know.

891
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,242
Maybe the ER's my thing.

892
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:32,944
I guess if today's
any indication,

893
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:34,848
there's never a
dull moment, huh?

894
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,750
Yeah, right.

895
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:41,908
Tubing's in. There.

896
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,656
Hold compressions.

897
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,657
He's in V-fib.

898
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,893
Charge internal paddles to 15.

899
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,850
Charging.

900
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,334
Clear.

901
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,241
Still in V-fib.

902
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:00,793
Charge to 30.

903
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,696
Haleh.

904
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,798
Clear.

905
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:11,799
Another amp of epi.

906
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:12,951
Charge again.

907
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:13,952
50 of lidocaine.

908
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:15,419
Start a drip at two per minute.

909
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:16,723
Clear!

910
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,357
Still in Torsade.

911
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,158
Three-sixty. Magnesium on board?

912
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:23,411
That's four grams.
Isuprel's pouring in.

913
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:24,767
Clear.

914
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,515
Asystole.

915
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,150
It's the tricyclics. We'll
never get a rhythm back.

916
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,721
Maybe we could
try overdrive pacing.

917
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:37,758
No. He's been down too long.

918
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:43,497
That's it. Time of death, 19:54.

919
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,998
Take him downstairs.

920
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,542
Make sure he's
put beside his wife.

921
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,102
You guys done?

922
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,704
I've got stab
wounds to the thigh.

923
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,261
Yeah, we are done.

924
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:02,082
Come on, Mike. Come on.

925
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,417
How many units of blood?

926
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,819
Six so far.

927
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,287
The heart's filling well.
He's not hypovolemic.

928
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,288
When was the last epi?

929
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,790
Three minutes.

930
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:10,858
He's had two of atropine?

931
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,360
Both amps are in.

932
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,729
Someone should prep the mother.

933
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:16,730
Dopamine's wide open?

934
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,265
For the last five minutes.

935
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,568
Son of a bitch. Mark.

936
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,837
Let's keep going.

937
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,973
You want me to talk to her?

938
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:29,176
No. I should do it.

939
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,984
Chen.

940
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:37,073
Can you come take
over chest compressions?

941
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,388
Okay. Let's go again
with the paddles.

942
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,847
Charge to 30.

943
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,684
Clear.

944
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,949
Hey, man, what's going on?

945
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,151
Is he dying?

946
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:56,354
What's happening
to him? Hey, come on.

947
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:58,778
He's our friend.

948
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:04,128
Someone said you
had to shock him.

949
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,730
Is that true?

950
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:08,999
We've had some complications.

951
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,069
What kind of complications?

952
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:12,937
The needle poked
a hole in the artery

953
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:17,325
that supplies the blood
and oxygen to Mike's heart

954
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:22,396
which caused him
to have a heart attack.

955
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,433
We opened up his
chest to repair the artery.

956
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,302
But his heart has been
deprived of oxygen for too long

957
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,903
and it wasn't beating.

958
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,339
Oh, my God.

959
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:34,041
We're giving him
intravenous drugs

960
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,710
and shocking his heart.

961
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,511
There's been no response.

962
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,796
What does that mean?

963
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,797
What does that mean?!

964
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,632
We might not get him back.

965
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:44,506
What? He could die.

966
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,192
But you said that this
was a simple procedure,

967
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:54,095
that he would be fine.

968
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,763
That he would sail through this.

969
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,331
I know. I know, Mrs. Palmieri.

970
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,368
This is an exceedingly
rare complication.

971
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:03,170
I don't care. I don't care.

972
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,372
You fix him.

973
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:06,139
You fix my son!

974
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,641
We'll try. No.

975
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,626
But...

976
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,316
You promised me.

977
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,002
I have to go back.

978
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,006
You promised me.

979
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:18,986
Is he gonna be all right?

980
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,487
We're working on him.

981
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,488
You gotta give us room.

982
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,757
Everybody back
up. Back up, guys.

983
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,059
Let the doctor through.

984
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,961
Still in V-fib.
Sats are dropping.

985
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,495
Carotid pulse with compressions.

986
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,397
Clear.

987
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,633
Anything? No.

988
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,902
Again. How long
are we going to go?

989
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,104
Until I say stop.

990
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,739
Clear.

991
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,507
We're out of epi.

992
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,645
Chen, I want you
to go get some epi.

993
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,113
Sure.

994
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,816
Crash cart Curtain 3.

995
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,707
Clear.

996
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,571
Excuse me.

997
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,715
The doctor told Mike's
mom he was gonna die.

998
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,829
Hey.

999
00:42:24,092 --> 00:42:26,342
Malucci!

1000
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,498
You okay?

1001
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:41,006
Stop it. Let it go!
Let it go! Stop it!

1002
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,057
Break it up.
Break it up. Get off.

1003
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,184
Security. We've got
a problem down here!

1004
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,810
What is going on out there?

1005
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,611
I don't know. They
just started fighting.

1006
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,769
Clear.

1007
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,783
Chen, are you okay? Yeah.

1008
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:13,784
Are you okay?

1009
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,286
Mark. Mark. What?

1010
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,670
A rhythm. We've got a rhythm.

1011
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:31,802
What's that?

1012
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,070
I don't know.

1013
00:43:33,094 --> 00:43:34,472
I better get back.
You coming in?

1014
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:35,606
No. I'm gonna go home.

1015
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,074
Hey, well, it was
good to meet you.

1016
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:38,098
Thank you.
