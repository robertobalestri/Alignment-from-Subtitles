1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,617
<i>If you're just waking up,</i>

2
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,519
<i>give yourself some
extra time to get to work.</i>

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,971
I know they didn't
plow my street.

4
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,372
First major snowfall,

5
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,707
they always take three
days to get their act together.

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,143
Oh, God, it's freezing outside.

7
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,111
Hey, Dr. Weaver.
Any trouble getting in?

8
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,712
No, I didn't even
bother with my car.

9
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:20,914
I just took the El.

10
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,682
Hey, John, what are
you still doing here?

11
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,167
I thought you were off at 3.

12
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,769
Five-car pile up
on the expressway.

13
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:26,770
How many did we get?

14
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:27,837
Six out of eight.

15
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,605
Three went up to the
O.R., two to the SICU,

16
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,708
and one's waiting
on a monitored bed.

17
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,476
I spent the last four
hours catching up.

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,678
How'd our temp attending do?

19
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:35,779
Worthless.

20
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,380
Carter had to keep
the board running.

21
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,682
Thank you, Haleh.

22
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,984
Yeah, what happened to the
attending we had last week?

23
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,152
Took a job in the Bahamas.

24
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,320
I knew that guy was
too smart for this place.

25
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,421
Where do you need me?

26
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,057
I think we're
through the thick of it.

27
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,058
Those are the dispos.

28
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,827
I signed out the
rest to Malucci.

29
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,462
Will you, uh, give Mr. Phelps
a Bactrim and discharge him?

30
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,564
Yeah. Thank you.

31
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,054
And I think I am out of here.

32
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,068
Hey.

33
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,937
Uh, John, I'm sorry that I
put you on nights so soon,

34
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,739
but with Mark gone,
the schedule's a mess.

35
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,008
We all do our share of nights.
Have you heard from him?

36
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:05,992
Mark? Yeah.

37
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,494
No. They got there Tuesday.

38
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:09,496
I didn't want to call. I
mean, if it's good news,

39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,080
then they'll... Yeah.

40
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,934
Well, I will see you at,
uh, 4:00 this afternoon.

41
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,002
Make it 5:00.
We'll cover for you.

42
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,453
Thanks.

43
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,530
Anesthesiologist is on his way.

44
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,531
How long?

45
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,866
A couple of minutes.

46
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,569
Jing-Mei, I'm gonna need
you to relax for a second, okay?

47
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:25,193
Okay.

48
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,565
Yeah, I know. I know.

49
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:35,048
Dilated at 4 centimeters.

50
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,450
Completely effaced.

51
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:38,985
Zero station.

52
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,553
Start the Pitocin
at two per minute,

53
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,510
and up it every 20 minutes.

54
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,843
Is it okay to come in?

55
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,845
Oh, John.

56
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,513
John, I'm so sorry to call you.

57
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,514
It's okay, it's okay.

58
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,982
I mean, I waited
as long as I could.

59
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,517
I didn't want to wake you.

60
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,819
Don't worry. I'm not working.

61
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,937
Jing-Mei,

62
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,538
I'm going to rupture
your membranes,

63
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:00,157
to help move you
along a little, okay?

64
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,491
When did you go into labor?

65
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,492
Midnight.

66
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,493
Where?

67
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,694
Home. I... I took a cab.

68
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,998
All done.

69
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,181
Oh.

70
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:11,818
You know, I thought I could
do this myself, but I can't.

71
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:12,986
I can't.

72
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,855
Hey, it's okay.
You don't have to.

73
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,858
Contraction? Mm-hmm.

74
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,294
Okay. Squeeze my hand.

75
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,029
Yeah, squeeze my
hand. There you go.

76
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,330
You're doing great, Jing-Mei.

77
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:25,498
You're doing great.

78
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:27,333
We'll get the
epidural working soon.

79
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,935
Have you taken
any birthing classes?

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,937
Mm-hmm. Lamaze? Bradley?

81
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,305
Which one?

82
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,329
Lamaze? Okay.

83
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:36,209
Take a good, deep breath.

84
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,512
In, in.

85
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,373
Don't touch that.

86
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:42,942
Peter.

87
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:45,411
Peter?

88
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,181
Yeah.

89
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,749
Listen.

90
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,952
What?

91
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,221
Voices.

92
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,711
It's Kynesha.

93
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,794
Talking to herself?

94
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:03,418
She's probably just watching TV.

95
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,031
Peter.

96
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,032
What?

97
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,056
You brought her here.

98
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,102
Go.

99
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,159
Mmm.

100
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,593
No, you don't know.
This girl stay uptight.

101
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,145
Can't be too uptight. Lets
you stay here by yourself.

102
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,347
Get mad every
time I turn on a light.

103
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,583
Place this nice, she
worried about the electric bill.

104
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,041
Sure has straight teeth.

105
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,987
Who are you?

106
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,857
Uh, I was just looking at it.

107
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,325
Where's Kynesha?

108
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,044
Hey, Dr. Benton.

109
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,128
Kynesha, who is this?

110
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:37,062
This is Tiny. Hey.

111
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,231
Tiny got locked out.

112
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,935
Her sister ain't
coming home till 7.

113
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:42,052
You went out?

114
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,336
No.

115
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
So somebody else is
wearing your boots now?

116
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,740
I went to check on my mom.

117
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,742
Tiny said she came
back, was looking for me.

118
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,061
Was pretty messed up.

119
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,730
All right. Um... You
live in her building?

120
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,399
Yeah. Grab your
stuff. I'll take you home.

121
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,001
Kynesha, you
better clean this up

122
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,440
before Cleo comes down.

123
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:03,623
Okay?

124
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:05,825
There, you have your coffee.

125
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:06,849
Now let's go.

126
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:09,863
Mark, I don't want to
keep this man waiting.

127
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:13,199
He's jammed us
into his schedule.

128
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:14,233
What is it?

129
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,468
The kid with the red hat.

130
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:17,970
What about him?

131
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:21,607
I saw another kid
wearing that exact hat,

132
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,209
three weeks ago.

133
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:26,100
I was buying groceries
for Thanksgiving dinner.

134
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:29,957
Now I'm in New York,
waiting for a miracle.

135
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,904
Well, maybe it's a sign.

136
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,939
Either that,

137
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,107
or the Grim Reaper
wears a red hat.

138
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,409
I didn't come with you
to hear talk like that.

139
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,111
I thought that was healthy.

140
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,046
Well, it's not.

141
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,116
I should just stick with denial?

142
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,118
I'd prefer guarded optimism,

143
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,088
until Dr. Burke maps the
brain, and gives us his opinion.

144
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,757
Yeah, and then I can
hear bad news twice.

145
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,294
If you really believed that,
you'd have called Rachel by now.

146
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,530
Just call her up, and
tell her over the phone?

147
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,398
No, you could have
flown out there for a day,

148
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,399
but you didn't.

149
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,602
Why?

150
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,470
I have a feeling
you're gonna tell me.

151
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,637
Yes, because deep down,

152
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,539
you really do believe
that this technology,

153
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,807
and this surgeon can help you.

154
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,309
And you don't want to tell her,

155
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,811
until you know
you'll be all right.

156
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,229
Yeah, or I'm desperate.

157
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,030
You've seen enough
patients in your time,

158
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,832
overcome illnesses
they shouldn't have,

159
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,401
to understand the importance
of a positive outlook.

160
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:25,109
Now, you have to
believe it's possible.

161
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,947
I think I'm a little nervous.

162
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,018
Well, me too.

163
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,236
Heart rate is 150
with Type-1 dips.

164
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,270
Is that a normal decel?

165
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,373
Yeah. It's good
cardiac activity.

166
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,874
I thought you got
high honors in OB.

167
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,976
I did. Excuse me.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,078
The adoptive parents are
here. Can I show them in?

169
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,763
Yes. No!

170
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:53,232
They said they arranged
to be present for the birth.

171
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,400
John, do you mind?

172
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:56,157
Yeah. I'll talk to
them. I'll talk to them.

173
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,608
Hi. You're the adoptive parents?

174
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,376
Yes. James and Linda. Hi.

175
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,377
You're the doctor?

176
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,678
I'm a friend of Deb's.

177
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:06,696
Who?

178
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,065
Jing-Mei. I'm John Carter.

179
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,533
Is there a problem?

180
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,668
No, no. She's starting to push.

181
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,121
Baby's healthy. Could
be any minute now.

182
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:16,756
We should get in there.

183
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,576
Well, she's feeling
a little overwhelmed.

184
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,343
She said we could
be present at the birth.

185
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,629
I know. Uh...

186
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,463
But labor can be demanding,

187
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,216
and she really needs to focus.

188
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,885
We traveled all night
from Portland to get here.

189
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,920
I understand.

190
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,264
You can have a seat, right here.

191
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,783
Is she changing her mind?

192
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,910
About giving the
baby up for adoption?

193
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,846
No, I think she's a
little embarrassed.

194
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,448
Just wants a little privacy.

195
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,018
Look, we really
wanted to be there,

196
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:46,102
for the birth of our son.

197
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,436
I'll bring him right out to you.

198
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,077
I promise.

199
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:54,260
Hey, I heard Dr. Chen's
having her baby upstairs.

200
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,428
Malucci, Exam 1's
been here since 9:00,

201
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,964
with reflux esophagitis.

202
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,132
In a minute, chief.

203
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:01,067
Do you want to
send her flowers? No.

204
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:02,068
I could start a pool.

205
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:03,536
No. Leave her alone.

206
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,537
Why?

207
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,572
Randi, can you
just drop it, please?

208
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,674
Hi, Kim.

209
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:10,109
Hi. You have a
cyclothymic down here?

210
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,045
Yeah. A guy in Exam 3,

211
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,047
trying to set a new
world record doing sit-ups.

212
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,048
Got it.

213
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,716
Hey, I tried to call
you the other day...

214
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,350
Oh.

215
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,819
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

216
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,020
My machine's been acting up.

217
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,321
I need to get a new one.

218
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,390
Oh. I wish I'd
known that sooner.

219
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:27,110
I might have gotten
you something different.

220
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,230
Merry Christmas. Oh, wow!

221
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:33,333
Yeah. I happened across
a copy over the weekend,

222
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:34,651
and couldn't resist.

223
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,318
Hopefully you don't
already have one.

224
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,620
Well, thank you.

225
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,560
My pleasure.

226
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,075
Should I open it now?

227
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,776
Or later.

228
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,877
Okay.

229
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:49,114
You know, you should try
drinking water upside-down.

230
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:50,850
It always helps with me.

231
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:51,884
Yeah. Thank you.

232
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:53,052
See you.

233
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,220
You said one night.
It's been a week.

234
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:56,488
Look, I can't find her mother.

235
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,706
What do you want me to do?

236
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,158
Turn her over to
Social Services.

237
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,327
If her mother's been on
a drug spree for a month,

238
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,628
she needs to be in foster care.

239
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,130
Cleo, Cleo. She's 15 years old.

240
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,232
She doesn't want to
go in the system now.

241
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,267
Well, I'm not
adopting her. Are you?

242
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,435
No, of course not.

243
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,437
I hate the thought of her
being in my house alone.

244
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,855
Now she's bringing friends over?

245
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,074
I'm sorry. That
won't happen again.

246
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:17,243
Peter, she's manipulating you.

247
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,912
You know, I... I got a lead
on another halfway house.

248
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,831
I'll... I'll make sure
she gets into that one.

249
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,489
Two more days.
After that, she's out.

250
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,587
Cleo, I'm working on it. Good.

251
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:31,211
LFTs are back on Room
4. Bilirubin's a little high.

252
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,347
I need help, please! Help me!

253
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,515
Someone help me, please!

254
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,583
What happened?

255
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,017
A dog attacked my son.

256
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,187
He's bitten all over. I
can't stop the bleeding.

257
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,155
What's his name?
Oh, God! It looks worse.

258
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,674
Laceration through and
through. He cut his facial artery.

259
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,059
What's your son's name? Jeff.

260
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,478
He was crying,
but now he's quiet.

261
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:53,863
Jeff, I'm Dr. Weaver.

262
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,765
We need to secure his
airway. What's open?

263
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,233
Trauma 1. Come on.

264
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,500
Get him on a monitor.

265
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,037
I need suction, and
a Pedes intubation kit.

266
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,456
Throw up 40 of sux
and five of Versed.

267
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,375
- Cutdown tray, move.
- Pulse ox is 86.

268
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,576
Ten liters blow-by.

269
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,461
I need 4-by-4s, and
Merocel sponges.

270
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:09,462
Stats are dropping.

271
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,029
Get back, Peter.
I need to intubate.

272
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,598
I think I can
control it. What is it?

273
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:13,966
Uh, let me get
some suction here.

274
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,468
Ma'am, I need some room.

275
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,869
We have to ask you to step back.

276
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,304
Damn it. If only I can
tie off this bleeder.

277
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,174
Heart rate's up to
120. Pulse ox is 82.

278
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,442
He's not getting enough
oxygen. We have to intubate.

279
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,511
What are you doing?!
Why aren't you helping him?

280
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,646
Got it!

281
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:31,517
Blow hard. Three, two, one.

282
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,119
Okay, okay, now
one more should do it.

283
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,820
I don't want to use
suction. All right?

284
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,322
I thought you said
he was crowning.

285
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:38,157
He is. Just one more push.

286
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:39,692
Ugh... Oh, I can't.

287
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,193
Yes, you can. Just
one more push.

288
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,195
Come on. Now.
You're doing great.

289
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,196
You're doing great.

290
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,799
Ten, nine, eight, push!

291
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,500
Seven, six.

292
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,002
Okay, the head is
out! You can stop.

293
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,871
Stop pushing.

294
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,008
Is it over?

295
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:59,812
Almost.

296
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,181
You did great. You did great.

297
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,182
It's a boy.

298
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,418
He's nice and healthy.

299
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:06,419
You want to hold him?

300
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:07,987
Wanna hold him?

301
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:10,055
No.

302
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,824
You sure?

303
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:12,859
Yes.

304
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,651
I guess this was more
than you bargained for.

305
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,820
Well, you did all the work.

306
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,421
No, I mean having
to see all this.

307
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,445
It was a blur.

308
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,658
Let's just say we're closer now.

309
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,793
Surprised you, huh?

310
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,062
I didn't tell you
about the father.

311
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,206
Yeah, kind of.

312
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:37,717
Are those the adoptive parents?

313
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,017
Yeah. You didn't meet them?

314
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,287
Uh, yeah. About two months ago.

315
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:43,689
They still want to
come in and see you.

316
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,191
What did they do when
you gave them the baby?

317
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,026
They cried.

318
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,027
They seem nice to you?

319
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,529
Yeah, they seem great.

320
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:51,964
Here we are.

321
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,065
Any nausea?

322
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,434
Um, yeah, a little.

323
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,471
All right. We'll give you
some ice chips until it passes.

324
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,439
Hey, you know, you
don't have to stick around.

325
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,440
Oh, I'm fine.

326
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,376
You have a night shift? Later.

327
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,745
Okay. Well, then
you should go rest,

328
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:07,112
crash in the, uh, on-call room.

329
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,213
We'll see.

330
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:09,948
All right. I'm gonna
change your pad.

331
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,518
Then we'll massage your
uterus, to firm it up a bit.

332
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,219
Oh, you don't want
to be around for that.

333
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:16,021
Not really. You okay?

334
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,291
All right, I'm gonna come
back and check on you later.

335
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,315
Okay.

336
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,795
Hey, John? Yeah?

337
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:23,796
Thank you.

338
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,720
You're welcome.

339
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,819
The, uh, whole thing
takes about an hour.

340
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,621
You'll be doing,
uh, language tasks,

341
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,023
as we map out
the speech centers.

342
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,357
Is Dr. Burke meeting us?

343
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,759
He'll stop by at some point.

344
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,027
Usually you meet the surgeon,

345
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,929
before he sends
you off for a scan.

346
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,698
Burke's one of the best
in the world. He's busy.

347
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,799
Uh, take off your glasses,

348
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,634
watch, wallet,
pager, cell phone.

349
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,635
Anything metal,

350
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,137
anything magnetic,
right in here.

351
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,605
Could you at
least call Dr. Burke

352
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,873
and let him know we're here?

353
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,042
He likes to be notified
when the renderings are up.

354
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,511
So as not to waste any
time with the patients.

355
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,512
Elizabeth.

356
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,947
Uh, don't forget the belt.

357
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,482
You'll have earphones,
and we'll talk by intercom.

358
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,052
Can I stay for the scan,
then? I am a surgeon, myself.

359
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,504
You can sit back there.

360
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,672
Uh, for the first run, we'll
ask you to name objects

361
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:08,808
you'll see projected
on fiber-optic goggles.

362
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:11,192
Do I get to shoot
down any aliens?

363
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,048
Will he have scars?

364
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,434
Surgeons will do everything
they can to minimize them.

365
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,568
What are you doing here?

366
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,970
I am so sorry. I was worried.

367
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:21,971
He almost died, Mona!

368
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,205
But he'll be all right?

369
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,490
You're putting that dog down!

370
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:25,858
He's a sweet dog. Mom?

371
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,159
What are you talking about?

372
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,627
Maybe this isn't the right time.

373
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:30,396
Jeff must have provoked
him in some way...

374
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,231
Provoked him? That
animal mauled my son.

375
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,600
You're putting him down. I
want that animal destroyed!

376
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,069
Shelly, I... You better
leave it alone for now.

377
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,170
Mom?

378
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:40,590
Are they gonna kill Winston?

379
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,091
I don't know, honey.

380
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,049
Why don't we find a place for
you to sit down? Here we go.

381
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:49,298
Oh. There's good hemostasis.
The repeat crit is 39.

382
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,299
Great, Peter. Thanks.

383
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,323
Yeah.

384
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,126
Hey.

385
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,823
You're not supposed
to be in there.

386
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,424
What's your name?

387
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,410
Taylor.

388
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:19,683
Well, come on out here, Taylor.

389
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,798
I hurt my foot.

390
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,039
If you come out here,
I can take a look at it.

391
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,192
I'm a doctor.

392
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,209
Okay.

393
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,698
Let's take a look.

394
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,064
Are you a patient here?

395
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:40,683
Let me see this.

396
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,658
Hey, you're supposed to
be up in the blood bank.

397
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,405
You having a blood transfusion?

398
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:48,274
I don't like needles.

399
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,876
Yeah, well, none of us do,

400
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,579
but sometimes we gotta use
them to make you feel better.

401
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:55,887
I'm not sick. Nicole is.

402
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,451
Who's Nicole?

403
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:00,619
She's my sister.

404
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,204
She has leukemia.

405
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,406
Ah.

406
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,350
Then you're donating
bone marrow.

407
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,327
I did that when I was little.

408
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,130
Now they want to
take all my blood

409
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,682
and wash it through a machine.

410
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,750
Mmm. Yeah, I see.

411
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,618
Every time Nicole gets sick,

412
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,162
I have to go to
the hospital too.

413
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,507
I tell you what.

414
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:24,415
You come with me, I'll
make your foot feel better.

415
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,896
You won't take my blood out?

416
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,731
No. Come on.

417
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,187
Come on.

418
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,944
Where are my shoes?

419
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,146
Jing-Mei, I didn't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

420
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,447
You should just think about it.

421
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,950
I have thought about it.

422
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:48,951
What's up?

423
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,485
John, I'm leaving.

424
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,820
Can you give me a ride home?

425
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,056
But you can't leave until
Dr. Coburn gets here.

426
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,191
I'll sign out AMA.
Just get the form.

427
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,094
We keep all postpartum
mothers for 24 hours.

428
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,495
Well, I'm not a mother.

429
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,898
I suggested she see the baby.

430
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,366
John, can we leave, please?

431
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,268
I think they observe
you for a reason, Deb.

432
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,003
I think you should
sit down and relax.

433
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,905
Well, I'll come
back for a blood test.

434
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,707
Don't run away
from this, Jing-Mei.

435
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,342
It's better for the adoptive
parents, better for you,

436
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,934
if you meet your son,
hold him, say goodbye.

437
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,215
I don't think I can.

438
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,350
Can what?

439
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,774
Say goodbye.

440
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,026
Last run is word fluency.

441
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,394
For, uh, each object,

442
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,129
name an action
that goes with it.

443
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,713
If, uh, you see a dog,
you might say, "bark."

444
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,384
<i>Okey-dokey.</i>

445
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,874
Okay, here we go.

446
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:42,941
<i>It grows.</i>

447
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,004
<i>Sweeps.</i>

448
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,587
<i>Live in it.</i>

449
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:51,618
<i>Writes.</i>

450
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:54,966
<i>Blossoms.</i>

451
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,370
Hey, Marty. Is this
the frontal GBM?

452
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:01,773
Baseline scans are up, but
not the functional renderings.

453
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,826
Well, Burke's not gonna
want to cut this one out.

454
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,860
I'll take him.

455
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,862
For the carboplatin trial? Yeah.

456
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,596
No, you had the
parietal GBM for that.

457
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,365
He's a good
gamma-knife candidate.

458
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,267
Best you can offer is
a 12-month survival.

459
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,569
We've seen up to 14 with
an intra-arterial protocol.

460
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,471
Yeah, and what an
enjoyable two months it is.

461
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,773
Hello? <i>It slithers.</i>

462
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,476
Okay, I'll be right up.
SVC Syndrome in the unit.

463
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,478
We'll duke it out
in tumor board.

464
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,579
<i>Sticks you.</i>

465
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,148
Page me when the
renderings come up.

466
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,050
Dr. Burke gets the first look.

467
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,985
No, he won't be interested.

468
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,508
<i>Entomb.</i>

469
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,123
<i>Hang.</i>

470
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,797
All done. I'll be right in.

471
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:39,854
<i>How'd I do?</i>

472
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:46,952
<i>How'd I do?</i>

473
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:48,575
You did brilliantly, Mark.

474
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,831
Can I go home after this?

475
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,132
We'll see.

476
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:01,800
Cleo, you have a call on two.

477
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:03,902
Girl named Kynesha,
something about your car.

478
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:04,903
My car?

479
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,527
She was talking really fast.

480
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,484
Kynesha?

481
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,765
Just gone?

482
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:17,766
Did you see anybody?

483
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,801
<i>No. Nobody.</i>

484
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,670
I'll call the police.
Stay near the phone.

485
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,105
What happened?

486
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,374
Kynesha says my car is
missing, didn't see anything.

487
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,712
Chicago Police Department,
main number, please.

488
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,313
Always the diplomat, Peter!

489
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,414
What?

490
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,216
Dr. Duhlstrom just
called me, ranting.

491
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,252
Says you stole one of
his leukocyte donors,

492
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,419
and you won't give it back.

493
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,388
<i>It</i> was a little girl
that I found scared,

494
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,456
hiding under the stairs.

495
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,724
Finders keepers? Is that it?

496
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:42,725
She cut her foot.

497
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,226
I told him to send
her parents down.

498
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,728
If you hadn't hung
up on Duhlstrom,

499
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,130
you'd know that Dad is at
the airport picking up Grandma,

500
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,198
and Mom's a little busy
with the other daughter

501
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,551
who's puking her guts out
from chemo. So do me a favor.

502
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,737
Hurry it up, suture the
foot, and ship her upstairs.

503
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:55,804
Has anyone even bothered

504
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,606
to explain this
procedure to this girl?

505
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,191
They've done a few
hundred of these.

506
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:02,077
Well, she's scared right
now and feeling a little used.

507
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,378
Oh, that's... That's terrible.

508
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,913
The sister's a
little scared too.

509
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,282
She's scared of dying!

510
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,384
It's not like they're
trying to take out a lung.

511
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,086
Well, she has point tenderness
over the distal malleolus.

512
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,589
Okay. You want to play
ER doc, fine. I'll tell you what.

513
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,757
I'll tell the mother to
abandon her child upstairs,

514
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,225
come down, and
calm this kid down.

515
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,895
But if she is not strapped
in for leukapheresis by 2:30,

516
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,318
I'm strapping you in.

517
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,469
What did she say?

518
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,404
Okay. She said that
she would see him,

519
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,223
but she doesn't really want to.

520
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:34,476
Are you sure that you
want to force this on her?

521
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,513
We have three days until
she has to sign the papers.

522
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,850
And if she doesn't see him,
she might regret it, and...

523
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,119
then change her mind
about the whole adoption.

524
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,238
Okay. Well, she's waiting.

525
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:49,158
All right. Why don't
you bring him in to her,

526
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:51,160
and the Reeds and I will
follow in a few minutes,

527
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,913
so that Jing-Mei can hand
the baby back to Linda.

528
00:20:57,873 --> 00:20:59,039
Okay.

529
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,893
I got him.

530
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,031
Okay.

531
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,974
Ready?

532
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,611
Oh, Carter.

533
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,469
He's so beautiful.

534
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:53,422
Hey. Hey.

535
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,610
Hope it's like a jury.

536
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:01,280
The longer they deliberate,
the better chance I have

537
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:02,381
of getting off.

538
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,483
They could still be
waiting for Burke.

539
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:06,752
I'm starting to think
that he doesn't exist.

540
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:09,120
Maybe he only meets
people that he can help.

541
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:10,121
Mark.

542
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:13,692
I know, I know.
Positive. Positive.

543
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:17,429
That MRI tech sure
thought I was a goner.

544
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:20,432
He just runs the machine.
He can't offer a prognosis.

545
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,901
Come on. You know that
those techs can read a scan

546
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,604
better than most surgeons.

547
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:26,908
No offense.

548
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,578
Do you want to get
something to eat?

549
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,203
No. No. Nope. No.

550
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:49,445
I can't believe they
call it a tumor board.

551
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,513
Why? They discuss tumors.

552
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,515
I know, but...

553
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,317
You'd think they'd
come up with something

554
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,319
a little more esoteric.

555
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,320
Like what?

556
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:02,124
I don't know, uh, the...

557
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,248
"You're completely boned" board.

558
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,866
I heard they used to call
it the "poor bastard" board

559
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,603
but too many people
were showing up.

560
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,771
Someone told me that they tried

561
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,075
the "take me out back and
shoot me now" board for a while.

562
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,076
What, it didn't stick?

563
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,578
No, surprisingly.

564
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:23,579
Why not?

565
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:26,148
Too many letters, I guess.

566
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,039
Hm. Pity.

567
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,180
Elizabeth? Mm-hmm.

568
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,796
Will you have the
baby either way?

569
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,654
What?

570
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,923
If that man comes
out of that room

571
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:54,848
and tells me he
can't do anything...

572
00:23:56,218 --> 00:24:00,966
that there's no
way I can beat it...

573
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,556
will you still have the baby?

574
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:08,261
Yes.

575
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,661
I got a 12-year-old in 4

576
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,964
that swallowed a
pair of toenail clippers.

577
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,066
I think he's gonna
need to be scoped.

578
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,534
Are you okay? The hiccups.

579
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,702
I thought they went away.

580
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:21,736
They did.

581
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,404
Teaspoon of sugar's
supposed to help.

582
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,539
It didn't.

583
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,607
Is Luka coming back
on the 26th or the 27th?

584
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,943
26th, I think.

585
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,811
Where'd he go? Croatia?

586
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,847
Yeah, he went to visit
his dad for Christmas.

587
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,048
Yo, my moms told me

588
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,616
if you stand on your head
and swallow, hiccups gone.

589
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,617
Thanks, Malik.

590
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,286
Hey, no problem.
Works every time.

591
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,754
Did you page me, Kerry?

592
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,857
Yeah. We got a bad
dog bite in Trauma 2.

593
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,524
Little kid who might
need to be plugged

594
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,026
into some outpatient therapy.

595
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,794
Sure. Did you open it?

596
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,529
What? The present.

597
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,465
No, not yet. No.

598
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,700
I'll go with you. Okay.

599
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,935
Do you want a shot of Reglan?

600
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,103
For what?

601
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,838
Hiccups. No, they'll go away.

602
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,306
What about my toenail clippers?

603
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,508
Malucci, get him.

604
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,244
Hey. Hey.

605
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,611
You're here early.

606
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,613
I was helping
Chen with her baby.

607
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,882
Was there a problem?

608
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,783
No. Well, she
didn't have a coach.

609
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,651
You were her coach? Mm-hmm.

610
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,652
How'd you do?

611
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,355
I did fine. She had
a rough time of it.

612
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,156
Should I...? She
doesn't want visitors.

613
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,359
I'll fill you in later. I'm
gonna catch some Zs...

614
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,493
Sweet dreams.

615
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,728
Dr. Carter! They told
me you were down here.

616
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,264
She's breast-feeding!

617
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,165
She gave the baby
back after seeing him.

618
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,734
Then we talked for a while,
then we went back to the nursery.

619
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,736
Then the nurse says she
wants to see him again.

620
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,871
She wants to breast-feed!

621
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,839
Man, slow down. What?

622
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,910
The nurse has to give the baby
back to her if she asks for him.

623
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,744
So she did.

624
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,845
My wife is frantic.

625
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,033
Okay. I'll... I'll talk to her.

626
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:42,767
Is my dad coming?

627
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,136
I'm not sure.

628
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,838
Your mom went to call him.

629
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,573
Is that a problem?

630
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:50,542
He's gonna kill me.

631
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:53,078
I was gonna put it back
without him knowing.

632
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:55,313
Put what back?

633
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,015
Is Winston gonna be okay?

634
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,301
The dog?

635
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:02,170
They're not gonna put
him to sleep, are they?

636
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,022
That would be very sad.

637
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:07,025
But any dog that would
attack you for no reason...

638
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:10,383
Excuse me.

639
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,714
I didn't mean to.

640
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,738
What?

641
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:19,170
To open my
Christmas present early.

642
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:21,873
I knew what it was.

643
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:22,897
A BB gun.

644
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:29,681
Did you shoot at the dog?

645
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:32,968
I was just trying it out.

646
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,469
Why would she
need to breast-feed?

647
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,204
It's not unusual.

648
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,272
Does she still have him?

649
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,174
She's changing
her mind. I know it.

650
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,476
There's no need to panic.

651
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,644
Why did we have to
force her to meet him?

652
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,180
Linda, she's
giving up her child.

653
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,082
There's a maternal
instinct she can't avoid

654
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,616
and shouldn't try to.

655
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,985
We'll give her some time

656
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,520
and have you rock
the baby in front of her.

657
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,255
Won't that make it worse? No.

658
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,957
She needs to know
at a very basic level

659
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,225
that the baby will be loved.

660
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,626
Can you talk with her?

661
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,529
Find out what's going
on, what she's thinking?

662
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,720
Yeah, I can try.

663
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,875
I can't lose another baby.

664
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,077
Deb?

665
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,416
What are you doing?

666
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,817
You know, they say
breast-feeding is good for them

667
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,453
in the first 24 hours.

668
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,227
It's mostly colostrum, which
boosts their immune system.

669
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:32,452
Deb, are you having
second thoughts?

670
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,516
I've always had second thoughts.

671
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,852
What's changed?

672
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,855
I saw his face.

673
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,557
I'm being selfish.

674
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,692
I have the money to raise him.

675
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:50,362
There's no reason why I can't.

676
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:52,364
There's a couple out there

677
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:55,388
who desperately
want to raise a child.

678
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:01,595
And you're giving
them a great gift.

679
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,511
What happens...

680
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:08,013
18 years from now?

681
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:11,282
He shows up looking
for an explanation.

682
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:13,118
Well, you tell him
the truth, you know?

683
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:14,785
You tell him that
you wanted to provide

684
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:17,811
the best home possible for him.

685
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:23,561
Do I tell him I was a coward?

686
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,796
That my bigoted parents

687
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,870
were more important
to me than he was?

688
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,484
Deb, I think that you gotta

689
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,924
take your family out of this.

690
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:35,996
Now, if you wanna keep
the baby, keep the baby.

691
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,512
But if you don't, or you can't,

692
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:42,714
then you wanna make sure
that he goes to somebody

693
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:45,967
who's gonna love him,
who's gonna want him.

694
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,839
And know that you're
not abandoning your baby.

695
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:53,296
You're creating a family.

696
00:28:58,704 --> 00:28:59,731
<i>Did you find it?</i>

697
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:00,865
Four blocks away

698
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:03,034
with a burned-out clutch
and a busted headlight.

699
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,168
You lucked out.

700
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:06,037
They could have
completely stripped it.

701
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:07,972
Hello, Peter? My car
wasn't stolen by a thief

702
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,941
who doesn't know
how to drive a stick.

703
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,460
Kynesha and her friend
took the car out for a joyride.

704
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,546
What? I gave Kynesha's
friend a ride home myself.

705
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,331
Just Kynesha, then.

706
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,582
She's the one that called you.

707
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,534
So she's not
completely stupid. Cleo...

708
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,903
Get her in here now.
I wanna talk to her.

709
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,304
Why don't we just...?

710
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,473
Get her in here, or I'll
have the police talk to her.

711
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,777
Cleo, I...

712
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,012
Excuse me. Are you Dr. Benton?

713
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,180
Yeah.

714
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,349
I'm Melissa Walker.
You found my daughter.

715
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,416
She's in Radiology.

716
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,585
We just wanted to
get an x-ray of her foot.

717
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,037
Oh, God! It's nothing serious.

718
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,639
We just wanted to
rule out a fracture.

719
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:41,656
She has three stitches.

720
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,657
Did she fight you?

721
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,776
She's afraid of hospitals.

722
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,612
Yeah.

723
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:49,870
You know, um...

724
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:56,721
I think it might be more
than just the needles.

725
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:57,923
The leukapheresis requires

726
00:29:57,947 --> 00:30:00,542
a big one in each
arm for five hours.

727
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,644
Taylor feels the only
reason you had her

728
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,434
was to help Nicole.

729
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,582
We love both of our daughters.

730
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:08,583
Of course you do.

731
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,084
If you had a child
dying of leukemia

732
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,653
and there was no
bone-marrow match,

733
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:12,804
what would you do?

734
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:14,972
We were planning to
have more children anyway,

735
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:16,958
but I am so tired of
having to explain this

736
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,360
like we did something wrong.

737
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,278
I was just telling you
that Taylor feels...

738
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,813
I know. She's my daughter.

739
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,882
And I love her,
okay? I love her.

740
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,033
Now, where is X-ray?

741
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,234
Mrs. Walker, I was just...

742
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,903
Where is X-ray?

743
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:30,305
Down the main hall to the right.

744
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,395
Thank you.

745
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,037
Hi.

746
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,261
Hi. Hi.

747
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:51,142
What's his name?

748
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,382
Michael. Michael Alexander.

749
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,070
Hey, Michael.

750
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:10,928
It's okay.

751
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,318
Shh. Shh. Shh.

I may go to trial.

762
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,087
Thought you were gonna settle.

763
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:11,288
Yeah, so did I.

764
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:12,556
Rachel called.

765
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,026
She wants to come out
a day early for Christmas.

766
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,794
Mark Greene?

767
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:18,596
Dr. Burke. Nice to meet you.

768
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,982
You too. And you are?

769
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,950
Dr. Elizabeth Corday,
Dr. Greene's fiancée.

770
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,885
Oh, congratulations. Thank you.

771
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,086
Sorry to keep you waiting.

772
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,989
I met some resistance
in tumor board.

773
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,858
Is that good or bad?

774
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,526
The oncologists and
radiation therapists

775
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,113
are having trouble
embracing the future.

776
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:36,337
Meaning?

777
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,366
Come over here.

778
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,600
They see a lesion like yours,

779
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,504
they jump to the
conclusion it's inoperable.

780
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:43,905
But it's not?

781
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,875
Not in my hands.

782
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,977
There's your tumor.

783
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,946
Now, as you were
doing verbal tasks,

784
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,215
there was increased blood
flow to language centers.

785
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,117
Those light up in orange.

786
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,352
As you can see,

787
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,620
while the tumor's
adjacent to Broca's,

788
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,022
it hasn't invaded yet.

789
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:04,643
That's not what the
neurosurgeon in Chicago said.

790
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,144
That's why you're here.

791
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,079
So you'll operate?

792
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:12,050
Mm. Yeah. We'll do
an awake craniotomy.

793
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,718
You'll be conscious and talking

794
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,954
while I map out Broca's
and resect the tumor,

795
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:18,623
but the real bonus
is my ability to insert

796
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:21,710
high-dosage chemotherapy
wafers into the tumor cavity

797
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,979
and use the malignant
cells themselves

798
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,915
to create a cancer vaccine.

799
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,150
Thank God for
second opinions. Yeah.

800
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,851
Those idiots on the tumor board

801
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,154
are satisfied with
12-month survival,

802
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,523
where most of the
patients on my protocol

803
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:39,816
are disease-free for
24 months and counting.

804
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,854
So when can you fit
him into the schedule?

805
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,671
How about December 31?

806
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,896
You can ring in the new
year with a load off your mind.

807
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,011
Brain-surgeon humor.

808
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,314
Right.

809
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,781
You okay?

810
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,883
Yeah, sure.

811
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,202
It's good news.

812
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:05,691
It's very good news.

813
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,600
You came to the
right place, Mark.

814
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,262
Dr. Carter! Wake up, Dr. Carter.

815
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,097
Multivictim MVA coming in.

816
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:34,399
Hell's Angel versus a minivan.

817
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:35,400
What?

818
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:37,468
Motorcycle hit a
minivan. Let's go.

819
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,487
Fortyish-year-old male,
closed head trauma.

820
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,554
Altered at the scene.

821
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,722
No helmet?

822
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,491
You kidding? This
moron was driving a hog

823
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,125
in the middle of winter.

824
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,126
Lost the IV.

825
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,628
Put another one in.

826
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,831
Cut the Gap collection off
him, get him on a monitor.

827
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,549
Ugh. Scissors can't
cut through this.

828
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:52,883
Use wire cutters.

829
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,769
Pupils are poorly reactive.

830
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,172
Check this out. This
ain't his first crash.

831
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,174
He's got brain
fluid in the right ear.

832
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:01,009
Let's get him in line for a CT.

833
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,743
That's a nasty scar.

834
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,995
That probably explains this.

835
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,731
Vicodin for pain, Hyzaar
for high blood pressure,

836
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:08,316
Lipitor for cholesterol. Yeah.

837
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,685
I've heard Hell's Angels
are on a pretty good diet.

838
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:11,770
Carter, Weaver needs you.

839
00:35:11,794 --> 00:35:12,771
It wasn't a minivan,

840
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:13,905
it was a "van" van.

841
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:15,006
About a dozen kids got hurt

842
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,074
on the way to a
Christmas pageant.

843
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:18,777
Okay, I'll be right there.

844
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:22,113
Yeah, but that's why I wanted
to handle this thing in person.

845
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:24,282
Peter, she's not
your responsibility.

846
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,417
I know that, Cleo, but...

847
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,753
Look, I don't want
her bothering Jackie.

848
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:30,521
I just, I don't want...

849
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,278
Kynesha?

850
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,414
I'm sorry, Dr. Finch.

851
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:44,385
I didn't take your car,
but I think Tiny did.

852
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:47,388
Your keys was
missing, so I lied to you.

853
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,852
I was afraid you was
gonna kick me out!

854
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:53,917
I don't have nowhere to go.

855
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:58,421
Okay. Hank, can you
press against my hand?

856
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,703
Is my mom all right?

857
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,805
Abby, have you
seen this guy's mom?

858
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,306
Weaver has her.
Seat-belt injury.

859
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,875
CBC and UA here.

860
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:08,876
Dr. Carter!

861
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,177
What do you got? Be right back.

862
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,580
Nine-year-old MVA. Head
lac from broken glass. No LOC.

863
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,214
150 of saline in the field.

864
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,250
Open tib-fib
fracture on the right.

865
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,752
Hi, sweetheart.
What's your name?

866
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:18,953
Elise.

867
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,022
Elise? Does your neck hurt?

868
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,006
Yes.

869
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,609
Okay, let's go to Trauma 2.

870
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:25,977
What kind of costume is that?

871
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:27,211
Milkmaid.

872
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,264
What? Milkmaid.

873
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,832
You mean like "The
Twelve Days of Christmas."

874
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,816
We're missing our play.

875
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,553
What is this guy
still doing in here?

876
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:38,389
Oh, CT just called for him.
They had a code on the table.

877
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,909
Take her to Curtain 3 until
this room is cleared out.

878
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,944
Come on. CBC,
C-spine, right tib-fib,

879
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,697
5 of MS for the
pain, a gram of Ancef.

880
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:49,155
Don't worry, Elise, everything
is gonna be fine, sweetheart.

881
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,861
Oh, God.

882
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:10,254
Hold still. You
have to let me look.

883
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:11,922
It hurts!

884
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:14,458
I know. I know.

885
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,459
What do you got?

886
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,560
Three more from the van.

887
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:18,496
This is Eddie.
Cracked his collarbone.

888
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,264
Right with you. Yeah?
Hyper number one.

889
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:21,832
Seat-belted in,
no obvious trauma,

890
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,134
complains of belly pain.

891
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,986
Give these to Dori in Curtain 3.

892
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,088
Take him to Curtain 2.
Give me a set of vitals.

893
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:30,557
I already did. BP,
110 over 70. Pulse, 90.

894
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,558
What?

895
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,561
BP, 110 over 70. Pulse, 90.

896
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,997
Whoa! Slow down. Sorry.

897
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,197
You all right? Yeah.

898
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,005
Kids in Exam 4 need
their necks cleared.

899
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,584
Come on. Come on!

900
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:20,157
Does it need stitches?

901
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,659
I don't know. I
have to get an x-ray,

902
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:23,928
make sure there's no
broken glass in there.

903
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:25,763
Is my mom coming?

904
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:27,164
I need to talk to
you. Just a sec.

905
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,466
Now. Is my mom coming?

906
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,635
Yeah, somebody called her.

907
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:32,870
Here, can you hold this for me?

908
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,572
And press down,
but don't make it hurt.

909
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:37,130
Lindsay, can you? Yeah.

910
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:42,113
What?

911
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,313
I took two Vicodin.

912
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:44,314
What?

913
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:46,316
I took two Vicodin. I...

914
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,185
Then I panicked and
ran in the bathroom

915
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,586
stuck my fingers down my throat.

916
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,356
You vomited them up?

917
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,357
How'd you sign 'em out?

918
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:54,558
I didn't. I didn't.

919
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,094
This biker comes
in with a full bottle.

920
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:58,729
Well, good. You
didn't actually...

921
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,330
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

922
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:01,732
I didn't plan on taking anything

923
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,000
I just saw them, and I...

924
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:04,924
It's okay.

925
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,128
Are you gonna tell Weaver?

926
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:11,709
I can't.

927
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:14,011
I think you have to.

928
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,047
Well, then, I'm done.

929
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:20,184
I mean, best-case
scenario, I'm back in Atlanta.

930
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:22,619
I mean, does it count? It
was never in my system.

931
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:24,254
All right, I'm off
in 10 minutes.

932
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,891
Let's go to a meeting.

933
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:27,892
I just started.

934
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:29,493
Well, you're sick. You threw up.

935
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:30,861
Tell Weaver you have to go home.

936
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,396
You have to be
on death's door...

937
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,754
Go convince her.

938
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:44,975
<i>♪ Oh, the weather
outside Is frightful ♪</i>

939
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:47,044
So you'll tell Rachel
and Jen now?

940
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:50,214
Yeah, I'll fly out there Friday.

941
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:51,949
You like it?

942
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:52,950
What?

943
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:53,951
The pizza.

944
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,686
Mm.

945
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:59,156
It tastes just like it did
when I was 8 years old.

946
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,660
It's weird how that works.

947
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,694
I wouldn't have been
able to remember

948
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:05,529
it if I hadn't tasted it again.

949
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,431
It's good, though.

950
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,099
You lived in New York?

951
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,669
Couple of months.

952
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:15,506
Dad taught me how to
skate backwards on this rink.

953
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,974
You never told me that.

954
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,043
You never came to
see me play hockey.

955
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,313
No, that you lived here, I mean.

956
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,815
Well, I can't tell
you everything.

957
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,317
I have to keep you interested.

958
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:31,888
You didn't sign
up for this, though.

959
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,057
It's called marriage, Mark.

960
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,126
We're not married yet.

961
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,384
You really believe that?

962
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:41,854
Didn't think so.

963
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:45,436
Hey, check it out.

964
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,773
There's a kid in another
one of those hats.

965
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:50,408
They must be on sale someplace.

966
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,411
Guess it blows your theory.

967
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:55,100
Yeah.

968
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,850
It was a good day.

969
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,086
<i>♪ But if you really
Grab me tight ♪</i>

970
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,707
<i>♪ All the way
home I'll be warm ♪</i>

971
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:07,708
Hey, Malucci!

972
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,009
I'll catch you later, chief.

973
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,245
Carter went home
sick. I need you to stay.

974
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,313
Come on, chief!

975
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,848
It's part of being a resident.

976
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:16,601
He's just tired. He stayed
up all day with Chen.

977
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,368
All the more reason
for you to lend a hand.

978
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,870
I just need you for
four more hours.

979
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,873
Damn these hiccups.

980
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,676
Okay, I got an 85-year-old
with abdominal pain,

981
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,877
headache and dizziness.

982
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,278
This sucks, man! Yeah, it does.

983
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,637
I saw the patient in 7.

984
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:40,407
She agreed to a
voluntary admission.

985
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,431
Thank you.

986
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:44,600
Hiccups.

987
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,947
Does it work?

988
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,415
I don't know. I'm desperate.

989
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,784
Now I'm listening to Randi.

990
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,836
Did you like it?

991
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,604
Yes.

992
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:57,107
First edition.

993
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,775
Must have been expensive.

994
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,778
Well, what's the point
of working like a maniac

995
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:02,452
if you can't spend
money on friends?

996
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:05,804
Friends.

997
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:09,437
I don't think we're in
the same place on this.

998
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,272
On what, Christmas?

999
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:12,745
No. Us.

1000
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,360
I don't need any more friends.

1001
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:18,128
Oh.

1002
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:21,632
Okay. Okay.

1003
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:23,034
I understand.

1004
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:24,619
Do you?

1005
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,386
No. No. I like you
and I respect you,

1006
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,623
and I thought we
were really hitting it off.

1007
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:32,376
That's the problem.
You're straight, and I'm not.

1008
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,311
And I've done this before.

1009
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:36,881
It didn't work out, and I
am not gonna do it again.

1010
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:38,648
But I'm not asking
for that from you.

1011
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:40,935
We're comfortable together,
we have a lot in common,

1012
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,842
we have fun together...

1013
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:54,620
That's why I can't
be your friend, Kerry.

1014
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:04,074
You want me to get that?

1015
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:06,266
Yeah, could you?

1016
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:12,049
Room 914.

1017
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:16,053
Yes. Hold on.

1018
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:18,110
It's your mother.

1019
00:43:20,148 --> 00:43:23,394
She's sleeping right now.
Can I take a message?

1020
00:43:23,418 --> 00:43:27,186
I don't know. Okay.

1021
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,667
She wants you to call her.

1022
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,636
Put a "do not
disturb" on the phone.

1023
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,637
Sure.

1024
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,494
Thank you.
