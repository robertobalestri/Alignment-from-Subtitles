1
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,304
Did you catch her?

2
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,705
Oh, yes. I caught her.

3
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,607
But once she starts
writing, she can't stop.

4
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,908
Heaven forbid.

5
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,211
I should have jammed that
pen into her carotid artery.

6
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,747
Mm. I think they double
the fine once you draw blood.

7
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,484
You need a building
with guest parking.

8
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,152
Take my spot.

9
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,775
I don't want your spot.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,924
Damn!

11
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,193
What?

12
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,217
No milk.

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,263
Want some of mine?

14
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,166
A grown man, you put
an empty milk carton

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,350
back into the refrigerator.

16
00:00:57,374 --> 00:00:59,357
It's not empty.

17
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,440
Now it's empty.

18
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,875
Not that it chills anything

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,000
cooler than room
temperature anyway.

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,246
It's just a parking ticket.

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,681
It's not just the ticket.

22
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,316
It's that had to go
chasing down there

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,085
half-dressed with my hair wet.

24
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,937
I said I'd go. But
you didn't, did you?

25
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,405
You didn't give me a chance.

26
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:19,472
You weren't fast enough!

27
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:22,709
I'll pay the ticket. Okay?

28
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,477
Calm down.

29
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,200
I paid the other ones.

30
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:32,373
What?

31
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:37,290
Let's just say it
wasn't your first ticket.

32
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:40,127
You stole parking
tickets off my windshield?

33
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:42,129
Just two. And paid
without telling me?

34
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:44,948
Well, I was trying
to avoid... this.

35
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,633
Well, that's it then. I'm
not staying here anymore.

36
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:48,768
Here we go.

37
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,204
Every faucet leaks.
Your toilet actually rocks.

38
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:52,272
I kinda like that.

39
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,174
There are creatures
scurrying in the walls.

40
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,909
Do you know what scurries
about in walls, Mark?

41
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,066
Bunnies?

42
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:02,315
Do you wanna take the
El train, or shall we drive?

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,858
Hey, is this the AA meeting?

44
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,159
How'd you guess?

45
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:15,028
I'm Brant. What's your
name? Hi, I'm John.

46
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,780
Ah, thanks, John. Welcome.

47
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,049
To believe a power
greater than ourselves

48
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,085
could restore us to sanity.

49
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,255
Step Three: Made a
decision to turn our will...

50
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,256
It's a lot of coffee.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,391
This is backup.

52
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,227
First time? Here? Yeah.

53
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,861
It's a good group.

54
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,565
A searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves.

55
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,001
Step Five: Admitted
to God, to ourselves,

56
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,294
and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs.

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,043
Step Six: Were entirely
ready to have God

58
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,230
remove all of these
defects of character.

59
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:54,950
Step Seven: Humbly asked
him to remove our shortcomings.

60
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,873
Step Eight: Made a list of all
persons whom we have harmed

61
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:03,309
and became willing to
make amends to them all.

62
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,695
Step Nine: Made direct amends

63
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,730
to such people wherever possible

64
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,700
except when to do so
would harm them or others.

65
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,921
Doc, can you take this
guy? He is driving me crazy.

66
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,622
Same here. Oh, no.

67
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,657
Shunt's clotted.

68
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,325
He missed his
dialysis appointment.

69
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,795
Mr. Fletcher, only
one day late, huh?

70
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,830
You? No, not you. You know him?

71
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,198
Yeah, he's one of our favorites.

72
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:20,103
Hey, Cleo? Can you, uh,
take Mr. Fletcher, please?

73
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,038
I see you called 911 again.

74
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,357
They're faster
than the El train.

75
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,725
My arm stopped buzzing.

76
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,360
No thrill, no bruit.

77
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,683
Talk English.

78
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,330
Mark, ready?

79
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,499
In a second.

80
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,833
Raise your right foot.

81
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,918
I can't.

82
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,469
I don't want to
keep him waiting.

83
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,625
I'll be right there.

84
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,494
Okay.

85
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,525
Have you started
teaching rounds?

86
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,127
No. The residents
are waiting in ICU.

87
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,361
All right, I'll be there.

88
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,897
And you need to schedule
the Surgical Service meeting.

89
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,599
Tomorrow. You have a mastectomy.

90
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,600
Well, whenever.

91
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,668
Dr. Benton.

92
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,788
Hey, Carter. What
are you doing here?

93
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,056
I have a meeting.

94
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,824
Oh, right. Hi, Shirley.

95
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:58,825
Hi, Dr. Carter.

96
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,059
I need you to sign off

97
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,345
on last month's O.R.
expenditure report.

98
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,346
I've never done that.

99
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,547
You do now. I take care of it.

100
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,488
You just sign it.

101
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,418
Suit yourself. I need it by 4.

102
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,175
It's good to see you, Carter.

103
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,346
Important Attending stuff?

104
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,494
Oh, yeah, well. Congratulations.

105
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,214
Thanks. Ah, man, you look good.

106
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,551
Well, couldn't look much worse
than the last time you saw me.

107
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,335
He's gotten big.

108
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,354
Yeah.

109
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:28,755
Hi, Reece.

110
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,329
Hey.

111
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,365
Well, hey, you're in a hurry.

112
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,865
Yeah. Um, I'll see
you later, all right?

113
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,201
I don't know. Maybe. We'll see.

114
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,758
Ah, good luck, Carter.

115
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,091
<i>When does he wanna start?</i>

116
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,126
As soon as possible.

117
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,527
I don't think
that's a good idea.

118
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,830
62-year-old female,
slurred speech,

119
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,397
also weak grip
in her right hand.

120
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,633
Any history of stroke?

121
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,200
Yes. A lacunar infarct.

122
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,568
She got much worse this morning.

123
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,837
He's eager to get back to work.

124
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,338
So we just throw
him in the deep end?

125
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,773
No. Of course not.

126
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,375
We'll start him on half-shifts,
limited responsibilities.

127
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,244
In the same place
where he started using.

128
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,046
Mark, he's doing the
program every day.

129
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,649
Good. Make him take
time. He can afford it.

130
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,717
Okay. We'll
monitor his progress,

131
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,120
and if he gets into
trouble, we'll just cut back.

132
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,989
If he gets into
trouble, it's too late.

133
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,056
Please, somebody!

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,825
What is it? I'm
having contractions!

135
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,727
Are you pregnant? Only 22 weeks.

136
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,762
Come here. Try to relax, okay?

137
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,285
Here, you're gonna sit down.

138
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,123
Sit here. Wait one second, okay?

139
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,639
Dr. Chen, I need you
over here. No, now.

140
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,640
How did you get here?

141
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,675
Taxi. I was shopping downtown.

142
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,644
What is it? She's
having contractions.

143
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,778
How far along are you?

144
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,747
Twenty-two weeks.
Oh, that's too early.

145
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,448
You're probably
having what are called

146
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,250
Braxton Hicks contractions.

147
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,887
They're coming
every three minutes.

148
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,522
Get a gurney,
clear a trauma room,

149
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,857
start an IV and call OB. Okay.

150
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,325
What's your name? Regina.

151
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,193
Okay, Regina, don't push.

152
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:02,482
Whatever you do,
don't push. Okay?

153
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,068
How much?

154
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,202
Four, almost 5.

155
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,236
No, that can't be right.

156
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,905
I was 4 centimeters
two hours ago.

157
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,906
You're doing fine.

158
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,542
Can Dr. Coburn take a look?

159
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,643
She was called in
to do a C-section.

160
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,628
How long will that take?

161
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,229
We have plenty of time.

162
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,031
Why don't we roll
you back on your side

163
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:20,588
and get you more comfortable.

164
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,387
Abby, they need
someone downstairs.

165
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,388
Where?

166
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,723
ER. They have a preterm labor.

167
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,758
Get a resident.

168
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,310
Simons and Perry are delivering.

169
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,512
Lift your leg. Where's Dana?

170
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,481
She's on break. Not
back for another five.

171
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,182
You're not leaving, are you?

172
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,354
It sounded urgent.

173
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,353
Do you know where you are?

174
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,659
Let the doctor
check you out first.

175
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:47,676
What did she say?

176
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,678
She wants to go home.

177
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,862
Pulse ox is 92.

178
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,050
She's in A-fib.

179
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,352
It probably triggered
the new stroke.

180
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,921
Do you provide 24-hour care?

181
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,322
Yes.

182
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,790
Does she have any family?

183
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,492
No. Not that she's
in contact with.

184
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,627
Connie, call Psych.

185
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,651
Psych?

186
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,714
After this stoke, she
might not be competent

187
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,689
to make her own
medical decisions.

188
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,307
Preterm labor? Next door.

189
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,561
EKG, Chem-7, UA, culture
urine, blood and sputum.

190
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,496
Your husband's on his way, okay?

191
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,497
Okay. How far along?

192
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:25,698
Twenty-two weeks.

193
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's hope it's a couple more.

194
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:29,268
Stop it. Please, stop it!

195
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,269
Where's the resident?

196
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,738
You got me instead.

197
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,007
Membranes are intact,
but she's fully effaced

198
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,075
and dilated to 6 centimeters.

199
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,244
Can you stop it?

200
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,846
What's...? What's
her name? Regina.

201
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,581
Regina, did you
have any ultrasounds

202
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,682
during your pregnancy?

203
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:43,716
About a month ago.

204
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,284
My doctor said
everything was okay.

205
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:46,302
Who's your doctor?

206
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,171
He's in Indianapolis.

207
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,005
Why is this happening?

208
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,609
Sometimes women go into
preterm labor for no apparent reason.

209
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,312
I shouldn't have come. I
should have stayed home.

210
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,566
This is not your
fault. This happens.

211
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,434
Giving you medicine
to stop contractions.

212
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,437
Your membranes haven't
ruptured yet, which is a good sign.

213
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,039
We're giving you something to
help your baby's lungs mature.

214
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,691
Oh, no! I feel pressure.

215
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,462
Strong contraction.

216
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,164
She's leaking amniotic fluid.

217
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,715
Make them stop. It's too early.

218
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,450
Two grams of amp.

219
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,370
Get a baby warmer in here.

220
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,510
No! It's too early!

221
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,499
Random urine tests.

222
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:34,722
Yes.

223
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,721
And I get to pay
for them too, I see.

224
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,023
Is that a problem?

225
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,829
No.

226
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:45,044
In addition to the
state meetings

227
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,914
we'll require 90
NA or AA meetings

228
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:49,615
during the first 90 days.

229
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,035
That's not a problem.
I'm going anyway.

230
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,302
Good. Good.

231
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,988
And the three of us
will meet once a week

232
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,122
just to, you know, check in.

233
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:59,475
Make sure you're
handling the stress.

234
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,499
Okay.

235
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,219
I came prepared.

236
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,883
The naltrexone
binds to your opiate...

237
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,322
I know what it does.

238
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,957
It protects you. It blocks
the euphoric effects.

239
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,731
It protects all of us.

240
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,483
You need to, uh, begin today

241
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,940
if you wanna begin
work next week.

242
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:34,911
You want me to
take it in front of you?

243
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,503
Yeah, we'll periodically
monitor your regimen.

244
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,751
How much?

245
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,674
Fifty milligrams a day.

246
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,599
Sorry. That was, um...

247
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,634
It's okay.

248
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,085
It's gonna be
difficult at first.

249
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:01,149
So we'll work it out.

250
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:06,158
All right. So we'll put you on
the schedule for next week.

251
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,728
Tuesday. Start out very light.

252
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,779
No trauma.

253
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,447
Whatever you say.

254
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,616
Kerry, I gotta go. Yeah.

255
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,452
See you next week,
Carter. Welcome back.

256
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,175
Thank you.

257
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,206
Thank you both.

258
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,963
Sure thing.

259
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,751
Baby's cephalic. Normal anatomy.

260
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,752
Progressed to 8.

261
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,554
Oh, God, please stop it.

262
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,555
Father's here.

263
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,490
Regina, wh...? What happened?

264
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,292
I was at the mall.
It started hurting.

265
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:41,978
I... I didn't know what to do.

266
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,896
Is she in labor? Yes.

267
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,164
My water broke.

268
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:48,267
Her OB confirms previous
ultrasounds put her at 21 weeks.

269
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,852
That's way too soon, right?

270
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,220
She's got rales.

271
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,905
Pulmonary edema.
No more terbutaline.

272
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,306
What...? What's wrong?

273
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,707
The medication we're giving you

274
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,509
is causing your
lungs to fill with fluid.

275
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,945
I don't care. Stop
the contractions.

276
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,063
I can't have this baby.

277
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,700
Okay, I'll try 50
mgs of indomethacin.

278
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,724
If the baby's born
now, can it survive?

279
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,369
Joseph, it's coming!

280
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,671
The baby's crowning.

281
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,007
Regina, you're gonna
deliver this baby.

282
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,008
No! No!

283
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,594
Yes. There's nothing
else we can do.

284
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,629
What have we got?
Preemie. Under 22 weeks.

285
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,030
Okay. Regina, go ahead and push.

286
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,798
No! No!

287
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,718
You okay there, Dr. Chen? Mm-hm.

288
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,187
The head's out. Whoa.

289
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,388
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

290
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,973
It's a boy. Is he breathing?

291
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,841
Yes, he's breathing.

292
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:31,010
Can someone...? Can
someone please help me?

293
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,028
You okay?

294
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,295
Dilute it in 1000 cc's,

295
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,597
100 drops per minute.

296
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,498
I don't hear
anything. Is he alive?

297
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,633
Yes.

298
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,757
Let's get a weight.

299
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,171
He's so little.

300
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,040
BP, 100/60.

301
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,542
Okay. Let's give
the mom 40 of Lasix.

302
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,743
Take her temp.

303
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,636
Please save him.
Please save my baby.

304
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,863
You're doing charts?

305
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,499
Yeah, I needed to catch up.

306
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:12,668
Um... Look, I-I'm
really sorry about, um...

307
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,258
With the baby.

308
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,222
It's all right.

309
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,074
Our reactions can
surprise us sometimes.

310
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,466
But you need to go back in
there and manage your patient.

311
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,131
Um... I can't.

312
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,333
Jing-Mei, you should know
you're being considered

313
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,051
for chief resident next year.

314
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,677
People need to be able to
look to you for leadership.

315
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,832
I'm pregnant.

316
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,298
I... I didn't know what to do,

317
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:48,308
and then eight weeks
became 12, and 12 became 20.

318
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,575
So you're... You're
20 weeks pregnant?

319
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,231
Twenty-two.

320
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,333
You know, that baby
was the size of mine.

321
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:02,990
Oh, sweetie...

322
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:09,546
Why did you wait
so long to tell me?

323
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,881
My parents are gonna kill me.

324
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,648
You should go home. No.

325
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:19,001
Go home. I'll cover
the rest of your shift.

326
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,205
We'll work out your
schedule tomorrow.

327
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,829
Okay.

328
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,645
Good.

329
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:31,797
Oh. Not fair. Not
in the workplace.

330
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,900
I found a soft spot.
I'm going to exploit it.

331
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,267
I'll exploit you. Mm-hm.

332
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,636
You know I will. Bring it on.

333
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,737
Time and place.

334
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,505
Clotted-off fistula
needs a new shunt.

335
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:41,874
Renal failure?

336
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,709
Missed his dialysis.

337
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,077
Mr. Fletcher? Who else?

338
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,178
Give him to somebody else.

339
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:47,380
I got stuck with him.

340
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:49,665
Last time, the man
yelled in my stethoscope.

341
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,600
And he grabbed
my ass. Suck it up.

342
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,136
Uh-uh. Come on. Be a man.

343
00:14:58,214 --> 00:14:59,892
That's not right.
Oh, you're crying?

344
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,449
That's not right.

345
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,328
You guys got a baby?

346
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,797
Twenty-two-week preemie.

347
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,798
Still breathing?

348
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,232
For now. Oh, man.

349
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,852
What took you so long?
I need to take a dump.

350
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,196
It's good to see you
too, Mr. Fletcher.

351
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:13,873
Is he hypothermic? Yeah.

352
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:14,974
Okay. Order another lamp.

353
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,330
It's on its way down.

354
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,816
What's his pulse?

355
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,439
Down to 90.

356
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,321
This is some heated saline

357
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,947
to keep him warm
while you hold him.

358
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,012
Did your husband leave?

359
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,965
He went to call a priest.

360
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:41,922
We wanna baptize our baby.

361
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,205
Well, there's a priest
on call with the hospital,

362
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,024
unless you had
someone specific in mind.

363
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:52,461
No, we're just in
town for a few days.

364
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:57,471
My doctor said I could travel
during my second trimester.

365
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,104
Well, Regina, this probably
would have happened

366
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,207
whether you were
traveling or not.

367
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,310
We tried for, um,

368
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,331
almost two years to get
pregnant and finally gave up.

369
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:16,023
And then suddenly, I was.

370
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:21,612
Look at him. He's hanging on.

371
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:28,347
I counted 10 little
fingers and 10 little toes.

372
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:31,205
He looks perfect.

373
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:36,160
He's just a little small.

374
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,912
Even if your baby
was a few weeks older

375
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,847
and somehow
managed to survive...

376
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:49,785
I know that that's what you say
because that's what you've seen,

377
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,811
but maybe he's
meant to be a miracle.

378
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,848
Sometimes you have
to help a miracle along.

379
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,433
And sometimes
you have to let go.

380
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,600
What took so long?

381
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,369
They had eight of us
in a holding pattern.

382
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,370
Are we still in Trauma 1?

383
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,394
Yeah, sure.

384
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,908
How bad is it?

385
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,411
I'm not sure I should
discuss this with you.

386
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,745
Why?

387
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,247
I can't share
medical information

388
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,199
with anyone but a family member.

389
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:21,701
Glenda and I are family.

390
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,002
I thought you were her nurse.

391
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:25,209
No, I'm, uh...

392
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,709
We're partners.

393
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,266
Oh. Right.

394
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,937
We should sit down.

395
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:42,955
Hey.

396
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,690
You're safe. I've had my coffee.

397
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,658
Good. How about a date tonight?

398
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,094
Sure. As long as
it's at my place.

399
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:49,595
I was thinking
the going-out kind.

400
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,696
We're going out Friday.

401
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,564
Yeah, I moved up a reservation.

402
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:53,565
What reservation?

403
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:54,934
It's a surprise.

404
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,935
Look, Mark, I'm fine.

405
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,137
I just had an
episode this morning.

406
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,638
I know. I know. I'm used to 'em.

407
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,241
Six o'clock. Trust me.
You'll like the place.

408
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:05,310
By the way, your patient has
an abscess around L4 and L5.

409
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,578
Who? Patterson.

410
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:08,914
I was in Radiology
when they flagged his film.

411
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,315
Suddenly bored? What?

412
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,834
Poaching my patients?

413
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,902
There can be some improvement

414
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,205
in the first 24
hours after a stroke.

415
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,542
But in Glenda's case, I'm afraid
there's too much brain damage.

416
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,709
So she'll never recover.

417
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,044
Maybe slightly.

418
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,078
Dr. Kovac?

419
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,863
Her sats are dropping to 86.

420
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,164
Glenda? Yes.

421
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,232
What does that mean?

422
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,468
She's not getting enough oxygen.

423
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,205
Eight ET tube, 10 cc syringe.

424
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:36,909
BP's 110/90. Pulse is 110.

425
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,877
Put her on a 100%
non-rebreather.

426
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,546
This your patient?

427
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,181
Large CVA with
dense hemiparesis.

428
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,118
Chest x-ray shows an
aspiration pneumonia.

429
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:48,704
Ma'am, we may have to
put a tube down your throat

430
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,728
to help you breathe.

431
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,459
Do you know where you are?

432
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:55,060
Psych note says
she's not competent.

433
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:56,295
I think she's just confused.

434
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,896
Does she have an
advance directive?

435
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,897
What do you mean?

436
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,432
Like a "Do Not
Resuscitate" order.

437
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:03,001
I don't think she'd wanna
be put on a ventilator.

438
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,254
Suction. I'll put
in an oral airway.

439
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,589
Are you a family member?

440
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,424
No, she's her...

441
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,898
They're together.

442
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,312
Do you have power of attorney?

443
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:15,231
No, I guess I should,
but we didn't do that.

444
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,599
Sats are climbing.

445
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,068
Okay, let's keep her
on 50 liters by mask.

446
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,753
She's okay? For now.

447
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:24,490
But if the pneumonia progresses
we'll have to intubate her

448
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:28,293
unless a family
member directs us not to.

449
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:30,045
Or a spouse?

450
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,735
One recognized by law.

451
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,872
Can you do it by phone?

452
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:40,973
Yes.

453
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:43,931
Yes, if you can verify
an out-of-town relative.

454
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:47,763
She has a brother in Houston.

455
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,964
I've never seen one so small.

456
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,166
You can practically
hold it in one hand.

457
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,469
I delivered a 700-gram
baby in med school.

458
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,703
Had a brain-bleed.

459
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,871
I don't even wanna look.

460
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,006
Randi, can you page
the chaplain on call?

461
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,742
I did. The baby's
father already asked.

462
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,310
He's gonna be a few hours.

463
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,678
Well, we don't have a few hours.

464
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,045
He needs to get here.

465
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,349
Well, he's helping talk down
a jumper from a bridge. I...

466
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,117
Okay. Then start
calling parishes

467
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,253
till you can find someone
who can get over here.

468
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,721
You want me to
cold-call priests?

469
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,556
Yes. Now, please.

470
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,658
Okay.

471
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,059
No, I just need the
coags. Dr. Benton?

472
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,663
I don't care what the computer
says, I'm trying to pre-op him.

473
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,097
Is this about Mr. Fletcher?

474
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,400
Tell you what, when they're
ready, page me, all right?

475
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,834
Thank you.

476
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,836
Maureen Conway,
Financial Services.

477
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,705
We can't admit Mr. Fletcher.

478
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,872
Why not? He's got Medicare.

479
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,841
Which he sold to a bankrupt HMO.

480
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,176
Come on, that's not his fault.

481
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,779
True. But in nine months,
Mr. Fletcher has run up

482
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:40,382
over $200,000 in avoidable
unrecouped charges.

483
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,050
He needs a new dialysis shunt.

484
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,920
Dr. Romano left strict orders
not to admit these patients.

485
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,122
Now, you can stabilize in
the ER, and then transfer.

486
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

487
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,892
Do you have an M.D.
behind your name? No.

488
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,529
Yet you're gonna try to tell
me how to treat my patients?

489
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,231
I've got a pheochromocytoma,
53-year-old male.

490
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,567
How do you suggest I treat him?

491
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,569
Do whatever you think
is medically necessary.

492
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,504
But we won't admit Mr. Fletcher.

493
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:06,542
Now, if you have any concerns,
take them up with Dr. Romano.

494
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,593
We took Regina
to get cleaned up.

495
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,496
Believe it or not,
a shower can help.

496
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,398
She did everything right.

497
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:15,567
She read that damn
<i>Expecting</i> book every day.

498
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:18,837
Well, it's important that
she knows it's not her fault.

499
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,639
What happened? Did he die?

500
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,107
No, uh, you wait here.

501
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:24,009
Did they find something
that might help him?

502
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,778
Someone from
Neonatology has to examine

503
00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:28,013
every premature baby
born in the hospital.

504
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,081
They might do something?

505
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:30,249
Wait here, please.

506
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:32,017
Note how the thinness
of the fetal tissue

507
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,153
makes thermal
regulation impossible.

508
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:35,621
The eyes remain closed...

509
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,688
What are you doing?

510
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,157
We heard you had
a micro-preemie.

511
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,241
It's not show-and-tell.

512
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,098
No, it's a teaching hospital.

513
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:46,298
As you can see, the heart,
limbs and palate are fully formed.

514
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:47,466
With a transparent skin,

515
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,635
we might even be able
to see the heart beating.

516
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:51,259
Okay, p... Uh, put him down.

517
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,705
Excuse me?

518
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:53,722
Put him down.

519
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,724
He is not a science experiment.

520
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,844
No, he isn't. But I need
to examine for anomalies.

521
00:21:58,868 --> 00:21:59,845
You should have called.

522
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:00,879
Well, you examined him.

523
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,231
Now go. When I'm finished.

524
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:03,599
The father is standing outside

525
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,652
thinking that you
are saving his baby.

526
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:08,676
How long would you
like to torture him?

527
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,600
Are there any questions?

528
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,715
No? Good.

529
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,084
Transfer him to the fifth floor.

530
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,419
No.

531
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,854
You can't keep him down here.

532
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,173
I'm not sending those
parents upstairs with the moms.

533
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:29,574
Fine. The NICU then.

534
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,810
No, he's staying here,
with his mother and father,

535
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,112
so they can have some privacy.

536
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:34,746
In the ER? Yes.

537
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,081
Is there anything you can do?

538
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:40,719
Um, no. I'm sorry.
He's too young.

539
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:44,840
Can you get Mr. Morgan a
chair so he can sit next to his son?

540
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,396
Sure.

541
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,644
I know this is difficult.

542
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,993
Don't be afraid to touch him.

543
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,330
He's not suffering, is he?

544
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,582
No.

545
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,717
We gotta clear the room.
Multiple MVAs coming up.

546
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,636
Find someplace else.
This is a Trauma Room.

547
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,726
I don't care. This
room's off-limits.

548
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:27,983
Titrate the phentolamine
to M.A.P. 120.

549
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,352
Don't worry, Mr. Robertson,
you are in good hands.

550
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,953
Dr. Romano. Hello, Peter.

551
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,022
I heard you were
hoarding a pheo down here.

552
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,890
An Attending for a
week and already

553
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,692
you're stealing the
fascinomas, huh?

554
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,693
Uh, you can have him.

555
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,295
Ha. I wasn't asking
your permission.

556
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,097
We have a problem
with a dialysis patient.

557
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,382
Why do you say "we"?

558
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,834
Financial Services
won't let me admit him.

559
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,803
Don't let those geeks
push you around, Peter.

560
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,872
Show a little backbone
before you come crying to me.

561
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,674
They're blocking
him on your orders.

562
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,577
Oh. That's different.
Let's take a look.

563
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,079
I've cleared him for surgery. I
can have him out in 24 hours.

564
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,548
Mm-hm.

565
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,016
Twenty-eight admissions
for renal failure?

566
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,852
He frequently misses dialysis.

567
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,604
Yeah, apparently.
Well, street him.

568
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:07,189
I am done carrying
these parasites.

569
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,591
That's an EMTALA violation.
No. He's had an exam,

570
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,742
and he's not emergent.

571
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:12,499
How do you know? You
haven't looked at him.

572
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,715
Okay, Peter. Let's take a look.

573
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:18,149
Where is he? Curtain Two.

574
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,118
Too late, Lizzie, I
already grabbed the pheo.

575
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,219
What? Nothing.

576
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:22,387
Listen, have you seen Mark?

577
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,389
He has a spinal
abscess patient for me.

578
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:25,958
He said something
about Radiology.

579
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:27,826
Hi, Mr. Fletcher.
I'm Dr. Romano.

580
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,994
How are you feeling today?

581
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:30,161
Like crap.

582
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,130
I'm sorry to hear
that. Can I take a look?

583
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,032
You're the seventh
person to take a look.

584
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,001
What am I, a freak show? Mm.

585
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:37,435
Why did you miss your dialysis?

586
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,437
I was busy.

587
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:39,805
Uh-huh. Doing what?

588
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:41,072
None of your business.

589
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:44,443
Mm. More important
things to do, I imagine, huh?

590
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:45,777
I don't like you.

591
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,946
I didn't like you the time
you sliced my foot open,

592
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,514
and I don't like you now.

593
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:50,866
Oh, I'm hurt, Mr. Fletcher.

594
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,867
Uh-huh.

595
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,802
What about my pain pill?

596
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,837
I need my damn pain pill!

597
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,039
The nurse is gonna
bring it, Mr. Fletcher.

598
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,608
She's too slow. I
need a new nurse.

599
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,245
Put him on a bus to Milwaukee.

600
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,396
He's fluid-overloaded.

601
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,631
This guy knows exactly
what's gonna happen

602
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:09,100
if he misses his dialysis,
and he still blows it off.

603
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:10,769
He's not gonna stop
abusing the system

604
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:12,304
until we draw the line.

605
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,089
What's this? This
is for his bus ticket.

606
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,224
Pfft. You serious?

607
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,225
Absolutely.

608
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:17,326
New state, new Medicaid,

609
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,194
and a whole new set
of doctors to piss off.

610
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,395
He lives in Chicago.

611
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,635
Cry me a river.

612
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,399
Oh, man...

613
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:27,769
Please call back immediately.
Thank you. Machine.

614
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,671
Do you have a
pager number, or...?

615
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,806
No.

616
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,575
A next-door neighbor?
Another relative?

617
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,599
No.

618
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,380
Well, her breathing
has stabilized for now.

619
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,114
How long have you been together?

620
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,256
Twenty-seven years.

621
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,043
Kerry?

622
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:51,343
Could you excuse
us for a moment?

623
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:52,367
Sure.

624
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,853
What are you doing?

625
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:04,940
She talked to her
brother twice in 10 years.

626
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,559
Yes, and she didn't grant
her partner power of attorney.

627
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,861
I'm trying to find a legal
way to fulfill her wishes.

628
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:12,364
Twenty-seven years. That
should count for something.

629
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:14,632
The woman has a
reasonable chance of survival.

630
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,235
But what kind of life?

631
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,370
Intubation is an
appropriate step

632
00:26:18,394 --> 00:26:20,038
unless she has an
advanced directive.

633
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:22,658
The only person who can
change that is the next of kin.

634
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,743
She is the next of kin.

635
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,311
They lived their lives together.

636
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,812
We should treat
them like a couple.

637
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,638
I agree. The law doesn't.

638
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,168
If her sats drop below 80

639
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,075
before her brother
calls back, tube her.

640
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,172
No.

641
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,073
What?

642
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,459
If you want to
manage it this way,

643
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:43,333
then you should manage it.

644
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:46,130
Okay. Fine.

645
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,454
Give me the chart.

646
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,387
Thank you. I just...
I need a picture.

647
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:06,551
I understand.

648
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,670
Should we use the
name? You don't want to?

649
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:11,456
No, I think we should.

650
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,925
There's only one boy's
name that we could agree on.

651
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:15,127
What's that?

652
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:16,761
Julian.

653
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,397
It's a nice name.

654
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,021
Yeah.

655
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,570
How much longer?

656
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:26,610
I don't know.

657
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,690
It could be a few minutes.

658
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:31,481
It could be a few hours.

659
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,822
Let's take him outside.

660
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,235
What?

661
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,456
We'll take him to
a lake or a park.

662
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,997
If he's gonna die, I don't
want him to die in here.

663
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,262
We have to wait for the priest.

664
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:52,664
Is he coming?

665
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:54,388
I'll check again.

666
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,208
Abby.

667
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,165
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

668
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,898
I paged you three times.

669
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,900
We had a 22-week birth
here. The baby's alive.

670
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,152
You had a patient
upstairs who needed you.

671
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:15,153
Did she deliver?

672
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:17,105
Yes, she delivered.

673
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,240
Shoulder dystocia.

674
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,575
Is the baby okay?

675
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,484
Well, apart from a broken
clavicle, he'll be fine.

676
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,332
She was really scared,
and she was asking for you.

677
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:29,501
Look, if you wanna take
shifts as an OB nurse,

678
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:31,787
I need you to work
as an OB nurse.

679
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,889
You cannot let these women
grow dependent on you,

680
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,357
and then just walk out on
them when you got an excuse.

681
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,758
I was not looking for an excuse,

682
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,961
I was taking care of
this woman and her baby.

683
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,063
There are other people
down here who can do that.

684
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,698
Your job is upstairs.

685
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,000
Janet, I'm sorry.
It was my call.

686
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,269
I asked Abby to stay.

687
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,137
These parents are
completely distraught.

688
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,689
There's nothing we can do,

689
00:28:50,713 --> 00:28:52,157
but they need support,

690
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:54,981
and Abby's been with
them since the birth.

691
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:59,719
Just don't ignore
my page. I'm sorry.

692
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,268
Thank you.

693
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:06,037
No. You're doing the hard part.

694
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:07,038
Is he still breathing?

695
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:08,456
Agonally.

696
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,125
Let me know when
you need to pronounce.

697
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,793
Okay.

698
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,496
Last time I got heated
blankets and an extra pillow.

699
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,997
Phew.

700
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,231
What's open, Shirley?

701
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,600
Depends on what you have.

702
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,102
Revision of an AV
graft, left forearm.

703
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,971
Patient named Fletcher?
How did you know?

704
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:26,174
Dr. Romano warned me
you'd try to bring him up.

705
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,543
Yeah, well, it's my call.
Just, uh, give me a room.

706
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,928
I'm sorry, Dr. Benton. I can't.

707
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:32,264
I'll be in and out in
less than an hour.

708
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,838
He actually said he'd fire me.

709
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:42,590
Okay. Okay, well, please hurry.

710
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,280
Thank you.

711
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,228
That was the priest.

712
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,364
He finally talked that
woman down from a ledge.

713
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,366
He's gonna get over
here and baptize this baby.

714
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,617
How long has it been?

715
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:54,586
Almost five hours. Wow.

716
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,988
He's really hanging on.

717
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,107
Maybe the mother's right.

718
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,242
Maybe he is a miracle.

719
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:05,463
In 10, 15 years, we
might be able to help.

720
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:06,664
You know, they wanted to try.

721
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:08,800
We could intubate
him, just in case.

722
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,784
Abby... I know.

723
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,722
It's his time on Earth,

724
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:16,813
and all you can do is
make it a good time.

725
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,135
I think he stopped breathing.

726
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,087
Here we go.

727
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,654
That's not a respirator?

728
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:32,490
No. It provides positive
pressure to her lungs

729
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,765
so she doesn't have to
work so hard to breathe.

730
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,176
Her father died of lung cancer.

731
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,652
I remember Glenda
and her brother

732
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,672
fighting outside the ICU.

733
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:49,174
Danny couldn't let go,

734
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,942
and Glenda couldn't watch
her father suffer like that.

735
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,933
You know, all those tubes.

736
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:58,415
After her first stroke,
Glenda made me promise

737
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,959
to never let her die like that.

738
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,628
We'll do everything we
can to reach her brother.

739
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:08,114
He doesn't know her like I do.

740
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,938
I love her.

741
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:22,095
I don't wanna lose her,
but I know what she wants.

742
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:29,214
His breathing just
slowed down for a second,

743
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:31,366
and then it just... It stopped.

744
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,790
Please, if you
could do anything.

745
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,841
Is there a heartbeat?

746
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:40,048
No.

747
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:47,983
You wanna call it?

748
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,305
Oh, God.

749
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:54,456
Abby?

750
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,157
Yeah.

751
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,364
Is that it?

752
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:04,799
The time of death is...

753
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,023
Wait! His chest moved.

754
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,450
Is he...? Is he still alive?

755
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:21,954
Got a heartbeat.

756
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:37,565
Yes. Ye... But your sister
has an aspiration pneumonia.

757
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:42,437
If we put her on a ventilator,
she may never come off it.

758
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,173
Possibly. Possibly, but she
suffered a massive stroke

759
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,675
from which she
probably will not recover.

760
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,612
Mr. Walton, I cannot
give you percentages.

761
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,454
Extremely unlikely.

762
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,836
We understand
your sister's wishes

763
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,972
are not to be kept
alive by artificial means.

764
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:02,956
Judy. Would you
like to talk to her?

765
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:09,948
Yes, if we don't
intubate her, she will die,

766
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:12,316
but the chances of a mean...

767
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,776
The chances of a
meaningful recovery are ex...

768
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,862
I understand.

769
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,167
Yes. Goodbye.

770
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,520
Hey, you. Malatucci.
Come here. Malucci.

771
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:36,224
Whatever. Look, wave you
seen the OIG officer down here?

772
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,392
Who?

773
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,560
Deputy inspector general.

774
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,361
Regulates our
Medicare compliance.

775
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,029
I heard she was snooping around.

776
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,631
Short, battle-ax, humorless?

777
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,032
That's her. Curtain Two.

778
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,167
Thank you.

779
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,869
Dr. Benton told you
you needed surgery?

780
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,004
He brought me upstairs.

781
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,505
Why didn't he operate?

782
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,574
Nurse wouldn't let him in.

783
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,643
He tried to tell me they
didn't have a room ready,

784
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,178
but I could tell
she kicked him out.

785
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,248
Okay, Mr. Fletcher,
we're ready for you. Sandy.

786
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,249
Hello, Robert.

787
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,917
What an unexpected, uh, visit.

788
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,786
Actually, I'm investigating a
possible EMTALA violation.

789
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,821
Really, what patient?

790
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:07,994
Mr. Fletcher.

791
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,494
Some sort of spot audit?

792
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,746
No, we got a call that you
were trying to bounce him.

793
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,680
From whom? Anonymous.

794
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,350
Well, fortunately anonymous
does not always equal reliable.

795
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:21,552
I was just coming to take
Mr. Fletcher up to surgery.

796
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:22,954
The O.R.'s ready, Peter.

797
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,378
Is that true, Dr. Benton?

798
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,759
I'm sure Dr. Romano's
found a room.

799
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,595
This is a consent
form, Mr. Fletcher.

800
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:32,313
I'll explain it to
you on the way up.

801
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,347
Yeah, I know the drill.

802
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,183
Robert, tell me you
don't have policy

803
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:38,686
to redirect all non-paying
Medicare HMO patients.

804
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,354
How could we? We're
a county hospital.

805
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,655
Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.

806
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,756
Always a pleasure, Sandy.

807
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,958
I'm sure.

808
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,059
As long as I'm here,

809
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,828
I think you should
know I will be auditing

810
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,463
all of your patient transfers
from the last month.

811
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,899
Audit away. No skeletons here.

812
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,489
I hope so.

813
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,956
Dr. Romano, I felt I had to...

814
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,592
Not a word, Peter.
Not a single word.

815
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:03,444
You're not gonna
leave a scar, are you?

816
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,729
The hack that first put
this in left a big scar.

817
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:07,782
Shut up.

818
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,901
I'd have had exposure
and direct visualization

819
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:12,069
without beaming a
gigavolt of radiation

820
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:13,504
into the poor man's spine.

821
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,738
A gigavolt?

822
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:16,174
You know what I mean.

823
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,842
And I could have
completely evacuated

824
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,844
all the infected tissue.

825
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,412
These guys are
going in half-blind.

826
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:22,847
Fine. Whatever.

827
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:27,151
Next spinal abscess
is all yours, I promise.

828
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:28,652
Where is this place, anyway?

829
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:30,822
You'll see.

830
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:32,056
These are houses, Mark.

831
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,179
Uh-huh.

832
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:37,584
Oh.

833
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,432
Oh, Mark!

834
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,935
It's beautiful!

835
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,026
See, I have some taste.

836
00:35:47,429 --> 00:35:49,274
Can you afford it?

837
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:50,775
I've been living cheap.

838
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:53,544
Besides, I'm gonna
have a roommate.

839
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,613
That's awfully
presumptuous of you.

840
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,782
I could take out an ad.

841
00:35:57,806 --> 00:36:01,352
You will not! I love it!

842
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,355
Check out the refrigerator.
It's nice and cold.

843
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:05,412
Look at this deck!

844
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:07,728
I knew you'd love that.

845
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:09,460
When can we move in?

846
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:10,928
When can you pack?

847
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:12,930
It has an icemaker.

848
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,700
These floors are gorgeous!

849
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,602
Check it out. What?

850
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,003
The icemaker.

851
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:20,905
It's lovely.

852
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,674
You have... You have to open it.

853
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:25,577
It has a special ice feature.

854
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,878
What? Does the ice come
in different-shaped cubes

855
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,297
or something?

856
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,327
Oh, my God. Oh, Mark...

857
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:51,952
I'm a little nervous. So, uh...

858
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,822
Uh, let me... Let me say it.

859
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:58,181
Elizabeth, I love you.

860
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:03,748
I was hoping you'd give
me the joy and honor

861
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,705
of being your husband.

862
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:11,911
Oh.

863
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,715
Is that a yes?

864
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,306
Yes.

885
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,502
Yes.

892
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:28,942
Hi. Could I get a coffee with
cream, no sugar, to go, please?

893
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,333
Sure.

894
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,002
Hey.

895
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,922
Hi. You back already?

896
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,192
No, not for another week.

897
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,292
What, are you just hanging out?

898
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,049
I have a diversion meeting at 9.

899
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,970
You look much better.

900
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:53,417
Thank you.

901
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,802
Hey, I like your hair.

902
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,926
Thank you.

903
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,406
Some nice scrubs.

904
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,110
You picking up
some extra shifts?

905
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:04,683
No. I was suspended.

906
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,281
Oh?

907
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,665
Didn't kill anybody,
did you? No.

908
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,553
I wanted to.

909
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,022
My ex-husband was
supposed to pay my tuition.

910
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,225
He didn't pay it, so...

911
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,326
Ouch.

912
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,893
I'm on the bench for a while,

913
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,862
but it certainly didn't
seem like that today.

914
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:22,863
Oh, thank you.

915
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,832
Hey, I got that. It's okay.

916
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,222
Hey, it's a cup of coffee.

917
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,836
Sit down.

918
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,011
It's the least I can do after
acting like a complete jerk.

919
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:36,427
When?

920
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:38,061
Three months ago.

921
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:41,665
You know, you might
have saved my life.

922
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,601
If you hadn't stopped
me when you did,

923
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,024
I could be dead now.

924
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:52,898
I'm working on my steps here.

925
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:55,869
You're up to nine already?

926
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,071
Well, more or less.

927
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,958
I forgive you.

928
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,373
Do you mind?

929
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:06,908
Sorry.

930
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,776
I really have to quit again.

931
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,578
Thank you.

932
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,580
Keep it.

933
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,253
Long day?

934
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,217
Yeah.

935
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,520
Twenty-two-week-old
preemie survived nine hours.

936
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,277
I just finished the death kit.

937
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:24,875
Wow. Yeah.

938
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,076
I don't know why I do this.

939
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,278
Sometimes I think I should
just go be an accountant,

940
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:29,313
or something.

941
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:30,314
That's an option.

942
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:31,682
If I could balance a checkbook.

943
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:32,755
What about you?

944
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:36,592
A lot of waiting.
A lot of meetings.

945
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:40,580
Yeah, you get
kinda meeting-ed out.

946
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,114
Aren't you gonna ask?

947
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,116
What?

948
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,285
What I was doing
there this morning?

949
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,955
You only go for one reason.

950
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,823
I figured I'd keep
going and eventually

951
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,614
you'd stand up and share.

952
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,352
It's not that interesting.

953
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:04,820
I'm a drunk.

954
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,051
How long have you been sober?

955
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:08,407
Almost five years.

956
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,107
So you could sponsor somebody.

957
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,642
Yeah, I guess.

958
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,506
Have you? No.

959
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:22,422
'Cause I'm, uh, supposed
to find a sponsor.

960
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,874
Don't look at me. No?

961
00:42:29,898 --> 00:42:33,110
No, I'm barely holding my
own life together right now.

962
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,228
Trust me.

963
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:40,867
'Cause it would be great to
have somebody at the hospital.

964
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,304
And since you did sorta start
me on my road to recovery...

965
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,923
And men and women aren't
supposed to sponsor each other.

966
00:42:45,947 --> 00:42:47,308
It's... Don't worry about it.

967
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:48,593
Thanks.

968
00:42:48,617 --> 00:42:49,649
Come on.

969
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:53,797
You're not gonna make
me ask a stranger, are you?

970
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,740
I mean, the only person I met at
the meeting was the coffee guy.

971
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,993
Okay. Okay.

972
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,261
I will work the steps with you,

973
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,736
until you find a
permanent sponsor.

974
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,888
Fair enough.

975
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,911
I'll start by setting
a good example.

976
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,373
Besides, I don't
think cigarettes

977
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:20,958
are gonna do it for me tonight.

978
00:43:20,982 --> 00:43:22,827
No? No.

979
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:26,013
I'm getting a hot fudge sundae.

980
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,080
Mm.

981
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,081
Would you like one?

982
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,550
Mm-mm. I got enough vices.

983
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,752
No. I think part of
the rules should be

984
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,387
that you have to
splurge with me.

985
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:36,426
