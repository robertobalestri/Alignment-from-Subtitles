1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,489
You asleep?

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,179
Cleo?

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,094
Cleo?

4
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,195
Mm.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,186
You asleep? Mm-hm.

6
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,593
It's snowing outside.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,764
What time is it?

8
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,544
Almost 6.

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,039
You know, I was thinking, um...

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,189
I have to be in at 7.

11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,247
The alarm's going
off in 10 minutes.

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,429
I'll be quick.

13
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,553
Mm. The hell you will.

14
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,736
<i>You feel it?</i>

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,240
<i>No.</i>

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,874
There. Oh, wow.

17
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,211
It's really moving.

18
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,381
How long has she
been going on like this?

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,965
On and off all night.

20
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,874
Shh.

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,144
Go back to sleep.

22
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,816
I keep thinking
about that movie.

23
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,553
<i>Alien.</i> You know?

24
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,567
It's moving around
under his skin,

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,701
and then, all of a sudden,

26
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,238
it breaks its way
through with its teeth.

27
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,140
Amanda, stop it.

28
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,243
You're scaring your mother.

29
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,667
Amanda.

30
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,015
So the baby's a girl today.

31
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,785
Or Matthew, after
my grandfather.

32
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,825
Can't decide.

33
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,646
Last day?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,483
Last day.

35
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:08,310
What?

36
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,982
It's okay.

37
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:28,574
Hi.

38
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:29,675
Did I wake you?

39
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,644
Uh-uh.

40
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,228
I was trying to let you sleep.

41
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,243
I should probably
get home anyway.

42
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:46,125
You should bring
a few things over.

43
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,736
I could clear out some
closet space for you.

44
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,219
Are you sure you can spare it?

45
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,522
I can find a couple of inches.

46
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,757
Somewhere, maybe.

47
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,535
I need to dry my hair.

48
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,388
Mm-hm.

49
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,911
Are you gonna watch me again?

50
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,601
Mm-hm.

51
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,181
You're okay?

52
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,050
Mm-hm.

53
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,284
And you?

54
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,319
Mm-hm.

55
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,833
Penny for your thoughts.

56
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,568
Pardon?

57
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,936
It means...

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,605
It means, "What are
you thinking about?"

59
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,297
Nothing, really.

60
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,659
I was thinking about the bishop.

61
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,357
Making love with me makes you

62
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,225
think of a priest with lupus?

63
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,793
Hm.

64
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,661
You watch me when we make love.

65
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,535
You're beautiful.

66
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,251
What was her name?

67
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,089
Who?

68
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,027
Your wife.

69
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,132
Daniella.

70
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,141
Did you love her very much?

71
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,711
Yeah.

72
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,951
I'm glad.

73
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,717
Carter. Four-year-old boy's
coming in from preschool.

74
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,019
Fever, trouble breathing.
Sixty-two's pulling in.

75
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,921
Okey-dokey.

76
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,923
Hey, Frank. Is
Dr. Greene here yet?

77
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,792
No. Said he was
coming in a little late.

78
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,194
Weaver's upstairs at some
big administrative powwow.

79
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,896
Probably suggesting
the installation

80
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,698
of pay toilets in the
employee bathrooms.

81
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,232
Is Kovac here?

82
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,635
He's got a dead shovel in 3.
They're trying to bring back.

83
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,004
I guess it's just you and
me then, with this 4-year-old.

84
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,639
Hey, I can take it.

85
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,407
Welcome back. Ha. Thanks.

86
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,309
How are you feeling?
Oh, pretty good.

87
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,561
Want me to tag along with you?

88
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:15,895
No. I've got it.

89
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,297
Eight weeks. Could
be some cobwebs.

90
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,099
Thanks, anyway.

91
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,851
Call me if she gets
into any trouble.

92
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,057
Okay.

93
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,490
You look great.

94
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,725
Oh. I still have a
few pounds to drop.

95
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,927
Can't tell. Oh, I should
have gotten a coat.

96
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,663
Go in and grab
one. No, I'm all right.

97
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:34,830
Zack Woodman, 4 years old.

98
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,799
Post grand mal
seizure at his preschool.

99
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,301
We were finishing
arts and crafts,

100
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,253
and he started shaking
and wet his pants.

101
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,305
You his mother? No,
his preschool teacher.

102
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,174
Feels like he's burning
up. BP's 100/60. Pulse, 120.

103
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,676
Does he have a
history of epilepsy?

104
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,310
No. Not that I know of.

105
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,879
Zack, open your eyes. Zack...

106
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,447
Excuse me. Can somebody help me?

107
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,100
Oh. Are you hurt, sir? No,
it's not me. He's in the car.

108
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,402
He's very weak. I don't
think he can walk on his own.

109
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:57,487
Abby?

110
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,888
What's wrong with him?

111
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,356
He's having trouble breathing.

112
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,791
Has he been ill? Yes.

113
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,959
When did this start?

114
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,503
I don't know. A couple
hours ago, I guess.

115
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,915
Hi.

116
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,950
Hello.

117
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:12,285
Can you walk?

118
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,004
I don't think so.

119
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,141
I need a septic workup, CBC,

120
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,176
blood and urine
cultures, chest x-ray.

121
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,178
Temp's 105.

122
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,463
Sorry. The bishop's back.

123
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:24,552
I need a weight.

124
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,118
Blue zone, 20 kilos.

125
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,471
360 milligrams
of rectal Tylenol.

126
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,172
Pulse ox, 82.

127
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,891
Put him on a mask, 10 liters.

128
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,009
Do you want to do a spinal tap?

129
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,361
He could have meningitis.

130
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,997
Well... Or a febrile seizure,
and he's going to wake up.

131
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,198
Why don't I get an LP tray?

132
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,399
I wanna wait a few minutes.

133
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,974
Give 900 of cefotaxime
after the cultures.

134
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,379
Well, I love what you've
done with the place, Peter.

135
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,546
Very Teutonic.

136
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,515
None of the trappings
of success to interfere

137
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,617
with your, um, performing
your new duties.

138
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,353
Well, I requisitioned
some furniture,

139
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,553
but I hear the form is still

140
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,306
on your desk waiting
for<i> your</i> signature.

141
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,807
Well, you should see my in-box.

142
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,141
Must be 18 inches deep.

143
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,509
Are those admissions folders?

144
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,795
Yeah. I thought I would
familiarize myself with them

145
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,330
before I met with candidates.
Don't bother. Kids come in,

146
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,182
and toss out a
bunch of tired clichés

147
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:18,551
about wanting to help people.

148
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,053
You could ask their favorite
color, or if they like cheese.

149
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,221
Doesn't matter.

150
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,678
Step outside a
minute, would you?

151
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:33,966
He, uh, showed up at my office

152
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,768
whining about not
getting an interview.

153
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,436
So I thought you
should shake his hand,

154
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,338
since this sort of falls
under your purview,

155
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,175
before you have the,
uh, Security toss him out.

156
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,744
Hey.

157
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,245
That's your man.

158
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:47,580
Dean Benton?

159
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:49,515
Dr. Benton.

160
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:50,850
William White.

161
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,451
Thanks for finding
the time to see me.

162
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,453
Yeah. Well... what
can I do for you?

163
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:56,422
I, uh... Uh, I got this letter.

164
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:57,857
I applied to the medical school,

165
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,776
but I didn't get an interview.

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,979
Teacher doesn't have a
signed emergency consent form.

167
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,148
He's still not waking
up. How long's it been?

168
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,348
Forty minutes.

169
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,717
Zack? Zack, can you hear me?

170
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,119
He needs an LP.

171
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,654
We don't have parental consent.

172
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,657
Get another doc to sign
off the chart with you.

173
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,126
Okay. Get the tray set up.

174
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,261
Frank... where's Carter?

175
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,645
In 4. Granny took a fall.

176
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,936
Dr. Carter, can I see
you for a moment?

177
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,292
Sure.

178
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,075
I've got that 4-year-old
with febrile seizure. Mm-hm.

179
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,277
He's still altered. I
wanna do a spinal tap,

180
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,680
but the preschool doesn't
have an emergency consent.

181
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,782
And we haven't been
able to contact a parent yet.

182
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,850
Any other signs?

183
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,952
Well, x-ray looks
like viral pneumonia.

184
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,487
I can't assess for a stiff
neck, but there is photophobia.

185
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,573
Well, where do you
want me to sign?

186
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:50,709
Oxygen saturation's only 78.

187
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,710
What should it be?

188
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,512
Hundred.

189
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,714
Seventy-eight sounds
like a passing grade.

190
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,716
Barely.

191
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,335
Put him up to four liters.

192
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,170
CBC, blood cultures, ABG,

193
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,289
sed rate and a portable chest.

194
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:06,042
And hang a gram of cefotaxime
in case it's pneumonia.

195
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,429
Pneumonia? I don't even
feel like I have a fever.

196
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:12,086
The steroids prevent
you from having fevers.

197
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,518
And push 125 of Solu-Medrol.

198
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,304
You're giving me more steroids?

199
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,173
You could have
a flare of the lupus

200
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:21,891
with inflammation in the lung.

201
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,326
There's also a chance that
you are throwing blood clots.

202
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,561
Oh.

203
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,352
Lupus makes your blood
coagulate more easily.

204
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,156
Have you called your own doctor?

205
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,105
No.

206
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,812
I'll call him. No.

207
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,662
Why? Because you... You
think I'm easier to manipulate?

208
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,865
I'm not nearly as Machiavellian

209
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,249
as you imagine me to be.

210
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,143
I came here because
I prefer your care.

211
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,944
How's it going?

212
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,812
Easy tap when
they're unconscious.

213
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,013
Looks pretty clear.

214
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,315
Cute kid. What's his name? Zack.

215
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,951
Cell count, glucose, protein,
Gram's stain and culture.

216
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,020
He's got those shoes
that light up when you walk.

217
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:09,588
How do you think they do that?

218
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,223
Want to roll him back over?

219
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,575
What is that?

220
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,776
What?

221
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,880
That.

222
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,364
You didn't tell me he
had a macular rash.

223
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,354
Wasn't there half an hour ago.

224
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,185
Must be a viral exanthem.

225
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,353
Could be measles.

226
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,588
Measles?

227
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,989
Yeah.

228
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,891
Fever, altered mental
status, pneumonia.

229
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,260
Or more likely he has
a virus with pneumonia,

230
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,361
and had a febrile seizure

231
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,630
from the high temperature.

232
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,216
That is a classic measles rash.

233
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,385
Abby, can you hand
me a tongue depressor?

234
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,720
Have you ever seen
measles? No. Have you?

235
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:44,089
Of course not.
Nobody's seen measles.

236
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:46,633
Can you, uh...?

237
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,695
He's got Koplik spots
on the buccal mucosa.

238
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,815
What?

239
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,118
Or he bit the inside of his
mouth when he was seizing.

240
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,052
Malik, There's a<i>
Nelson's</i> in the lounge.

241
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,070
Can you grab it, please?

242
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,128
Now.

243
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,494
Is Zack all right?

244
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,380
Uh, this is Mrs.
Woodman. I was in court.

245
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:10,432
I have to turn off my cell when
we're in session. oh, my God.

246
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,934
I'm Dr. Chen. Your
son had a seizure

247
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,802
and a high temperature.

248
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,805
We've done a spinal
tap to rule out meningitis.

249
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,090
Mrs. Woodman, are Zack's
immunizations up-to-date?

250
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,393
No. CARTER: Has he had the MMR?

251
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,917
He hasn't had any immunizations.
None of our children have.

252
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,047
I got it, Dr. Carter.

253
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,515
Abby, put a mask on Zack.

254
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,100
MRS. WOODMAN What's the matter?

255
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,268
What the hell is happening?

256
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,986
Get him into the
Laminar Flow Room.

257
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,777
Call the school. Don't
let anybody leave.

258
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,741
What's the matter with my son?

259
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,076
Your son has measles.

260
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,078
That's not too bad, right?

261
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:40,801
One in 500 kids
die from measles.

262
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,068
Frank, I'm taking
the Luiz kid up now.

263
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,304
Please send along the films when

264
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,604
you find them again, will you?

265
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes, ma'am.

266
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,474
Hi.

267
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,876
Hey.

268
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,911
So how'd it go? Fine.

269
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,847
Fine? That's it?

270
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,148
I laid down, they shot a couple

271
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,549
billion more rads into my skull,

272
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,718
and then I left.

273
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,353
And that's it.

274
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,421
Hopefully, my irradiated
head won't screw up

275
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,690
any navigational equipment

276
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,034
on our next flight.

277
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,934
All right, all right.

278
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,705
I have to go.

279
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,540
Uh, lunch?

280
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,576
Uh, if I can. Come find me.

281
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,233
Okay. All right.

282
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,615
So did I hear
right? You're done?

283
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,917
Radiation treatment.

284
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,718
Just two more weeks
of immune therapy.

285
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,120
Uh, Dr. Greene? Yeah?

286
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,322
That's great. Hey, did they
give you the tumor back?

287
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,258
What? When they took it out,

288
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,493
did they give it back to
you? Because my uncle Al,

289
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,429
he's got his on
a mantle in a jar.

290
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,565
Guy over there
wants to talk to you.

291
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,300
You know, Dave, I
don't really want a...

292
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,790
tumor on my mantle.

293
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,337
Hi. Dr. Greene.

294
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,672
Can I help you?

295
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,174
Robert Wilson. Uh, is there
someplace we could talk?

296
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,476
Actually, I'm on duty.

297
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,745
It'd be better if we
had some privacy.

298
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,880
I'm sorry, Mr.,
um... Dr. Wilson.

299
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,016
<i>Dr.</i> Wilson. What is it?

300
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,518
I work for the
Illinois Department

301
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,870
of Professional Regulation.

302
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:13,906
We've been asked to
evaluate your competency

303
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,408
to continue practicing medicine.

304
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,544
<i>Where in the hell
did he catch measles?</i>

305
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:19,811
Europe, I think.

306
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,613
Mom was in Paris on
business two weeks ago.

307
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:22,948
Took the whole family.

308
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,183
She some fringe lunatic

309
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,884
thinks immunizations
are a conspiracy

310
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,953
between doctors
and drug companies?

311
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,855
Oh, I don't think so.

312
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,291
Talk to the mom. Find out if
there are other kids at home,

313
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:34,560
where the child's been,
anyone he's had contact with

314
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:35,883
over the last week.

315
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,770
How is he? They
won't let me back there.

316
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:46,071
We had to move him to a room

317
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:47,639
with a special
ventilation system

318
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:50,508
so that he doesn't
contaminate the rest of the ER.

319
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,845
Is he awake? Still unconscious.

320
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,079
He has pneumonia.

321
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,815
And, in all likelihood,
encephalitis.

322
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,817
What's that? Inflammation
around the brain.

323
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,886
Were you able to get in
touch with the preschool?

324
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,354
Yes. All the children are there.

325
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,022
Make sure they've
all been immunized.

326
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,758
Their parents, their siblings,

327
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,659
anyone that they've
been in contact with.

328
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:08,861
There's a phone at the desk.

329
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,929
Tell Frank that Dr. Carter
said you could use it.

330
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,286
Okay. Okay. Please.

331
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,136
You have other children?

332
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,971
Yes, a daughter. I
called my husband.

333
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:20,239
He's coming with her.

334
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:22,783
And she hasn't been
immunized either?

335
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,399
No. Is Zack gonna be okay?

336
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,364
Well, he's in grave condition

337
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,628
with a highly
contagious disease.

338
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,485
I'm not an irresponsible parent.

339
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,287
I read all the literature
on the Internet,

340
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,521
the parenting magazines.

341
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,124
I discussed it with
my pediatrician.

342
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:40,292
And he didn't recommend
the MMR? I breast-fed.

343
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:43,295
Zack's immune system could have
been weakened from vaccinations.

344
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,849
The immune system is
strengthened by vaccines.

345
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,251
Kids are exposed to
foreign antigens every day.

346
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,770
Vaccines aren't completely safe.

347
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,705
I'm sorry... They
aren't, and you know it.

348
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:54,940
The connection between
vaccinations and autism...

349
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:56,942
There is no connection.

350
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:57,943
Dr. Carter...

351
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,562
Zack dropped his sats.

352
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,214
He's at 75 at 100 percent.

353
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,652
He's getting cyanotic. I've
already started the atropine.

354
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:09,405
Etomidate and sux. I
need a 5-0 uncuffed ET

355
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,273
and a number 2 curved blade.

356
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,742
Please. What's going on?

357
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,576
There's so much lung
damage that no oxygen

358
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,029
can get into his bloodstream.
What are you doing to him?

359
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,313
We'll put a tube in his throat

360
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,633
to get him more oxygen. He
needs a machine to breathe?

361
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,468
If we don't intubate
him, he's gonna die.

362
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,035
I'll do it. CHEN:
No, I've got it.

363
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,971
Not on your first day
back. Step out, doctor.

364
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,640
What? Step out, doctor.

365
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:28,674
Give me some suction.

366
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:30,259
He's throwing PVCs. Oh, my God.

367
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,921
Come on.

368
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,807
Okay. I got it.

369
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,493
Good breath sounds, bilateral.

370
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,912
- Pulse ox up to 88.
- Tidal volume of 150,

371
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,920
AC of 14. Let's keep him on
100 percent with three of PEEP.

372
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,367
He's okay now?

373
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:56,556
Yeah, sure. He's great.

374
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,922
<i>Is that the bishop's?</i>

375
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,657
He says he's feeling better.

376
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,962
So he'll be able to perform
the ordination this afternoon?

377
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,430
What?

378
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,698
That's where we were headed

379
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,050
when he became ill in the car.

380
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,352
One of the kids that he
baptized at his first parish

381
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,209
is being ordained
as a priest today.

382
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:21,811
Where do you think you're going?

383
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,745
I feel much better.

384
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,532
Your ABG shows
an oxygen level of 58.

385
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,567
And your sed rate is 84.

386
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,835
Eighty-four. Is that good?

387
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,037
No, it's not good!

388
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:34,373
It's an indication
of active lupus.

389
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:37,693
Stop buttoning the damn shirt.

390
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,027
Is Joe still outside?

391
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,395
I think I'm gonna need some help

392
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,664
getting into these pants.

393
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:45,817
You need to be admitted
to the ICU for IV Cytoxan.

394
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,920
It'll only take me
a couple of hours.

395
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:50,355
If the inflammation in
your lungs continues,

396
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,842
you won't get enough
oxygen to stay alive.

397
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,227
If I skip the reception, I
can be back in here by 6.

398
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,418
You'll be dead by 6!

399
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,983
It's in God's hands.

400
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,440
God could give a damn.

401
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,362
Is there something
I should sign...

402
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,832
so I can go?

403
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,534
You're kidding! Stephanie?

404
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,135
Yep, she just up
and moved to Seattle.

405
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,804
I thought she was
living with Deborah.

406
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,006
No, she met a stewardess
on Alaska Airlines

407
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,440
Another stewardess!

408
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,661
Hey. We were
just looking for you.

409
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,748
This is Christy. Christy, Kerry.

410
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:33,766
Hi.

411
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,933
Hello.

412
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:36,519
Christy and I
were having coffee.

413
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,888
And I insisted that she
bring me down here.

414
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,022
I'm sorry, but a bunch of us

415
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,923
were beginning to
question your existence.

416
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,125
We were all thinking
about getting dinner tonight.

417
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,561
You game?

418
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,163
I don't think I can get off in
time. But thank you for asking.

419
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,616
I checked your
schedule. You get off at 6.

420
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,883
Don't worry. Nobody bites.

421
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,486
Uh, chief, can I get you
to sign off on this LOL?

422
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,571
Head CT's clear.

423
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,741
Seven-thirty?

424
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,176
Okay.

425
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,477
Oh, great. We'll see you then.

426
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,934
Bye.

427
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,382
That, uh, Legaspi's girlfriend?

428
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,817
Heard she's gay.

429
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:09,885
I don't know.

430
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,419
Hm. What I wouldn't
pay to drop in

431
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,542
on that little party, huh?

432
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,861
You turned me in?

433
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,463
A guy from the medical board
questioning my competency.

434
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,765
Don't walk away. I'm not.

435
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,033
I don't wanna have this
conversation in the lobby.

436
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,518
He wants to see
my medical records.

437
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,287
He's planning on
interviewing the staff

438
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,189
to see if I'm still fit
to practice medicine.

439
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:31,623
He can pull my license. Look,

440
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,125
I've been concerned about
the changes in your personality

441
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,194
since the surgery.

442
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:36,495
I tried to talk to<i> you</i> about it,

443
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,896
but you've chosen to ignore me.

444
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,200
So you call in the licensing...?
Keep your voice down.

445
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:44,002
They cut a tumor
out of my head, Kerry.

446
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:46,871
I'm sorry if I seem a
little different to you.

447
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:49,107
I wouldn't come back to
work if I couldn't do the job.

448
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,109
What about the
aphasia? It's getting better.

449
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,811
And if you're in an
emergency situation

450
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,080
and couldn't think of the
name of the drug you wanted,

451
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,282
the nurses ask 20 questions
while the patient dies?

452
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,450
Nobody's dying!

453
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,419
You've been insensitive
and argumentative.

454
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:01,520
I have not been!

455
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:03,088
You have been
shooting from the hip,

456
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:06,758
and I'm not the only one
who's expressed concern.

457
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:08,393
For the safety of the patients,

458
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,697
I felt I had to call the board
for an objective assessment.

459
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:12,698
I-I-I want you to pass,

460
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:14,566
so that we can all
get back to work

461
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,435
confident in your abilities.

462
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:17,736
Okay?

463
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,305
Rich people think if all the
poor kids are immunized,

464
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,606
then they don't have to be.

465
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,108
Thought it stopped snowing.

466
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,077
If everybody stops
getting vaccines,

467
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:28,613
then smallpox will be
back, polio, measles. Hey.

468
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,382
Then they'll be lined
up around the block

469
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:31,549
begging us to stick a needle

470
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:33,085
into precious
little Annie's arm.

471
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,354
Fifty-year-old male with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

472
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,622
Persistent nausea and
vomiting despite Compazine.

473
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,791
BP's 88/58. Pulse, 130.

474
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,294
Mucous membranes very dry.
Gave a liter of saline en route.

475
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:44,263
He only finished the
chemotherapy last week.

476
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:45,697
Is the cancer back?

477
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,267
No. He's probably just
having a reaction to the chemo.

478
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,734
How's the little boy? Which one?

479
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,736
The kid with the
febrile seizure.

480
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,638
You brought him in?
Yeah, couple hours ago.

481
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:55,140
They didn't call
you? About what?

482
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,910
He has measles. You drove
an immunosuppressed patient

483
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,644
in the same rig?
What does that mean?

484
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,013
Damn it. Nobody told us.

485
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,881
I'll need a CBC and a Chem-20.

486
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,982
Watch your step.

487
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,201
Excuse me.

488
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,037
I need to review a
file of an applicant

489
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,471
who wasn't given an interview.

490
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,806
And you are?

491
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,975
Peter Benton. I'm the
new director of diversity.

492
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,877
Lucky you. This year?

493
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,178
Yeah.

494
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,648
It would be in the reject
pile. What's the name?

495
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,083
White. William White.

496
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,175
We had over 3000
applications for 150 spots.

497
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,944
Big pile.

498
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,910
Director of diversity, huh?

499
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:08,179
That position's a little quixotic
around here these days.

500
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,248
My David wouldn't be
working for Morgan Stanley

501
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,839
without affirmative action.

502
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,053
William Jackson White.

503
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:17,477
Thank you.

504
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,637
Excuse me. Do you keep files

505
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,471
of past candidates
that were accepted?

506
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,873
I need to compare them.

507
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:36,642
Compared to last
year's acceptances.

508
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,476
They're over there
by graduating year.

509
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,979
2004 is on the right.

510
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,115
Student Affairs.

511
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,471
Fax it over.

512
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,675
I'll be looking for it.

513
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,148
Student Affairs.

514
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,071
Yeah.

515
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,391
What are you doing out here?

516
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,575
Just getting some air.

517
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:30,584
What's the matter?

518
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:35,033
How's your bishop?

519
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,369
He just left.

520
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,204
That's good, right?

521
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,673
He's having an
acute lupus flare.

522
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:43,797
He left AMA.

523
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,212
So go get him.

524
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,931
Take some oxygen,
make sure he's okay.

525
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,366
He... He knew what he was doing.

526
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,556
I'm not his keeper.

527
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:02,928
So this is you, huh?

528
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,296
Yep.

529
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,898
Could use a little something.

530
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,065
What is that back there?

531
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,733
My room with a view.

532
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,234
Cafeteria kitchen.

533
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,904
Vending machine only
had turkey and egg salad.

534
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,695
No veggie. All right.

535
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,642
Thank you.

536
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,628
Hear about our
measles kid downstairs?

537
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,012
Four years old,
parents didn't vaccinate.

538
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,599
What's all this?

539
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,801
Med school applications.

540
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,385
Thinking about starting over?

541
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,041
Is this your file?

542
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,510
Uh, this black kid applied
and didn't get an interview.

543
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,413
I went to Records to find
out why and found that.

544
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,315
Oh, yeah? Anything interesting?

545
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,350
Yeah. My file
wasn't with the rest.

546
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,258
It was in the back with
three others filed under AA.

547
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,590
Affirmative Action.

548
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,291
That surprise you?

549
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,777
Hell, yeah.

550
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,835
Look, my grades were good, my
MCAT scores were competitive.

551
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,768
Yeah, but...

552
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,970
when I compared it
to the other applicants

553
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,337
that were accepted that year,

554
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,839
I shouldn't have even gotten in.

555
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,775
You're an excellent
physician, Peter.

556
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,025
They were right to let you in.

557
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,027
Oh, yeah?

558
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,229
This is the file of the kid

559
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:13,231
that didn't even get
an interview this year.

560
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:14,699
William White.

561
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:18,075
His grades, his MCAT scores,
they're better than mine were.

562
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:18,914
Bishop Stewart?

563
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,070
Mm.

564
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,641
Damn it.

565
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:30,030
I'm okay.

566
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:34,478
How long have you been
having trouble breathing?

567
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm just...

568
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,137
gathering my strength.

569
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:41,073
You have to go to the hospital.

570
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:44,477
It's pretty... isn't it?

571
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:48,093
The snow.

572
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:50,294
So much beauty.

573
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:52,364
Where's the phone? I
need to call an ambulance.

574
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:56,034
No. Please. I only
need a minute.

575
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:57,298
You're dying.

576
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,893
Evidently.

577
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,826
As I was sitting here,

578
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,027
I was reminded of the night

579
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,664
I chose to become a priest.

580
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,099
I'd been struggling
with it for...

581
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,322
a long time.

582
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,625
Several years.

583
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:21,143
Anyway, that night,
I couldn't sleep.

584
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,478
So I... I got up

585
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,502
and... went out for a walk...

586
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:30,340
in the woods behind
my father's house.

587
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,791
It was snowing. Like it is now.

588
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,442
I don't have any idea
how long I walked.

589
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,445
But at a certain point...

590
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,170
I suddenly realized I
didn't know which way to go.

591
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,235
I'd gotten lost.

592
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,592
I was frightened.

593
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,929
As I looked up into
that dark night...

594
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,211
he came to me.

595
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,464
I saw all those
millions of snowflakes

596
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,322
drifting down toward me.

597
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:05,725
So still.

598
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,796
So peaceful.

599
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:12,811
Perfect.

600
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:16,770
And I was filled with the
love of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

601
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,937
Like pouring wine...

602
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,794
into an empty glass.

603
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,334
I'm afraid...

604
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,438
I may have wasted my life.

605
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,919
For some reason,

606
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,243
I never accomplished
the things I should have.

607
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,214
What God wanted of me.

608
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:52,005
And now I'm frightened.

609
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,447
I'm afraid of dying.

610
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,544
There. I said it.

611
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,328
I am...

612
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,047
afraid to die.

613
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,681
You have to go to the hospital.

614
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:26,906
The Lord is my
shepherd, I shall not want.

615
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:31,022
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

616
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,691
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

617
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:34,776
Is he all right?

618
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,300
No... Yes.

619
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,065
The procession is forming.

620
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,522
What should I tell them?

621
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:48,761
Tell them...

622
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,080
I think I have to
skip the processional.

623
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:03,054
When did you lose your faith?

624
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:06,780
I've found with most
people, it comes and goes.

625
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:09,427
Like...

626
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,184
intimacy in a relationship.

627
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,265
Sometimes...

628
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,700
it's so strong.

629
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,624
A passion, rapture.

630
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:21,572
And then at other
times it's impossible,

631
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:22,840
distant...

632
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:23,964
lost.

633
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,180
But that's not God.

634
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:30,770
That's us.

635
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,553
We put up our own barriers...

636
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:37,010
with our egos...

637
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:40,948
and our pain.

638
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:49,067
He's always there.

639
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:50,302
No matter what.

640
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,363
Bach.

641
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,799
I love Bach.

642
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:06,239
Well...

643
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,308
that's my cue.

644
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,068
So, Kevin...

645
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,655
why do you want to be a doctor?

646
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,957
I've given that question
a great deal of thought.

647
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:49,160
And I think it all boils
down to one thing:

648
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,745
I really want to help people.

649
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,531
My dad died of lung cancer

650
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,598
and I was 12.

651
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,701
And I vowed I would
work for a cure.

652
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,671
My research in molecular
biology has been very rewarding.

653
00:32:59,695 --> 00:33:01,790
I expect we'll see gene
therapy in our lifetime.

654
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,524
I'm a people person.

655
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,926
<i>The bottom line is,</i>

656
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,943
I want to help people.

657
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,847
I volunteered for
the Pediatrics ward.

658
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:10,281
When I saw my kitty

659
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:11,766
suffering like that,

660
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,219
I... knew that I had a calling.

661
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,104
To help people in
their time of need.

662
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,023
You have to combine
humanistic skills...

663
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:20,225
With a passion for
making a difference.

664
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,859
And I really just
wanna help people.

665
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:22,944
I just wanna help people.

666
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,112
I wanna help people.

667
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,152
Help people.

668
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,536
How dare you?! Damn it, Kerry.

669
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,970
They sawed off half his skull.

670
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:35,740
Then they inserted high-dosage
chemotherapy wafers... Hello.

671
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,041
Into the empty cavity.

672
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:39,310
It caused temporary
swelling right next to Broca's.

673
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,512
Of course he had
a little aphasia.

674
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:42,847
But that was six weeks ago.

675
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:45,483
The swelling's gone down,
and he's back to normal.

676
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:48,486
If anything, I find his
honesty rather refreshing.

677
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,455
We could all do with a
little more candor here.

678
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,856
Candidly speaking then,

679
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,892
are you sure that you can
be objective about this?

680
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,062
Of course I'm not objective!

681
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,964
Look, I've been with
him every moment,

682
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:02,233
and I can tell you he's
making remarkable progress

683
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:03,768
and is no danger to anyone.

684
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,338
Except perhaps easily
threatened, minor demigods.

685
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:08,906
He may be endangering patients.

686
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,576
I'm not unsympathetic
to his circumstances,

687
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,545
but I have larger
responsibilities.

688
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:15,846
It's despicable.

689
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,948
And you should be
ashamed of yourself.

690
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,284
I hope that you end up with

691
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,818
a possibly fatal
illness one day,

692
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:23,910
so that I can do absolutely
nothing to help you.

693
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:30,895
What was that about?

694
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,130
Uh. Some days I
really hate this job.

695
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,333
Well, you, me and
everyone else around here.

696
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:36,656
Are you ready?

697
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,470
Dinner? Right.

698
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,072
Yes. I just have
to, uh, drop this off.

699
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,575
Carter, you still got that
leg lac waiting in Sutures.

700
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,277
I'm on it. WEAVER:
Get there by Easter,

701
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,735
would you, please?! Yeah, yeah.

702
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:54,419
Hey, Malik? Yeah?

703
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:56,954
Is this the measles kid's
post-intubation film? Yeah.

704
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:58,823
How come it didn't go
up to the PICU with him?

705
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,491
I'll take it up.
No, that's all right.

706
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,181
I'll do it. I want to
check on him anyway.

707
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,047
Phi Beta Kappa, Yale.

708
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,916
GPA's 3.95.

709
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,184
MCATs in the 97th percentile.

710
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,252
Yeah, sure.

711
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,420
Peter?

712
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,444
All right.

713
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:17,375
And... Carpenter.

714
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,676
University of Georgia.

715
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,877
Wait, was this the, uh...?

716
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:21,946
The geek in the Smashing
Pumpkins, uh, T-shirt,

717
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,481
with the... With the lisp?

718
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:25,984
Sarah. Redhead, glasses.

719
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:27,368
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

720
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,023
GPA, 3.79. Ninety-fourth
percentile on the MCATs.

721
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,110
Finalist for the
Falsberg Science Award.

722
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,011
Whatever the hell that
is. We've got better.

723
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,168
Peter?

724
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,332
No. Okay.

725
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,667
Okay, that's it for today.
We are recommending two

726
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,787
to the full committee,
and rejecting 14.

727
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,039
Great. I still might make
it home for<i> SportsCenter.</i>

728
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,730
Uh, there is another
candidate I'd like to discuss.

729
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,746
William White.

730
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,113
Who?

731
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,466
His MCAT scores were
only in the 91st percentile,

732
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,002
but his GPA was 3.80

733
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,303
and he was class president.

734
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,688
Wait, I don't see
him on the list.

735
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,339
We didn't grant
him an interview.

736
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,607
I met with him today,

737
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,860
and he asked me to
reconsider his application.

738
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:12,230
Oh, no. Is this that whiner
I told you to get rid of?

739
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,131
Where did he go to school?

740
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,899
University of Illinois, Chicago.

741
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,536
My gardener could have
gotten a 3.8 at the U of I,

742
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,955
and his head was run over
by an ice cream truck as a kid.

743
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,907
I went to the
University of Illinois.

744
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,460
His MCATs are well below
our admission standards, Peter.

745
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:28,128
MCATs don't predict how
good a doctor you'll be.

746
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,230
Just what you do the first
two years of med school.

747
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,916
This kid is bright.
He's dedicated...

748
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,384
He's black.

749
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,402
Yeah, he's black.

750
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,386
Affirmative action's

751
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,888
against the law, Peter.

752
00:36:36,912 --> 00:36:38,306
We didn't interview one black

753
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,724
or Latino candidate today.

754
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:41,676
We have a colorblind
admissions policy.

755
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,344
If he was good enough,
he would be here.

756
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,112
Minorities don't
have the same access

757
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,314
to academic opportunities.

758
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47,448
You want to address that

759
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,583
by advancing
underqualified applicants

760
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,902
at the expense of our
integrity and theirs?

761
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:54,405
I want him to have an interview.

Still V-fib. What happened?

776
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:44,239
Hypoxia, bradyed down to 20,
then he arrested. Another epi.

777
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,241
He's on PEEP? Maxed out.

778
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,360
And his PO-2's only 39
on 100 percent oxygen.

How long has he been
down? Forty minutes.

782
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,588
He's had two rounds of atropine?

783
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,590
Lidocaine, amiodarone
and dopamine.

and Carol is getting
married to one.

796
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,806
Oh.

797
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,641
Both of these women marched

798
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,042
in every gay-pride parade

799
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,410
for the past 15 years.

800
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,445
I don't get it.

801
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,830
I do. You get
society's blessing,

802
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:01,999
your family's... Survivor
benefits, tax breaks.

803
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:03,367
Mm.

804
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,752
And all you gotta do is lay
there a few times a week.

805
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,558
I'm sorry. We're
not usually this bad.

806
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,961
Oh. It's okay.

807
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,429
Hey.

808
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,697
Do you realize that everyone

809
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,133
at this table has
slept with Kim?

810
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,669
Oh, my God.

811
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,970
Cut it out, you guys.

812
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,304
I bet she brought a U-Haul

813
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,923
on your second date, right?

814
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,858
Mm. I don't understand.

815
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:30,094
It's a lesbian joke. A bad one.

816
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,747
D... Do you want another drink?

817
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,748
Actually, I gotta go.

818
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,084
I have a early shift tomorrow.

819
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,320
Kerry... It was really...

820
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,904
It was really nice
to meet you both.

821
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,683
Wait. Are you upset?

822
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,208
No. Well, why are
you leaving then?

823
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,321
I don't belong here.

824
00:39:57,345 --> 00:39:58,922
I don't belong here.

825
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,758
I dated Christy in college.

826
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:02,260
Kate and I dated
for maybe a month...

827
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:03,628
It's not that. It's... It's...

828
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:04,995
This isn't me.

829
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:07,164
I mean, my... My experience,

830
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:09,367
the jokes, your friends.

831
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:10,868
I'm... I'm...

832
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:12,336
I care about you.

833
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,138
I'm... I'm not interested in...

834
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,682
In adopting a lifestyle.

835
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,884
Wow, I can't believe
you just said that.

836
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,904
I'll call you later.

837
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:38,985
Just drive.

838
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:49,874
Dr. Kovac.

839
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,176
I... I was helping him
off... Off with his dolman,

840
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,944
and he was very short of breath,

841
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:55,248
And he just collapsed.

842
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,387
Oh, God.

843
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:06,356
Bishop Stewart...
can you hear me?

844
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,125
Call 911. Tell them
we have a man

845
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,249
with impending
respiratory arrest.

846
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:22,095
Mark?

847
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:29,769
Mark, you home?!

848
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,067
Mark?

849
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,683
Mark?

850
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,104
Are you okay?

851
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,209
He recommended
formal competency testing.

852
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,691
Psychiatrists,
neuropsychologists,

853
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,726
MRI, personality tests.

854
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,317
It's gonna take five days.

855
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,055
I'm so sorry.

856
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,160
The good times just keep coming.

857
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,057
Luka?

858
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,395
What are you doing?

859
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,033
I... I couldn't find a forest.

860
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,369
What?

861
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:01,010
You brought Bishop
Stewart back in?

862
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,358
How's he doing?

863
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:05,848
He's dying.

864
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,052
He might surprise you.

865
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,888
We get enough miracles
around here. Why not one more?

866
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:20,563
I'm freezing.

867
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Ready to go home? Yeah.
