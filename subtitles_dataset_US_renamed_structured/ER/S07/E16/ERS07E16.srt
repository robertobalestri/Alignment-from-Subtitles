1
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:14,708
Dr. Legaspi?

2
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:15,776
No.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,043
I'm Detective Graham.

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,212
This is Detective
Watkins. Chicago P.D.

5
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,481
We have this listed as,
uh, Dr. Legaspi's address.

6
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:22,816
Is everything all right?

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,317
Does Dr. Legaspi live here?

8
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:26,203
Yes, she does. She's inside.

9
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,227
Who are you?

10
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,289
I'm Dr. Weaver.

11
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:30,874
You live here too?

12
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,509
No. I-I don't. I'm just...

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,911
You know, I don't want to
be rude, but I'm... I'm freezing.

14
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,212
Oh, I'm sorry. By all means.

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,504
We just need to
speak to Dr. Legaspi.

16
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,586
Luka.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,753
I think one of the kids

18
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:03,623
from the coffee shop
broke into the apartment.

19
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,542
I got breakfast.

20
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,110
I don't believe in breakfast.

21
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,112
It's the most important
meal of the day.

22
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,870
That's never been
medically proven.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,921
Why are you up?

24
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,689
It's morning.

25
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,926
I got coffee, bagels
and a real-estate paper.

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,430
I'm thinking I should
get a new place.

27
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,632
What, did the hotel fire
you for getting up too early?

28
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,851
No. Well, somebody should.

29
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:31,875
Hey!

30
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,789
Look. There is an
entire warehouse in here

31
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:38,296
for the price of some condos.

32
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,828
That is very nice.

33
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,698
Especially in the summer
when all you smell is dead flesh.

34
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:46,650
That's the
slaughterhouse district.

35
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,914
It's still a good deal.

36
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,053
You know, first
you live in a boat,

37
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,822
then a hotel, and
now a meat plant.

38
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,257
What's next? Tree house?

39
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,681
Eh... Uh, you're really not
a morning person, are you?

40
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,252
Hey!

41
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,099
Hey, boy.

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,272
Hey. Good morning.

43
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:26,373
Nice toga.

44
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,574
Yeah. I seem to
have lost my clothes.

45
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:30,010
Oh. Your pants are on the couch.

46
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:33,179
And Norman had your socks,
so I put them in your shoes.

47
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,581
You named your dog "Norman"?

48
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:37,116
Well, that was his name
when I got him from the shelter.

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,502
He likes you. You think?

50
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,837
Yeah. Otherwise,
he would've bit you.

51
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,605
You want some
eggs? Oh, yeah. Sure.

52
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,030
Sorry.

53
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,968
My roommate. Think
we kept her up last night.

54
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:56,636
She seemed a little angry.

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,093
More jealous than anything.

56
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,191
You want some tea?

57
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,392
Uh, do you have any coffee?

58
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,893
No, sorry. I don't drink coffee.

59
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,361
That's okay.

60
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,665
Mm. Mm.

61
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,766
I don't usually do this.

62
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,068
Bring somebody home.

63
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,572
Trust me. I don't...
I don't either.

64
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,889
I really had a lot
of fun last night.

65
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,073
Me too.

66
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,711
Maybe we could do it
again some other time?

67
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,045
What about, um...?

68
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,882
Uh, well. You'll just
have to be a little quieter.

69
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,016
Ha-ha. Me?

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,452
Yeah. I think you yelled "stat."

71
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,476
I did not.

72
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,340
Are you working today?

73
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,809
Uh, I got a lecture
in the morning,

74
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,833
but I'll be in around 1.

75
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:39,813
Wanna have lunch?

76
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,837
Okay.

77
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:43,983
These are good eggs.

78
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,235
Oh. Thank you.

79
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,605
I was called down to
assess for suicidal ideation.

80
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,739
It was my job to determine

81
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,075
if the patient needed
to be admitted.

82
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,243
For a psych hold?

83
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,660
Yes.

84
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:57,263
And it was your professional
opinion that she did?

85
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,566
Dr. Legaspi?

86
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,634
Yes.

87
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,137
She was, um...

88
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,606
confused about
her sexual identity.

89
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,608
She was clinically
depressed and had spent

90
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:11,478
a considerable amount of time

91
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,279
planning to hurt herself.

92
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,182
You're awfully
quiet this morning.

93
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,617
Was just thinking. About?

94
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,953
Oh, nothing important.

95
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,320
I hope you're not worrying

96
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,422
about this silly
competency evaluation.

97
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,324
Silly evaluation will determine

98
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,726
whether or not I
keep my license.

99
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,228
They're merely a formality.

100
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,997
NASA astronauts
take fewer tests.

101
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,465
If I don't score
above average...

102
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,633
Mark, stop.

103
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,968
You're a brilliant doctor

104
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,469
regardless of
whether you put a...

105
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,371
A round peg in a square hole.

106
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,539
Where did you hear I put a
round peg in a square hole?

107
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,076
Hey, hey, hey, easy.

108
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,745
You don't want to shake up
that kid more than he has to be.

109
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,280
Listen, our baby's fine.

110
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,215
I've taken every
necessary precaution.

111
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,350
I've been extremely careful.

112
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,552
I haven't had a contraction
in two weeks, you know.

113
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,521
You still need to take it easy.

114
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,140
I'm medicated, I'm monitored.

115
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,709
I'm more than able
to go back to work.

116
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,778
So stop being such
a nervous Nellie.

117
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,379
Okay, one: Don't
ever call me Nellie.

118
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:56,049
And two: If you overdo it,
you can go into preterm...

119
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:58,718
Yes, yes, yes. I am a
doctor too, you know.

120
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:01,987
Well, this doctor's
orders are to slow down.

121
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,473
I remember giving you similar
orders after your surgery,

122
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,860
and I don't think you
listened to me either.

123
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,094
Meet me for lunch.

124
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,118
If you're not in labor.

125
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:12,932
Is that decaf?

126
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,934
Some guy swallowed a
couple dozen on a bet.

127
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,335
Now he's got tummy trouble.

128
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,271
No doubt. Any suggestions?

129
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,140
Yeah. Why don't you
get some colored rocks,

130
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:22,242
maybe one of those
deep-sea divers with bubbles.

131
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,609
Carter, you want a pet?

132
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,744
No, thanks.

133
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,679
How about some
coffee? What's this?

134
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,447
Some guy dropped it
off a few minutes ago.

135
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,649
You want me to read the card?

136
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,885
Hm. No, thank you.
Too late. It's from Rena.

137
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,519
Aah. Oh. Who's Rena?

138
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:36,256
Child-life specialist. Helped
me with an unruly kid last week.

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,390
Really? Hm.

140
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:40,160
So, what does she
look like, Carter?

141
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:41,727
Uh, you know, I don't know.

142
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,163
She's blond. Like, that tall.

143
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:46,532
Kind of cute in her
own way. Right?

144
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,868
Don't ask me. I
didn't get a gift basket.

145
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,270
Now, if she helped you, Carter,

146
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:51,905
why are you getting
all the goodies?

147
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,275
Because I gave her a good
assessment on her internship.

148
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,011
Actually, the card says...
Thank you very much, Amira.

149
00:06:58,035 --> 00:06:59,478
"Thanks for a great evening.

150
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,781
You can bring your
own coffee next time..."

151
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:04,183
Must've been one hell
of an assessment, Carter.

152
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,572
We're gonna move you to
your own room. Okay, Mary?

153
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,108
What if Jesus comes
for me, and I'm not here?

154
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,544
I'll have one of the
nurses send him upstairs.

155
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,412
Will you? Yeah.

156
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,414
Thank you.

157
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,449
You're welcome.

158
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,617
Hey.

159
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,373
Got a minute?

160
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:27,573
So Bloody Mary's back, eh?

161
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:29,775
Well, she's harmless.

162
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,110
Tried to page you.

163
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,212
You know, well, it's
been pretty crazy upstairs.

164
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,780
Not just because
of the patients.

165
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,081
So what was with the police?

166
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:38,150
Oh, you should have
stuck around. It was a party.

167
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,334
I had to be on
at 7:30. So did I.

168
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,142
I didn't abandon you on purpose.

169
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,477
I didn't say you did.

170
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,778
Okay. What did they say?

171
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,081
They were following
up on Shannon Wallace,

172
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,784
the attempted suicide who
caused that train derailment.

173
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,586
They probably wanna talk to you.

174
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,853
Why?

175
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,511
The patient has accused
me of sexual harassment.

176
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,809
What? Yeah.

177
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,943
She told the police that

178
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,463
I came on to her,
and I touched her.

179
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,132
Why would she say such a thing?

180
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,666
Well, she caused over 30 deaths.

181
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,268
She's probably trying to divert

182
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,553
the heat off of herself.

183
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,022
Yeah, but why... Why
would she accuse you of that?

184
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:18,975
How would she even
know you were...? Gay?

185
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,743
Yeah, I-I told her.

186
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,795
You what?

187
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,398
I was trying to help
her. Oh, no. Kim.

188
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,784
Kim, what were you thinking?

189
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,953
I don't know, Kerry.
That she needed help?

190
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,754
Yes, so you disclose
your personal life

191
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,190
to an unstable patient
who you don't even know?

192
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,042
I ca... I-I...

193
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,243
Mr. Hollis is crashing.

194
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,267
Okay.

195
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,829
I'll see you later. Yeah.

196
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,667
Elizabeth, I thought
you were on bed rest.

197
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,502
Hardly.

198
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,471
Is this another one
of my patients, Peter?

199
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,605
What?

200
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,274
Well, you seem to
have taken on several

201
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,642
additional responsibilities
during my absence.

202
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,012
Well, I didn't have
really much choice.

203
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,982
Oh. So you<i> had to</i> organize
the educational conferences

204
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,517
for the next two months
and do my interview?

205
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,070
Well, I thought you were on
medical leave for preterm labor.

206
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:05,872
Romano told me to
keep this place running.

207
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,506
Well... I was on medical leave.

208
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,825
But now I'm back.

209
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,227
And I am ready to resume
all of my responsibilities

210
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,695
as associate chief of surgery.

211
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,863
And if anyone has
a problem with that...

212
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,288
they can come and see me.

213
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,803
Think Greene developed
that brain tumor

214
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,576
after she got pregnant?

215
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,117
Ahem. Can I help you?

216
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,652
Oh. A glass of
water would be nice.

217
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,454
My throat's a little dry.

218
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,689
Has anybody seen you?

219
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:40,789
Why, no.

220
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,859
I didn't want to bother anybody.

221
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,593
That's why we're here.

222
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,562
But you need to check
in with the receptionist

223
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,780
at the Admit desk.

224
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,315
And then you can
speak with a nurse.

225
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,718
I'm afraid there's nothing
they can do for me.

226
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:53,875
I'm dying.

227
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,159
Who's your doctor?

228
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,078
I don't have one. Never did.

229
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,530
Then how do you
know you're dying?

230
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,149
Oh. It's in the cards, dear.

231
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,251
Ah, you read tarot cards? Mm-hm.

232
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,687
Cards, palms, tea leaves.

233
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,289
Give me your hand.

234
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,340
Ah.

235
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,884
Come on. Ha-ha.
I won't hurt you.

236
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,530
Oh, my.

237
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:23,232
You do have a bit of a
black cloud hanging over you,

238
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,801
don't you, dear?

239
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,937
See, there... There's
a crack in your lifeline.

240
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,055
It's probably dry skin.

241
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,123
Listen, while I'm here,

242
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,693
why don't you let
me check you over.

243
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,795
Well, you can if you want to.

244
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:38,664
The cards have already told me.

245
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,168
I will be dead by sundown.

246
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:45,371
Bolus a liter of saline
and call Animal Control.

247
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,473
How's our old friend
Super Larry doing?

248
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:50,593
He's got a fever of 100.8,
but no source of infection.

249
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,795
You might wanna check
for an aspiration pneumonia.

250
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,096
Had one last year.

251
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,998
Hey, wake up, Super Larry.

252
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,599
You know, get a head CT.

253
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,552
He's got abrasions.
He might have fallen.

254
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,804
Well, you would too if
you slept on a sidewalk.

255
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,873
Hey, Dr. Weaver. This
is, uh, Detective Graham.

256
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,859
You ran off before I got
a chance to talk to you

257
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,895
this morning. Why do
you want to talk to me?

258
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,897
You saw a patient by the
name of Shannon Wallace

259
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,932
that Dr. Legaspi
also treated...? Yeah.

260
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:14,617
I called for the
psych consultation.

261
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,285
But you didn't stay with her?

262
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,487
No, we had a
mass-casualty situation.

263
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,373
She only had minor injuries.

264
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,958
So you effectively left

265
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,759
Dr. Legaspi alone
with the patient?

266
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,843
I suppose.

267
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,879
Are you aware that the
patient said Dr. Legaspi

268
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,297
sexually assaulted her?

269
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,631
Yes. And it's ridiculous.

270
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,650
The young woman had
psychological problems.

271
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,002
She tried to kill herself.

272
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,421
Nonetheless, we have to
follow up the accusations.

273
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,392
What exactly is your
relationship with Dr. Legaspi?

274
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,761
We're colleagues.

275
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,479
Do you live together?

276
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,414
No.

277
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,366
But you were at her
house early this morning...

278
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,235
Well, to be honest, I
really don't have time

279
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,252
for this right now.

280
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,409
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,842
County is hard-core
blood and guts.

282
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,144
But I guarantee...

283
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,845
you'll rack up more
surgical hours here

284
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,281
than anywhere in the country.

285
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,050
I must admit I'm
intrigued, Dr. Romano.

286
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,051
I'll be in touch.

287
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,435
I look forward to that.

288
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,591
Is she another one
of my replacements?

289
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,293
Lizzie, my, how you've grown.

290
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,561
How you feeling?

291
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,662
I was doing wonderfully
until I got in to work.

292
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,498
What work? I thought
you're on bed rest.

293
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,300
See, I wish people
would stop saying that.

294
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,268
I took a little time off
to recoup some energy,

295
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,336
but now I'm fine.

296
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,338
Oh, that would explain
the, uh, baby monitor

297
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,274
I see strapped to your belly.
Or are you just glad to see me?

298
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,942
I spent 48 hours
in the hospital.

299
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,744
Yes, I've been doing
home monitoring.

300
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,446
But I can assure
you, I'm ready, willing

301
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,181
and more than able
to return to work.

302
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,483
Mm-hm. For how long? A week?

303
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,184
Look, I appointed
you associate chief

304
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,186
so that I'd have a
lieutenant on the front lines

305
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,187
that I could count on.

306
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,422
Now, you want to be barefoot

307
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,591
and pregnant in the kitchen,
you have my blessing.

308
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,092
Go forth and multiply.

309
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,394
But this is why surgery's
an old boy's club.

310
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,563
Have you any idea
of the hospital's policy

311
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,865
on sexual harassment
and discrimination?

312
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,767
We still have one
of those? Yes, we do.

313
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,569
And I'd be so happy
to reacquaint you

314
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,238
on the section of
maternity leave.

315
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,607
Well, I'd rather do a
bowel resection. Thank you.

316
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,209
Do you know I read somewhere
about a pregnant woman

317
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,677
who killed her husband

318
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,013
and got off on a
temporary-insanity defense

319
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,714
because of her
hormone imbalance.

320
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,184
Okay, you want to work. Fine.

321
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,353
We're presenting three
cases for M and M tomorrow.

322
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,155
Pull the charts from
Medical Records,

323
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,756
track down the
x-rays in Radiology,

324
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,358
and get the slides
from Pathology.

325
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,659
No. No. I want back in Surgery.

326
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,294
Uh-uh-uh. First things first.

327
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,530
Then you can set up the,
uh, projection microscope

328
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,080
and make 35-millimeter slides

329
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,883
of the gross
pathology specimens.

330
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,134
Anything else? Yeah.

331
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,236
Make sure there's coffee
and doughnuts for 100.

332
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,388
Uh, especially ones
with little sprinkles on top.

333
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,506
<i>Give them back.</i>

334
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,673
Give them back! Shh.

335
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,609
Mr. Perkins, keep it
down... Give them back!

336
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,144
Sh, sh, sh.

337
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,246
This bitch stole my teeth.

338
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,547
You call me that one more time,

339
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,049
I'm gonna put that
Foley bag in you.

340
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,201
Okay, here. You might want to,

341
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:03,945
uh, wash these off bef...

342
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,828
fore you put them back in.

343
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,758
Abby. Can you help me with this?

344
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,127
Sure.

345
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,628
So how long has she been sick?

346
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,097
A few days. I-I thought
it was just a cold.

347
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,098
Any fever?

348
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,099
I don't think so.

349
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,135
Any problems with birth?

350
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,402
History of lung disease?

351
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,538
No, no. She's been
a really healthy baby.

352
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,041
Dr. Kovac, could I speak
with you for a minute?

353
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,043
Yeah. Get a quick set of vitals

354
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,311
and put her on a pulse ox.

355
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:31,847
So have you figured out

356
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,515
what's causing
Super Larry's fever?

357
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,850
No, no. Not yet.

358
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,019
I'm still waiting on the
lab for his blood work.

359
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,621
Maybe something will turn up.

360
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,955
Okay.

361
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,057
Luka, wait.

362
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,226
Uh... you're probably wondering

363
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,478
what that police detective
was all about today.

364
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:46,863
Not really.

365
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,616
There were some charges
filed against Dr. Legaspi.

366
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,151
Oh. I... I'd like to
keep the rumors

367
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:55,504
to a minimum... for
Dr. Legaspi's sake.

368
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,906
I understand. I only bring it up

369
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,758
because this place
seems to feed on gossip.

370
00:14:58,782 --> 00:14:59,825
And in light of an inves...

371
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:00,959
Dr. Weaver?

372
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,762
Dr. Romano's looking
for you. Thank you.

373
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,030
He said he wants to see
you at his office immediately.

374
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:07,300
Thanks. He also said if you
didn't come up the moment

375
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,557
you heard this message, he
was going to fire both of us.

376
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:19,583
Temp is 100.2, pulse is
120, with a pulse ox of 94.

377
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,517
That's not too bad. No wheezing.

378
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,185
I appreciated some retractions.

379
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,120
A little.

380
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,406
We'll get a chest
film just to make sure.

381
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,908
In the meantime, put some saline

382
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,109
in her nose for a few minutes

383
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,245
and, uh, use the bulb syringe.

384
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,246
See if that helps.

385
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,581
Is she gonna be okay?

386
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,983
Well, she doesn't have a fever,

387
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,285
and her lungs are pretty
clear, which is good.

388
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,087
Yeah, but she still
seems to have trouble

389
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,722
catching her breath.

390
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,058
Well, babies tend to
breathe through their nose,

391
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,360
so they have some difficulty
when they're stuffed up.

392
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,268
But I'm sure she'll be fine
once I help her with that.

393
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,036
He knows that I'm here, right?

394
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,188
Yes.

395
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,090
And he is aware that I am
working in the ER today?

396
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:06,091
I would imagine so.

397
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,226
Well, he made this sound

398
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,728
like it was some
kind of emergency.

399
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,313
I'm sure he won't
be much longer.

400
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,120
Okay. He can page
me when he's ready.

401
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,307
Dr. Legaspi.

402
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,359
Kerry.

403
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,059
What are you waiting
for, Dr. Weaver?

404
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,283
A written invitation?

405
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,620
Is that it?

406
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,755
Is it fixed? Can I go?

407
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,257
No. We have to put a splint
on you and check another x-ray.

408
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,859
Just try and relax, okay?

409
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,027
Malik... Ow.

410
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,596
Why don't you finish this splint

411
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,033
and order up a Chem-7,
cholesterol and a tox screen.

412
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,368
You got a skin infection
on your forehead.

413
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,671
And it could move into an
infection around your brain.

414
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,073
How's it going, Dave? Uh... Oh.

415
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,692
The Weasel is suffering
from a self-inflicted wound.

416
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,227
Weasel? That's my ring name.

417
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,162
Yeah. Todd's a
basement wrestler.

418
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,114
I had an uncle who
was a closet ballerina.

419
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,916
So is your friend
there a wrestler too?

420
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,017
James is awesome.

421
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,619
Calls himself Mr. Midnight.

422
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,120
How'd you manage to do this?

423
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,289
He sliced himself
with a razor blade.

424
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:12,508
It's called blading.
Fans love it.

425
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,542
Yeah, I bet.

426
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,593
You got this, Dave?

427
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,195
Yeah. I'm just
trying to convince

428
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,430
Superfly here that,

429
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,349
slicing open his scalp,
not such a good idea.

430
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,817
Update his tetanus
if he needs it.

431
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,585
Uh-huh. See?
There's another risk.

432
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,605
Tetanus. Huh? Then, of course,
there's nerve damage, otitis.

433
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,207
You could put your
eye out, you know?

434
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,874
A-and don't forget
about scarring.

435
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,477
Scarring's... That's
not a good one.

436
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:32,677
Chicks don't dig scarring.

437
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,446
They don't dig that
Frankenstein look,

438
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,465
if you know what I'm
saying? Right, Dr. Greene?

439
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:37,489
What's that?

440
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,573
Never mind.

441
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,404
At least give me a heads-up.

442
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,773
This is the first I've
heard of these allegations.

443
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,375
But you must have
had some indication

444
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,744
that she was a lesbian.

445
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,497
What has that got
to do with anything?

446
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:54,333
It seems to me that's the crux
of the problem, don't you think?

447
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:56,568
No. The problem seems
to be a false accusation

448
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,603
from a patient with
psychological problems.

449
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:00,989
She could have just as easily
made a similar indictment

450
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,391
against one of the male doctors.

451
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,781
Yeah, but she didn't, did she?

452
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,695
Have you had any
other complaints

453
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,848
against Legaspi in
the ER? Of course not.

454
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:11,750
And, uh, she's never displayed
any unacceptable sexual behavior

455
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,023
that you've witnessed?

456
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,740
Well...?

457
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,046
What do you think?

458
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:25,114
I'm getting a sneaking suspicion
that you're holding out on me.

459
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,699
Oh, please, Robert.

460
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,567
I think you're
trying to protect her.

461
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,869
Of course I'm trying to
protect her. You should be too.

462
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:32,838
She is a damn good doctor.

463
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,324
I'm calling for an emergency
disciplinary hearing today

464
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,742
with you and Anspaugh. Why?

465
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,294
You know these
charges are a joke.

466
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,162
No one's laughing, Kerry.

467
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,465
This is a witch hunt. No,
this is damage control.

468
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,933
Okay. Are we finished?

469
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:44,967
For now.

470
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,535
Can I give you
some friendly advice?

471
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,604
No!

472
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,341
Well, we spent an
hour hooking up two of

473
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,543
my grandfather's polo
ponies to this old pushcart.

474
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,711
Were you insane?

475
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,580
We were, like, 9. We
didn't know any better.

476
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:58,714
It was so cool.

477
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,316
It was just like
<i>Spartacus,</i> you know?

478
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,518
Right up until the part when
my grandmother sees us.

479
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,487
Oh, no. She screams.
The horses spook.

480
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,887
My cousin, as usual, bails.

481
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,623
The horses go one
way, I go the other,

482
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,191
and I'm left holding
onto the reins.

483
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,359
Um...

484
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,361
Actually, uh, I'm still
working on it. Thanks.

485
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,429
Thank you.

486
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,697
Yeah. So, um...

487
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,500
How was your... How
was the seminar today?

488
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,902
It was a lecture on
developmental psychology.

489
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,770
Freud, Piaget, Kohlberg.

490
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:22,994
It was boring.

491
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,590
Blast from the past, huh?

492
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:27,092
It's like being back in college.

493
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:28,344
Well, I am in college.

494
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,412
No, I meant as an undergraduate.

495
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,516
I am.

496
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,559
Mm.

497
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,408
Excuse me. I thought you
said you were a Pedes intern.

498
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,109
No, I'm doing a
child-life internship

499
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,344
in the Pedes Department.
I need 480 hours

500
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:48,046
of clinical
experience to certify.

501
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,280
And I figured if I start now,

502
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:51,950
I'll be done by the
time I graduate.

503
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:52,974
Graduate.

504
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:57,706
How old are you?

505
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,609
Twenty. Well, in September.

506
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,577
You're 19?

507
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,945
Yeah. Are you okay?

508
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,681
Oh, my God.

509
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,008
Hi.

510
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,723
Is she doing better?

511
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,492
Well, she's still not
getting as much air

512
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,660
into her lungs as we'd like.

513
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,061
It might just be her cold.

514
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,197
But we're gonna get a
chest x-ray just in case.

515
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,198
Can I go with her?

516
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,254
Of course.

517
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,901
Are you all right?

518
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,169
Yeah.

519
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,737
She just hasn't let
me get much sleep

520
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,938
in the last couple days.

521
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,542
Why don't you get a cup
of coffee while we wait.

522
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,898
Okay.

523
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,519
Hey. Hey.

524
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,504
You got a minute?

525
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:47,006
Sure.

526
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:50,075
What's up?

527
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,099
I just had...

528
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:54,112
Um. I just had
lunch with Rena...

529
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:56,314
and I think there's a problem.

530
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,767
What? She, uh, chews
with her mouth open?

531
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,069
She's young.

532
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,104
So? You're not exactly
an old man yourself.

533
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,272
You could use someone
to loosen you up a little bit.

534
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,641
She's really young.

535
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,142
What is she, like...

536
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,383
23 or something?

537
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:12,936
Twenty-two?

538
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:15,266
Is she 20?

539
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,586
In September. She's a teenager.

540
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,920
Carter. I know.

541
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,021
You didn't ask?

542
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,207
Women don't like
to tell you their age.

543
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:24,226
Well, she's not a
woman. She's a girl.

544
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,299
She's a woman. Believe me.

545
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,847
Did you sleep with her?

546
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,082
Oh, my God. You did.

547
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,201
I didn't know.
You couldn't tell?

548
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,139
Did you break up with her?

549
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,623
Not yet. What are
you waiting for?

550
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:39,991
Are you gonna call your lawyer?

551
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,993
Well, she's very
mature for her age.

552
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:43,946
She's cool. She's...
She's fun. She's...

553
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,410
She's Britney
Spear" little sister.

554
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:47,716
Thank you.

555
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,734
Excuse me?

556
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:49,735
Yeah?

557
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,569
Did they bring May to Radiology?

558
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,171
No. Not yet.

559
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:55,129
Then where is she?

560
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:57,965
Oh.

561
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:00,578
They must have picked her up

562
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,415
when I was in the hall
talking to Dr. Carter.

563
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:06,067
Darryl. Hey, Darryl.

564
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,936
Did you take the
little girl in Exam 4?

565
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,171
Not yet.

566
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,238
You didn't take her?

567
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,774
No. She's my next pickup, okay?

568
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,475
I-If he doesn't have
her, then who does?

569
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,243
She might've been
moved to another room.

570
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,479
Hey, hold that elevator.

571
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,647
Hoo. Is that May Jeffries?

572
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,648
Who?

573
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,100
Uh, May Jeffries.

574
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:22,901
She's a 4 month
old in Exam 4. Sorry.

575
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,669
Please tell me what's happening.

576
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,271
Okay. Just a second.

577
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,891
Haleh, did you move a
4-month-old baby out of Exam 4?

578
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,241
No.

579
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,276
I can't find her.

580
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,984
Where is she?

581
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,666
I need Security.

582
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,568
Where's Secur...?
What did they do...?

583
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,269
I need someone to
lock down the ER, now.

584
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,254
Dr. Greene?

585
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,721
Uh, Just a second.
Can you call...?

586
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:45,523
Dr. Greene, I'm
missing a patient, a baby.

587
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,092
I think someone
took her from Exam 4.

588
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,226
Oh, my God. What?

589
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,128
I-I was waiting for
transport to Radiology.

590
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:51,930
I just stepped outside
to talk to Carter...

591
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,832
Where's my baby?!
Alert Security.

592
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,167
Sorry. May! May!

593
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:57,151
Grab nurses. We'll do
a room-by-room search.

594
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,554
Hey!

595
00:22:58,578 --> 00:22:59,578
Hey!

596
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,063
Please... Look... Look out!

597
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,616
Uh...

598
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,199
Hold it! Hold it!

599
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,400
Wait.

600
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,123
What's your problem?

601
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,308
Sorry.

602
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,376
You didn't see
anyone enter the room?

603
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:35,908
Did you? What?

604
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:38,209
See anybody? A doctor,
a nurse, an orderly?

605
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,511
No. No.

606
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,312
I feel like I should
be helping them look.

607
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,214
Look. We've... We've
got that covered, okay?

608
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:44,767
We're searching the hospital.

609
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,168
How long were
you out of the room?

610
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,336
Like a minute. Maybe two.

611
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,037
You know, maybe
the person that took her

612
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,240
is distraught over recently
losing their own baby.

613
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,841
I could check the
hospital records.

614
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,110
We'll tell you if that's
something we want to pursue.

615
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,978
Did you see anyone
unusual in the vicinity?

616
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,947
Someone you didn't
recognize? This is an ER.

617
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,550
It's filled with strangers. I've
told you everything I know.

618
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,118
I feel like I'm
wasting my time here.

619
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,620
I-I-I should be doing something.

620
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:05,854
Just a few more questions.

621
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,555
It's okay, dear.

622
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,275
Sometimes God
calls little babies

623
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,466
home to be his angels.

624
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,582
Is there someone you would
like me to call to be with you?

625
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,884
Your husband, maybe?

626
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:20,785
I'm divorced.

627
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,453
What is his name?

628
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:23,955
Ed.

629
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,046
Ed Jeffries. But he
lives in Boston now.

630
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:31,329
Okay. The police would like
to ask you some questions.

631
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:33,465
Do you feel up to that?

632
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,400
Okay. I will be back when

633
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:38,035
they're done, and we'll talk.

634
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,326
Okay.

635
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:41,423
Hey. Hey.

636
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,114
How's she doing?
Better than I would be.

637
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,969
Um... how was your
meeting with Romano?

638
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,105
Homophobic. Misogynistic.

639
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,541
Ha. The usual.

640
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,276
Degrading.

641
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,510
What did you tell him?

642
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,912
The truth.

643
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,580
That Shannon Wallace
was a young woman

644
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,650
experiencing a severe
sexual-identity crisis.

645
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,153
She needed to know that
being gay is not an affliction.

646
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,657
Yeah. And what did
you tell him about us?

647
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,214
Oh.

648
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,228
Oh, I see.

649
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,429
Uh. Don't worry, Kerry.
Your secret's safe with me.

650
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,630
No, that's not what I meant.

651
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,233
No? No, what did
you mean? No, no.

652
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,801
You think that I am the only one

653
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,036
who has problems with this.

654
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,873
Th-th-th-that it's
universally accepted.

655
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,457
But that is not true. So, what?

656
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,459
So we're supposed to
skulk about in the shadows

657
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:37,078
because some narrow-minded
individuals disapprove...?

658
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,681
No. No. I just think that
you are fooling yourself if y...

659
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,016
How many openly gay women

660
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,752
do you know in hospital
administrative positions?

661
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,837
Kerry... None. It
doesn't happen.

662
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:47,539
What does that have
to do with anything?

663
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:50,008
I'm trying to explain to you
why this is difficult for me.

664
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:52,310
Guess what, Kerry,
this isn't about you.

665
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,012
This is about a
confused and frightened

666
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:56,064
young woman who
would rather kill herself

667
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,956
than deal with the
stigma of being gay.

668
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,941
Maybe it is about you.

669
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,667
Abby? What are you doing?

670
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,107
Nothing.

671
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:25,176
I, um... I heard about

672
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,800
a baby that got scooped up...

673
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,648
with the laundry
in another hospital.

674
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,416
I know it's stupid. I
just... I don't know.

675
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,585
Can you give me a hand
with a squirmer? Sure.

676
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,487
Sit still, Jason.

677
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,988
I just need to
look into your ears.

678
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,390
Do you think it's his adenoids?

679
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:40,775
His brother had to have
them taken out with his tonsils.

680
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,778
Abby, can you hold
him still, please?

681
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,281
Uh, Haleh, can you help Carter?

682
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,532
Sorry.

683
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:51,636
Excuse me.

684
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,137
Did you find her? Not yet.

685
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:54,906
Okay, I was thinking,
she's sick, right?

686
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,291
So whoever took her might...

687
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,760
Might take her to a pharmacy
to get some Infant Tylenol.

688
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,445
And they'll need
diapers and formula.

689
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:02,146
Right. Thanks. And
it also seems to me

690
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,865
that she's not in the
hospital anymore.

691
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,867
So shouldn't you guys
be setting up a roadblock

692
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,436
or checking the neighborhood?

693
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,903
We're doing everything we can.

694
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,022
Shouldn't we have
heard something by now?

695
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,225
I mean, the chances of
finding her get worse every...

696
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:15,093
Every passing second, right?

697
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:17,195
Abby? Abby?

698
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,097
Did you get the labs
back on the jaundice guy?

699
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:20,098
Who?

700
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,432
Jagadeeshan. No.

701
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:22,834
Oh, could you try and find them?

702
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:24,157
No. Sorry.

703
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,459
These are the most
recent photos I have.

704
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,728
Can I have them?

705
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,863
Look, uh...

706
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,164
I promise to return them.

707
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,748
May I, please?

708
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:40,252
Thank you.

709
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:42,554
Mrs. Jeffries, I know
I can't say anything

710
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,021
to change the situation.

711
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:46,258
I just wanted to tell
you how sorry I am.

712
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:48,426
She's my only baby.

713
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,650
I know.

714
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm sure she's gonna be fine.

715
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,525
Why would somebody take my baby?

716
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,776
Mr. Kinney can go home.

717
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,012
There's no known cure
for being a pain in the ass.

718
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:08,079
Hm-hm.

719
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,214
Any news on the baby?

720
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,448
Uh, nothing yet.

721
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,483
Dr. Greene, labs are
back on that wrestler.

722
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:13,618
Anything show up?

723
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,320
I don't know. What
were you looking for?

724
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:16,888
Nothing on the tox screen.

725
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:19,457
Cholesterol level's a
little high for a teenager.

726
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:20,491
Too much fast food.

727
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:21,960
I think he's on steroids.

728
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:24,595
He's got acute acne,
hirsutism, aggression.

729
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,997
What teenage boy doesn't?

730
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:28,233
What's the turnaround
time on a steroids test?

731
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:29,234
Five days?

732
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:30,535
At least.

733
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,603
Hey, look, if you think
he's using, just ask him.

734
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,961
He might cop to it.

735
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,659
I thought you forgot about me.

736
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,361
Look, man, I need
to go home, all right?

737
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,230
I ordered some tests.

738
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,849
What kind of tests?

739
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:47,069
The kind that show that
you're using steroids.

740
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,820
I don't know what
you're talking about.

741
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:49,954
I think you do.

742
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,088
What you might not know

743
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,824
is that you're putting
yourself at risk

744
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:55,360
for kidney failure,
stroke, impotence...

745
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:56,361
You're crazy.

746
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:57,729
Where are you going? Home.

747
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:58,797
Sit back down, James.

748
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,248
Screw you, man! I'm leaving!

749
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,349
No, you gotta stay here

750
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,034
until your parents
come and get you.

751
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,202
You called my parents?

752
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:06,288
Todd left. Somebody's
got to get you home.

753
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:07,489
Man, forget this! Come on.

754
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:08,473
Leave me alone!

755
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,497
Yah!

756
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,693
Hey, Dr. Greene.

757
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,663
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Just go get him.

758
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,047
Don't let him leave.

759
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,982
Hey. Hey, man,
what are you doing?

760
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,651
Leaving. Why? What
are you afraid of?

761
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,119
I'm not afraid of anything.
I've had enough of this place.

762
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:23,788
We weren't finished
working you up.

763
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,089
I mean, we're only here to help.

764
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:26,858
Then let me go.
What's the big rush?

765
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:29,460
All right, look. Look. Just...
Just take it easy, all right?

766
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:32,330
Stay out of my way, man!
Look, I don't want to hurt you!

767
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,433
Look, look, look. Just relax,
all right? Come back inside.

768
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,102
I mean it, man. You
can't keep me here!

769
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:39,204
My old man will be pissed
if you don't let me leave!

770
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:41,106
Your father would want
us to take care of you.

771
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,074
No, that doc's gonna
tell him I use steroids!

772
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:45,409
Look. My old man will
kill me if he finds out!

773
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,078
He doesn't have
to find out. All right?

774
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:48,479
But he said he
was gonna tell him!

775
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,248
Look, James, you
need to just settle down

776
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:52,066
and come inside, okay?

777
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,970
Look... you don't
know my father.

778
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,839
He'll kill me if he finds out.

779
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,675
You're right. I don't
know your father.

780
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,567
But I know the type.
Trust me, okay?

781
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,847
Okay? We'll work something out.

782
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,849
Right, Dr. Greene?

783
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,100
Sure. Come on.

784
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:10,456
You have my word on it.

785
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,693
Deal? Come on.

786
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,558
Hey, who's got
the guy in Exam 2?

787
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:17,659
Carter.

788
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,427
He's been restrained
in there for hours.

789
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,428
I hope so.

790
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,830
Did you see all
those bite marks?

791
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,331
Those are self-inflicted.

792
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,233
That guy practically
ate himself alive.

793
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,202
Get somebody from
Psych. Let's get rid of him.

794
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,404
We've been waiting. Psych's
been slower than usual

795
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,755
answering their consults.

796
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,724
I hear they got a
shakeup going on up there.

797
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,142
Dr. Legaspi's being fired.

798
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,545
Let's keep gossip
to a minimum, Haleh.

799
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:37,779
That's not gossip.

800
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,632
The gossip is she's
a lesbian. Legaspi?

801
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,017
That's what I heard.

802
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,518
Really? Oh, uh-huh.

803
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,108
Follow my finger.

804
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,189
What happened?

805
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,558
He got whacked in
the head by a patient.

806
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,360
Show me your teeth. I'm fine.

807
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,229
You should get a head CT.

808
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,581
I-I'm sorry about that,
man. I got a little worked up.

809
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,483
That's what steroid
rage will do to you.

810
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:00,902
Cleo, could you, uh,
find James a bed, please?

811
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,203
Sure. Come on.

812
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,188
Mark, you should get a head CT.

813
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:06,157
He didn't mean
it. He's just scared.

814
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:07,525
Scared he's gonna get busted.

815
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:09,460
Scared he's gonna get
the crap beat up of him.

816
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:11,896
The kid's petrified
of his old man.

817
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,364
I got a feeling he's
an abuse case.

818
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:14,865
Abuse? The kid's a tank.

819
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,502
The steroids, the aggression,
the tough-guy routine.

820
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,404
It's a... It's a defense
mechanism, trust me.

821
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:22,573
I don't think you
should tell his parents.

822
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:24,709
Too late. They're
on their way. Wha...?

823
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,811
I said we'd work something
out. I gave him my word.

824
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:29,648
Well, you shouldn't
have. He's not your patient.

825
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:31,032
Tumor!

826
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,867
What was that?

827
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,819
The old Dr. Greene
would have helped this kid.

828
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:36,471
I am.

829
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,856
Maybe there's something to
this competency stuff, huh?

830
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,014
Keep it up, Malucci. You'll
be looking for a new job.

831
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,632
Her name's May.

832
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,766
And she's really...

833
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,269
got a pretty bad cold,

834
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:54,694
so... if you could
just please return her.

835
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:58,265
She's just a baby.

836
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:03,114
It doesn't matter
why you took her.

837
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:07,318
It's just that sh-sh... She
really needs medication.

838
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,754
If you could just
bring her back.

839
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,745
Have somebody bring her in.

840
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:15,192
And drop her off at
the police department.

841
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:17,094
Call an ambulance.

842
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:20,582
You should have your coat on.

843
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,216
I'm okay.

844
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
Why don't you come back inside?

845
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,555
Come on. You can
help me cast the twins

846
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,524
who rode their wagon
down the basement steps.

847
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:30,747
You should get someone else.

848
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,250
I want you.

849
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,165
Um... Uh...

850
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,322
Could you just leave
me alone, please?

851
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,154
I can't do that.

852
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:50,729
I lost that woman's baby.

853
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:52,097
No, you didn't. Yes, I did.

854
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:54,521
No, you didn't.

855
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:05,248
Real nice. Can't
take notes in class.

856
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,731
Dad, it's not that bad.

857
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,298
How we doing in here?

858
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,299
You a nurse?

859
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,533
Doctor.

860
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,586
You Greene? Malucci.

861
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,255
They told me I was supposed
to wait here for Dr. Greene.

862
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,673
I was assisting Dr. Greene.

863
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,375
Yeah, fine, whatever.

864
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,410
So is he gonna be okay or what?

865
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,513
Well, he dislocated his
hand, but it'll heal. Hm.

866
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,803
What about his head?

867
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,185
He didn't injure his head.

868
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,352
Oh, no?

869
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,154
Jumping around in a
costume like an idiot.

870
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,440
Seems like a sign of brain
damage, if you ask me.

871
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:37,992
Yeah. Can I speak
with you outside, please?

872
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,694
Yeah.

873
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,251
Get yourself together.
We're leaving right after this.

874
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,533
What are you doing?

875
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,067
What?

876
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,169
Your son, you
know, hurt himself.

877
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,671
He... He needs a
little compassion.

878
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,108
And... And you come in
here and you humiliate him.

879
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,327
You don't know him.
He needs discipline.

880
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,129
He's always doing
stupid stuff like this.

881
00:33:58,153 --> 00:33:59,930
Ever wonder why?

882
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,474
Maybe there's a reason
he behaves this way.

883
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:05,270
Yeah. It's called being crazy.

884
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,639
And a cure for it's a
good kick in the ass.

885
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:09,641
Around here we
call that abuse, man.

886
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:10,842
Oh, get out of here. Hold on.

887
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,043
Where are you going?

888
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,181
Go work on your golf game,<i> doc.</i>

889
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:20,185
Golf?

890
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:22,070
What the hell is going on?

891
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,655
Son of a bitch, I'm
gonna sue your ass!

892
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,057
Oh. Kiss it while you're at
it. Malucci, get out of here.

893
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,858
The guy abuses his
son. Malucci, out now!

894
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:29,026
Let's go!

895
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,695
Why don't you let
me take a look at that?

896
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,951
Get away from me.

897
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,107
Ah-ah.

898
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,172
Are you sure you've
done this before?

899
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,507
Yes.

900
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,508
Ow!

901
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:44,809
I'm sorry.

902
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,061
I'm having a... A little
trouble finding the vein.

903
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,280
Can I get another
nurse over here, please?!

904
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:50,381
Shh!

905
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:51,766
Let me just take a little break.

906
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,390
Yeah.

907
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,192
Ow.

908
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:58,489
Is there anything I can get you?

909
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,846
Just my baby.

910
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,944
Maybe you should go home.

911
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,113
I'm sure someone will
call you if we hear anything.

912
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,803
I don't think I can
leave without her.

913
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,807
Okay.

914
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:18,392
Oh, not you again.

915
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,077
This is County.

916
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:22,446
<i>County, this is
Rescue 62 en route</i>

917
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,748
<i>with what appears to be a
3-to 4-month-old infant girl</i>

918
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,417
<i>found abandoned
on the El platform.</i>

919
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:27,451
What's her status?

920
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:29,136
<i>Pulse 120. Resps 60.</i>

921
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,305
<i>Got a weak cry and
is cold to the touch.</i>

922
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,140
Uh, is there any sign of trauma?

923
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,809
<i>No.</i> Is she alert?

924
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,410
<i>Hard to tell. She's a baby.</i>

925
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,780
Is she making eye
contact? <i>Not really.</i>

926
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,164
What's your ETA? <i>Less than five.</i>

927
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,874
Did you talk to Rena? What?

928
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,026
Your, um...

929
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,628
That child-life
specialist... Oh.

930
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:54,996
No, not yet. But I'm...

931
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,130
You know, where are they?

932
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,865
It's been, like,
almost 10 minutes.

933
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,166
I think I hear an ambulance.

934
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,687
Oh, God. I hope it's her.

935
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,022
I'm sure it is.

936
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:07,191
It's gotta be, right? Yeah.

937
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:09,695
I mean, how many kids
can they find in one day?

938
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,537
Open up! Okay!

939
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:22,440
Okay. Pulse ox is down to 89.

940
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:23,441
Abby, is that her?

941
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:24,730
It's her.

942
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:28,112
I need a core temperature,
put the monitors on

943
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,580
and get me a 24-gauge angiocath.

944
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,982
Where'd they find her?

945
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:32,249
May? Is she okay?

946
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,351
El station. Everything's
gonna be fine.

947
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,237
Whoever stole her
panicked and dumped her.

948
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,339
Let the doctors work.
No, I want to stay here.

949
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,374
Come on. May!

950
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:40,641
Okay Abby, I got it from here.

951
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,626
I've got to start an IV.

952
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,127
I think you should step out.

953
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:44,579
Let me do this, Luka, please.

954
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,331
Hypothermic. Core temp, 93.

955
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:48,499
Okay. Put her on
heated humidified O-2,

956
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,935
get a warm blanket,
some warming lamps...

957
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,687
and a set of heated D5,
and a half at 30 cc's per hour.

958
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,672
Anything else?

959
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,641
No. That's good.

960
00:36:56,665 --> 00:36:59,059
Okay. You're okay, May.

961
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,144
Shh.

962
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,162
You're safe now.

963
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,563
You're gonna be okay. Sh-sh-sh.

964
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,466
Oh, yeah.

965
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,769
Let me get this here.
You're gonna be okay.

966
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,503
This is pathetic.

967
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,705
Not a single
trauma in the bunch.

968
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,129
Oh. Hello.

969
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,777
That's mine. What are you doing?

970
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:16,778
Go home, Dave.

971
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:17,845
I'm on till 8:00.

972
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,346
No, you're not.
As a matter of fact,

973
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,948
you're not on for
the rest of the week.

974
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:21,949
Wait, wait. Says who?

975
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,184
Says me.

976
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,987
Does Weaver know
about this? She will.

977
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,588
Is this because I
defended myself?

978
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,589
Mark!

979
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,657
Goodbye, Dave.

980
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,225
I just heard that
you were attacked.

981
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,326
Why didn't you call me?

982
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,528
No big deal. I just
ran into an elbow.

983
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,763
Well, did you get a CT?

984
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,464
Ahem. No. I'm fine. Really.

985
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,667
I'm just glad I didn't opt
for the surgical Velcro

986
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,669
when they put my
skull back together.

987
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,671
How are you doing?

988
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,372
Well, Romano's
trying to replace me.

989
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,008
Um, he wouldn't
let me do surgery.

990
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,676
So I spent the day
doing wedding stuff.

991
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,877
I'm not wearing a kilt.

992
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,212
You'd look really handsome.

993
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,181
Dr. Romano's
looking for you again.

994
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:55,116
Oh, wonderful. Hey, um, Mark.

995
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,518
This, uh, came for you today.

996
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,486
I-I'm gonna be in
Romano's office.

997
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,522
These are my competency results.

998
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,241
You wait until the
end of the shift?

999
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:05,576
I... I'm sorry. I forgot.
I've be... I've been busy.

1000
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,960
You forgot? How
could you forget?

1001
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,215
You wanna open them?

1002
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,271
No.

1003
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:30,889
Oh, Mark.

1004
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:35,723
I passed.

1005
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,625
Don't look so surprised.

1006
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,893
Stop it!

1007
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,694
Well, you had your
doubts, didn't you?

1008
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:41,762
You had your moments.

1009
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,431
Dr. Greene,
Dr. Corday, good night.

1010
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,565
Good night, Carter.

1011
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,667
Hey, where you
going, Georgia? Home.

1012
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,008
I guess you're not dying
today after all then, huh?

1013
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:53,491
John!

1014
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:54,791
Hey. Hey.

1015
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:56,093
What are you doing down here?

1016
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:57,261
Looking for you. I'm off.

1017
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:58,496
You almost finished?

1018
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,797
I got like two hours
of charts to finish here.

1019
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,833
Can you do it over
garlic noodles?

1020
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:04,101
I don't think so.

1021
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,237
Come on. I'll get some
takeout, a bottle of wine,

1022
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,538
you can do your charts.

1023
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:09,673
Uh, ah... I don't drink.

1024
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,393
And... it's illegal for
you to purchase alcohol.

1025
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:15,296
The age thing again.

1026
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,531
I like you a lot, Rena.

1027
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,067
You wish I was older.

1028
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,487
I guess I should
enjoy this while it lasts.

1029
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:24,221
Uh, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to...

1030
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:26,295
No. Please. Hm. Forget it.

1031
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,915
I'm young. We heal fast.

1032
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:32,797
I'll see you around. Yeah.

1033
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,323
Are Dr. Romano and
Dr. Anspaugh still here?

1034
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,481
Uh, they're waiting for
you in the conference room.

1035
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:54,685
Dr. Weaver. Better
late than never.

1036
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,086
Let's cut to the
chase, shall we?

1037
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,573
So that we can all get out
of here and go home. Okay.

1038
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,741
Dr. Legaspi recently,
for whatever reasons, had

1039
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:04,111
what I hope was a
momentary lapse in judgment.

1040
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,747
I take offense to that.

1041
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:08,282
Really? Well, I take offense
to you having come out

1042
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,535
to your patient, which
was grossly inappropriate...

1043
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,671
Dr. Legaspi is a valuable asset
to the Psychiatry Department

1044
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:15,539
as well as this
hospital as a whole.

1045
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,308
I think that her
instincts were correct

1046
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,644
and her intentions
very honorable...

1047
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,295
considering the situation.

1048
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,531
Honorable, perhaps.
Stupid, definitely.

1049
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,965
Oh, come on, Robert.

1050
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,968
Patients with
psychological problems

1051
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,770
falsely accuse their
doctors of all sorts of things.

1052
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,723
I had a guy today blame
me for hypnotizing him

1053
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:34,692
in order to drink his blood.

1054
00:40:34,716 --> 00:40:37,145
Well, we'll have to look
into that another day, Donald.

1055
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,013
But the fact is, to the
best of my knowledge,

1056
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,414
you are not actually a vampire.

1057
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,117
Dr. Legaspi, however,
is a lesbian. Am I right?

1058
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,619
I've never hidden that fact

1059
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,821
from this administration
or my colleagues.

1060
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:48,522
Or from your patients,
for that matter,

1061
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,608
wherein lies the problem.
There's a difference

1062
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:53,394
between being gay and
being a child molester.

1063
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,929
Okay. My recommendation
is administrative leave

1064
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,498
pending the criminal hearing.

1065
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,133
I think that's premature.

1066
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,718
No. It's preemptive.

1067
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:03,103
If we get really lucky,
there won't be any charges

1068
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,571
and you can come
right back to work

1069
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,595
having learned a lesson,
albeit the hard way.

1070
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,613
Do you have anything
to add, Dr. Weaver...

1071
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,216
considering you are one of them?

1072
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,400
Them?

1073
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:18,152
A female physician dealing with

1074
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,420
female patients. No.

1075
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,689
Yes. I think that Dr. Legaspi...

1076
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,813
is a wonderful doctor.

1077
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,496
And I... don't think that
she did any of the things

1078
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,153
that she's accused of doing.

1079
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,535
Well, that's well-spoken.

1080
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,704
Kerry, that's very convincing.

1081
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,106
Please remind me never to
ask you to testify on my behalf.

1082
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,432
Okay. Meeting is adjourned.
I have dinner plans.

1083
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:49,005
Pay no attention to him.

1084
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,384
This, too, will pass.

1085
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,814
I'm sorry.

1086
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,028
I'm s... Kim.

1087
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,429
Kim, please don't.

1088
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,565
Kim... Please.

1089
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,533
Uh, please...
Please stop. I'm so...

1090
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,802
I'm so sorry.

1091
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:10,404
Let's just get out of
here and talk about this.

1092
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,606
There's really
nothing to talk about.

1093
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,874
What did you expect me to say?

1094
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,899
I am so sorry, Kim.

1095
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,169
Me too.

1096
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,782
Go back to your life, Kerry...

1097
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,534
Don't... No, don't.
You can't do this.

1098
00:42:23,558 --> 00:42:24,752
We have something good.

1099
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:25,819
What? What do we have?

1100
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,521
A relationship that
you're ashamed to

1101
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,839
acknowledge in public?

1102
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:31,107
I know, you're right. I
wish I could be like you.

1103
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,860
I wish I could be as confident

1104
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,428
and secure with this as you are.

1105
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:36,913
But I am not you.

1106
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:38,782
I have been on the
outside my whole life

1107
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,684
fighting for acceptance
and respect.

1108
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:44,338
And now you're asking
me to do it all over again?

1109
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:45,940
I'm not asking you for anything.

1110
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,461
Don't, please. I just...
I... I need more time.

1111
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,296
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

1112
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,986
Please, Kim. Kim.

1113
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,066
I missed you.

1114
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:09,680
Hi.

1115
00:43:09,704 --> 00:43:11,014
She's smiling.

1116
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:12,483
All her tests came back normal.

1117
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,987
She wasn't hurt.
She's gonna be fine.

1118
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,507
But I would like to keep
her overnight for observation.

1119
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:22,143
Is that necessary? You just
said she's gonna be okay.

1120
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,944
Just a precaution. I
pulled some strings.

1121
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,078
And got her a private room,

1122
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,730
and I'm having them
set up a bed for you.

1123
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,983
Oh, okay. Thanks.

1124
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,735
Is there anything else you need?

1125
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:33,237
No, she's all I need.
