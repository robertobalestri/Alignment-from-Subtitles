1
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,247
Hold on!

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,671
All right!

3
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,094
Coming.

4
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,109
Sorry. Did I wake you?

5
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,711
Uh, yeah, kind of.

6
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,852
Dr. Kovac ordered breakfast.

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,877
Oh, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,890
Have a good day. You too.

9
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:58,201
Sorry. I... I told him
to leave it outside.

10
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,987
That's okay. I had to get up.

11
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,227
Have some if you want.

12
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,124
No, thanks.

13
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,460
You want to take a
shower? I'm almost done.

14
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,761
Nah.

15
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:08,945
I have to stop home.

16
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:10,964
You working today?

17
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:11,988
Yeah.

18
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,251
Are you?

19
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,540
No, no.

20
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,647
Okay.

21
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,036
See you later, then.

22
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,794
Morning.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,774
Morning.

24
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:38,775
How was your night?

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,243
What's all this?

26
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,201
Mmm. I borrowed the
sewing machine from Marge.

27
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,582
Who's Marge?

28
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,517
Marge is your neighbor in 2A.

29
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,119
An adorable woman.
I'll introduce you to her.

30
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,155
Divorced.

31
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,222
Coffee's fresh.

32
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,546
Thanks.

33
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:57,743
You been up all night?

34
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,829
No. I got up early
just to finish this.

35
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,186
I have a big interview today.

36
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,935
Where'd you get all that fabric?

37
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,502
Sale at the yardage
store. Big sale.

38
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,194
And then I talked them
into a bit more of a discount.

39
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,408
Honey, I'm sorry.

40
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,876
I used the money you
gave me for bus fare.

41
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,028
I know it wasn't my money.

42
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,447
I will pay you back just
as soon as I get this job.

43
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,950
It's a fabulous place.
Fabulous. Very high-end.

44
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,451
Big commissions.

45
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,041
I'll buy us all-new furniture.

46
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:28,841
There. Finished. Tell
me what you think.

47
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:31,110
I copied it from something
I saw in a magazine.

48
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,913
You know, the
skirt and everything.

49
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:34,902
I shortened the
jacket. I changed...

50
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,855
You don't like it.

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,503
No, I do.

52
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,937
Do you? Heh-heh.

53
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,673
Oh, you know what I got you?

54
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,876
Something great.
Knit-jersey fabric.

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,361
I love the jersey. Where is it?

56
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,796
I'm gonna make you something.

57
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,198
Make that Euro-doctor
stand up and take notice.

58
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:53,600
Euro-doctor?

59
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:56,235
I've been here long enough
to know what's happening.

60
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,237
As far as I'm concerned
he's very handsome

61
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,990
but too old to be
playing hard to get.

62
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,409
Well, I thought I had him.

63
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,778
You do. You just
don't know you do.

64
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:07,068
When you're not looking,
he stares at you all the time.

65
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,867
Ah! Here it is. Come here.

66
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,535
Come here. Come here. Come here.

67
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,637
We're gonna make one of
those wraparound dresses

68
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,506
with a plunging neckline.

69
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,458
There we go.

70
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,709
He stares at me?

71
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,261
All the time.

72
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,762
I'm gonna take
some measurements.

73
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,265
Oh, no, no. I have to shower.
I have to work this morning.

74
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,567
Uh, honey, my... My
interview isn't until noon.

75
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:30,554
Maybe we could have
breakfast? Okay. If there's time.

76
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,977
Well, hurry up.

77
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,751
Honey, have you got any...?

78
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,071
What are you doing?

79
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:03,169
Counting your pills.

80
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:04,170
Why?

81
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,504
Just checking.

82
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,540
I told you I'd
take them. I know.

83
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:08,763
Did I pass inspection?

84
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,429
You taking any Prozac?

85
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,830
I'm normal. I'm normal.

86
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,932
I'm a little nervous
about this interview, but...

87
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,117
Prozac. Zoloft. Effexor.
I gave them to you.

88
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,469
Did you get more? How?

89
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,670
Mom.

90
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,472
Look, I told you.
I promised you.

91
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,773
You don't believe me?

92
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,775
Can you do me a favor?

93
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,694
Anything. Come to
the hospital with me.

94
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,796
What for? A blood test.

95
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,620
A blood test? Yes.

96
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,084
Would you do that for me?

97
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,409
Sure. Sure, I'd do
anything for you.

98
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,379
There was no epidural.

99
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,714
I was the only one
remotely close to the dura.

100
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,783
Answer the questions
honestly. You'll do fine.

101
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,068
I had to have punctured it.

102
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,788
It's a known risk. It does
not constitute negligence.

103
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,790
Mark, missing a leak does.

104
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,659
I don't even remember looking
before I removed the endoscope.

105
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,045
You've done 100 of these.
You know the procedure.

106
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,179
There was a bad outcome.

107
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:54,997
They're looking for
someone to blame.

108
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,855
It doesn't mean you
did anything wrong.

109
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,636
Do you want me to
ride with you there?

110
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,637
No, go to work.

111
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,261
You sure? Mm-hm.

112
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,593
Hey. Don't go jogging
into any more street signs.

113
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,577
Hard as a rock. Apparently not.

114
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,348
How long do these
depositions usually last?

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,401
Call me if it goes
past midnight.

116
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,518
What?

117
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,375
I'm just kidding.

118
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:26,446
I hate to go on an interview
with a big Band-Aid on my arm.

119
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,913
What will they think?

120
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,582
You have a suit jacket.

121
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:32,885
Yeah. Yeah, well, hope
I don't have to take it off

122
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,754
if the room gets
warm or something.

123
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:35,955
Tell them you gave blood.

124
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,725
Yes. I don't wanna
be late, though.

125
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:41,428
Rule number one is, do
not be late for an interview.

126
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:43,880
This will just take a
minute. I'd like to be early.

127
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,633
What if I go and come back?
Then if you want to do this...

128
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,768
Okay. Hold still.

129
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,336
I... I just don't
understand, Abby.

130
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,071
I mean, you've let
me in your home.

131
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,807
We're getting along so
well. This is an absolute gift.

132
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,909
I mean, what will taking
my blood accomplish?

133
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,062
Nothing, hopefully.
Wait, stop. Stop. Stop.

134
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,864
Listen to me, honey. Listen.

135
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,967
When this test comes
back negative or positive

136
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,869
or whatever it's supposed to be,

137
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,754
then you're gonna feel
foolish and I'm gonna be hurt.

138
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,691
And then you're gonna feel bad.

139
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,710
You can't touch the
vein after I've cleaned it.

140
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,511
That can't be what
you want! It's not.

141
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,895
Then, honey, let's
just not do this!

142
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,450
Need some help in here?

143
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,652
No, we're fine.

144
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,636
Hi, Dave.

145
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,005
Hey. Hello, Mrs. Lockhart.

146
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,474
Oh, it's Wyczenski.

147
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,642
Right. Right. Are
you not feeling well?

148
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,394
No. Why, do I look sick?

149
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,729
No, no.

150
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,347
Actually, you look great.

151
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,671
Oh, thank you.
You look good too.

152
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,986
Thank you.

153
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,237
Uh, what's the draw for?

154
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,960
I'm giving blood.

155
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,178
What? That's what
you told me to say.

156
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,997
Go. Just go. Go ahead.

157
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,533
What? Go. I don't
want you to be late.

158
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,634
Really? Yes.

159
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,235
Honestly? Yes.

160
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,592
Sweetie, I love you.

161
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,194
Okay. Thank you.

162
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,577
Bye, Dave. It's good
to see you, Miss W.

163
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,412
Miss W. Oh, I like that. Miss W.

164
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:07,430
I'll call you,

165
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,215
let you know how it goes.

166
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,351
Mwah, mwah, mwah. Bye.

167
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,436
Must be nice having
such good genes.

168
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,704
Knowing that you're gonna
grow up looking like that.

169
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,968
You got a...

170
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:20,793
Is this about a patient? No.

171
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:21,927
Bye, Randi. Hi, Maggie.

172
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,497
Oh, love that top! Oh, thanks.

173
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:26,265
He's supposed to be working.

174
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,469
Abby, have you seen Dr. Malucci?

175
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:30,903
He's around here somewhere.

176
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,572
Just tell him
Stephanie stopped by.

177
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,807
Your last name? He
knows my last name.

178
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:36,743
Uh-huh.

179
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,679
I don't get it. He had another
girl looking for him yesterday.

180
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,981
You fire enough shots,
eventually you hit something.

181
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,132
Or catch something.

182
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,134
Don't knock it till you try it.

183
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,586
What?

184
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,639
Abby! Abby! A girl out here
needs help! She's bleeding!

185
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,558
Some kids, they just
threw her from a car.

186
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,865
Honey, honey, here
you are. Take this.

187
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,934
What happened? They
hardly stopped the car.

188
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,935
I'm okay.

189
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,436
No, you're not. Mom, step back.

190
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,538
Okay. Let's sit down.
Come on. Careful.

191
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,106
Oh! Oh! Okay, okay.

192
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,674
What's your name? Kynesha.

193
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,860
Okay, Kynesha. Lean
back. Let me take a look.

194
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,445
Did someone beat you up?

195
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,696
I fell. Nonsense.

196
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,997
Honey, who did this?

197
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,283
Mom, go to your
interview. I'm trying to help.

198
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,451
We don't need your help. Go.

199
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,869
Did you lose consciousness?

200
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,672
No, no... Ah! Any
trouble breathing?

201
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,958
Get a gurney and page X-ray.

202
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,665
Abby? Yeah.

203
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,663
Mr. Resnik called
from the garage.

204
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:31,864
He's on his way up now.

205
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:32,954
Thank you.

206
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,837
We'll wait another five
minutes, and then we'll leave.

207
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,638
I can stay. I've taken
the whole day off.

208
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,441
No. We shouldn't have to
play these kind of games.

209
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,943
Gordy, good to see you.

210
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,562
Bruce. Sorry to
keep you waiting.

211
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,097
There was a pileup on the
expressway. A real mess.

212
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,450
I'm sure. You
must be Dr. Corday.

213
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,952
Yes. Bruce Resnik. A pleasure.

214
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,927
They didn't tell me
you were so stunning.

215
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,993
That's okay. You
don't have to respond.

216
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,694
Has the court
reporter set up, Fran?

217
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:02,879
In the library.

218
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,802
Well, let's get going.

219
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,837
After you.

220
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,524
Hey, Irene. How
are you this morning?

221
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,293
Fine, Mr. Resnik. Yourself?

222
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,845
Can't complain.
Hey, how are you?

223
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,979
Fine, thank you.

224
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,715
Please, have a seat.

225
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,616
Ignore the camera.

226
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,735
Thank you.

227
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,072
Everyone was rubbernecking
past this accident.

228
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,158
I waited my turn. So,
of course, I take a look.

229
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,359
You know, human nature.

230
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,061
And these firemen are using

231
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:38,831
one of those big
steel, um, things to cut.

232
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,034
What do you call
them? Uh, Jaws of Life.

233
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,735
Jaws of Life! Right.

234
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,504
I mean, it looked
pretty dangerous to me.

235
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:45,505
You ever use one?

236
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,290
No, not personally.

237
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,925
It was cutting into the
car like a can opener.

238
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,260
Anyway, shall we start?

239
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,428
Certainly.

240
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,932
Please raise your right hand.

241
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,333
Sit down.

242
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,636
There's no Bible? No.

243
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,272
Do you swear to tell the truth
in this matter, so help you God?

244
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,274
Yes. RESNIK: We
are on the record

245
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,611
in a deposition on the behalf
of the plaintiff, Al Patterson.

246
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,747
His attorney's Bruce Resnik.
Gordon Price for the defense.

247
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,899
Doctor, state and spell
your name for the record.

248
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,070
Elizabeth Corday. C-O-R-D-A-Y.

249
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,238
Doctor, how long have
you been a surgeon?

250
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,439
Including Residency? Yes.

251
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:21,658
Ten years.

252
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,793
Have you ever had a...?
A deposition taken before?

253
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,878
No, this is the first.

254
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,047
After 10 years,
that's pretty good.

255
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,917
Well, only three
have been in America.

256
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,239
Touché.

257
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,405
Extraocular
movements are intact.

258
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,390
Okay, Kynesha.

259
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:38,591
We need to remove your pants

260
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,192
so I can check
for injuries, okay?

261
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:41,694
It's just my face.

262
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,918
I know, but we
still need to check.

263
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,088
I'll be right back.

264
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,038
Hey, Peter.

265
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:53,172
Hey.

266
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:54,941
There's an inguinal
hernia in Curtain 3.

267
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,826
Could you take a look? Yeah.

268
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,593
After the assault
victim. We've got it.

269
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,029
Probably a facial fracture.

270
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,165
Well, I'll clear the belly.

271
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,699
She's stable.

272
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,102
There's blood in her underwear.
She says it's her period.

273
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,539
Get a rape kit.

274
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,557
Peter, wait.

275
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,192
You shouldn't take this one.

276
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,794
Why?

277
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,685
It's Jesse's girlfriend.

278
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,022
I can take care of her.

279
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:24,904
I'm gonna come in close

280
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:27,056
and check the back of your eyes.

281
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,458
Let's take a look
in your ears now.

282
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,093
Peter.

283
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,862
Good. No hemotympanum.

284
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,063
And what's that?

285
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,765
That means you
didn't crack your skull.

286
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,571
I'm Dr. Benton. I know.

287
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,520
Anyone you want us to call?

288
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:42,955
Mother, father?

289
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,259
She won't be home.

290
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,660
<i>The re-enhancing lesion</i>

291
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,553
and central necrosis on
MRI was, uh, suspicious.

292
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,168
The biopsy confirms it.

293
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,069
Another pathologist
should take a look.

294
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,771
Could be an astrocytoma.

295
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,474
Two neuro specialists reviewed
the slides independently.

296
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:03,542
They concur.

297
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:04,566
It's a GBM.

298
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,232
What's the survival rate?

299
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,067
Untreated, eight weeks.

300
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,501
But with radiation therapy,

301
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,303
the average increases
six to nine months.

302
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,372
You need to go see a
radiation oncologist today.

303
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,191
Wait... Wha...?
What about surgery?

304
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,944
Uh, I'm afraid the
tumor is inoperable.

305
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,479
Why?

306
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,147
It looks like it
invaded Broca's area.

307
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,033
The speech arrest
you were experiencing

308
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,069
was probably the
result of a focal seizure.

309
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,904
Even if we removed
the entire tumor,

310
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,805
you'd most likely be
left with the inability

311
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,142
to speak and
understand language.

312
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,378
Communication. More
than communication.

313
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,380
You'd... You'd lose all
ability to comprehend,

314
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,948
interact with the
world around you.

315
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:45,818
Essentially, what
makes you human.

316
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,387
Even if you consented,

317
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,988
I wouldn't even
consider operating.

318
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,546
We'll keep you on Dilantin,
uh, 300 milligrams daily.

319
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,890
Do you have
disability insurance?

320
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,894
Dr. Greene?

321
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,647
Yeah.

322
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,001
What's going on, Carter?
Why are we so backed up?

323
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,569
Uh, I... I just got here.

324
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,205
Weaver's not on till tonight.
This happens when she's off.

325
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,706
Hey, what happened to your head?

326
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,243
Oh, uh, jogging. I
ran into a street sign.

327
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,944
She left you a note.

328
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,846
Take the shoulder
pain and the vertigo.

329
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,615
Dr. Greene, guy
with palpitations.

330
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,419
Tachycardic at 300. BP is
100/70. Normal mentation.

331
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,421
Uh, six of adenosine.
I'll be right there.

332
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,990
Whoa, did you say
heart rate was 300?

333
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:41,991
Yeah.

334
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,458
If it's Wolff-Parkinson-White,

335
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,027
adenosine could
put him into V-fib.

336
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,529
Oh, yeah, right. 100
milligrams procainamide.

337
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,331
IV every 10 minutes.

338
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,000
Thanks, Carter. Sure. You okay?

339
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,568
Yeah. It's just, uh...
It's been a long morning.

340
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,971
Listen, we have to do a
blood and urine test on you.

341
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,406
It's your three-month mark.

342
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,573
Right now?

343
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,742
Sometime in the next
six hours. Whenever.

344
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,744
Listen, if you want
privacy, I'll do the stick.

345
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,679
Otherwise, you can ask a nurse.

346
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,448
Um, yeah, I'll ask Abby. Okay.

347
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,716
Randi, what's open?

348
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,919
Exam 1. Meet you there.

349
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:14,094
Liver and spleen are good.
No peritoneal free fluid.

350
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:17,343
No lacerations or contusions.

351
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,679
Kynesha, when's the last
time you had intercourse?

352
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,135
I don't remember.

353
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,099
Woods lamp.

354
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,989
I'll get the lights.

355
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,623
What's that do?

356
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:32,927
Hold on.

357
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,329
There's no semen.

358
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,996
What? BENTON: We got abrasions,

359
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
but no stridor.

360
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,834
I need to do a pelvic
exam, Kynesha.

361
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,919
Do you know what that is?

362
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,754
No. I'm on my
period. I told you.

363
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,922
I still need to check.

364
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,223
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

365
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,758
Let me go! Come
on. Hey, calm down.

366
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,345
Kynesha, it's important
we give you an exam.

367
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,896
Not down there.
Just fix my face.

368
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,599
Look, we know it's hard, but if
someone sexually assaulted you,

369
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,468
we have to check.

370
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,405
I didn't get raped. I
got beat up. That's all.

371
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,522
Who beat you up?

372
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,524
I got jumped out. No big thing.

373
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,509
Of a gang? I did okay.

374
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,979
Some girls get real messed up.

375
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,619
I did okay.

376
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,035
<i>So you concede</i>

377
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,506
Mr. Patterson's surgery
started at 5:17 p.m.

378
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,308
According to the chart, yes.

379
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:27,096
And you sent Mr. Patterson
to Pre-Op at 2:15 p.m.?

380
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,530
Approximately, yes.

381
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,666
Expecting to operate
within the hour?

382
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,467
Expecting to
operate immediately.

383
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,502
But you didn't.

384
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,970
You didn't start the operation

385
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,472
for another three
hours, did you?

386
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,974
No. Why not?

387
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,475
I'm on emergency call.

388
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,611
A life-threatening gunshot wound
to a 14-year-old boy came in.

389
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,813
I had to respond.

390
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,265
And were you able
to save this boy?

391
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,000
No.

392
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,486
And this Jesse Robbins...

393
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,605
uh, did you know him?

394
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,940
By association, yes.

395
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:59,578
And that association was through
a colleague, Dr. Peter Benton?

396
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,831
He was Dr. Benton's nephew.

397
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,616
And Dr. Benton is
your former lover?

398
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,072
Don't answer that.

399
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,587
Was the young boy
you weren't able to save

400
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,055
the nephew of your former lover?

401
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,507
Move it along, Bruce.

402
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,959
That has no probative value,
and she's not answering it.

403
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,428
Are you refusing to answer...?

404
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,179
She's not answering
the question.

405
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,723
Fine. She'll answer
in front of the judge.

406
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,403
So the death of his
nephew was upsetting to you.

407
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:25,871
Of course.

408
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,195
How long did it upset you?

409
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:29,809
I'm not sure.

410
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,643
Well, losing a young
boy, a boy you knew,

411
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,613
a boy close to someone
you cared about,

412
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,997
it must have been
quite overwhelming.

413
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:38,722
Is that a question?

414
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,371
Was it overwhelming?

415
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,839
At that moment.

416
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,042
So overwhelming
and tragic, in fact,

417
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,478
that it was still on your mind
while you operated on my client.

418
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,918
Wasn't it, Dr. Corday?

419
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:53,999
<i>Guess I should have had</i>

420
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,624
that blood transfusion
this morning, huh?

421
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,160
Come on. That was funny.

422
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,364
This is kind of
ironic, isn't it?

423
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:09,114
Check my cholesterol
while you're at it?

424
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,884
Hey, you! You're supposed to
be watching this. You better watch.

425
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,988
You think I want to
be doing this, Carter?

426
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,989
I don't have
better things to do?

427
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,076
Okay. What should
I do with this?

428
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,143
Give it to me. We done?

429
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,244
Yeah.

430
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,246
Abby, paramedics
called. Your mom's hurt.

431
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,248
She's asking for
you. What happened?

432
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,689
I don't know. She's outside a
clothing store on Oak Street.

433
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,338
If she wants to give
names, I'll check it out.

434
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,424
She's afraid. She's
not going to give names.

435
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,675
Dr. Benton?

436
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,843
She wants to talk to you.

437
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,267
She changes her
mind, give me a call.

438
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,915
Peter, I said I'd
take care of her.

439
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,219
I got it.

440
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,535
Looks like you broke
your cheekbone.

441
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,365
Gonna have to do a
CAT scan of your face.

442
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,283
So you're really gonna protect
the girls who did this to you?

443
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,618
Protecting myself.

444
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,788
They find out I said
something, they gonna kill me.

445
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,977
Like they did Jesse?

446
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,130
You don't know that.

447
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,582
I know he wasn't a gang
member and you are.

448
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,050
Was.

449
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,385
I know that the only reason
he was in that neighborhood

450
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,670
is because of you.

451
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,911
He only came there twice.

452
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,493
Said he didn't like me banging.

453
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:32,230
Kept telling me that I
was better than all that.

454
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,899
That he loved me.

455
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,967
He was gonna get me out.

456
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:38,111
You're telling me that's
why they killed him?

457
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,423
He ditched school.

458
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,967
Tried to get me to come over.

459
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,781
Told me that his mom
was gonna figure things out.

460
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,271
We had a fight.

461
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,790
I was walking away
when it happened.

462
00:19:57,814 --> 00:20:00,492
You...? You saw who shot him?

463
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:03,012
That's why I don't want
to be a part of it no more.

464
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,436
I loved him too.

465
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,788
Who shot him, Kynesha?

466
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,087
You just said you loved him.

467
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,806
You'll tell the
cops if I told you.

468
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,074
No. Why you asking?

469
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:17,731
Because I gotta know.

470
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,814
You swear you ain't
gonna say nothing?

471
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:23,270
Kynesha...

472
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,739
Who murdered my nephew?

473
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,208
- Hold still.
- My daughter is a doctor.

474
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,277
I don't need you to do
any of this. Don't touch me.

475
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,446
She's a doctor. She will
be here. She can do this.

476
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,065
Abby, this wasn't my fault.
This... This man came after me.

477
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,134
You her daughter? I didn't
even know who he was.

478
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,402
She was shoplifting.
I was not shoplifting!

479
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,222
Why would I
shoplift a $10 scarf?

480
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,474
It's a $300 scarf.

481
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,442
Well, it looks like a
$10 scarf, I'll tell you!

482
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,078
She ran straight into my door.
Shattered glass everywhere.

483
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,981
You don't want to arrest her.
It's not worth it. I'm a nurse...

484
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,450
What's wrong with her?
Nothing's wrong with me!

485
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,819
What's wrong with you?
She has a mood disorder.

486
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,721
She was stealing.
She wasn't stealing.

487
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:03,739
She was confused.

488
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,773
You weren't there.

489
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,558
She walked into the
store, demanded a job.

490
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:08,394
I explained... Let me
tell you something,

491
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:11,080
I have better retail skills than
you do any day of the week!

492
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,032
Be quiet, Mom!

493
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,200
Common courtesy and
politeness being two of them!

494
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:16,935
Can I just give you
my phone number,

495
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,437
and then I... I'll
pay for the glass?

496
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,804
Is that cool with you?

497
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:22,207
What if she comes back? I
mean, I have customers in there.

498
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:23,708
She... She's not
gonna come back.

499
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:25,411
You'll take care of
it? Yes, I promise.

500
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:28,034
All right. Fine! Just...
Just get her out of here!

501
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,066
Up to 5 of Haldol, p.r.n.

502
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,930
You got it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,109
What? Huh?

504
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,710
You wanted to see me? Yeah.

505
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,980
Carter, your naltrexone
level was nondetectable.

506
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,398
My naltrexone level?

507
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,617
The blood test. You're
supposed to be on 50 mgs a day.

508
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,119
I just thought it
was a drug screen.

509
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,920
I didn't know you
were screening for that.

510
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,555
It's in your contract.

511
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,090
Well, my prescription ran out,

512
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,659
and I haven't
had time to refill it.

513
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,627
You know that it's
part of the agreement.

514
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,128
And I'm taking it.

515
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,852
I don't need it,
and I'm taking it.

516
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,267
What? You're not the only one

517
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,919
with something at
stake here, Carter.

518
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:10,839
We put ourselves on the
line to give you a fresh start.

519
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,592
In any other circumstance,
you'd either be dead or in jail.

520
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:14,893
Fresh start, huh?

521
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,447
You think this has
been a fresh start? Yeah.

522
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,016
I think that I've done
absolutely everything

523
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,234
that you've asked of me.

524
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,069
And I've done it
without complaint.

525
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,171
I think that I've obeyed
all these arbitrary

526
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:28,339
and arcane rules and regulations

527
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:30,909
about what patients I can
treat and what patients I can't,

528
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,511
when I can treat
them and when I can't.

529
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,979
I think I've peed into cups. I
think you've taken my blood.

530
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:37,282
And I think at some point,
it's gonna have to be enough.

531
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,857
I think at some point, you're
actually gonna have to trust me.

532
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:46,831
Hey, Mark!

533
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,401
Hey, I need some help in here!
Chuny, get me some Ativan!

534
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,716
Oh, my God! What happened?

535
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,934
Get the Ativan. How much?

536
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,436
Four milligrams. Now.

537
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,854
Did he hit his head?

538
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,305
No. Does he have a fever?

539
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:03,025
I don't know. He
just started seizing.

540
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,860
Hold him still.

541
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,730
All right. Start him on...
Start him on 15 liters of O-2.

542
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,364
Get a line going.

543
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,300
And then I need a pulse
ox and a set of vitals.

544
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,959
Get a tox screen.
Finger stick of glucose.

545
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,441
What do you want for labs?

546
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,076
CBC and a Chem-20.

547
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,911
Carter?

548
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:26,381
Dr. Greene? Hey, hey,
Mark! Can you hear me?

549
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,216
Squeeze my
hands. Right and left.

550
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,052
What happened?
You had a seizure.

551
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,554
Your vitals have been stable
and you didn't drop your sats.

552
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,289
We're gonna take
you for a head CT.

553
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,358
See if you can follow
my finger with your eyes.

554
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,825
Come on, Mark. Just lay back.

555
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,394
No. We need to work this up.

556
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,495
I don't want to work it up.

557
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,030
Neuro is coming
down for a consult.

558
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,198
It's not necessary.

559
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,999
Yes, it is. You had
a new onset seizure.

560
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,002
I just need a Dilantin level. I
can go to the outpatient lab.

561
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,571
Sit down and relax. Come on.

562
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,738
I called Kovac in to cover.

563
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,207
You've got a
Hep-Lock on your arm.

564
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,131
I'll handle it. I'll
handle it! Mark. Mark...

565
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,148
Dr. Greene, are you okay?

566
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,292
I'm fine.

567
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,687
Hey, boss, what are you
doing? I heard you had a seizure.

568
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,822
Yeah? You heard wrong.

569
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,758
<i>But Mr. Patterson's condition</i>

570
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,361
needed immediate
surgical attention, did it not?

571
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:14,630
It depends on what you
mean by "immediate."

572
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,231
You had to operate that day.

573
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,533
Within the next 24 hours.
And the endoscopic surgery

574
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,636
is certainly the fastest
procedure, correct?

575
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,903
Among other benefits.

576
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,072
So it was more
convenient for you.

577
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,874
I base my surgical opinions

578
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,309
on what I perceive to be

579
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,177
in the best interests
of the patient.

580
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,045
The recovery, how...
Let me try again.

581
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,847
Perhaps you didn't
hear the question.

582
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,385
The endoscopic surgery
was faster and therefore easier

583
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,871
on your schedule than the
alternate open procedure.

584
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,456
Of course, but... Thank you.

585
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,758
How long does the
endoscopic procedure take?

586
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,726
My schedule had
nothing whatsoever

587
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,512
to do with my advice
to Mr. Patterson.

588
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:49,131
Please strike that
as nonresponsive.

589
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,600
Dr. Corday, how long does
the endoscopic procedure

590
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,056
take to perform?

591
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:56,972
About an hour.

592
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,974
But you performed
Mr. Patterson's

593
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,443
endoscopic discectomy
in 42 minutes.

594
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,345
Correct? I don't know.

595
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,030
I'd have to check
the operative report.

596
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:07,633
Well, if the operative report
stated that you were in the O.R.

597
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:09,668
with Mr. Patterson
less than 43 minutes,

598
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:12,204
would you say that's
correct? It could be.

599
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:14,628
Do you have any reason to
doubt the veracity of the report?

600
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:17,375
No.

601
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:18,911
Would it surprise you

602
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,579
that of the 87 endoscopic
discectomies you performed

603
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,814
before November 16,

604
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:25,250
your fastest time
was 54 minutes?

605
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,251
Twelve minutes slower
than Mr. Patterson.

606
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,287
Objection. You're
testifying, Bruce.

607
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,289
It's a question. She can count.

608
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,058
Would that surprise you?

609
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:34,510
Let's move on. Did you know

610
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,879
that the fastest you had
ever performed this procedure

611
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,765
was 12 minutes slower
than Mr. Patterson's surgery?

612
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,900
I do now.

613
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:43,769
You don't time yourself?

614
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,437
It's not a race.

615
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,407
Then why did the circulating
nurse remind you it was 10 to 6?

616
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:50,291
Objection. Assumes
facts not in evidence.

617
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,661
Do you recall the circulating
nurse reminding you

618
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,864
that it was 10 to 6 while you
were operating on Mr. Patterson?

619
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,165
Yes.

620
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,867
Why did you need to be reminded?

621
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,419
To keep me on schedule.

622
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:03,121
And what did you have scheduled
after Mr. Patterson's surgery?

623
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,540
I had an engagement.

624
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,508
Someplace more
important that you had to be?

625
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,627
No, and I resent the inference.

626
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,045
What inference is that?

627
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,847
That I rushed
Mr. Patterson's surgery

628
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:14,315
in order to satisfy a
personal obligation.

629
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,968
Okay, that's it.
We're taking a break.

630
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,769
Did you? Did you
rush? Don't answer that.

631
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,255
Were you reminded of the time
because you needed to leave?

632
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,756
Yes. PRICE: We're
taking a break.

633
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,642
Did you get that? No.
We're off the record.

634
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,277
Stop typing.

635
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:26,861
Now, I said we're
taking a break.

636
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,452
Let's go.

637
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,486
All I wanted to do
was talk to the owner.

638
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,488
If I could just talk to
him, he'd want to hire me.

639
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,723
What happened?

640
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:40,047
I don't know.

641
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,546
Dr. Greene had a seizure? Yeah.

642
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,049
I've never understood people
who make themselves feel big

643
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,650
by making other
people feel small.

644
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,119
Let me tell you something.
I've got plenty of experience.

645
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,687
Plenty. You know what? Sit down.

646
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,423
She was threatened,
is what she was.

647
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,191
She knew I could
outsell her. She knew it.

648
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,193
And so she... She sent
that Neanderthal in on me.

649
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,979
Know why? She was threatened.
Did you even have an interview?

650
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:02,280
Of course I had an interview.

651
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:04,115
Until she chased
me into the window.

652
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,550
Ow! Ow!

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:08,070
Oh, God. This is
bad! This is bad.

654
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,105
You need stitches.
Here. Sit down.

655
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,374
I'll get an x-ray and make
sure there's no glass in it.

656
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,142
Ow! All right. Keep
some pressure on it.

657
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,126
I'll be right back. Abby. Abby.

658
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,947
What? You're mad at me.

659
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,499
No, Mom, I'm not mad at you.

660
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:21,800
I thought you would be mad.

661
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:23,089
Sit down.

662
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,340
I have plenty of experience.

663
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:30,007
Plenty of experience.

664
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,011
Do you think I'm
gonna put up with that?

665
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:34,513
Well, I'm not.

666
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:36,703
I'm not. I'm not
gonna put up with that.

667
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:41,053
See if I don't.

668
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,509
I hate people like that.

669
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:46,608
I have so much more
experience than you.

670
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,710
I don't think she's
gonna say anything.

671
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,279
She wouldn't have told if she
didn't want us to get this girl.

672
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,482
I gave you the name. Why
don't you go pick the girl up?

673
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,888
We have to get it
from the witness.

674
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,618
What if she doesn't
say anything?

675
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,888
Depends. We can bring
in the DA, maybe a judge.

676
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,924
There's, uh, fluid in
the maxillary sinus.

677
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,359
But no depressed fracture.

678
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,194
Good. Good.

679
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,179
Kynesha, there are a
couple of guys out here

680
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:09,548
that need to talk to you.

681
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:12,483
No! No way!

682
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,867
I told you I don't know nothing!

683
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,011
Looks like you're
feeling better.

684
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,946
Yeah.

685
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,615
Hey, I got my
prescription refilled.

686
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,049
Do you want to see me take it?

687
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,385
No.

688
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,286
Thanks for helping me out.

689
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,756
Sure. You want to tell
me what happened?

690
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,913
Not particularly.

691
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,694
You know, I did treat you.

692
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,746
Technically, I am your doctor.

693
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,786
Anything you tell
me is confidential.

694
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,803
Okay, doctor.

695
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,193
It's quite simple.

696
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,210
I have a brain tumor.

697
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,350
What? Glioblastoma multiforme.

698
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,186
Bummer, huh?

699
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:02,533
Gets better.

700
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:04,691
I found out that
it's inoperable.

701
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:09,391
Oh, Mark. I'm sorry.

702
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,415
Yeah. Well...

703
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,695
You're up.

704
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,999
What are you gonna do?

705
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:16,820
Die, I guess.

706
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,238
After today, I probably won't
be able to work anymore, so...

707
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,290
Did you get a second opinion?

708
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:26,758
They double-checked the biopsy.

709
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:28,542
No, by another neurosurgeon.

710
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,563
There's gotta be a clinical
trial going on someplace, right?

711
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,715
Yeah. Looking into it.

712
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,307
Oh, looks like they need you.

713
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,477
Are you gonna be okay?

714
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,296
Stupid question, Carter.

715
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,344
Do me a favor.

716
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,713
Try and keep the rumors
from spreading around here

717
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,732
before I get a chance
to talk to Elizabeth.

718
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:51,922
Sure.

719
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,113
Do you know what time it is?

720
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,515
Uh, 2:47.

721
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,350
Correct, but it's
not the right answer.

722
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,368
It's not?

723
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,288
No, the right answer
is "yes" or "no."

724
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,992
Yes or no when
possible. Don't elaborate.

725
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:19,027
Not all questions have
a yes or no answer.

726
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:23,131
I understand. Yes or no
when possible. Don't elaborate.

727
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,699
We don't win
cases in deposition,

728
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:25,684
but we can lose them.

729
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,986
At best, this is a
stain that follows you

730
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,221
for the rest of your career.

731
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,106
At worst, you lose your license.

732
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,807
We're not here to
win an argument.

733
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,693
This is about information.

734
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:37,696
He's looking to gain information
to use against you in court.

735
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,200
We're looking to
limit that information.

736
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,956
You mean hide the truth.

737
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,425
I didn't say that.

738
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:52,110
How many do you think? Stitches?

739
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:54,412
Uh, four. Five.

740
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,716
Five?

741
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,482
You're so good at this.

742
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:00,240
You're so gentle.

743
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,354
Thank you.

744
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:04,923
It's hard to believe

745
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,959
'cause you have such
great big, masculine hands.

746
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:11,196
Oh...! Oh!

747
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,297
Sit still. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

748
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:15,255
Eyelash. See?

749
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:18,959
Okay, now you have to
make a wish and blow.

750
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:21,740
That's all right.

751
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:23,830
Okay. I'll blow for you.

752
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,748
What did you wish for?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

753
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:31,750
I'm sorry.

754
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:33,084
You're sorry for what?

755
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,536
It's, uh, part of the disease.

756
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,956
Oh!

757
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,058
Oh, yes. We're going
to now apologize

758
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:41,626
for your diseased
mother, are we?

759
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,178
Are we?

760
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,546
She's always misbehaving.

761
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,299
You know, Abby never
wanted me around her friends.

762
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,866
She was always ashamed. Stop it.

763
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,969
Ashamed and embarrassed.
You think I don't know?

764
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,938
Let him finish your hand.
You would walk by me

765
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:55,539
and pretend you didn't know
me. You'd pretend I didn't exist.

766
00:31:55,563 --> 00:31:58,310
Let him finish your
hand and shut up!

767
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,511
Don't sass me! I'm your
mother! Not by choice.

768
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,398
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right.

769
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,451
Okay! Do you want
a 5 of Haldol? No!

770
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:07,702
Abby, I'm sorry!

771
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,371
Do you want 5 of
Haldol? I'm sorry!

772
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,405
I don't want Haldol!

773
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,489
Sit still and behave

774
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,041
and we won't give you anything.

775
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,376
Don't! You let me go! Okay.

776
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,077
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

777
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,913
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

778
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,915
I'm leaving!

779
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,716
I am leaving!

780
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,219
No! No! No!

781
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:27,472
No! No! No! No!

782
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:29,707
You want a 5 of Haldol?
Get restraints, stat!

783
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:32,344
No! No! Start an IV!

784
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,062
Abby! Abby!

785
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,981
Abby, no! Don't let
them do this to me! Abby!

786
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:39,350
Abby, don't let them...
Starting a line with saline.

787
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,119
Here! Arm restraints!

788
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:43,387
Okay, call Psych.

789
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:44,489
Put her on the monitor.

790
00:32:44,513 --> 00:32:45,824
Please!

791
00:32:45,848 --> 00:32:49,244
Please don't let
them do this, Abby!

792
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,445
Come on, Maggie. Calm down.

793
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,998
No!

794
00:32:53,022 --> 00:32:53,999
No!

795
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:56,952
Maggie! Maggie!

796
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,087
Maggie. MAGGIE: Don't!

797
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,821
Don't!

798
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,759
You... You're my
daughter, you little bitch!

799
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:05,844
Make them stop!

800
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:09,769
No! No! No!

801
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,870
They're ready to start again.

802
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,538
You okay? You
look a little peaked.

803
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,739
Oh, I'm fine.

804
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,841
Look, we're getting to
the critical stage, here.

805
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,344
So if you don't feel like you
can maintain your composure...

806
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,780
No. No, I want to
get this over with.

807
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,070
Okay.

808
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,040
What's he doing here?

809
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:37,475
It's his deposition.

810
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,577
He has a right to be here,
just like you have a right

811
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,079
to be at any of our depositions.

812
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,263
Don't they have to tell us?

813
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,148
He's been brought
in to rattle you.

814
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:46,101
Just stay calm.
Pretend he's not there.

815
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,019
Pretend he's not there.

816
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:49,404
Don't let it affect you.

817
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:50,605
Are we ready to start?

818
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,745
Yes. Okay?

819
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:10,041
You removed the restraints?

820
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:11,409
I can admit her voluntarily,

821
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,878
but she doesn't meet
the criteria for a hold.

822
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,546
Ran through a
plate-glass window.

823
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,016
An accident. She's
not gravely disabled.

824
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,734
She's not a danger
to herself or others.

825
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,970
That's debatable.
She's rapid-cycling.

826
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:24,222
Probably experiencing
a drug-induced mania.

827
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:26,191
Blood alcohol's 0.092.

828
00:34:26,215 --> 00:34:28,059
Well, that'll do it.

829
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,563
So do you want me to admit her?

830
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,197
I don't care.

831
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:33,598
Okay, I'll do it.

832
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,483
She wants to talk to
you. She's remorseful.

833
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,684
She wants to apologize.

834
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,419
No, thank you.

835
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,723
Okay.

836
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,655
Abby, I'm sorry.

837
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,424
Hey, Maggie... I'll
go in the hospital.

838
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,226
I'll get better. Go
back inside the room.

839
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,627
Go back to bed. I'll get better.

840
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,651
It's all right.

841
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:50,415
I'll get better.

842
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,706
I'll get better.

843
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,671
Get some frozen peas.

844
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,842
Reuse them every four hours
on your face for 20 minutes.

845
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:03,177
You can take some
ibuprofen for the pain.

846
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,521
I want you to come
back for a recheck.

847
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:10,990
Hey, he was my nephew. You
knew I had to do something.

848
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,426
LOL, complains of weakness...

849
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,979
Yeah. Good luck.
While under a hair dryer.

850
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:23,948
Ma'am, were you having any
chest pain or shortness of breath?

851
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:26,501
No, dear. The dryer
was just set too high.

852
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,603
Okay. EKG, CBC,
Chem-7, and get a chest.

853
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,204
I'll be right with
you, Mrs. Fruhman.

854
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,228
Thank you, dear.

855
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,375
They think they're
gonna find the shooters.

856
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,810
The ones who killed Jesse.

857
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,199
Good. I hope it helps.

858
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,351
Yeah. Cleo...

859
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,469
I got angry, you know?

860
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:47,138
And I got you angry.

861
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:49,774
You're the only thing in my
life that makes sense right now.

862
00:35:49,798 --> 00:35:51,693
You know what I'm trying to say,

863
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:54,534
I'm, you know, sorry.

864
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,319
Buy me some dinner.
I'll consider your apology.

865
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:03,287
<i>Well, then in your
medical opinion,</i>

866
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,989
what caused the meningocele

867
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:08,792
that cut off the blood supply
to Mr. Patterson's spinal cord?

868
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,062
A leak of CSF,

869
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,431
cerebrospinal
fluid from the dura

870
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:14,898
which covers the spinal canal.

871
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,467
Which means you must have

872
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:19,470
punctured the dura
during the procedure.

873
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,939
That seems evident now, yes.

874
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:24,141
It wasn't evident
during the procedure?

875
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,376
No.

876
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,645
It was apparently evident
to the anesthesiologist.

877
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,230
Objection. Argumentative.

878
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,465
According to the
operative report,

879
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,569
Dr. Babcock, the
anesthesiologist,

880
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,604
drew your attention
to spinal fluid

881
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,039
in the surgical
field at 10 to 6.

882
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,024
Correct?

883
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,297
No.

884
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:44,695
The note says
10 to 6, doesn't it?

885
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,114
Yes.

886
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:47,498
The report is wrong?

887
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:51,870
No. He did draw
my attention to fluid.

888
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:54,255
Fluid we now know
to be spinal fluid.

889
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,522
No.

890
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,925
What could it have been, doctor?

891
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,344
Saline.

892
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:01,946
But you understood that the
anesthesiologist was concerned

893
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,464
it might be spinal fluid?

894
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,133
Yes.

895
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:08,553
And how did you satisfy
yourself that it wasn't?

896
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:11,188
I suctioned the
irrigation saline

897
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:14,480
and did not see
any persistent CSF.

898
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:16,682
Did you look?

899
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,847
I can't operate without looking.

900
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,733
Well, given that it was 10 to 6,

901
00:37:21,757 --> 00:37:23,701
that you were in a hurry,

902
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:26,070
the nurse simultaneously
reminding you of your date...

903
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:27,372
Objection.

904
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:28,873
Can we get to a question, Bruce?

905
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:31,292
Did you perform a complete
and competent inspection

906
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:34,801
of the field to ensure
there were no CSF leaks?

907
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,504
Sometimes leaks are so small
you cannot detect them visually.

908
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:46,674
Nevertheless, did you
perform a thorough inspection?

909
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,109
That's procedure. And
you followed procedure

910
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,062
by performing a
thorough inspection?

911
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,764
Objection. Asked and answered.

912
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:54,649
It's been asked. It has
not been answered.

913
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,416
What was the question?

914
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,720
Did you perform a thorough
and competent inspection

915
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,857
specifically looking
for possible CSF leaks

916
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,280
before you closed?

917
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,371
Yes.

918
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,255
Hey.

919
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,389
Hey. Where did you go?

920
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:19,690
I was looking all over for you.

921
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,225
Took a walk. Got
a cup of coffee.

922
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,343
You didn't get my page?

923
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,777
I knew what it was about.

924
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,947
Yeah. Legaspi was trying
to find a bed for your mom,

925
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,448
and, uh, she just took off.

926
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,233
I figured. Thanks.

927
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:31,019
Maybe you want to
check your apartment...

928
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:32,353
She's not there.

929
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,521
You checked?

930
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,961
No. Uh, this is the
end of the cycle.

931
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:39,276
Our cycle. She disappears.

932
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,178
And then for months, I
don't know where she is

933
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:42,914
or what she's doing
or if she's alive.

934
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:44,982
And then eventually,
she'll turn up somewhere,

935
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,435
and I'll have to deal with it.

936
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,659
I'm sorry.

937
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:50,655
Don't be.

938
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,611
I knew how it would
end when she showed up.

939
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,978
It's the dance we do.

940
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,580
You get lost in
it for a little while,

941
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,504
but it always ends the same.

942
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:05,719
Do you...? You ready?

943
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:06,954
Yeah.

944
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,522
Carter, I forgot to tell Weaver

945
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,092
enzymes are pending
on Mr. Albe in 4.

946
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,177
I'll tell her. Thanks.

947
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:14,417
Good night, Carter.

948
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,241
You coming in?

949
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,609
I don't want to intrude.

950
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,444
They're probably
just eating. Come on.

951
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,196
Jackie always makes
so much food anyway.

952
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,798
They need some
time to themselves.

953
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:35,450
I'll wait for an invitation.

954
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,618
All right. I'll just grab
some stuff for tomorrow.

955
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:38,875
I'll be right back.

956
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,156
Dr. Benton.

957
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,674
What are you doing here?

958
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:45,510
I went to the
store, like you said.

959
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:46,511
Jackie see you? No.

960
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:47,628
You can't be here.

961
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,881
The cops was there
hooking up the cousins.

962
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:52,633
- They gonna think it was me!
- Have you been home yet?

963
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,268
No. They're gonna
kill me! I'm dead!

964
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,853
Shh! Come on. Get in the car.

965
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:57,921
I talked to the cops.
I can't go home.

966
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,356
I told you this was
gonna happen.

967
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,980
All right, just get in the
car. I'll figure out something.

968
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,283
Mark?

969
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,207
I'm up here.

970
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,758
What are you doing?

971
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,215
Just thinking.

972
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,563
How'd it go?

973
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,532
Terribly.

974
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,323
What happened?

975
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:38,717
W-what? W-what is it?

976
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,767
I lied.

977
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,791
I lied.

978
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,857
The fact is, I rushed.

979
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,559
I rushed through
and didn't inspect

980
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,249
the entire surgical field.

981
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,831
That man will never walk again

982
00:40:56,855 --> 00:41:00,801
because I wanted to get
out early for the weekend.

983
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:04,394
And I... I couldn't even
claim responsibility.

984
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:08,593
I sat there, and I...

985
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:12,868
I swore to God, and
I lied to save myself.

986
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:21,093
God owes us one.

987
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,902
I think you're allowed
to be selfish for a while.

988
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,780
I didn't run into a street sign.

989
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,676
I had a biopsy.

990
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:10,771
Those, uh, headaches
weren't from hockey.
