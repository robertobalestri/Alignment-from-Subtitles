1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,772
What can I tell you?
I'm short-staffed, okay?

2
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:14,141
I can't go on a transport.

3
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:16,442
Conni, can you
clear this TIA in 6?

4
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:19,045
She's waiting for her daughter.
That's what Chairs are for.

5
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,514
And give a gram of
Unasyn to the dog bite in 4.

6
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:23,549
Mark, they need you at the MICN.

7
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:24,717
Why don't you try Mercy Air?

8
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,319
Maybe they can
pick him up. Mark.

9
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,288
What? Paramedics have
a guy with chest pain.

10
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:29,656
Won't get in the ambulance.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,458
Well, explain the risks and
make sure he signs out AMA.

12
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:33,660
What are his vitals?

13
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,295
He's refusing to sign the form.

14
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,030
Mark, you gave
my patient cefoxitin?

15
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:39,800
Who? Bovard. Uh, appy.

16
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:42,936
Hold on. Uh, yeah. Listen,
uh, he needed antibiotics.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,939
Yeah. Cefotetan's a better
drug. Peter, I'm a little busy.

18
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,374
I know. That's not my problem.
You should have called me.

19
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:50,543
Did you get through? No
answer at his hotel room.

20
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:51,744
I stat-paged him twice.

21
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:54,815
Well, try his cell phone.
Any response to Lasix?

22
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,516
Mark, the AMA.

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,152
Well, get him on the radio
and try and convince him.

24
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,453
What about a nitro drip?

25
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,823
I need you to buff up a, uh,
recurrent bowel obstruction

26
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:05,192
I have on the way.
What are we? Jiffy Lube?

27
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:08,695
I need a sugar-tong splint
in 3. Kovac still MIA? Uh-huh.

28
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,964
Kovac missed his shift?
I'm sure he's on his way.

29
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,799
Where's, uh, Kerry?
It's her day off.

30
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,334
She's at a chrysanthemum show.

31
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,937
Great, the one day I need her
she's playing Martha Stewart.

32
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,771
Hold on. Just a sec. I'm sorry.

33
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,540
'Cause I've got a
helicopter transport.

34
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:22,175
We're gonna have
to call in backup.

35
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,811
Uh, why don't you wait
till 8:30? He's never late.

36
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,780
Peter, what's this?
Hot appy. O.R.'s ready.

37
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:30,516
Great. I'll take him. Dr. Greene
needs your help here.

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,617
Trauma coming in?

39
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,286
Nah, you're gonna
cover the whole ER.

40
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,555
What? Yep. This'll
get you started.

41
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,358
Diarrhea, ear pain and
weak and dizzy all over.

42
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:39,993
Whoa, wait a minute.
"Weak and dizzy"

43
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,761
wasn't a part of our
per-diem agreement.

44
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:44,731
Sure it is. Per diem
means "per my discretion."

45
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,067
Okay. I'm on my way.

46
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:49,669
I haven't done primary
care since med school.

47
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,803
Don't worry, Peter.

48
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:52,906
You just gotta cover
until Kovac gets here.

49
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,374
When's that?

50
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:59,179
I hope soon. Andrazak in
4, check his lytes in an hour.

51
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,515
Oh, and look at a post-reduction
shoulder film on Quintano.

52
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,517
Uh, how long's your
flight? I don't know.

53
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,303
Where you going?
Grass Creek, Indiana.

54
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,773
The wedding coordinator's
coming at noon.

55
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,074
I know.

56
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,376
Mark, we canceled
her once already.

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,578
Well, go ahead and talk
to her. You can handle it.

58
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,680
I don't wanna handle
it. I want you to share

59
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,650
in what kinds of
invitations, menus, flowers...

60
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,618
I know. I'm stuck. I'm sorry.

61
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,188
Well, at least try
to get back on time.

62
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,290
I'll call you.

63
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,792
Have a safe flight! What?

64
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,532
Nothing!

65
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,221
<i>Lifeguard Five-Seven-David.</i>

66
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,924
<i>Landing-pad zone is clear. Over.</i>

67
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,063
All right, I've got the earache.

68
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,464
That's a Pedes case.

69
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,901
Yeah. Well, Romano has
me seeing everything today.

70
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,436
And that's a complete
waste of your brilliance.

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,205
I've apologized. If
you can't accept it,

72
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,374
let's at least call a truce
so we can work together.

73
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,742
You are amazing.

74
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,443
First, you dump me.
Then you expect me...

75
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,413
Whoa, whoa. I did not dump
you. Then what do you call it?

76
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,082
You were going to
move to Philadelphia

77
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,449
without saying a word to me.

78
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,650
Yeah, but I didn't, did I?

79
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,187
I stayed here and took
this damn per diem job.

80
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,090
And I'm supposed to
believe you did that for me?

81
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,846
That's what I thought.

82
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,296
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,699
So, uh, Jason...

84
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,533
How long has he been sick?

85
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,135
It started last week
with an earache.

86
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,670
And then he had a fever.

87
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,205
Okay. Now he's coughing.

88
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,607
Well, let's take a look here.

89
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,174
You don't think
he's got pneumonia?

90
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,443
One thing at a time.
Get away from me!

91
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,780
Jason. Be nice. The
doctor wants to help you.

92
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,749
- Ow! Hey, whoa.
- I said, be nice.

93
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,218
All right, Jason. Look,
this isn't gonna hurt, okay?

94
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,053
Just, uh...

95
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,538
Just be still. Here we
go. No! I wanna go home!

96
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,042
Okay. It's okay. It's
not gonna hurt. Jason.

97
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,678
That's right, Jason.
Go to Mommy.

98
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,012
Uh-huh.

99
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,380
Why don't you
put him on your lap

100
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:49,215
and give him a nice big hug?

101
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,101
And if Jason's real still,

102
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,503
I'm going to give him a sticker.

103
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,888
<i>Sats?</i> MAN:<i> Up to 98.</i>

104
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,290
His ejection fraction's
less than 10%.

105
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:58,391
Mr. Coggins?

106
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:00,126
Call me Tom. I'm Mark Greene.

107
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,295
We're gonna lie you down
to load you on the chopper.

108
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,630
My first helicopter ride,
I'm gonna miss the scenery.

109
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,465
What's his BP? 90/70.

110
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,902
It's always that low. There's
not much heart muscle.

111
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,437
Can you keep trying
Janet? Sure, Tom.

112
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,505
That's my fiancÃ©e.

113
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,374
She's flying in
from Montreal today.

114
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,110
Let me know if you feel dizzy
or have any shortness of breath.

115
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:20,046
I'm okay as long as I lie still.

116
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,582
Bright side is, I get bumped
up on the transplant list, right?

117
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,752
Gordon, how are we for
oxygen? Four E cylinders, all full.

118
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,989
Ready? Let's go.
One, two, three.

119
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,125
Get a full trauma panel.
Type and cross for eight.

120
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,394
Get the bypass team
on standby. Move.

121
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,096
Oh, somebody stabbed him?

122
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,198
No. He tripped near
a pencil sharpener.

123
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:41,968
Our manager wanted to pull
it out. But I wouldn't let him.

124
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:44,737
Decreased breath sounds.
Set me up with a chest tube.

125
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,172
I'll do it. No, I'll do it.

126
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:48,341
Excuse me. This is
a teaching hospital.

127
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,865
Exactly. Go find another
patient to learn on.

128
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:53,913
Pulse ox down to 91.

129
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,115
Okay. Let's get
one percent with epi.

130
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,985
Peter, heard you had a good
one. Oh, and indeed you do.

131
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,519
He needs a CT. Let
me get a 10 blade.

132
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,755
Oh, no, don't bother.
I'll, uh, throw the tube in

133
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,123
and take him
right up to the O.R.

134
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,992
Don't worry, you are
in excellent hands.

135
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:08,494
It's okay. I've got this. No,
no, this is a surgical case.

136
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:10,830
You are an ER doc today.
Remember? There's a guy puking

137
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:12,349
out in the hall. See
what you can do.

138
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,972
Excuse me.

139
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,822
I need a 32 French tube,
some 0 silk and Xeroforms...

140
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,757
Sir, are you okay?
Ah, whoa, whoa!

141
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,526
What does it look like? Can
we get some Compazine here?

142
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,795
Sir, you're gonna have
to aim for the basin.

143
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,897
I heard it. But I
didn't believe it.

144
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,199
Carter, get me some gloves.

145
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,068
Dr. Peter Benton, ER Attending.

146
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,703
It's got kind of
a nice ring to it.

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,672
You want this? Oh, no. No, no.

148
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,936
Looks like you're
doing just fine.

149
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,877
Trent? Yeah.

150
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,846
I'm Dr. Carter. What
happened to your hand?

151
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,280
Aw, I have this
stupid art class.

152
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,249
We were carving some duck decoy.

153
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,318
Huh. The most exciting
thing that we ever did,

154
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,888
I think, was macramÃ©.

155
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,225
How many stitches do you
think? How many do you want?

156
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,360
Enough to get
me out of art class.

157
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,511
Well, ten oughta do it.

158
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:00,279
Dr. Carter, can you
step out for a second?

159
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:01,881
Yeah, after I suture this.

160
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:04,817
No. It's important.

161
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,093
I'll be right back.
Don't pick your nose.

162
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,523
What? The boy's grandmother,

163
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,691
she wants to talk with you.

164
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:14,615
Just bring her in. She
asked to see you alone.

165
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,164
Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.

166
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,232
Oh, I'm sorry. I came
as soon as I could.

167
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,168
Is Trent all right?
Oh, just a few stitches.

168
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,937
He'll be good as new. Ah. Um...

169
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:28,440
Doctor, there's something
you need to know.

170
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,277
Trent's mother died of
AIDS when he was 2.

171
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:33,245
He tested HIV-positive.

172
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:35,782
You need to be careful.
He didn't say anything.

173
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:39,185
He doesn't know. We
never told him. What?

174
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,355
We just wanted him to
be normal like other kids.

175
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,057
Well, what about
the medications?

176
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,025
He thinks he has a
vitamin deficiency.

177
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,694
And your doctor
plays along with that?

178
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,779
Well, he understands.

179
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,981
Trent needs to know.

180
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,050
Yes. When he's older. When
he can better understand.

181
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,203
Your grandson could be
sexually active right now.

182
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,872
He's not. I've asked him.

183
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,407
Are you sure that he's
telling you the truth?

184
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:04,710
Doctor, I know my
grandson. You don't.

185
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,529
Mrs. Larson, I
have a legal right

186
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,465
to tell Trent that
he's HIV-positive.

187
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,700
You have no right to
interfere in our lives.

188
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,669
HIV is a sexually
transmitted disease.

189
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,470
And if he's having
unprotected sex,

190
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,972
he could be putting
others at risk.

191
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,424
Well, I think we better leave.

192
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:19,692
Well, he can't leave.

193
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,010
Let me by. Chris?

194
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,512
Let me by. Could you please

195
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,313
escort Mrs. Larson
to Chairs. Let me by.

196
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,649
This way, ma'am. Don't touch me.

197
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't do this.

198
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,596
Pulse ox 94 on two liters.

199
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:36,776
What's your hurry?

200
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,344
Huh?

201
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:41,213
You keep checking your
watch every 10 seconds.

202
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:42,282
I'm just charting.

203
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:43,950
I don't think so.

204
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,218
You're late for something.

205
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,955
I'm supposed to meet my fiancÃ©e.

206
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:50,206
You got a lunch date?

207
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,258
Well, we're meeting
the wedding planner.

208
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,426
You're taking the plunge.

209
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,028
It's a great feeling.

210
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,446
Yeah.

211
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,549
What's your
fiancÃ©e's name again?

212
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,788
Janet.

213
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm calling the ER.

214
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,956
See if they can get ahold of
her and she can meet us there.

215
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,625
That'd be great. RANDI:<i> ER.</i>

216
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,327
Hi, Randi? <i>Yeah.</i>

217
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,813
It's Mark Greene up in the
helicopter. Who's around?

218
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,915
Dr. Corday's right
here. It's Dr. Greene.

219
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,950
I don't care, I need to
speak to him right away.

220
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,985
Mark, is everything
all right? Dr. Dietrich?

221
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,221
This is Dr. Carter
at County General.

222
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:25,191
I just repaired a laceration
on your patient, Trent Larson.

223
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,893
I'll try and get ahold
of her. No, yeah,

224
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,429
he's a great kid, uh...

225
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,364
Listen, if I was to
get a needle-stick,

226
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,065
is there anything I should know?

227
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,634
Did you get in
touch with that hotel?

228
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,402
There's still no
answer in his room.

229
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:38,003
Could you call the
manager's office

230
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,111
and see if they could
send somebody up there?

231
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,514
Detective?

232
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,683
Oh. You keep coming by,
I'm gonna have to get you

233
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,385
a badge and a gun.

234
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,953
So, uh, is there anything...?

235
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:56,622
Oh, Dr. Kovac, now, you know

236
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:59,792
the minute there's anything
new, I'm gonna call you.

237
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,228
We take photos for
the medical record.

238
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:04,930
I thought it might help.

239
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:08,618
His... His morgue photo's
already on the police bulletin.

240
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,754
Maybe you could go back to
where it happened, show this around?

241
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,589
We've done our interviews, doc.

242
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,158
No one knows him.

243
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,459
What about fingerprints?

244
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,094
Have a seat.

245
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,967
Have a seat, doc.

246
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,555
Look... I understand
how you feel, okay?

247
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,457
But the fact is,

248
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:34,427
you're probably better
off if no one IDs this guy.

249
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:37,062
No family member's gonna
come crawling out of the woodwork

250
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:39,198
with some wrongful death suit.

251
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,466
I don't care.

252
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,890
I just need to know who he was.

253
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,872
Take my advice, doc.

254
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,374
You were defending yourself.

255
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,464
Dedicate yourself
to believing that.

256
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,947
All right. Keep
that clean and dry.

257
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,083
All right. Cool.

258
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,419
Hey, Dr. Carter, is my
grandmother here yet?

259
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:01,620
Um... yeah.

260
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,211
But first we need to talk.

261
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,671
Why? It's just a cut.

262
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,444
Uh, yeah, actually,

263
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,930
I need to ask you something.

264
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:13,721
All right.

265
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,154
It's about your mother.

266
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,157
Uh, how much do you
remember about her?

267
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,925
Nothing.

268
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,794
You sure?

269
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,530
Yeah. She's... She's
dead. She was a loser.

270
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,103
A heroin addict.

271
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,617
She died of AIDS.

272
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:34,487
And she had the virus when
she was pregnant with you.

273
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:35,922
And the virus can pass

274
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,957
from the mother

275
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,196
to the baby.

276
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,217
Wait a second. So...

277
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,698
I have AIDS? No. You have HIV.

278
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,217
And you're healthy

279
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,208
because you've been
taking medication.

280
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,705
Oh, no, no. See, I...

281
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:55,525
I just take a bunch
of vitamins. That's it.

282
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,159
No. You've been
taking medication

283
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,532
to combat the virus.

284
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,415
No. No, they're
just vitamins, man.

285
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,516
No. Your grandmother
told me, and I confirmed it

286
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,873
with your doctor.

287
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:09,810
Why wouldn't she tell me?

288
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,961
I think she wanted
to protect you.

289
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,296
And, um...

290
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,604
But you need to know.

291
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,726
So my whole life
everybody's lied to me.

292
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:30,782
I'm not lying to you.

293
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:36,948
How much longer do you think?

294
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,667
Gordon, what's our ETA?

295
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,686
Well, there's the
Kankakee River.

296
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,494
About 20 minutes.

297
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,526
You all right?

298
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,196
It's all right. Just
a little chest pain.

299
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,397
I'll be okay.

300
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:52,915
Nitro spray.

301
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,535
Open your mouth,
under your tongue.

302
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,455
On a scale of one to
10, how bad is the pain?

303
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,512
Big-time ST elevation
on the monitor.

304
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,784
Find the tenecteplase.
I'll do the heparin.

305
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,884
Uh, wh-what's going on?
You're having a heart attack.

306
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:14,720
But we're giving you
clot-busting medicine.

307
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:16,944
Pulse ox down to 82.
Do you wanna intubate?

308
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,548
Not if I don't have to.

309
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,063
Let's get him on
a mask. 15 liters.

310
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:25,364
Maybe we should land.

311
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,617
No. Dr. Greene...

312
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,719
Dr. Greene...

313
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,042
you'll get me there, right?

314
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,712
Yeah. I'll get you there.

315
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,579
Do you have a girlfriend?

316
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:41,346
Because if you've
slept with anybody,

317
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,930
they'll have to be tested.

318
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,719
It's important, Trent.

319
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,854
You have to use condoms.

320
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,111
Yeah.

321
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:52,959
Can I go now?

322
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:54,215
Yeah.

323
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,730
Yep, your grandmother's waiting.

324
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,600
So a case manager's
gonna phone you tomorrow,

325
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,501
sort of see how you're doing.

326
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,871
And you've got an appointment
with the teen HIV center.

327
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,439
And you can always
reach me here.

328
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:09,575
The ER always knows
where to find me.

329
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,359
All right. All right?

330
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:14,836
Trent?

331
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:17,706
Thank you, doctor.

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,180
What the hell's that?

346
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,942
The main rotor.

347
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:18,477
I got metal fragments
in the gearbox.

348
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,529
What's wrong? CORDAY:<i> Mark.</i>

349
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,231
Mark, are you there? Mark?

350
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,449
Mayday, mayday.

351
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:26,302
This is Lifeguard
Nine-Seven-Kilo

352
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,155
on emergency descent.
Cinch him in tight.

353
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,874
I'm gonna shut down
for auto rotation. Mark?

354
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,218
No, no. We're gonna make it.

355
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,179
Mark? Can you hear me?

356
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,980
What's going on? I don't know.

357
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,834
There were horns, shouting.
Now there's nothing. Mark!

358
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,669
VFR position.

359
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,838
Industrial area.

360
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,624
A scrap yard near
95th and Commercial.

361
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,593
Now, when I get
enough rotor speed,

362
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,479
I'm gonna pull on the pitch,
that should cushion our landing.

363
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,848
We're falling.
Hang in there, Tom.

364
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,566
Here we go.

365
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:14,672
Okay. Everybody out.

366
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,292
Get out now!

367
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,563
Take the monitor. Got
it. Pumps are down.

368
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,682
Let's go. Move away. Airway kit.

369
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:32,301
Gordon, you get the feet?
- All set.

370
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,603
Let's go together. All
right. We gotta move.

371
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,573
How far? Just keep going.

372
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,858
I'll tell you when. Argh!

373
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,494
You all right? Got it.

374
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,196
Yeah, yeah. Let's go. Come on!

375
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,698
Tom, how are you doing?

376
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:47,265
Sats are down to 78.

377
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,466
All right. I gotta tube him.

378
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,736
All right. This is far enough.

379
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,127
This will shield us if
the fuel tank blows.

380
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,159
Give me four of Versed,

381
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,410
100 of sux.

382
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,629
All right. Tom...

383
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,221
We gotta stick a tube down
your throat, help you breathe.

384
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,186
Do they know where we
are? Yeah, I called it in.

385
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,655
They'll find us.

386
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,613
I'm giving some medicine
to relax you, Tom.

387
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,062
Got it. Do they know anything?

388
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,831
ATC's got a mayday
call with location.

389
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,198
EMS and Fire are rolling.

390
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:21,801
Any injuries? They didn't say.

391
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,202
Well, call them back, damn it.
- What's going on?

392
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,272
Mark's chopper went down. What?

393
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,206
They crashed? It was
an emergency landing.

394
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,376
We don't know that.
We don't know anything.

395
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,444
Call Dispatch. They
don't know anything more.

396
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,513
I don't care! BENTON:
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

397
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,282
Look, I can't have
this place fall apart.

398
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,317
Get on and stay on with
CDO and keep us posted.

399
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:40,753
Randi, how are we doing?
We've got 19 patients waiting.

400
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:42,421
All right, Malucci,
grab some charts.

401
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,923
Abby, draw labs, start some
IVs for anyone who needs one.

402
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,925
Get Carter to order
x-rays from triage.

403
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:49,094
All right, let's
move, people. Now.

404
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,752
- Where the hell is Kovac?
- We're still trying.

405
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,258
Very nice. Appreciate it.

406
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,626
You play here a lot?

407
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,862
Yeah. I work here
and the Navy pier.

408
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,980
What about at night?

409
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,924
Yeah, sometimes for
the after-dinner crowd.

410
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,985
Have you...

411
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,488
ever seen this man?

412
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,611
No. I would remember
a guy like that.

413
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,992
You don't seem like a cop.

414
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,827
Um, I'm a doctor.

415
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,230
Try the tour-boat ticket
guy. He's here all the time.

416
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:26,832
I did. Thanks.

417
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,922
Sorry I can't help you.

418
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,351
<i>Good breath sounds.</i>

419
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,018
Keep him on high-flow oxygen.

420
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,987
Fifteen more minutes
and the tank's dry.

421
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,156
Where's EMS? Sound close.

422
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,758
Yeah, but they can't see us.

423
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:54,526
They'll have to call
in a police chopper.

424
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,562
We can't wait. You
have any flares?

425
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:58,129
I have a Verry
pistol in the chopper.

426
00:18:58,153 --> 00:19:00,766
But I can barely
walk. I'll get it.

427
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,110
Left side, behind
the pilot seat.

428
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,530
Luka, it's Abby.

429
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,066
Um, could you call me
when you get this message?

430
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,469
'Cause I've been trying to,
uh, reach you everywhere.

431
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,803
I'm getting a little worried.

432
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,094
Abby? Okay, c-call me.

433
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,609
Miss Skye here complains
of abdominal pain.

434
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,612
Well, it's not
really my abdomen.

435
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,982
I can't believe I'm
actually embarrassed.

436
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,884
Well, we see everything here.

437
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,719
Okay.

438
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,227
I got a roll of
money stuck up my...

439
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,529
birth canal.

440
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,843
Look, could you hurry up?

441
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,730
I got a cab waiting with
the meter running. Okay?

442
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,198
Dr. Benton, we
need you right now.

443
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,667
Six-month baby boy,
respiratory distress.

444
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,503
Abby? Um, just
hold on one second.

445
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,039
Temp's 103. Coarse
crackles bilaterally.

446
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,110
Pulse ox is only 75. All
right. Let's take a look.

447
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,678
Sounds like pneumonia.

448
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,147
Let's get a pediatric intubation
tray. Move now, people.

449
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,816
We got a line. I'll draw
a CBC and blood culture.

450
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,770
Damn. I don't even do pediatric
intubations. Where's Cleo?

451
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:45,771
She took a kid to PICU.

452
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:48,674
Get her down here now.

453
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:49,692
What size tube?

454
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,243
We use two and
a half in Delivery.

455
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:53,345
No. I think I need
something bigger. Uh...

456
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:54,813
Uh, three, three and a half?

457
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,865
I don't know.

458
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:57,972
Got the labs.

459
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,636
Move.

460
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,805
Uh, he's clamped down.
I can't get the blade in.

461
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,574
Paralyze him. BENTON:
What's the dose?

462
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,677
You need his weight.
He's vomiting. Suction.

463
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,746
- Pulse ox is dropping.
- What do we have?

464
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,914
Uh, difficult intubation,

465
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,483
I-I can't dose him
without a weight.

466
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,818
That's what the
Broselow tape is for.

467
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,856
Okay. We're in the red zone.
2.6 of Etomidate, 18 of sux.

468
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,143
Premedicate with .17
of atropine, 14 of lido.

469
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,917
Bag him. Keep
some cricoid pressure.

470
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,247
I couldn't see the cords.

471
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,791
That's because you had
the wrong blade and tube.

472
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,470
Thanks for coming.

473
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,138
Drugs are on board. He's loose.

474
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,774
- Okay. Here we go.
- Dr. Benton?

475
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,160
Hold on. Hold on. FINCH: Okay...

476
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,761
I'm in. Bag him.

477
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:45,080
Dr. Benton, do you wanna
close to paramedic traffic?

478
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:48,917
I've got this. Hang
400 of ceftriaxone.

479
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,652
Settings will be
volume at 90 cc's...

480
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,655
No monitor beds, and we're
boarding five ICU patients.

481
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,224
All right. Uh, close
to paramedics.

482
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,524
You sure you wanna do that?

483
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,294
We've been getting a
lot of bad press lately.

484
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,130
What would you do,
Carter? I don't know.

485
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,431
Dr. Benton, South Side
Urgent wants to send a patient.

486
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,800
We're closed to transfers.

487
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,435
It's just a backache. Their
x-ray machine's down.

488
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,305
Fine! Fine! Fine! Send
him! So? Do we close?

489
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,808
And don't ask me. They don't
pay me enough to run this place.

490
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,744
Paramedics found them on
the South Side. No casualties.

491
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,579
Well?

492
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,814
Well? Um...

493
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,903
Thank you.

494
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,622
Trent? Hey.

495
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,166
Uh, they told us to wait
because you were busy.

496
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,328
Is she a friend of yours?

497
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,381
Uh, she's my girlfriend.

498
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:38,751
Your girlfriend? Thought
you said you didn't have one.

499
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,469
I brought her here.
Think that was easy?

500
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,004
You gotta be honest with me.

501
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,840
Is she the only one?
Yes. The only one.

502
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,893
I've kissed other girls
though. Is...? Is that a problem?

503
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,928
No sex with anyone else? No. No.

504
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,392
And you didn't use condoms?

505
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:54,900
I love her, man.

506
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:57,469
All right. Okay.
Let's run some tests.

507
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:58,773
We'll see where we are.

508
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:03,158
You want to ride up front?
No. I'm staying with Tom.

509
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,327
Nearest facility's Oakdale,
seven-minute ETA.

510
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,329
No. We're going to
County. That's 20 minutes.

511
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,698
Dispatch doesn't want us
to leave our attachment area.

512
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,633
All right. I'll take
responsibility.

513
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,768
Easy now.

514
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,170
Roy, the doctor
says we go to County.

515
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,705
Can't. County's closed. What?

516
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,407
They just closed. ER saturation.

517
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,465
I'm an Attending there.
They'll take us. Let's go.

518
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,513
Patch me through
to the ambulance?

519
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,648
Dr. Corday, surgical
consult in Exam 4.

520
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,484
I'll be there. Just
give me the number.

521
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,554
Excuse me. I'm
looking for Dr. Corday.

522
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,555
Are you Janet?

523
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,223
Yeah. Elizabeth Corday.

524
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,426
We expect them very
soon. How's Tom doing?

525
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,396
Quite well. Apparently, no
one was hurt in the landing.

526
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,831
What landing?

527
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,699
Just something minor
with the helicopter.

528
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,135
So how long have
you two been engaged?

529
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,204
Almost three years. So
he's not in the helicopter?

530
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,141
No. In an ambulance. Um,
my goodness, three years.

531
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,276
That seems like a long time.

532
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,579
Right after he gave me
the ring, he got the flu.

533
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,082
We thought it was no big deal.
But the virus went to his heart.

534
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,151
We spend a lot of
time in hospitals.

535
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,353
Have you seen the
hernia yet? In a minute.

536
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,922
No, no, no, no, no. Now.

537
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,558
EKG on a new chest-pain
patient. All right, let me see.

538
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,292
I got a guy on a
backboard for two hours.

539
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,261
When are you gonna
clear his neck? When I can.

540
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,863
Want me to call Weaver in? No.

541
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,264
Are you ever gonna sew me up?

542
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,066
We're busy. Just
wait right there.

543
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,201
What's this? A second
board. We're backed up.

544
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,370
Four patients just left
without being seen.

545
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,072
Oh, I know the
solution. We see them,

546
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,941
send off labs and have
them wait in Chairs.

547
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,944
Come on. Are you crazy? We
need monitoring, IVs, medication.

548
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,580
The problem is you doctors
order too many damn tests.

549
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,347
You should be
reviewing their charts,

550
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,116
keeping things moving.

551
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,885
Stroke patient needs
a monitored bed.

552
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,287
We don't have them. Tell
him... We'll put him in the hall.

553
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,855
Peter.

554
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,625
None of my nurses
have even had lunch.

555
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,160
Ambulance dropped off
a stab wound to the belly.

556
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,196
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

557
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,966
That's it. That's it.
Get me the phone.

558
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,603
Heart rate is 40
after two of atropine.

559
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:57,389
Amp of epi. He
needs a pacemaker.

560
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,492
We should be in a hospital
right now. Any hospital.

561
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,128
Rescue 82. BP
is down to 60 palp.

562
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:05,063
Open up the
dopamine. It's for you.

563
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,527
Hello. Okay, we're almost there.

564
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:10,035
No. He can't talk right now.

565
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,005
He's out. I can't feel
a pulse. I gotta go.

566
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,874
Starting chest compressions.

567
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:18,410
We could have been at
Oakdale 10 minutes ago.

568
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,379
I'm going on record
that you overrode policy.

569
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:22,297
There's gonna be an
incident report on this.

570
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,499
Shut up.

571
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,084
Get back to work.

572
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,654
Hang in there, Tom.
You're gonna make it.

573
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:31,089
Janet's there.

574
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,046
She's waiting for you.

575
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,815
How long's he been
down? He never arrested.

576
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,484
Needs help maintaining a
pulse. You look exhausted.

577
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,720
He wouldn't let us
relieve him. I'll take over.

578
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,955
We're coming through
here! What's wrong?

579
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,757
This is Janet Wei, his fiancÃ©e.

580
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,159
Tom had a heart attack. We
need to put in a pacemaker.

581
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,728
You can take his hand.

582
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,230
Hey, Tom, it's me. I'm here.

583
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,732
Keep talking to him.

584
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,067
It's Janet. He's
squeezing my hand.

585
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,603
- What's his BP?
- Uh, 70 systolic

586
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,904
on 20 mics of dopamine.

587
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,440
What about an intra-aortic
balloon? Not a bad idea.

588
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,042
We need the room.
Everything's backed up.

589
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,612
We're closed to paramedics.
Get that patient out!

590
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,597
- Wait! The rapid infuser!
- Oh, my God!

591
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:15,083
Clamp the central line!
- Turn it off!

592
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,169
I'm trying! GREENE:
Get Housekeeping!

593
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,271
We need another
two units of blood.

594
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:20,556
What the hell's going on?

595
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,625
I just got back from transport.

596
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,594
I left Benton in charge. Benton?

597
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:29,063
Mortimer goes to X-ray. Put
the rectal bleed in Exam 3.

598
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,065
I got a patient says her
tongue is too smooth.

599
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,434
Tell her to get a life.

600
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,203
Smooth tongue could be a
sign of anemia, iron deficiency.

601
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,839
I can't leave for a day
without this place going to hell.

602
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,642
I've never seen it this
busy. It's like this every day.

603
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,778
I just heard from the<i> Trib.</i> Tell
me we're not closed to trauma.

604
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,680
We're not. As of
now, we're open.

605
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,382
We can't see
another critical patient.

606
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,050
Abby, get me the
nursing supervisor.

607
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,819
I want every remotely stable
patient moved out of the ICU.

608
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,456
I was under the impression
you could manage the ER.

609
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,791
Well, I was the only Attending.
Kovac never showed up.

610
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,461
He didn't show?! He
might have switched a shift.

611
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,496
In 20 years, I have never
been late for surgery.

612
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,265
I guess you work on
a different standard.

613
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,032
Peter, based on your
performance today,

614
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,724
maybe you're not the
guy for the per diem job.

615
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,772
Dr. Carter? CARTER: Yeah?

616
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,008
Lab results on Emma Miller.

617
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,377
Oh, man. That's tough.

618
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,167
Fifteen years old.

619
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,816
Pacer is capturing well.
Setting the rate at 80.

620
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,652
- I got your transducer here.
- How are you doing?

621
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,588
Passing a 40-cc balloon.

622
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,390
I need to check
position with fluoro.

623
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,215
Janet, why don't you
come talk to me outside?

624
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,233
Ahem. This pump should
bring his blood pressure up.

625
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:41,136
Will he live long enough
to get the heart transplant?

626
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,693
I don't know.

627
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,260
I wanna marry him.

628
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:49,827
I don't know if
he's gonna be able

629
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,346
to leave the hospital.

630
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,610
Can we do it here?

631
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,567
We could try and arrange it.

632
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,635
I think if we got married

633
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:58,909
it might help.

634
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,107
What if they made a mistake?

635
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:04,660
I wouldn't tell you
if I wasn't certain.

636
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,328
But I don't feel sick.

637
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,764
You should do the test again.

638
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,750
Emma, if you start taking
medication right now,

639
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,669
you could stay healthy.

640
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,904
No. I know what
happens. Everybody dies.

641
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,272
That's not true. That's not...

642
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,275
Look at Trent. He's had HIV
his whole life. Look at him.

643
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,377
I wish we'd never had sex.

644
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,814
Emma, I didn't know. I swear.

645
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,683
Dr. Carter, tell her. Please.

646
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,352
This is a lot.

647
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,887
This is a lot for you to handle.

648
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,272
And you're both
gonna need some help.

649
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,725
So before you go, I would like

650
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,593
you both

651
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,899
to talk to a counselor.

652
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,616
Hold on, you two. Hold on.

653
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,207
I'll leave you two
alone for a little while.

654
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,239
But before you do anything,

655
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,324
talk it over.

656
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:54,668
Definitely. Thanks.

657
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:58,251
Hey. Hey. Come on...

658
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,752
Why is Mr. Chang still here?

659
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,386
He's waiting for a second CBC.

660
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,323
Okay. Do another HemoCue.
If it's over 11, send him home.

661
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,657
Torelli's cardiac enzymes.

662
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,260
Great. All right.
She's outta here.

663
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,562
Clears up another monitored bed.

664
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,164
You know, Romano
was out of line.

665
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,033
Heh-heh! When isn't he?

666
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,768
It's wrong to throw
you into the deep end

667
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,036
and expect you to swim.

668
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,739
Nobody masters ER
management on their first day.

669
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,325
What's this? Back
pain. Collapsed at triage.

670
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,695
Both trauma rooms are full.
Let's take him to Curtain 2. Go!

671
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:34,265
I need a central line
kit now! BP's 60 palp.

672
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:35,900
Could be a ruptured aneurysm.

673
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:39,404
CBC, coags, type and cross
for eight, four units of O-neg.

674
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:40,638
Let's prep the neck. Move.

675
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,006
I feel a pulsatile mass.

676
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,776
Hey, Malik, is there
any history on this guy?

677
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,745
I need a trauma kit.

678
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:48,613
This is a triple-lumen CVP.

679
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:50,915
"History of hypertension
and high cholesterol."

680
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:54,051
He needs an NG and a
Foley. I need the SonoSite.

681
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:57,121
Dr. Benton accepted this
patient from an urgent-care center.

682
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:58,790
What? And he's been
waiting in Chairs?

683
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:00,191
For two hours.

684
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,627
I can't find the subclavian.
Put him in Trendelenburg.

685
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,496
Look, they said it
was just a back sprain.

686
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,398
The doctor told you that?

687
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:09,000
Well, I-I, uh... I didn't
exactly talk to the doctor.

688
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,264
Oh, great. And now
he's bleeding out.

689
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,474
Take a deep breath.
M.A.P. is 78 with a pump.

690
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,276
Is that good or bad?

691
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,477
Took you out of heart failure

692
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:21,312
and got you off
your breathing tube.

693
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:22,813
Sats are up to 99.

694
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:25,783
Okay, let's get him on
five liters, nasal cannula.

695
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,341
Conni, why don't you
grab a blood-gas kit?

696
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:30,505
Where's Janet?

697
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,274
She's trying to get
a clerk from city hall

698
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,560
to come issue a
marriage license.

699
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,647
That's crazy.

700
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,949
People in love do crazy things.

701
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,550
I wanted to wait
for a transplant

702
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,335
so I could chase
her down the aisle.

703
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,572
I didn't want her to
marry a cardiac cripple.

704
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,308
You get a heart, she won't.

705
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:53,010
If one's available,
if the tissues match,

706
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,302
how long can I
last on this pump?

707
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,291
Couple weeks.

708
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,101
Pretty lousy odds.

709
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,270
They were worse when you
were having a heart attack

710
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,677
and the chopper was going down.

711
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,793
You see any Zephiran?

712
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,450
Yeah. Top shelf.

713
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,498
Hey, I heard about
your teenagers.

714
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:15,099
They're so young.

715
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,802
It's pretty rough.

716
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:20,538
Are you okay? Yeah. I think so.

717
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:22,607
Do you wanna take a break?

718
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,410
I'm gonna plug in two new
patients. I'll come find you.

719
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:28,234
Talk to Kovac? Not yet.

720
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,604
Dr. Kovac?

721
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,622
Yeah?

722
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,224
We finished the autopsy.

723
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:41,292
I can review some of
the pertinent findings.

724
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,960
Mm-hm.

725
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,331
There were multiple
contusions to the occipital cortex

726
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:50,401
with herniation through
the foramen magnum.

727
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:52,737
And if you'll take a look here,

728
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:54,673
you'll see numerous fractures

729
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:56,675
consistent with
repetitive blunt trauma.

730
00:31:56,699 --> 00:31:58,398
I know how he died.

731
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,813
Well, I can tell you
that he was a smoker

732
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,283
based on the lung findings.

733
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:08,853
Also, he probably once
lived in central California.

734
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:11,255
There were foci of
pulmonary fibrosis

735
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,591
consistent with coccidiomycosis.

736
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,626
It's endemic to the
San Joaquin Valley.

737
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,962
Eh, that's an agricultural area.

738
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:20,264
Maybe he grew up on a farm.

739
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,732
Well, I don't know.

740
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,602
There's grease
under the fingernails

741
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,672
and a biker-club tattoo.

742
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,148
He could be just a drifter.
But we'll probably never know.

743
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:35,301
Happens all the time.

744
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,642
Not such a smart
idea to take your Razor

745
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,310
down a flight of stairs, huh?

746
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,512
Were you wearing a helmet?

747
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,314
Yeah. What do you
think I am? Stupid?

748
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:57,519
Ooh. Well, we'll
see after the x-ray.

749
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:00,188
Right wrist film, something
for the pain. A half a...

750
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,990
It happened so fast.
We were having a fight.

751
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,293
He ran into the street
and a car hit him.

752
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,317
They're doing
everything they can.

753
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,898
Dr. Carter? WEAVER:
What's the rhythm?

754
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,701
V-fib. Charge to 360.

755
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,538
Trent. Oh, God. Trent.
What's our down time?

756
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,506
Twenty minutes.
Never had a pulse.

757
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,530
Clear.

758
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,526
Don't let him die.

759
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,017
Still V-fib.

760
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,616
Hey, doc. Hey, thanks
for coming down.

761
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,884
Sure. What do you need?

762
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,386
Thirty-one-year-old patient,
end-stage heart failure.

763
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,189
He may not make
it to transplant.

764
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,990
What denomination? I don't know.

765
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,359
Can he speak? For last
rites, I really need to know that.

766
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,628
No, no. He and his fiancÃ©e,
they wanna get married.

767
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,231
Tonight? He's sick.
We can't move him.

768
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,433
We gotta do it here.

769
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,767
Were you able to get a license?

770
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,937
Oh, I tried. But
city hall's closing.

771
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,805
You don't have a
marriage license?

772
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,573
Can you do it anyway?

773
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,843
I'm sorry, but a marriage
isn't legally binding

774
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,811
without a license.
How about tomorrow?

775
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,379
Okay.

776
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,148
He may not make
it till tomorrow.

777
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,415
Can't you help these people?

778
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,683
They want your blessing.

779
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,886
They have very little time.

780
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,857
As long as everyone understands
it won't hold up in court.

781
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,558
Are you ready to
tie the knot? Heh.

782
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,902
Come on. Let's go talk to Tom.

783
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,331
Dr. Kovac, did you
trade your shift?

784
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,365
No.

785
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,933
Hey. Where have you been?

786
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:22,203
I heard they couldn't reach
you. You didn't answer your page.

787
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,072
What's...? What's the problem?

788
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:27,742
That I had to come in
today and cover for you.

789
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,077
I thought I was on tonight.

790
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,812
No. You were on today.

791
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,282
Then... Then I'm sorry. There
must have been some mistake.

792
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,885
There was no one with
enough experience to cover you.

793
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,120
We almost lost two patients.

794
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,005
Luka, this is
grounds for dismissal.

795
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:44,225
Fine, Kerry. Fire me.

796
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,993
I know that you've
been through a lot.

797
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,097
If you need to take some
time off, you should tell me.

798
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:50,949
But you can't miss
any more shifts.

799
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:53,117
I can work tonight.

800
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,403
We don't need you tonight.
You should go home.

801
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,927
Go on. Go.

802
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,405
Luka, wait. What?

803
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:16,949
Wait a minute. Don't walk away.

804
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,779
Where have you
been? Abby, please.

805
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:24,415
I j... I wanna help.
Just talk to me.

806
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:26,639
There's nothing to say, okay?

807
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:36,377
To have and to hold,
to love and to cherish

808
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,313
as long as you both shall live.

809
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,050
"The union of husband and
wife in heart, body and mind

810
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:45,053
"is intended by God
for their mutual joy.

811
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,622
"For the health and
comfort given one another

812
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,959
"in prosperity and adversity.

813
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,159
"And when it is God's will,

814
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,484
for the procreation
of children."

815
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,026
You can stay as long
as you want, okay?

816
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,607
Emma, I am so sorry.

817
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,146
Get out of here.

818
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,168
Emma... It's your fault.

819
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:36,821
By the power vested in me,

820
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:40,358
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

821
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,616
Go ahead and kiss
your bride, Tom.

822
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:49,200
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

823
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:50,401
I'm gonna break all the rules

824
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:53,638
and allow you to have
one sip of champagne.

825
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,072
Thanks.

826
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,841
Well, since this is
the honeymoon suite,

827
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:59,544
you're entitled to a
little privacy. Ha, ha!

828
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:01,162
We're very grateful.

829
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,448
Thank you. TOM: Yeah.

830
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,188
For everything.

831
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:11,289
Nice folks.

832
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,525
Tell them to get a license,
and I'll do it again. No charge.

833
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:15,826
Thanks.

834
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,662
So, what about our
wedding coordinator?

835
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:20,898
I totally forgot to
call and cancel.

836
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,266
Oh, she'll be furious.

837
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,202
Well, blame it on me. I mean,
it was a medical emergency.

838
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,738
Oh, the hell with
her. Excuse me?

839
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,506
This is all so silly.

840
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,708
I don't want a
rose-entwined arbor

841
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,177
with trained doves.

842
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:37,014
I don't want champagne
served out of crystal flutes.

843
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:38,649
I understand.

844
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,752
Who cares about a
bloody ice sculpture?

845
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,020
Not me.

846
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,422
I just want to get married

847
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:47,058
in a simple ceremony.

848
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:50,127
I don't know. I was looking
forward to those doves.

849
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:56,867
So I spoke to the O.R.

850
00:37:56,891 --> 00:37:58,903
The aneurysm
repair's going well.

851
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:01,406
I'm glad to hear it. Yeah.

852
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,807
I think it's best for now

853
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:05,810
if you just see patients. Here.

854
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:08,078
Well, if that's what you want.

855
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,781
Peter, you're an
excellent surgeon.

856
00:38:09,805 --> 00:38:12,450
But ER management is not
the best use of your skills.

857
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:14,341
Leave that to us.

858
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,862
Hello, Mrs. Barnwell.

859
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,831
I'm Dr. Benton.

860
00:38:26,855 --> 00:38:30,034
So I understand you
have a pain in your hip.

861
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,168
That's right.

862
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:33,438
And I've been lying
here for three hours.

863
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:37,074
Oh, well, I'm very
sorry about that.

864
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:40,110
Pardon me for asking,
but are you an intern?

865
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:43,631
No, no, no, no, no. I'm
a, uh, faculty physician.

866
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,199
Oh.

867
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,635
Your mother must be very proud.

868
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,238
Yeah, she was.

869
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:52,406
So how long have
you had this pain?

870
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,525
Before we get much further,

871
00:38:54,549 --> 00:39:00,264
I'd like to say that I
would be more at ease

872
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:01,721
with another doctor.

873
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:07,804
Excuse me? You look
like a fine young man.

874
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:11,063
But, uh, I've always
had white doctors.

875
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:17,803
I've always felt more
comfortable that way.

876
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:22,987
So you're saying

877
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:25,223
that you only wanna
see a white doctor?

878
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,565
If it's all right with you.

879
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,234
That's fine.

880
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,434
You'll just have to wait
another three hours.

881
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,643
What happened to
him? I don't know.

882
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,545
Hey, uh, have you seen Abby?

883
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:49,302
I saw her punch out.

884
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:57,310
Hey, Carter. You got a minute?
Actually, I'm on my way out.

885
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,601
Carter, wait.

886
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,285
John, you had a bad
day. We all have bad days.

887
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,388
Look at me.

888
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,357
You have to make tough
choices, do what you think is right

889
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,515
and accept the outcome.

890
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,853
I shouldn't have
told him. You had to.

891
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,269
I'll see you tomorrow.

892
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,104
Hey...

893
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,241
I'm off in 20 minutes. Uh...

894
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,714
You wanna get some dinner?

895
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:39,135
I-I got an AA meeting
at 9. You'll make it.

896
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,501
Can I join you?

897
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,503
It's a counter, Peter.
You can sit anywhere.

898
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,208
So you survived.

899
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,178
Weaver said I was incompetent.

900
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,813
Really?

901
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,582
Well, that's what she implied.

902
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,284
The per diem job
is just temporary

903
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,186
until you get back into Surgery.

904
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,556
Yeah. But I needed to show
them that I could run the ER.

905
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,460
Why? It has no bearing
on your surgical career.

906
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,829
Yeah. But it reflects
on me, you know? Uh...

907
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,998
I should've been
able to handle it.

908
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,699
You can't be
perfect at everything.

909
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:33,734
Yeah, but, Cleo,

910
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:36,278
I can learn a job
if I can do it well.

911
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,273
So do you feel
better having said this

912
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,530
to a sympathetic ear?

913
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,887
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Thanks.

914
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,485
You know, I've
had some problems,

915
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,575
and I haven't had
anyone to talk to.

916
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,546
Are you ever going
to be there for me?

917
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,952
Because you sure
as hell haven't been.

918
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,083
Who is it?

919
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,573
It's me.

920
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,399
Can I come in, please?

921
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,287
Sure.

922
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,236
Abby... You don't have to talk.
