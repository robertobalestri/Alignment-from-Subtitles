1
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:41,234
Clear.

2
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:42,924
Go again. Clear!

3
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,039
Still in V-fib. Been
down 28 minutes.

4
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,874
Hey, Carter! Hey, Dave.

5
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:50,243
Hey, man. Good to see
you. It's good to see you too.

6
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,345
Yeah? You miss me?
What happened to your hair?

7
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,447
The chief's training me
on the sternal saw today.

8
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,616
Hopefully we get a GSW
who needs his chest cracked.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,218
I'll keep my fingers
crossed for you.

10
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:00,186
And, uh... Uh, this
jerk cut us off. Carter.

11
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,655
And then I rear-ended him.
And then the air bags went off.

12
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:08,794
That's disgusting.

13
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,063
Hi, Carter. Hi, Chuny.

14
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:11,631
I'm glad you're back.

15
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,932
She drinks anything... No!

16
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:14,134
She can get her hands on.

17
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,102
Probably psychogenic polydipsia.

18
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:17,470
You want to, uh, check her lytes

19
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,239
and then call for a
Psych consult. <i>Agua.</i>

20
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:21,741
Hey, Carter. Hey,
Lily. How are you?

21
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:23,943
Chuny... Weaver needs
somebody to make a blood run.

22
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,312
Weaver needs to get a
couple more nurses down here.

23
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,813
Can you tell we're short nurses?

24
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,971
Ha-ha.

25
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:36,622
Congratulations. John...

26
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:37,924
welcome back.

27
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:41,594
Hey, Carter! I got a live
one waiting in Exam 3.

28
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,229
Freak tore off all her toenails

29
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,330
with a pair of pliers.

30
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,766
What about me? I
need medical attention!

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,334
The only thing
you need is a bath.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,736
I'll be there in
a minute, Lydia.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,872
Can I get a doctor? Any doctor?

34
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,219
Hey, you. Where do
you think you're going?

35
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,154
Oh. I, uh... I work here.

36
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,589
No, that's an old ID.

37
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,257
Well, I've been away.

38
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,992
Dr. Weaver. Does
this one belong to you?

39
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,194
Yes, he does.

40
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,962
He'll need to get a
new ID from Personnel.

41
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,564
You can get it after your shift.

42
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:18,886
Sorry, doc.

43
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,535
Why not Christmas?

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,004
Next Christmas.
No, this Christmas.

45
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:27,506
Are you mad? It takes
months to plan a wedding.

46
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,176
Hey, Carter. Carter.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,178
We got engaged.
We bought a house.

48
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:34,080
Wow.

49
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:35,944
Congratulations
on both accounts.

50
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,518
Boy, I go away for
a couple weeks...

51
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,519
you guys get engaged...

52
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,221
Chen's pregnant,

53
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,557
Malucci's blond, Admin
looks totally different,

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,759
and I can't seem to remember
my locker combination.

55
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,561
Oh. You know, the,
uh, state medical board

56
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,895
made us clean it out.

57
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,630
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,399
Where's my stuff? Uh...

59
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,669
Listen, I'll look into, uh,
getting your locker back.

60
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,222
But you can use mine until then.

61
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,573
Uh, look, I better run.

62
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,575
Listen, there's a
surgical conference today.

63
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,676
We're short-staffed.

64
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,278
Please don't let
your residents call

65
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,247
for any unnecessary consults.

66
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,815
Good luck, Carter. Thank you.

67
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,572
We'll talk dates later.

68
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,942
You ready to rock 'n' roll?

69
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,872
Yeah, I guess so.

70
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,441
Listen, if you
need anything, uh...

71
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,477
Talk about a case or
a patient or<i> anything</i>

72
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,312
just come find me.

73
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,616
I'll do that.

74
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,501
I will.

75
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,755
Hey, you got anything good?

76
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,557
Got a chest pain
in 2 hooked up...

77
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,994
I think Dr. Greene
is free. Thanks, Lily.

78
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:47,663
Sorry, Carter, but in order
to facilitate your return,

79
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,199
we need to
implement a few rules.

80
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,433
Uh-huh. Such as?

81
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,869
You're to do only minor
medical, no trauma.

82
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,305
No suturing. No
needles. No narcotics.

83
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,375
And absolutely no
surgical procedures.

84
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,809
Uh, that leaves me with...?

85
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,145
The chance to practice
medicine again. Okay...

86
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,514
Let me go! Settle
down, Mr. DiBattista!

87
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,216
Settle down! Let go of me!

88
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,652
Give me some four-by-fours!

89
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,588
I think I know this
guy. Stabilize his neck!

90
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,557
Leave me alone,
bitch! All right, that's it!

91
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,997
Once you get back
in the swing of things...

92
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,133
you can resume a normal schedule

93
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,234
and do procedures again.

94
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,336
But until then, it's baby steps.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,537
Why don't you start with...

96
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,094
Mr. Griffis?

97
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,774
Gluteal rash.

98
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,044
Nothing worse than a
chapped ass. Or so I'm told.

99
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,513
Dr. Carter. When
did you get out?

100
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,869
A couple weeks ago.

101
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,152
Well, I got a patient.

102
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,154
Go forth and heal.

103
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,222
So who's watching
the drugstore cowboy?

104
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,323
I'm head of the ER.

105
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,192
That makes Carter
my responsibility.

106
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,794
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't he develop drug addiction

107
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,763
under your eye? Is there
something you need?

108
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,932
Do I need to have a reason
to come down and say hello?

109
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,034
But now that I'm down
here, perhaps you can tell me

110
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,836
who replaced all the candy
bars in the vending machines

111
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,305
with raisins and rice cakes?

112
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,774
You're here because
you need a sugar fix?

113
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,776
We're a hospital. We're
setting a good example

114
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,211
by offering healthy snacks.

115
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,879
So, what are you,
the nutrition Nazi?

116
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,248
America's poor eating habits
help keep us in business.

117
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,950
Did you even take
the Hippocratic oath?

118
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,585
I had my fingers crossed.

119
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,088
Oh... Dr. Romano? Dr. Chen.

120
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,123
Well... I guess I
don't have to ask

121
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,691
what you've been up to.

122
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,093
Look, um, I... I need a favor.

123
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,295
Well, if it's about taking
time off, talk to Weaver.

124
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,030
Maternity leave is a topic
for those bearing ovaries.

125
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,632
No. It's about my parents.

126
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,068
I figured you'd run into
them today at the conference.

127
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,903
I'll say hello. Well, actually,

128
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,739
um, I haven't told them
that I'm pregnant yet,

129
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,509
and... I'd really appreciate
your not saying anything.

130
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,377
Um... I-I want to surprise them.

131
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,013
How? By going into
labor at Sunday dinner?

132
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,771
"Mom's" the word.

133
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:49,035
Just a little longer.

134
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,703
I've already been
here three hours.

135
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,171
How long is this gonna take?

136
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,473
Abby, what are you doing
here? Looking for Weaver.

137
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,776
She's under the impression
I'm her own personal temp.

138
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,177
She's next door. Thanks.

139
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,096
Is somebody gonna dig
this wood out of my butt

140
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,664
before it sprouts roots or what?

141
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,933
Would you mind, before you
go, removing some splinters?

142
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,269
Can't you do it?

143
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,837
Weaver won't let me
use any instruments.

144
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,301
Oh. Okay. Sure. Just a minute.

145
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,193
You need an ortho surgeon
for a closed reduction.

146
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,663
I've been paging them every
five minutes for half an hour.

147
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,631
Call the attending, tell
them you're Weaver.

148
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,466
That usually will
scare somebody down.

149
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,068
Excuse me. Dr. Greene?

150
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,370
Uh, I've got a 9-year-old
boy who got hit in the larynx

151
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,305
with his skateboard.
He's pretty hoarse.

152
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,941
Uh-huh. Any sub-Q emphysema?

153
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,842
No. Uh, everything's okay.

154
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,144
No stridor, good sats, and
he's handling secretions.

155
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,346
- He woke up with pain.
- Visualize his cords?

156
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,382
Well, our scope
is being serviced.

157
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,051
I paged Head and
Neck to bring one down,

158
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:39,652
but I've been
waiting three hours.

159
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:42,889
Yes. Yes. It's moved to the
lower right quadrant. Yes.

160
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,257
Yup, we're gonna have to
scope him. Call the attending.

161
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,560
Well, I tried. But, uh,
they're either in surgery

162
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,028
or at some damn conference.

163
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,631
He's too sick for a jump test!

164
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,936
Hold on one second.
Dave, you have a problem?

165
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,737
Stewart here has had two
days of vomiting and diarrhea.

166
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,639
Corday says it's not a
good story for an appy.

167
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:01,774
Maybe, maybe not. But
now he's got classic signs,

168
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:04,010
including guarding and
rebound tenderness.

169
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,278
Did you tell her that? Yeah.
But she won't come down.

170
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:07,680
She wants me to
make this poor guy

171
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,115
get up and<i> jump around!</i>

172
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:10,950
Thanks, Elizabeth.

173
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:12,785
Follow me.

174
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:13,920
Where are we going?

175
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,605
Where are we going?

176
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,040
Dr. Weaver, did you page me?

177
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,374
Yes, Abby. Hi. Hi.

178
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,177
We need those in Exam
4. Wh... Why am I here?

179
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,278
We're short on nurses.

180
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,512
I am an OB nurse.

181
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,414
Are you planning on
going back to med school?

182
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,616
Yes. Okay. Then

183
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,384
you might as well work
as a nurse in the ER.

184
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,352
You'll see more medicine
here than upstairs.

185
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,788
Right. But I... I... Okay, look.

186
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,823
I'm offering you a
learning opportunity

187
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,492
that'll put you way ahead when
you come back as a student.

188
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,096
Which should only take
me about two more years.

189
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,515
It's really not so bad
down here, Abby.

190
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,072
Oh, yeah? Compared to what?

191
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,252
Excuse me.

192
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,836
I'm having trouble
with my card key.

193
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,757
What's the name?

194
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,347
Dr. Peter Benton.

195
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,552
You're not on the list.

196
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,283
Oh.

197
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,219
I just became a
surgical attending.

198
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,020
Gonna have to
park on the street.

199
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,621
I'll just park in
the visitors' area.

200
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,256
No, you won't. You
said you work here,

201
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,197
and employees can't
park in visitor spaces.

202
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,478
Well, if I'm an employee,

203
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,697
then you have to let me in.

204
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:33,054
I can't. You're not on the list.

205
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,052
Uh...

206
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,138
You've got a corneal abrasion.

207
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,674
Don't you mean pinkeye? Uh.

208
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,809
No. You've got a
scratch on your eyeball.

209
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,412
Probably some dirt got trapped

210
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:48,047
under the eyelid there.

211
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:50,016
Well, how on earth

212
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,184
would that happen? Mm.

213
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,276
I don't know. Maybe,
uh, the wind blew it in.

214
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,791
Well, the last
time I was in here,

215
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,225
they said I had pinkeye.

216
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:01,894
Ooh!

217
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,030
And crabs.

218
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:05,798
I think I might have them again.

219
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,033
Mm-hm. Okay.

220
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:10,603
Well, why don't we
treat one thing at a time?

221
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:13,505
I'm gonna go get
some antibiotics...

222
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,675
put them in your eye,
so it doesn't get infected.

223
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,543
Oh, will...? Will it
stop the hurting?

224
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,162
We'll get you
something for the pain.

225
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,413
Am I gonna get a patch?

226
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:22,917
I'll see what I can do.

227
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,535
Hello. Elizabeth.

228
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,904
Have you gone downstairs
to see that ruptured appy yet?

229
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,506
Rupture? I thought
it was a rule-out.

230
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,075
Well, that was 10 minutes
ago. I'm sure it's ruptured by now.

231
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,144
Look, I told you there's
a surgical conference,

232
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,512
at Rush today, and we're jammed.

233
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,714
If Dr. Malucci fails to give
me a good enough story...

234
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I gave
you a great story for an appy.

235
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:44,403
When we call for a consult,
we need you to do just that.

236
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,627
Well, thank you
for the clarification.

237
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,174
What's this?

238
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,477
Uh, it's just some things
we need downstairs.

239
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:54,480
Well, these "things"
belong to the OR.

240
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,148
Well, the surgeons
can bring them back

241
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,973
once they've come down
to the ER to use them.

242
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,062
Hello. I'm Dr. Chen.

243
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,824
So, Willie,

244
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,710
it says here that
you're having earaches.

245
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,178
Yeah.

246
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,562
Could you, uh, take off
your hat so I can have a look?

247
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:15,835
Oh.

248
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,337
Gee, what happened?

249
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,539
I couldn't stop
the bleeding. Huh.

250
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,123
Who did this to you?

251
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,725
I did.

252
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,926
With what?

253
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,061
Kitchen shears.

254
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,063
On purpose?

255
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,098
Didn't it hurt?
What do you think?

256
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,984
I tried to numb it with ice,
but they're still pretty sore.

257
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:33,352
Yeah, I bet.

258
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,955
Now, why would you give
yourself Doberman ears?

259
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,389
They're Vulcan.

260
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:39,207
Is that like a Shih Tzu?

261
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,631
Uh, no. I think he
means like Mr. Spock.

262
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,830
On <i>Star Trek.</i>

263
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:45,998
Oh. Oh, right. Right.

264
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,667
Okay, um...

265
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,403
we'll irrigate the wounds,
wrap them in saline gauze,

266
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,972
um, give him a DT and
run in a gram of Ancef.

267
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:54,140
Okay. Psych consult?

268
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,607
Yes. And I'll call Plastics.

269
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,376
Psych? W... Wait a second.

270
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,061
But I'm not... I'm not crazy.

271
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,515
You mutilated yourself
with kitchen shears.

272
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,984
How long is it gonna take?
The sci-fi convention's today.

273
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,068
I'm running pretty late.

274
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,858
We're moving at warp
speed here, Willie.

275
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,743
Hey. I got a present for you.

276
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,512
What?

277
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,680
One fiber-optic laryngoscope,

278
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,349
compliments of the OR.

279
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,450
Where did you get this?

280
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,852
Ah, you're better
off not knowing.

281
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,021
So you pick out
a name for the...

282
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,623
little bambino yet?

283
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,725
No. Oh, well...

284
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,926
Uh, let me get that.

285
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,761
You, uh, planning
on something Chinese

286
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,062
or a little bit more Western?

287
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,764
I haven't really
given it much thought.

288
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,833
Hey, you got a minute? Oh. Sure.

289
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,935
I got a corneal abrasion
that needs some Vicodin,

290
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,803
and I'm not allowed
to write for narcotics.

291
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,038
Yeah, I'll take it.

292
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,040
Uh, there's an otitis in
Exam 2 you can have.

293
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,708
All right. He
presented as pinkeye.

294
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,310
But all he needs
is the meds. Okay...

295
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,279
And wear this mask,
because he's pretty rank,

296
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,047
and he's got crabs.

297
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,583
Are you going
soft on me, Carter?

298
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,385
Uh, it looks like I
missed a few things

299
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,386
while I was away, huh?

300
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,554
Yeah.

301
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,590
So how far along are
you? Twenty-four weeks.

302
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,626
Was this planned, or...

303
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,327
No. Not particularly. Mm-hm.

304
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,713
You know, I gotta run.

305
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,982
Sit still so the doctor
can look at your hand.

306
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,149
It hurts.

307
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,952
We'll give you medicine
to make it better,

308
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:15,054
but you have to let us
clean out the germs first.

309
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:17,389
Abby, irrigate the wound
and start him on Augmentin.

310
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,524
Gloria, this looks
like a human bite.

311
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,193
Mm, his Uncle Charlie bit him.

312
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,695
Did you call Social Services?

313
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,962
That's Uncle Charlie.

314
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:26,549
Uh, Albert's my
grandson. Charlie's mine.

315
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,951
Oh. You're, uh, babysitting?

316
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,921
24/7 for the past two years,
if you call that babysitting.

317
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,623
Her daughter got involved with
someone with a drug problem.

318
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,975
She got pregnant. I got Albert.

319
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,111
How long have you
had that cough, Gloria?

320
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:40,846
Couple months. Okay.

321
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,414
It comes and goes. Here we go.

322
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,583
Do you smoke? Yeah.

323
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,252
But I go outside. I don't
light up around the kids.

324
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:50,105
Okay. I'd like to
get a chest x-ray.

325
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,357
No, I'm fine. I just need
you to look at Albert's hand.

326
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,026
It'll only take a few minutes.

327
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,861
What about Albert and Charlie?

328
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:58,631
I can take them to Daycare.
You don't have to do that.

329
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,898
It's not a problem. Let's go.

330
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,233
Let's go to the playroom.

331
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,719
Okay, I'll get a PA and
a lateral chest on Gloria.

332
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:04,942
Okay. Let's go.

333
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,356
Thanks.

334
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,508
Ow!

335
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:11,928
Grandma! Grandma!
Uncle Charlie bit the nurse!

336
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,146
<i>Is everything gone
crazy down here?</i>

337
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,981
I can't even log on
to the damn system.

338
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,249
Forget your password?

339
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,351
Uh, Dr. Romano. Here.
Peter, you're still here.

340
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,419
I had problems getting
into the parking garage.

341
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,888
Now I can't get
onto the computer.

342
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,589
You didn't get my
letter? What letter?

343
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,558
Your privileges have
been revoked. What?

344
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:29,377
Yeah, you remember that,
um, dialysis patient of yours?

345
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,279
Um... Uh, Fletcher.
That's right.

346
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,649
Well, your, uh, tattletaling
to the inspector general

347
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,752
cost me a $50,000 fine which,
uh, my insurance doesn't cover.

348
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,687
Look, I was just looking
out for my patient.

349
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,972
You also cost the hospital
a substantial EMTALA fine.

350
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:43,242
Now, I had to recoup those
monies from somewhere,

351
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:45,511
so I was forced to eliminate
the attending position.

352
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,313
It's all in the letter.
Hold on, hold on.

353
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:49,181
I mean, we can't talk
about this in private?

354
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,350
Why, Peter? You didn't
seem to feel the need

355
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,002
to talk in private
about our problem.

356
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,853
You just decided to
go off on your own.

357
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:55,854
So now you are.

358
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,390
So, what is my position here?

359
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:59,525
You have no
position here, Peter.

360
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,560
You're firing me?

361
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,645
No. No, no, no.

362
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,235
You fired yourself.

363
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,939
Hey, Cleo.

364
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,308
How are you at getting
insects out of little boys' ears?

365
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,465
Keep him still. I'll
get to him in a minute.

366
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,402
I brought her to the
doctor's with a sore throat.

367
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,172
That was three weeks ago.
She's still not getting any better.

368
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,907
Where are we?

369
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,442
I see tonsillar exudates.

370
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,044
What's that? Excuse me.

371
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,596
It's, uh, pus.

372
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,797
Gross.

373
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,548
Yeah, it looks like strep.

374
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,317
Did you take all the medication
the doctor prescribed last time?

375
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,619
Yes. She can't miss
any more school.

376
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,121
I'm going to order
a couple of tests

377
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,023
to rule out other
infections. Abby?

378
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,926
Rapid strep, mono spot,
Gram's stain and culture?

379
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,916
That'll do it. Thanks. Yep.

380
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,016
Abby...

381
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,684
can you find a room
for Mr. Duncan here?

382
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,386
Uh, sure.

383
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,587
Excuse me.

384
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,555
Ah, I need you to
suture a head lac, Abby.

385
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,358
I... I can't do that
now. I'm a nurse.

386
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,159
Oh, I forgot. Oh, can
you clean it up for me?

387
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,294
Sure. In a minute.

388
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:10,196
Abby... Abby. Just the
person I wanted to see.

389
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,830
Ah. Ooh, bear attack.

390
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:14,833
Listen. Um, I've got a trio of
businessmen with food poisoning.

391
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,169
Shoot them up with Compazine
and plug them into IV's.

392
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:20,072
And, oh, you might want to call
Housekeeping for some buckets.

393
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:21,507
Buckets?

394
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,642
It was an all-you-
can-eat buffet.

395
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,711
Hey. Anybody else need
anything? Bring it on.

396
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,779
If I'm being arrested,
I get a phone call.

397
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:29,615
You'll get it. There's
a phone upstairs.

398
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,117
Why are you letting
them move him?

399
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:32,684
The man's wanted for murder.

400
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,488
Lucky I recognized him.
Once a cop, always a cop.

401
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:36,989
This is not a police department.

402
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:39,325
Yeah, they can observe
him in the jail ward.

403
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:40,792
If people don't feel safe here,

404
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:43,262
they'll stop coming in when
they need medical attention.

405
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,764
- Only the criminals.
- I'm not talking to you.

406
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,966
I think we're done here.
I was still observing him.

407
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,369
Freaking liberal
foreigners. Uh...

408
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:52,671
It's my decision
to transfer or not.

409
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,773
Yeah, he's a threat to
the patients and the staff.

410
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:57,209
He needs to be in custody.
And that is<i> my</i> decision.

411
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,078
Hey, it's not so bad down here.

412
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,280
I'm gonna give you
some antibiotics.

413
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,615
But the next time that you
want to pierce your nipples,

414
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,851
I suggest you go to
a professional, okay?

415
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,420
You almost finished?
I need the bed.

416
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,444
Yeah.

417
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,823
Oh. Hey. How's it going?

418
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,527
Oh, great. Actually, it sucks.

419
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:16,662
I'm not allowed to do anything.

420
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,453
Uh, well...

421
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:23,235
Easy does it?

422
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,438
You might want to give
yourself a little bit of time.

423
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,273
Time and scut. I
got plenty of both.

424
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,208
It could be worse. How's that?

425
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:31,777
Did you have to pluck maggots
out of anybody's crotch today?

426
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,245
Ooh. I had a guy with crabs.

427
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,314
Ah. That's not even close.

428
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,149
Anything interesting
on the big board?

429
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,585
A UTI in Exam 2.

430
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:42,455
I was hoping for something
more than a bladder infection.

431
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,390
There are no small
patients, Carter.

432
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:45,958
What about dwarves?

433
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,727
So, Carter, you've known
Jing-Mei for a while, huh?

434
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,296
I knew her before
she was Jing-Mei.

435
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,164
So do you know
who got her pregnant?

436
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:54,633
Even if I did know that,
Dave, I don't know if I'd tell you.

437
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,469
That's not a definitive no.

438
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,204
You two haven't been...

439
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:02,825
Yeah. Uh-huh.

440
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,894
Sometimes this medicine
can give you muscle spasms.

441
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,164
Ooh!

442
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,334
Don't worry. That's easily
reversed with Benadryl.

443
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,043
And I'm sure you'll
all feel much better

444
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,178
after you're rehydrated, okay?

445
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,047
Abby. You need a hand in here?

446
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,932
Everything's under control.

447
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:29,034
How did you become paralyzed?

448
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,802
I was... I was hit by a car.

449
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,304
Um... on my bike.

450
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:35,474
And I would've been killed
if I wasn't wearing a helmet.

451
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:37,009
You were lucky, huh?

452
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,510
You know, I didn't
used to think so,

453
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,279
but... now I come
to the hospital,

454
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,614
and I see kids way
worse off than me.

455
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,716
It says on your chart that
you think you might have

456
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,852
a urinary tract infection.

457
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,653
Does it burn when you pee?

458
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,489
I don't know. I don't...
I don't feel much...

459
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:51,890
I don't feel much
below my waist.

460
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:53,625
But I can feel pressure
on my stomach...

461
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,027
you know, when I need to go

462
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,496
and, um, that's when I
know to catheterize myself.

463
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,298
And how often do you do that?

464
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,633
About every six to eight hours.

465
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:03,902
Uh, but lately I've... I've
been having to do it more,

466
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,405
which is usually a
sign I have an infection.

467
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,173
You put in your own catheters?

468
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,509
My grandmother used
to help me, you know.

469
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,512
She passed away
in... In February.

470
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,647
Who takes care of you now?

471
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:16,982
I live in a retirement home.

472
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,717
Um... you know,

473
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,285
it used to be me
and my grandmother,

474
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,821
and, you know, now it's
just me. I know that sounds...

475
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:23,989
really lame,

476
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,158
but it's across the
street from my school,

477
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,227
and some of the old
folks don't get a lot of visits

478
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,795
from their families, so
they like having me around.

479
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:33,115
It's kind of like having
20 grandparents, huh?

480
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,705
Ye... Yeah, it is.

481
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,238
Okay. You might
need some antibiotics.

482
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,506
And I'm gonna have
a nurse come in...

483
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,408
and get a urine sample.

484
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,627
Um. That's okay. I
can... I can do it myself.

485
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,568
I'm used to doing
stuff like that myself.

486
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,989
I'm gonna have a nurse
come in and help. Okay?

487
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,988
<i>I seem to be a magnet</i>

488
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,189
for the weird ones today.

489
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,925
Why? What's up with this guy?

490
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,993
Whoa! Oh!

491
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:03,695
Where did this water come from?

492
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,498
Oh. Mr. Kamatovik,
what did I tell you?

493
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:08,901
I found him soaking
his blanket in the sink.

494
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,569
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to make a mess.

495
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:13,005
Mr. Kamatovik, why
is your blanket wet?

496
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,973
I was afraid I was gonna burn.

497
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:18,710
I have a family history of
spontaneous human combustion.

498
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:19,711
Really? Yeah.

499
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:20,846
I... I... I gotta stay wet,

500
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,447
or I'm gonna go up
like a Roman candle.

501
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,216
Oh, get that oxygen
away from me... Hey!

502
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,302
Unless you want this
whole place to explode!

503
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,337
Mr. Kamatovik,
please just sit and relax.

504
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,922
I'll... I'll turn off the
oxygen in the hall, okay?

505
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:33,775
Dr. Chen, let's get
Mr. Kamatovik started

506
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,477
on a flame-retardant saline

507
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,946
and get somebody down
here from the special burn unit.

508
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,381
<i>Yes.</i> Okay.

509
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,167
Don't worry, Mr. Kamatovik.
We've got you covered. Okay?

510
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:43,485
Hey, chief!

511
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,220
Woah!

512
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,504
Oh!

513
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:47,756
You okay? Yeah.

514
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,058
There's... There's a
multi-trauma coming in.

515
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,028
A causeway collapsed at a
sci-fi convention. I'm good.

516
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,065
Spin a crit, dip a urine.

517
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,200
C-spine, chest and
pelvis. I'll be right there.

518
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,869
You okay, Cleo? So far, so good.

519
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,470
There were so many
we had to double up.

520
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,840
First one's a forearm
fracture from falling concrete.

521
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,475
Open or closed? Closed.
Neuro-circ is intact.

522
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,395
Got a 10-centimeter
scalp lac. No LOC.

523
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,629
Olbes got a bad one in 43.

524
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:12,181
What's this?

525
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,848
Looks like a
dislocated shoulder.

526
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,733
Neck pain with
midline tenderness.

527
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,870
BP 125/78. Pulse 90.

528
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:19,471
You got it? Yeah.

529
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:20,688
Where do you need me?

530
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,824
Triage the most critical
patients to the beds.

531
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,326
You got it.

532
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,662
23-year-old man, crushed
pelvis, fell at least 20 feet.

533
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,464
Danny. Danny. Where is he?

534
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,766
Who's Danny?

535
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,418
He's my brother. He
was standing next to me.

536
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:34,620
I think Morales got him.

537
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:35,921
He didn't want to go today.

538
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:37,723
I made him. Danny.

539
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,742
Looks like a bad tib-fib.

540
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,226
Please, don't let him die.

541
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,462
Let's take care of you
first, sir. What's your name?

542
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:46,231
Sir?

543
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,299
Sir, open your eyes.

544
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:49,251
Losing the pulse.

545
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,108
Okay, let's go.

546
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,573
Blunt chest trauma,
tachy at 120.

547
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:57,842
Decreased breath
sounds on the left. Abby?

548
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,644
I said we could
handle one major.

549
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,813
They've got 30 critical
patients on scene, Kerry.

550
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,982
I told them we could take
three major and 10 minor.

551
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,518
How can we handle criticals if
we don't have any surgeons?

552
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,054
We can stabilize and triage
them to surgery one at a time.

553
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,856
I hope that we can, Mark.
Frank. Page the surgeons.

554
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,725
They're all at the
conference. Page them.

555
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,327
Hey, can I help? No.

556
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:17,695
Looks like you're slammed.
All the more reason for you

557
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,364
to take the minor
medicals. No trauma.

558
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,632
We need you in Trauma 1.

559
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:23,068
Let's take him
to Curtain Area 2.

560
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,669
Give me the
greatest hits, Morales.

561
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,704
32-year-old male. Walkway fell.

562
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,740
This guy crushed his
right foot under a girder.

563
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,676
- What's wrong?
- Open fracture.

564
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,478
- Bleeding through the perineum.
- Pressure's down to 60.

565
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:34,646
I'll put in a central line.

566
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,315
How's the other patient?

567
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,816
They're putting in a chest tube.

568
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,484
Elizabeth, you should
go check on him.

569
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,453
I can't leave this
patient. Where's Peter?

570
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:42,654
Didn't Romano fire him?

571
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:43,755
What?!

572
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,058
No, I saw him earlier.
Try paging him.

573
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,360
Go on. I can handle this.

574
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,312
Kerry, he needs a
MAST suit inflated,

575
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,614
a suprapubic Foley, and
either a pelvic embolization

576
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,516
or application of
the external fixator.

577
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,285
You can't possibly
do all of that at once.

578
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,153
And I'm not leaving
him until he's stable.

579
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,122
And the other patient
has blunt chest trauma.

580
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,407
He might be bleeding out.

581
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:03,691
If he is, I'm sure
Dr. Kovac will come get me.

582
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,128
Get me a 3-0 nylon
and an OpSite.

583
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,295
Got it.

584
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,898
Tell Mark Greene we
are closed to trauma!

585
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:13,601
Urine dip is negative for
blood. Hemoglobin's 11.6.

586
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,704
Get him a unit
bed. Working on it.

587
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,841
Third liter of
saline up at 15:10.

588
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,709
Pressure's down
to 60. Tachy at 130.

589
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,293
I have some breath
sounds on the left.

590
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,596
20 of etomidate, 10 of Norcuron.

591
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,150
I'll intubate. Abby, prep
for a chest tube on the left.

592
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,102
Suction.

593
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:31,258
Open a Steri-Drape.

594
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,806
Too much edema.

595
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,109
I need the fiber-optic scope.

596
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,426
Abby... put in the chest tube.

597
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,363
I can't. I'm a nurse.

598
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,732
This guy needs a chest tube.
You're gonna have to do it.

599
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,584
It's a tough intubation.
You know how.

600
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,908
Go!

601
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:51,773
Ten blade.

602
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,742
Hey, hey! Get back in
bed, Mr. Kamatovik. I...

603
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,610
You're not supposed to be here.

604
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,978
Are you feeling better?

605
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,581
There was probably a lot of dust
when the causeway collapsed.

606
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,015
It aggravated your asthma.

607
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,386
All right. 60 of prednisone.

608
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,355
Repeat nebs in 30
minutes. Sorry about that.

609
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,722
It's like<i> Mars Attacks</i> in here.

610
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,324
Got a 23-year-old
male with hip pain.

611
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,611
BP's 130/85, pulse 110.
There's no obvious deformity.

612
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:13,979
Ah! Okay.

613
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:15,347
Let's cut this off, please.

614
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,848
No! Don't cut my costume, man!

615
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,317
I need to take a
look at your hip.

616
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:19,518
The zipper's in the back.

617
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,886
Fine. Unzip Zontar here.
Titrate 10 of morphine.

618
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,138
Get a AP pelvis
and a right hip film.

619
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,174
Where the hell is
Benton? I think he quit.

620
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:30,111
We got a bad tib-fib fracture,
and he's losing foot pulses.

621
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,714
We gotta get him to the OR
now. We're short surgeons.

622
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,315
I thought we were
closing to traumas.

623
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,818
It's a little late for that
now. I'll get Corday.

624
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,486
Liver and spleen look good.

625
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,672
Excellent. Bleeding must
be limited to the pelvis.

626
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:43,008
We've a patient with probable
compartment syndrome.

627
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:45,594
Do your best to stabilize him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

628
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,961
And we need the digital Stryker.

629
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,797
Call upstairs. No,
it's under the sink.

630
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,632
Dr. Greene borrowed
it from the OR.

631
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,119
Oh, stole it, more like.
Never mind. Let him use it.

632
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,188
Just tell him I want the
results of the readings.

633
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:57,756
Systolics are down to 70.

634
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,975
Another two units
of packed cells.

635
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,309
Oh, Dr. Weaver. Cops are coming

636
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,545
to arrest your pneumonia
mom, Gloria. For what?

637
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,097
Frank said for
writing bad checks.

638
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,716
Oh. Elizabeth, you
okay for a minute?

639
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,772
Yeah. Go.

640
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,887
Hey, did somebody get hurt?

641
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,344
Uh, yeah.

642
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,593
Hey, did that nurse come in yet

643
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:18,794
and get the urine sample?

644
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,328
No. What happened?

645
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,531
A, uh, walkway collapsed
over at the Tarver Center.

646
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,684
Run two units O-neg
on the rapid infuser.

647
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,085
Type and cross for four more.

648
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,954
A lot of people got
hurt, huh? Yeah.

649
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:32,224
That's too bad. I bet
they never saw it coming.

650
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:34,443
I sure didn't.

651
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,967
Okay. Let's get
you up here, huh?

652
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:39,664
Oh.

653
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:41,266
Uh.

654
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,934
I'm sorry. I... I didn't
know I had to go.

655
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,404
I would've cathed myself,
but I was waiting for the nurse.

656
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,239
It's okay. No big deal, Dennis.

657
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:50,041
Oh, uh, I'll get to him
in a minute, Carter.

658
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:51,743
Oh, that's all right.
I got this, Lydia.

659
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,211
They need you in
the trauma rooms.

660
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:55,680
Are you sure? Yeah. Go.

661
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,049
You know...

662
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:59,513
most doctors don't
like to do this stuff.

663
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,671
All right, let's get you...

664
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,206
out of those wet clothes.

665
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,910
BP's stable at 140/90 in
all three compartments.

666
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,845
His leg is cool.

667
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,547
He's losing
circulation to the foot.

668
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:23,758
Gloria. This is the Zithromax.

669
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,793
Take two tomorrow,

670
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,428
then one a day for
the next four days.

671
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,730
Is something wrong?

672
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,800
Yes. The police are on
their way to pick you up.

673
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:32,801
What?

674
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,502
They have a warrant
out for your arrest.

675
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,072
You know, sometimes I have to
bounce a check to buy some time.

676
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,373
But I... I... I usually pay
everything off in time.

677
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,542
I just... You know
what? I've got two jobs.

678
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,345
I understand. Here
we go. Right this way.

679
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,815
Daycare... Hey... Hey... Hey...
Day... Woah... Day... Honey,

680
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,916
Daycare is up this way.

681
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,000
The fourth floor!

682
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,968
Thanks for everything!

683
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,137
Kerry.

684
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:53,905
Oh. Tell me that
you're here to help out.

685
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,107
No. But I will take
Mr. Kamatovik up to Psych

686
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,410
once we get a bed available.
Yeah, I appreciate that,

687
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:00,778
but we could really use an
extra pair of hands down here.

688
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,647
Sorry. We've got our
own problems up there.

689
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,350
Tonight's the full moon.
Stop by... later, if you want.

690
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,140
It'll be like Mardi Gras.

691
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,377
Anterior compartment
pressure is 68.

692
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,545
That's not good.

693
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,981
Normal is 30. He
needs a fasciotomy now.

694
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,282
You're gonna do this?

695
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,984
I did one in med school...

696
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,085
on a cadaver.

697
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,552
Well, you can't do it down here.

698
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,189
If we don't do this now, he's
gonna need an amputation.

699
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,246
Get Corday on the intercom.

700
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,978
<i>Dr. Corday?</i> What is it?

701
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:35,813
<i>We've got the pressures.</i>

702
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:37,782
<i>An average reading: 65.</i>

703
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,634
<i>I have to open the compartments.</i>

704
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,919
Yeah, well, we're ready.

705
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:42,620
This guy's bleeding
from his pelvis.

706
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:43,755
You're gonna have to wait.

707
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,574
Can't wait. We've
lost foot pulses.

708
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,426
Look, could you get
another surgeon?

709
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,927
<i>No one's here.</i>

710
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,746
You're gonna have
to talk me through this.

711
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,931
<i>Well, I don't think I can.</i>

712
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:54,904
<i>You're gonna have
to do this, Elizabeth.</i>

713
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:01,072
Another oh-silk, please.

714
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,395
What are you doing?

715
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:05,710
Sewing in a chest tube.

716
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:08,113
When I said you'd get more
medical experience down here,

717
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:09,981
this is not what I meant.

718
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:11,382
Nurses do not
sew in chest tubes.

719
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:12,383
Do they, Dr. Kovac?

720
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:14,385
She knows how. Of course.

721
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:16,988
But our malpractice
insurance no longer covers her

722
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:20,191
doing anything outside the
scope of normal nursing practices.

723
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,593
We were short-handed.

724
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,895
The patient could have
died if she hadn't put it in.

725
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,614
You let her put
in the chest tube?

726
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:29,667
It's your responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

727
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:31,836
- She did a great job.
- That's not the point.

728
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,121
You should've called me.

729
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,822
You were busy. Step back, Abby.

730
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,292
I... I'm really almost done.
You know... Step back!

731
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,194
Get Corday some Pavulon.

732
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:46,801
I need some Pavulon.

733
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,403
How's it going in there?

734
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,138
I'll live.

735
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,375
Hey, do you know if we have
any extra-small scrubs in here?

736
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,743
Sure they'll fit you?

737
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:58,480
Ha, I got a paraplegic kid
with a UTI who just wet himself.

738
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,149
I want to give him something to
change into, and these are huge.

739
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,484
Well, don't ask me.

740
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,886
I didn't even know I was
working here till today.

741
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,023
I swear, I can't
win with Weaver.

742
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,508
Well, who can?

743
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:13,310
Here, she drags me down
here claiming it's for my benefit,

744
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,480
so I can get more experience,
but not too much experience.

745
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,215
Talk to your nurse
manager. Right.

746
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,018
And then Weaver
completely hates me

747
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:21,686
if I ever come back
as a med student.

748
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,355
Oh, you'll come back.

749
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,423
I don't know I want to.
This place is a freak show.

750
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,042
This place grows on
you. So does foot fungus.

751
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,611
Abby, get Mr. Palmer a
CBC, urine dip, myoglobin,

752
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,863
put in a Foley.

753
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,231
Uh, which one's Palmer?

754
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:35,383
Three-hundred-pounder
with blue skin.

755
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,636
Oh, excellent. Fat
and colorful. Here.

756
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,006
Hey. Well, at least you
got something to do.

757
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,908
I'll trade you Jabba
the Hutt for the UTI.

758
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:44,747
I said I was bored,
not desperate.

759
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,129
Abby. Corday's still
waiting on that Pavulon.

760
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,285
Right.

761
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,617
Your self-diagnosis
was right on!

762
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:54,853
You got a urinary
tract infection.

763
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,421
Hey, are these for me?

764
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:57,955
Well, you think like a doctor.

765
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:00,525
So you might as
well dress like one.

766
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,094
I will help you put those
on when I get back.

767
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:06,698
I'm writing you a
prescription for some Bactrim.

768
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,366
If you follow all the directions

769
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,201
and take<i> all</i> the pills,

770
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,503
you'll be better in no time.

771
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:12,904
Oh, and, uh...

772
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:15,206
think I could get some extra
catheters while I'm here?

773
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,108
Sometimes they forget
to order them for me.

774
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,576
I think we can manage that.

775
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,545
Really? Sure.

776
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,515
Thanks. Here, I
made <i>this</i> for you.

777
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,285
Hey, thanks. That's very cool.

778
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,121
Well, now, it's supposed
to look like an F-22 Raptor.

779
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,355
Oh, you like jets?

780
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,090
Yeah. I wanted to be a pilot.

781
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:35,710
Now I make paper
airplanes, but...

782
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:36,933
Will it fly?

783
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,047
Yeah.

784
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,882
Here. Check it out.

785
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,149
Frank?

786
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,352
Where is Frank?

787
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,620
Grow up, Malucci!

788
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,627
What did I do? You
got patients to treat.

789
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,175
Lydia said you
needed more Versed?

790
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,477
Yeah. Try another two.

791
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:54,782
There's a lot of masseter spasm.

792
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:57,181
So...

793
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,083
when are we gonna meet Daddy?

794
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,084
Huh?

795
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,819
The father... of your baby.

796
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:04,043
Everybody's kind of curious.

797
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,647
How's he doing?

798
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,262
He's out.

799
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,430
You know, my pregnancy...

800
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,899
is none of your business.

801
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:16,233
In fact...

802
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,936
nothing remotely concerned

803
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,037
with my personal life

804
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:21,781
is anybody's business.

805
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:26,477
I... I just wanted to
meet the lucky guy.

806
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,968
You do know who
the father is, right?

807
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:32,383
Hey, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

808
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:35,252
I can't help myself sometimes.

809
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,154
There's something
about seeing you this way

810
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,690
that I find very sexy.

811
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:41,759
I'm gonna order a
post-reduction film.

812
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:44,128
Whoa... Whoa.
Conscious-sedation protocol.

813
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,564
Somebody's gotta babysit
this guy till he wakes up.

814
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:49,567
Yeah? Well, I guess
that would be your job...

815
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:50,601
Dave.

816
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,825
Thank you.

817
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,138
Oh, crap. What's wrong?

818
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,207
Got a 16-year-old with
gonorrhea in her throat.

819
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:58,409
Her mom brought her. Now
I gotta find a way to tell her

820
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,378
without her mom
finding out. I'll take that.

821
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:02,413
No, that's okay. Come
on. Your hands are full.

822
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:03,614
Carter, I've got it.

823
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:05,583
<i>Lateral incision.</i>

824
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:09,220
<i>Start three finger breadths
below the fibular head</i>

825
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,956
<i>and carry it down to
above the lateral malleolus.</i>

826
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,224
How deep?

827
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,726
First incision...

828
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,450
just through the skin and sub-Q.

829
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,781
Got it.

830
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,250
Is there anything I can do?

831
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,336
Yeah. Get Elizabeth out here.

832
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:28,740
What's next?!

833
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:30,325
<i>Now, carefully,</i>

834
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:34,746
extend the incision through
the deep fascia of the anterior

835
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,547
<i>and lateral compartment.</i>

836
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:39,751
What about the
anterior tibial nerve?

837
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,474
<i>You should be okay.</i>

838
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,863
Don't cut too deep, and
you'll stay superficial to it.

839
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,561
How's he doing?

840
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:52,297
Who? Mark or my patient?

841
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,801
I'm gonna need
more type-specific.

842
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,603
Hey, Moira. Where's your mom?

843
00:32:58,627 --> 00:32:59,871
She went to find you.

844
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,373
She was getting really
pissed off waiting around.

845
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,442
Well, it's good she's not here.

846
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:05,732
Why?

847
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,367
You have a sexually
transmitted disease.

848
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:13,768
What?

849
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,325
You contracted gonorrhea.

850
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,039
Wait. But that's impossible.

851
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,843
I... I've never even
had sex. I'm a virgin.

852
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,378
What about oral sex?

853
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,585
That doesn't count.

854
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,650
Oh, God.

855
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:32,053
You and your boyfriend both
need to be treated with antibiotics.

856
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,389
He gave me
gonorrhea in my throat?

857
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,524
Have you had any more partners?

858
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,592
I'm not a slut.

859
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,645
I didn't even want to
do it in the first place.

860
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:42,068
Then don't.

861
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,933
You're not gonna
tell my mom, right?

862
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,751
No. But you have to promise me

863
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,953
you're going to
practice safe sex.

864
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:51,505
I thought I was.

865
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,706
All right.

866
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,664
Yes.

867
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,445
Hello? Hey, it's me.

868
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,380
Peter?

869
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,049
What are you doing home?

870
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,583
There was a surgical conference,

871
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,718
so all elective surgery
was canceled today.

872
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,720
I figured I'd come home
and hang out with Reese.

873
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:10,491
Oh. Being an attending
has its privileges.

874
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,260
Hey, man.

875
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,895
Hey. Reese. How are you?

876
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,531
What's happening?

877
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,532
Hey. What's this?

878
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,684
What you playing with, huh?

879
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,353
Playing with your fire
truck? Want to be a fireman?

880
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:23,688
Huh? What's that?

881
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:26,162
Horse, huh? You
want to be a cowboy?

882
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,186
Looks like I'm gonna have
two doctors in the family.

883
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,562
How much longer am
I gonna have to wait?

884
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,464
Have a seat. Someone
will see you in a minute.

885
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,366
I've been seen. She disappeared.

886
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,268
Who's that? I don't
know. Some black woman.

887
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,602
She came into the room,

888
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,654
looked at my daughter's
throat three hours ago!

889
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,507
What's your daughter's name?
Garvey. This is ridiculous!

890
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,959
Mrs. Garvey. Oh, there she is.

891
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:02,343
Where have you been? At lunch?

892
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,311
I'm sorry. I had some
traumas come in.

893
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,748
I gave Moira her shot.
She's ready to go home.

894
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,883
Three hours to get a needle.

895
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,485
I'll be right there
to discharge her.

896
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,952
What did you say
to her? Nothing.

897
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,576
I don't even know
who... Who she is.

898
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:17,942
BP 110, pulse 95.

899
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:19,510
Tell them I'll be
up in a little while

900
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,178
to put in a suprapubic catheter.

901
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,315
Tell the blood bank to send
the other two units upstairs.

902
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,517
Hey. How's he doing?

903
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,285
Pulses are bounding.

904
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:29,687
May I take a look?

905
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,789
Did you get your guy's
pressure back up?

906
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:34,173
Oh, yeah. After eight
units of packed cells.

907
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,161
That's not bad for a first time.

908
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,296
Piece of cake when
you follow directions.

909
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,198
Yes. Funny how I
can talk you through

910
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,734
a complicated fasciotomy,

911
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:45,603
but when I tell you to pick up
your socks, you just ignore me.

912
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:47,493
I'm sorry, did you
just say something?

913
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:52,260
Dr. Dave: 14. Death: Zero.

914
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,195
Nice job on triage, Dr. Malucci.

915
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,163
Ah, thanks a lot,
chief. I still can't believe

916
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,465
we didn't get one penetrating
chest trauma, you know?

917
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,936
Hey! We got another
one. Greg Fulton, Exam 5.

918
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,794
Wanted for assault, battery
and indecent exposure.

919
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,807
Hey! Sorry, Frank.

920
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,443
This isn't working.

921
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,210
What are you saying?
We made two arrests.

922
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,513
It would've been three if
that mother hadn't escaped.

923
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,182
And between you and me, I think
someone on staff tipped her off.

924
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,851
No more record
checks on patients.

925
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,218
What did you do with my patient?

926
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,587
Mr. Kamatovik? I got him a bed,

927
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:20,721
but he's gone AWOL.

928
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,225
Well, he can't
have gotten too far.

929
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,593
You look pretty good in scrubs.

930
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,761
Uh, can I keep them?

931
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,225
Uh... sure. Hey, I'll
be right back, okay?

932
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,933
Hey, Cleo.

933
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,236
Was that your
gonorrhea patient? Yep.

934
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,438
Did you manage to treat
her without Mom finding out?

935
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,006
Yep.

936
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,041
Listen, I wasn't trying
to step on your toes.

937
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,676
When I offered to take the case,

938
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,278
I was just trying to help.

939
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,214
I know.

940
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,649
Hey, Cleo.

941
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,984
Do you, uh...

942
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,653
have a problem
with me being here?

943
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,277
Course not.

944
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,018
I told you. He's disappeared.

945
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,932
What is this?

946
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,734
Alcohol wipes.

947
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:10,371
He says he has to stay cool to
avoid spontaneous combustion.

948
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,140
Yeah. He begged me to
give him a Popsicle enema.

949
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,878
We settled for ice chips.

950
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,414
Mr. Kamatovik. Are you in there?

951
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,582
Yes!

952
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,818
All right. Come out
so we can help you.

953
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,386
I can't!

954
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,522
I'm burning up. I
need wet blankets.

955
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:28,890
We can get you some upstairs.

956
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,408
You want me to
bring him out, chief?

957
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:31,597
Please.

958
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:34,795
Mr. Kamatovik, open up.

959
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,394
Somebody call the burn unit!

960
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:51,851
Get a gurney!

961
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,515
This is a modified version

962
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,685
of Ken Blackburn's
1998 world-record design.

963
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,354
Sure you want to launch it?

964
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,757
Piece of folded
paper until you let it fly.

965
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,841
All right, let it fly.

966
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,448
All right.

967
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:10,631
Wow.

968
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,317
That looks like it
could go on forever.

969
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:14,902
Mm, theoretically, it could,

970
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:18,272
if the wind kept blowing,
and it kept finding up currents.

971
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,074
This is really cool. I've never
been up this high before.

972
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:26,964
Looks like your ride is here.

973
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:29,322
I'm out of airplanes anyway.

974
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:35,162
Oh.

975
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,408
Thanks for bringing
me up here, Dr. Carter.

976
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:40,011
Well, you make
some more airplanes,

977
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:41,578
and we can do it again sometime.

978
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:43,486
I'd like that.

979
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,662
Hey. Hey.

980
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,511
You were popular today, huh?

981
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,968
I know.

982
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,005
What's that about?

983
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,979
I'm everybody's favorite nurse.

984
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,396
Oh. But that's the problem,
because as a med student,

985
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,633
I screwed up everything.

986
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:21,390
Everything. Things I could
do even with my eyes closed.

987
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,039
I think it's all in... here.

988
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,063
The...

989
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,778
You are a good nurse, Abby.

990
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,002
But you could be a<i> great</i> doctor.

991
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,106
Just need a little confidence.

992
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,391
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

993
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,496
I can't believe I did that.

994
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,830
Abby. Yeah?

995
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,334
You got a code
brown with Mr. Pozoni.

996
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:56,058
Again? Jeez. How
much can that guy eat?

997
00:39:58,747 --> 00:39:59,787
I gotta go.

998
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,536
Yeah.

999
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,629
I'll see you later.

1000
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,730
Bye. Bye.

1001
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,536
Peter, are you here?

1002
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:17,163
I've been calling.
Why didn't you pick up?

1003
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,879
I didn't feel like talking.

1004
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:24,282
I went up during my break.
Shirley said you'd been fired.

1005
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:26,417
Hm.

1006
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:28,841
I guess the whole hospital
knows by now, huh?

1007
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:31,761
Why didn't you tell me?

1008
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,077
Peter, I was worried
about you. I called Jackie.

1009
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,644
She said you had
been gone for hours.

1010
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:38,663
What did you tell her?

1011
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,281
I didn't tell her anything...

1012
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,184
except I didn't have
any idea where you were.

1013
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,111
What happened?

1014
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,148
Peter?

1015
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,317
You can tell me.

1016
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,931
Ah, Romano got hit
with a big EMTALA fine

1017
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,567
over the Fletcher case.

1018
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,268
Good. He deserves it.

1019
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,852
Yeah. Well, now he's
taking it out on me.

1020
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,459
Maybe he's just
blowing off steam.

1021
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,883
No. I've seen him do that.

1022
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,340
This time he's serious.

1023
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,585
Talk to somebody.

1024
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,970
Call Anspaugh.

1025
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:20,304
Tell him what?

1026
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:23,941
Tell him Romano is a
racist, sexist, elitist jackass.

1027
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,764
Cleo, he knows that.

1028
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:30,469
You're an excellent
surgeon, Peter.

1029
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,984
And you're a good man.

1030
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,308
And we'll work it out.

1031
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,556
How's it going, Carter?
Good. My day got better. You?

1032
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,791
Yeah. Think so.

1033
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:58,993
Hey... Heck, no.

1034
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,095
It was like, rrooh, the
guy just went up in flames.

1035
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,496
You should have seen it.

1036
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,032
Hey, Carter. You ever see
spontaneous human combustion?

1037
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,968
Uh, no, Dave. It doesn't exist.

1038
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:08,469
Ah. I was there. I saw it.

1039
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,271
No lighter, no
matches, no nothing.

1040
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,440
He's right. I went on a
missing-persons call once.

1041
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:14,225
All we found was
this old gal's legs.

1042
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:15,992
The rest of her
burned to a crisp.

1043
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,512
But that chair she was
sitting in, barely singed.

1044
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,464
So, Carter, how was
your first day back?

1045
00:42:20,488 --> 00:42:22,533
It was good. A little slow.

1046
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:24,601
Glad to hear it. Finished up?

1047
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,537
Yeah. I am
officially out of here.

1048
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:28,681
Just one last thing to do.

1049
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:30,729
Sure.

1050
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,777
You coming with me?

1051
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,401
That's the rules.

1052
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:40,317
Sorry, Carter, I have to
witness the entire process.

1053
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:43,120
Trust me. It's no
treat for me either.

1054
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,335
Seen any good movies lately?

1055
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,692
No.

1056
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:09,502
You want me to run
some water or something?
