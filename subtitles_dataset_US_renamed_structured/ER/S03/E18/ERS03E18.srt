1
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,110
Am I going to be late again?

2
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,373
No... and starting today

3
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,864
we are both going to be on time.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,198
Who's picking me up?

5
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,617
Tina's mom.

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,679
You're going to play over there

7
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:21,314
and then I'll pick you
up right after dinner.

8
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:22,304
I hate Tina.

9
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,988
Don't say that... she likes you.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,973
No, she doesn't.

11
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:26,324
Her mom's just doing you

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,443
a favor.

13
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:29,311
That's not true.

14
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,730
I'm sure the bell just rang.

15
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:39,387
I hate going in late.

16
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:40,672
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,657
This is the last time, I swear.

18
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,560
I can't wait till
Mommy gets back.

19
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,450
Have a nice day.

20
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,147
Can I help you?

21
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,949
Yeah, I'm looking
for Carla Reese.

22
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,439
She went home last night.

23
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,675
Thank you.

24
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,307
What are you doing?

25
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:20,879
Oh, um... I was,
um, just going over

26
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,147
Carla Reese's discharge summary.

27
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,617
That's confidential.

28
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,886
Yeah, I know.

29
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,056
Dr. Coburn, um...
I'm the child's father.

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,125
She told me.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,995
It's still confidential,
and you know it.

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,331
Why did you order a
glucose tolerance test?

33
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,679
I'm not going to
answer that question.

34
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,870
Does she have
gestational diabetes?

35
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,872
Good-bye, Doctor.

36
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,946
Gestational diabetes
can put the fetus at risk

37
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,648
of heart problems,
metabolic problems.

38
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,833
Look, Dr. Coburn, I think
I have a right to know.

39
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,879
If you want to know

40
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:01,497
what's going on with your child,

41
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,589
then I suggest
you ask the mother.

42
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:09,277
Aha, thought I'd find you here.

43
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:10,545
Here I am.

44
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:12,280
Hey, it's supposed
to be a great weekend.

45
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,793
They say it'll
get up in the 70s.

46
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:14,494
Oh, yeah...

47
00:02:14,518 --> 00:02:15,550
Damn it.

48
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:16,762
You're in a good mood.

49
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:17,919
I was doing fine

50
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:20,255
until the clinic called
with my blood test results.

51
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,572
Oh?

52
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,824
My viral load's up to 1,000.

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
A thousand is not significant.

54
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:25,844
It is to me.

55
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,812
Perfect timing.

56
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,958
What do you mean?

57
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,715
Today is Al and my anniversary.

58
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,449
It would have been nine years.

59
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,852
Talk about the gift
that keeps on giving.

60
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,066
Jeanie, you had
the flu last week.

61
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,234
That's why your
viral load went up.

62
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,524
Give it two weeks.

63
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,509
It'll be back to undetectable.

64
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:42,294
Think so?

65
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,463
Yeah... and I'm the expert.

66
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,865
I also think we should
rechristen this date in history.

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,166
What do you mean?

68
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,212
I propose April 17

69
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,035
be the anniversary of our first

70
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,315
weekend getaway.

71
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,305
Keep talking.

72
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,367
All right.

73
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,219
How does a suite at
Indian Lake resort sound?

74
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,254
They have great restaurants,
massages in the room.

75
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,856
We can leave tonight,
come back Sunday.

76
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,179
Sounds nice.

77
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,392
It will be, I promise.

78
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,982
Hey...

79
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,434
Stop worrying, okay?

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,591
Aw, come on, don't lie.

81
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,393
You did not buy this car.

82
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,384
Boxster, dude... I'm leasing it.

83
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,696
How? To afford
those kind of wheels

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,398
man, you got to be
making some doctor ducats.

85
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,400
Well, then just call
me Dr. Markovic.

86
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,590
Okay, Doc.

87
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,603
Jerry, did that attending
meeting start on time?

88
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,973
Yeah, and Anspaugh was
looking for you, but don't bother.

89
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,674
I think it ended about
five minutes ago.

90
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,663
Catwoman?

91
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,999
Yeah, Rachel left it in my car.

92
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,266
I should call the school

93
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,135
to make sure they're
going to feed her...

94
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,848
Mark, we need to talk.

95
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,138
Sorry about the meeting.

96
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,406
No, don't worry about it.

97
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,875
Listen, the search committee
received your application

98
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,277
for the teaching position
along with Kerry Weaver's.

99
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,757
I thought Kerry was going
for the research position.

100
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,116
She is... the teaching
job is just her fall-back.

101
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,318
Now, between us, you're
the better candidate.

102
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,353
Now, Kerry's
intellect is superior,

103
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,733
but she doesn't have
your people skills.

104
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,823
Thanks.

105
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,569
The hitch is, you
haven't published.

106
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,771
Whereas Kerry, she's
written seven articles...

107
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,839
Two in the<i> Annals.</i>

108
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,996
Seven?

109
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,243
Exactly, which
means you have to find

110
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,445
an interesting
case and write it up.

111
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,768
Show the committee

112
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,014
you're not illiterate.

113
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,004
A case?

114
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,283
And soon.

115
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,508
I went out on a
limb to back you.

116
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,793
Don't make me
look like an idiot.

117
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:16,676
Damn it.

118
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,260
Damn it, damn it.

119
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,837
Carol?

120
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:23,204
What are you
doing? What is this?

121
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,507
You're reading... is it<i>
Harrison's Internal Medicine?</i>

122
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,508
What are you doing?

123
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:27,620
I'm checking the rate

124
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,622
of oxidated metabolism
in hypothyroidism.

125
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,079
This is important to you?

126
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,025
It was on the
medical board exam.

127
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,415
I put "above normal."

128
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,400
The answer is "below normal."

129
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,080
Every day I think of
another test question

130
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,223
and when I go to look it
up, I find out I got it wrong.

131
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,474
I'm sure you did fine.

132
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,741
No, Doug.

133
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,254
I've looked up
maybe 30 questions,

134
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,244
all of which I missed.

135
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,562
I did not do fine, okay?

136
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,564
Okay, all right, you're right.

137
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,832
But you do things for people

138
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,801
that doctors don't
even think about doing.

139
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:55,287
Carol?

140
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,300
This guy in the hall
needs a clean-up.

141
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,164
He just did a major code brown.

142
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,120
You're right.

143
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,155
I wipe butts

144
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,746
and take orders from
25-year-old interns.

145
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,152
Who's the jockey on Goosebumps?

146
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:13,087
Is that turf or dirt? Uh-huh.

147
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,723
And what's the
conditions at the track?

148
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,226
Easy.

149
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,861
Well, listen, put me
down for a double pop...

150
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,129
Goosebumps to win.

151
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:24,065
Either of you want any action?

152
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,811
I got the lowdown on a miler.

153
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:26,818
You're a gambler, huh?

154
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,031
Investor... if I want to gamble,

155
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,165
I'll play the stock market.

156
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,433
This is scientific.

157
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,990
What about it?

158
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:32,757
No, thanks.

159
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,075
Your loss.

160
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,142
Doc?

161
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,911
Uh, sure.

162
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:38,758
Put me down for five bucks.

163
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:40,014
Five bucks?

164
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,850
A high-roller.

165
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:44,129
I see you've been
vomiting... since yesterday?

166
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,371
Yeah, I think I caught
the flu from my cat.

167
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,318
Okay, we're going
to run a few tests,

168
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,675
and let's get an X ray
of his abdomen as well.

169
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,842
Can I keep my hat on?

170
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,011
Sure... why?

171
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,579
It's my thing.

172
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,632
Once I make a bet, I keep
the hat on till the payoff.

173
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,066
Oh, scientific, huh?

174
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:01,653
Hey, Einstein wore
brown socks for luck.

175
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,038
Now, who am I to
argue with that, huh?

176
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:10,011
Hey, Jeanie, some guy
dropped this off for you.

177
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,379
Who?

178
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,058
I think it was your ex-husband.

179
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:14,048
When?

180
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,243
He just left.

181
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:21,856
Al.

182
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,103
Hi, I see you got the flowers.

183
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,443
What's this about?

184
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,444
Uh, nothing.

185
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,458
Just it's our anniversary,

186
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,893
and I was thinking of
you, like it says on the card.

187
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,849
It's inappropriate.

188
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,284
Jeanie, it's no big deal.

189
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,337
I don't want to celebrate a
marriage that was a disaster

190
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,505
from beginning to end.

191
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,118
I didn't mean to upset you.

192
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,125
Well, here... just... here.

193
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,594
No... keep them.

194
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,664
Give them to a
patient or something.

195
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,825
Oh, God!

196
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,260
Ida Blinnder, 55,
acute abdominal pain.

197
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:01,796
It's like my stomach
is exploding.

198
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:04,098
BP 100/70, pulse 90.

199
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,099
I need surgery.

200
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:06,534
All right, draw the usual labs.

201
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,504
Add an amylase, some LFTs
and call a surgical consult.

202
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,251
Oh, good Lord, it looks
like a railroad yard.

203
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:15,155
Mrs. Blinnder, I see you're
no stranger to surgery.

204
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,811
I've had five operations.

205
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,730
They never find anything.

206
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,405
You've had all these
for the same problem?

207
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,433
It comes back.

208
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:24,152
Mrs. Blinnder,
do you ever suffer

209
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,854
the loss of sensation
in your arms and legs?

210
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,456
Yes... yes, I do.

211
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:30,624
Cancel the surgeon.

212
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,576
Why?

213
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,744
What's going on?

214
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,857
There's a rare condition
called porphyria.

215
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,648
It's often misdiagnosed
as surgical.

216
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,316
It's really a metabolic disease.

217
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,528
You mean this poor thing

218
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,063
had five operations
she didn't need?

219
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,153
It's possible.

220
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,199
This could be the perfect case

221
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,889
to write up for the<i> Journal.</i>

222
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,558
Let's get a CBC and lytes.

223
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,375
What's happening?

224
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,521
Don't worry, Mrs. Blinnder.

225
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,389
We're going to get
to the bottom of this.

226
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:51,746
Excuse me.

227
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,581
A little help?

228
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,216
Malik, get a gurney.

229
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,362
Found her in a car

230
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,864
outside of Grayson Cemetery

231
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,565
just sitting there
bleeding to death.

232
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:00,589
These your belts?

233
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,201
Yeah, that's all we
had for tourniquets.

234
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:03,536
How much blood has she lost?

235
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,604
It's hard to tell.

236
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,256
The car had dark upholstery.

237
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,312
Get the belts off.

238
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,247
See if she has
an arterial bleed.

239
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,660
No spurting on this side.

240
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:11,744
Can I get a pulse below the cut?

241
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,429
Must have used a dull knife.

242
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,664
Guys, something
ugly is going on.

243
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,137
Well, get the suction.

244
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,583
Think she swallowed something?

245
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,008
Did you see any containers,
poisons, insecticides?

246
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:20,942
We didn't look...
Just scooped and ran.

247
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,943
What's her name?

248
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:22,944
No ID.

249
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,257
Go back and check her car.

250
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:26,581
Give me an Ewal tube
and activated charcoal.

251
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:27,865
We got to pump her out.

252
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,385
Jeanie, could you hold her head?

253
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,514
Yeah.

254
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,582
Here it is.

255
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,838
Oh, the pain!

256
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,673
"Unexplained abdominal crisis.

257
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,609
Symptoms include
absence of fever."

258
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,610
What's her temp?

259
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,611
Normal.

260
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,612
Good.

261
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:41,979
"Porphobilinogen in the urine."

262
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:42,980
Let's get a UA.

263
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,293
You going to write this up

264
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,262
for the<i> Annals of
Emergency Medicine?</i>

265
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,620
And the<i> New England Journal,</i>
maybe the<i> New York Times.</i>

266
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,522
Yeah, who knows how
many needless surgeries

267
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,922
are done in cases like this?

268
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,923
"Porphyria: the hidden tragedy."

269
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,036
Am I going to get an operation?

270
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,026
Absolutely not.

271
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,761
But I want an operation.

272
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,479
Mrs. Blinnder, you
don't understand.

273
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,825
Mrs. Blinnder, you
don't need surgery.

274
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,382
What you have is porphyria.

275
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,383
No, she doesn't.

276
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,496
What? She's psych.

277
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,931
She enjoys having
surgery done on her.

278
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:06,921
"Enjoys"?

279
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,556
Mm-hmm.

280
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:11,225
She's convinced five
different doctors to cut her.

281
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,838
It's a lie... I do need surgery.

282
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,828
Mrs. Blinnder...

283
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,040
Oh, God, the pain!

284
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,498
Call psych... tell them
to bring down the net.

285
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,884
And cancel the<i> New York Times.</i>

286
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,285
Hey, Carla, it's Peter.

287
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,286
Are you there?

288
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,354
All right, listen.

289
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,267
When you get
this, do me a favor.

290
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,159
Give me a call either at
the hospital or at home,

291
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,805
or page me... 555-0197, okay?

292
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,241
I hope you get this,
and I hope you call.

293
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,231
All right, bye.

294
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,232
Hey, what is it, Carter?

295
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,500
I got a 68-year-old guy

296
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,036
with diffuse abdominal
pain, no focal tenderness

297
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,304
some bowel edema,
but no acute obstruction.

298
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,907
Well, he's got a history of
peripheral vascular disease

299
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,076
so I was thinking about
getting an angiogram.

300
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,323
You know what? Hand it off
to Dixon, because you and I

301
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,558
are supposed to be covering
the wards two minutes ago.

302
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,714
I'd rather stick with him.

303
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,083
His temp's up, he's looking gray

304
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,151
and I just don't want him

305
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,785
to get lost in the
shuffle, you know?

306
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,132
All right, stick with him.

307
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,166
If he needs surgery,
Anspaugh's on call.

308
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,669
Heart rate is 40.

309
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,827
Give two more of atropine, and
get the contents of her stomach

310
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,207
to the lab for analysis.

311
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,564
The cops found empty
pill vials in her car.

312
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,643
What kind of pills?

313
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,234
Three-TC, Retinovir, AZT.

314
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,413
She OD'd on her AIDS pills?

315
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,287
There's more... Valium,
Desipramine, Prozac.

316
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:16,441
Plus they found a jar with some
kind of mixtures... smells like sterno.

317
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,870
I guess she wanted to make
sure she got the job done.

318
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,638
What's the name
on the prescriptions?

319
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:20,628
"Suzanne Alner."

320
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,113
See if she has a chart.

321
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,782
Tube is coming out.

322
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,700
Washcloth, please?

323
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,318
Let's start with bicarb

324
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,769
for the tricyclics,

325
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:31,239
Romazicon for the benzos,
Narcan to cover the narcotics,

326
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,019
and if she's positive
for methanol,

327
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,275
we need to dialyze her.

328
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:36,038
What about the AIDS pills?

329
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:36,894
I have no idea.

330
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,457
Greg Fischer would know.

331
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:40,097
Good, I'll call him.

332
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:45,086
Why would you want
to hurt yourself like this?

333
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:56,798
We're talking 200 horses,
zero to 60 in 6.1 seconds.

334
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,367
ER.

335
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,368
Who?

336
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,370
Yeah, I'll let you drive it.

337
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,806
Jerry, someone from Cryo-Gen Lab

338
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,085
is calling for a Dr. Markovic?

339
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:08,976
Uh, let me call you back.

340
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,177
Hello?

341
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,479
Yeah, speaking.

342
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:13,681
Um...

343
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,033
Uh, Monday at 4:30

344
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,417
would be fine.

345
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,752
Uh, thank you.

346
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:20,154
Jerry, isn't Cryo-Gen
Lab that sperm bank?

347
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:21,655
Uh, yeah.

348
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:23,991
Don't tell me you're
representing yourself

349
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:26,493
as a doctor and trying
to sell your sperm?

350
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:27,873
Shh, just keep it down.

351
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:29,363
Ah, that is reprehensible.

352
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,499
What's in a title?

353
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:34,113
The fact of the matter is, women
are paying top dollar for the seed

354
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,815
of a tall man with an IQ of 150.

355
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,521
Who took the test for you?

356
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,600
<i>I</i> took it.

357
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,425
Oh, you're IQ's not 150.

358
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,559
Mine's only 145.

359
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,828
What am I supposed to do...

360
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,608
Apologize because
I'm smarter than you?

361
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,932
What?

362
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,118
I'm going to get an
IQ test from psych

363
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:52,854
and if you don't score 150,

364
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:56,168
I'm going to blow the
whistle on you, Dr. Markovic.

365
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,725
<i>Ted brought these down.</i>

366
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,204
She was positive for methanol?

367
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,073
Yeah, dialysis is on the way.

368
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:03,397
Pumped her stomach
and given her charcoal.

369
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,867
That's all you can
do for the HIV pills.

370
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:07,547
Cops found two
pictures in her car,

371
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:08,753
both of a little girl.

372
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,636
Her daughter?

373
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:10,682
Pharmacy who gave her the pills

374
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,472
has her living in a motel.

375
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,035
I called... They
say she lived alone.

376
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,125
She's got a wedding ring.

377
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,005
Did we find an old
chart? Nothing came up.

378
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,046
This kid looks familiar to
me; what's the last name?

379
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:20,242
Patient's last name is Alner.

380
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,334
Suzanne.

381
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,669
Where am I?

382
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,170
You're in the hospital.

383
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,388
Oh, no.

384
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,167
Do you want us to call
someone? Your husband?

385
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:29,907
No.

386
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,292
We found these pictures

387
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:32,293
in your car.

388
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,661
Is she your daughter?

389
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:34,946
Mm-hmm.

390
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,580
Where is she?

391
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,284
I killed her.

392
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,415
How you feeling, Mr. Bartok?

393
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,173
Bad, like after I had
my second heart attack.

394
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,692
Well, what you're having

395
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,573
is a lot like a heart
attack, except to your gut.

396
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,508
See, this is an artery
that brings blood

397
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,009
down into your small intestine.

398
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,768
As you can see right there,
it's completely blocked off.

399
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,102
Sounds serious.

400
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,270
It's very serious.

401
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:17,571
Can you fix it?

402
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,774
Yeah, but we need to get
you into surgery right away.

403
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,393
What if we don't?

404
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,946
You'll be dead in 72 hours.

405
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,247
Cripes.

406
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,832
Listen, I don't
want you to worry.

407
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,635
The chief of staff is on
call, and you're going to get

408
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,621
the best care in Chicago.

409
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,801
So why don't we take
Mr. Bartok down to pre-op

410
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:37,241
and stat-page Dr. Anspaugh.

411
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,909
Where's my phone?

412
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,878
Hmm, it's around here somewhere.

413
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,758
I don't think this is
the best time for you

414
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,998
to be calling your bookie.

415
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,633
I want to talk to my daughter.

416
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,588
Yeah, sure.

417
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,891
Mr. Gearhart, the doctor
ordered a painkiller injection.

418
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,459
Take your best shot.

419
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,460
Marine, huh?

420
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,030
Master Gunnery
Sergeant, 22 years.

421
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,882
Well, this might sting a little.

422
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,113
I think I can handle it.

423
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,937
Uh, Carol, what are you doing?

424
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,106
You ordered 30
migs of Ketorolac.

425
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,108
He needs it I.V.

426
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,109
You didn't say that.

427
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,588
He's got kidney stones and COPD.

428
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,789
He needs to be hydrated.

429
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,213
Okay, I'll start an I.V.

430
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,792
Sorry, Sergeant, we
got to stick you again.

431
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,182
Well, what's another needle?

432
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,451
Back at Fort Bragg,
my drill instructor

433
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,787
hammered my air-assault
wings into my chest.

434
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,383
I heard about that
stuff on the news.

435
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,407
Sounds awful.

436
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,618
Proudest day of my life.

437
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:27,892
Weak-tit journalists

438
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,054
kept their noses out
of my marine corps,

439
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:30,639
we'd all be a lot better off.

440
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,913
Aah! Caught me off
guard there, Cookie.

441
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,703
Ooh, peanut butter and jelly

442
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,405
and a plain doughnut.

443
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,839
Rachel forgot her lunch.

444
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,986
Maybe she left it on purpose.

445
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,076
Hey, you know, I'm new at this.

446
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,378
How's it going?

447
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,714
It's great, I mean, I love
having Rachel around.

448
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,049
We haven't quite got
the routines down yet,

449
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,984
but, you know, she seems happy.

450
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,620
Mmm, So I hear you have

451
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,021
a psych case for me.

452
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,867
Yeah, uh, curtain area three.

453
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,771
This lady has a
predilection for operations.

454
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,160
She's had five surgeries.

455
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,530
They've all been
completely unnecessary.

456
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,631
Not Ida Blinnder.

457
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,377
Yeah... she a patient of yours?

458
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,567
Total fruitcake.

459
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,502
You didn't leave
her alone, did you?

460
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:12,570
Why?

461
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,350
Whenever she's
rejected from surgery,

462
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,374
she likes to force the issue.

463
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,775
What do you mean?

464
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,854
She eats things:

465
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,323
batteries, paper clips, pens.

466
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,425
Then they have to
be surgically removed.

467
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,449
Ida, what have you been doing?

468
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,650
Oh, no. What?

469
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,496
Haleh, did you take
all the instruments

470
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,597
off this tray?

471
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,920
Uh-uh.

472
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,334
Okay, this was full when I left.

473
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,391
Ida, did you swallow anything?

474
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,695
Oh...

475
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,631
Excuse me.

476
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,233
Uh, is Dr. Coburn around?

477
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,134
She's at the clinic.

478
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,970
Want to leave a message?

479
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,971
No, no.

480
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,834
You know what... Actually
maybe you can help me.

481
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:51,442
I need to see the ultrasound
tape for Carla Reese.

482
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,610
We only keep them a week or so

483
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,546
before they get recycled.

484
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,647
Let's see.

485
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,815
Ah, you're in luck.

486
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:01,219
You're a surgeon, right?

487
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,586
Uh-huh.

488
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,132
Is she a surgical patient?

489
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,556
Uh-huh.

490
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,932
How's she doing?

491
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:15,916
BP's down.

492
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,995
Breathing's labored.

493
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,370
She's not responding
to anything.

494
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,738
Guess what I found...

495
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,585
Chart on the little
girl, Katy Alner.

496
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,486
Father: Roger. Mother: Suzanne.

497
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,976
The girl in the picture?

498
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,729
Yeah... father brought
her to the clinic last year

499
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,709
for recurrent ear
infections and the flu.

500
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,049
I ran a CD-4.

501
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,261
Turned out she had AIDS.

502
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,251
From her mother?

503
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:34,968
Yep.

504
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,065
Girl died last month...

505
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,567
AIDS-related pneumonia.

506
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,224
So that's what she meant.

507
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,270
Yeah.

508
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,075
So sad.

509
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,729
I just talked to her ex-husband.

510
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,163
He's on his way in.

511
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,065
Soon, I hope.

512
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,471
His celiac is shot.

513
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,516
Mm-hmm.

514
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,906
White count is 18,000?

515
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:56,985
Mm-hmm, correct.

516
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,510
He's had two MI's,
peripheral vascular disease?

517
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,012
Co2, 14; fever, 102;
BP's down to 90?

518
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,525
Yeah, that's why I called you.

519
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,784
I thought we should get
him up to the OR right away.

520
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,286
He's going into shock.

521
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,832
We open him up, he
won't get off the table.

522
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,000
Turf him to ICU.

523
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:12,923
Wait, wait, wait.

524
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,924
You're not going to take him?

525
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,959
He's septic, and
he's grossly unstable.

526
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,806
He's septic because
he's infarcting his bowel.

527
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,608
He's not going to get
any better in the ICU.

528
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,098
Probably not, but
it's his only shot.

529
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,145
Oh, come on, don't you
think he's got a better shot

530
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,134
if he has the operation?

531
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,204
Carter, there's nothing
we can do for this man.

532
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,341
We operate, all we get
is a mortality statistic.

533
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,376
I'm a surgeon,
not an executioner.

534
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,324
Let's go, Doc.

535
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,991
I'm dying here.

536
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,330
Uh, Mr. Bartok,
Dr. Anspaugh feels

537
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,799
that you won't
survive the surgery.

538
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,249
What's that mean?

539
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,029
It means that we're
going to move you.

540
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,865
We're going to move
you up to the ICU...

541
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,155
The Intensive Care Unit.

542
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,689
I don't understand.

543
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,043
You said if I don't get the
surgery right away, I'm through.

544
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,963
That's true.

545
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:10,898
So? What?

546
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,583
You writing me off?

547
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,101
You just going

548
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:15,803
to send me someplace to die

549
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:16,804
like some animal?

550
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,921
I'm sorry.

551
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,585
You're sorry?
What the hell's that?

552
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:21,253
You told me I was going to get

553
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:23,160
the best care in the city,

554
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,511
for God's sakes.

555
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:25,941
Should I call Transpo

556
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,765
to come get him?

557
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,982
You gave me

558
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,217
your word.

559
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,156
No, keep him here.

560
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:37,992
Give him dopamine, uh,
ten micrograms per minute.

561
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,626
Let me have that, uh...

562
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:41,628
Yeah, I'll be right back.

563
00:19:41,664 --> 00:19:43,074
Holy cow!

564
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,743
Sorry.

565
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,844
Mother!

566
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,167
Damn it! I'm sorry.

567
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:48,569
What are you doing?

568
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,981
Trying to get a blood gas.

569
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,305
He's a hard stick.

570
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,536
I'll take that as a compliment.

571
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,359
I'll go get one
of the attendings.

572
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,743
No, I got it.

573
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:00,747
Kerry?

574
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,561
You might want to help Doyle.

575
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,286
She's using one of the
patients as a pincushion.

576
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:06,565
Judas Priest!

577
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:07,488
Sorry.

578
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:08,667
Got to learn sometime.

579
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:11,392
I don't see why nurses
can't do blood gases...

580
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:14,128
As if we wouldn't do
a better job than that.

581
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,341
Sounds like she's got it.

582
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:17,698
Holy Shih Tzu!

583
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,372
I'd say his chances of
surviving an anastomosis

584
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,407
are slim to none.

585
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,619
Oh, you never know.

586
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,654
His collaterals may still
be perfusing his bowel.

587
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:30,918
I doubt it.

588
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:32,479
His BP is up.

589
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:33,881
He's not a good risk.

590
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,294
Dr. Hicks... Listen,
Mr. Bartok knows

591
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,684
that he might not
wake up from this.

592
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,653
I think he still wants
everything done,

593
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,422
and I think we should at
least try to save his life.

594
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,258
If we get in and
out of there quickly,

595
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:45,326
he may have a chance.

596
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,571
That's all he wants.

597
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,128
All right, let's take him.

598
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,130
I'll bring him up.

599
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,236
Good news, Mr. Bartok.

600
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,104
You're going to surgery.

601
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,205
Thanks.

602
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,461
Ah, my pen.

603
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,628
I was wondering where I left it.

604
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,796
Scissors, tweezers.

605
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,364
She should be in a circus.

606
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,744
Nothing's left the stomach.

607
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,479
With a rat's tooth on a scope

608
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,213
I can grab all that stuff.

609
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,621
Well, looks like she's
back to being an ER case.

610
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:17,002
Yeah, "Woman swallows
medical instruments."

611
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,871
The journals would love this.

612
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,794
I didn't know you
were into publishing.

613
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,864
Yeah, life in the fast
track... publish or perish.

614
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,084
She's throwing PVCs.

615
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,652
Probably the tricyclics.

616
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,898
They're cardiotoxic.

617
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,056
Who's talking?

618
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,690
My name's Jeanie.

619
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,259
Where are you?

620
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,805
Can't you see me?

621
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,628
No.

622
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,742
You're experiencing blindness

623
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,086
because of the
methanol you ingested.

624
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:45,819
Papilledema?

625
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,338
Yeah.

626
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,907
Suzanne?

627
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,242
Huh?

628
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,678
Roger's on his way.

629
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,213
My Roger?

630
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,281
Yeah.

631
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,018
No, God.

632
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,955
Oh, God, what will I say?

633
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,175
I don't know.

634
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,611
Is there anything
you'd want to tell him?

635
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,119
That I'm sorry.

636
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,877
Then that's what you should say.

637
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,130
Psst... Dr. Ross.

638
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,343
Jerry, it's a test,
not a survey.

639
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,112
Doug, got a minute?

640
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,514
These kids were on
their way to the prom

641
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,038
when she had a gallstone attack.

642
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,785
It's no big deal, I've
had them for years.

643
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,754
You guys are starting
early... it's barely 2:00.

644
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,110
We had a pre-prom party.

645
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,912
Betsy's folks are out of town.

646
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,747
Why would you tell him that?

647
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,249
He's a doctor.

648
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,917
I just need some antibiotics.

649
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,219
Well, why don't you let
me check you out first.

650
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,421
Let's go to, uh, yeah,
let's go to Exam 1.

651
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,957
From now on, let
me do the talking.

652
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,174
Excuse me, Mr. Alner?

653
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,809
Yes.

654
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,055
Do you want to see her?

655
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,079
I can see her.

656
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:38,998
She's dying.

657
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,334
Yes.

658
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,853
Is she in pain?

659
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,404
Some.

660
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,923
Good.

661
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:55,666
She... cheated on me, got
herself infected with AIDS

662
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,118
and gave it to our baby.

663
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:03,674
I've been waiting for
this for a long time.

664
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:08,945
Retract the omentum.

665
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,221
Let's see what we've got.

666
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,919
Ooh!

667
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,066
Oh, is that gangrene?

668
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,658
All the way from
the proximal jejunum

669
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,893
to the transverse colon.

670
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,596
If we go forward,
we'll be here for hours.

671
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,299
And this guy won't
have any small bowel left.

672
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,301
I think it's worth a shot.

673
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,803
What is it, Carter...
He owes you money?

674
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,116
All right, let's go.

675
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,219
Hemostat and a couple
of scudders for the bowel.

676
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:40,143
What the hell is
going on in here?!

677
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,645
Why? What's the problem?

678
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,547
I rejected this patient

679
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,826
as a poor surgical risk.

680
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,683
But didn't Dr. Carter tell you?

681
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:46,584
No, he didn't.

682
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,859
I got a 23-year
jump on you, kid.

683
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:49,998
You trying to outflank me?

684
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,088
No, sir.

685
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,167
What makes you think

686
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,968
your judgment is
superior to mine?

687
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,770
I don't, I don't, I just
thought that the patient...

688
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,039
This has nothing to
do with the patient.

689
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,708
This is about the
practice of medicine.

690
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,843
Interns do not make end
runs on the chief of staff.

691
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,445
I want you in my
office at 5:00 sharp

692
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,703
to discuss your
future as a surgeon.

693
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,616
If you have any hope of
continuing in this program

694
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,318
you will explain your actions

695
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,204
with the appropriate degree
of contrition and respect

696
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:14,662
and the assurance
that nothing like this

697
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:16,664
will ever happen again.

698
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,335
Dr. Hicks...

699
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,203
Scrub out, Carter.

700
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:31,205
All right, Mrs.
Blinnder, sign here

701
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,974
so the doctor can
get back our property.

702
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,631
No, I want surgery.

703
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,267
Mrs. Blinnder, have you ever
had an endoscopy before?

704
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,468
No.

705
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,571
I don't think you know
what you're missing.

706
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,507
Endoscopy is an
extremely traumatic

707
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,075
and invasive procedure.

708
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,645
See, I have to stick
this tube with a camera

709
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,548
down your throat, root around

710
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,851
and grab the items
that you've swallowed

711
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,653
and yank them back
up through your gullet.

712
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,320
And the best thing is

713
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,323
you'll be conscious
the whole time.

714
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:03,159
You mean... I can watch?

715
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,961
In living color.

716
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,265
Mark, you got a call
from Rachel's school.

717
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,835
They want you to come
pick her up right away.

718
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,147
Someone else was supposed to.

719
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,138
Apparently they didn't.

720
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,138
Ah, geez.

721
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,139
They're holding.

722
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,508
You want to talk to them?

723
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:18,620
Uh, no... I'll, uh...

724
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,844
Tell them I'm on my way.

725
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,192
Look, I'll be back
in 45 minutes.

726
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,715
Don't leave her alone,

727
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,518
and don't let anybody
else do the endoscopy.

728
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,098
Who's your wife's doctor again?

729
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,555
Janet Coburn.

730
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,001
So why are you coming to see me?

731
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,658
You're the expert
on fetal anomalies.

732
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,926
Since we discovered Carla
has gestational diabetes

733
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,194
I wanted you to take a look.

734
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,296
Well, I can tell you right now

735
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,509
he looks fine.

736
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,666
No cardiac abnormalities?

737
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,712
Nah.

738
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:44,701
Macrosomia?

739
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,520
Nope.

740
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:47,966
How's Janet managing your wife?

741
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,305
Uh...

742
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,402
Through diet or
insulin injections?

743
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,292
I'm not sure.

744
00:26:52,328 --> 00:26:54,222
You don't know how your wife

745
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,357
is being managed?

746
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,530
Actually, we're not married.

747
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,677
But you talk to her,
one would hope.

748
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,003
Well, we had a
little falling out.

749
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,005
Uh-huh.

750
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,119
You know, I don't
really know you,

751
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,786
and I'm getting the feeling

752
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,922
I'm doing something
I shouldn't be

753
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:13,386
and I'm starting to resent it.

754
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:21,616
Bad news, Betsy.

755
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,951
Your gallbladder is going to
have to come out right away.

756
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,642
You mean first thing tomorrow?

757
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,310
No, I mean right away.

758
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,395
No way.

759
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,180
I paid $400 for that dress.

760
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,950
Well, I'm sorry, but
you're in real trouble here.

761
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,084
Listen to him, Bets.

762
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,836
Shut up, Jeffrey.

763
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,004
I'll come back
right after the prom.

764
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,473
No, you'll get septic and
die by the end of the night.

765
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:41,491
I'm willing to risk it.

766
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,175
Bets!

767
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,177
Give me the antibiotics.

768
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:44,739
Betsy, no! You're
going to surgery.

769
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,230
Oh, no... I'm 18 years old.

770
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,898
I know my rights.

771
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,295
I'm walking out of here
and you can't do squat.

772
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,818
Jeffrey, my dress.

773
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,356
Can you be back by 10:00?

774
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:58,925
No, they crown the
king and queen at 10:00.

775
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,143
10:30, then.

776
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,812
We could leave at 10:30.

777
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,080
Where's the prom?

778
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,493
The Drake.

779
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,994
Okay, the Drake's
halfway across town.

780
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,585
You leave by 10:00.

781
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,719
Forget it.

782
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,254
Jeffrey, zip me.

783
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,823
All right.

784
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,160
Let's go.

785
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,275
Okay, hang on, wait, wait.

786
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,431
I got an idea.

787
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,137
Mr. Greene?

788
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,872
Hi, sorry about the mix-up.

789
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:29,951
It happens.

790
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,008
Where's Rach?

791
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,287
She went down to the library.

792
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,522
If you have a minute, I
would like to talk to you.

793
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,679
Uh, sure.

794
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,331
I just want to know
if there's anything

795
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,361
we need to be careful
about with Rachel these days.

796
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,351
Such as?

797
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,787
Restricted physical
activities, diet.

798
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:46,106
Why?

799
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,024
Because of her leukemia.

800
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,021
Leukemia? Rachel
doesn't have leukemia.

801
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,145
Where'd you get that?

802
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,231
Rachel.

803
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,110
She told some of her
classmates that she's sick

804
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,701
and not expected to live.

805
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,347
Why would she say
something like that?

806
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,505
Well, Rachel's been
having some trouble socially.

807
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,868
I'm sure you heard
about the fight.

808
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:04,892
No.

809
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:07,326
It was with one of
the more popular girls,

810
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:10,413
and since then, Rachel often
winds up playing by herself.

811
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,732
Feigning an illness
I'm sure was just a way

812
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:14,234
to get some attention.

813
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:17,170
Hey, Rach, you ready to go?

814
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:19,239
Are we going home?

815
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:22,509
I wish, but we got to
get back to the hospital.

816
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:24,038
You can do your math homework.

817
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,662
Big whoop.

818
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,197
Hey, Rachel, that is no way
to talk to Mrs. Hilderbrand.

819
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,260
We'll see you tomorrow.

820
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:30,583
Say good-bye.

821
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:31,818
Bye.

822
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,320
Bye-bye.

823
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:36,390
Bye.

824
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,259
What's the story?

825
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:41,973
Old guy was playing cards with
his pals when he keeled over.

826
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,241
Must've gotten a bad hand.

827
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,276
One, two, three.

828
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,977
BP's 80/50, heart
rate's up to 130.

829
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,700
You didn't start an I.V.?

830
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:49,302
Blew two on the ride.

831
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:50,303
His veins are shot.

832
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,416
I'll try a stick on the hand.

833
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,689
I'm hearing rales.

834
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,041
Three-plus pitting edema.

835
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:56,109
He's got congestive
heart failure.

836
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:57,321
Yep, prep Lasix and dopamine.

837
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:58,478
We need to get the fluid

838
00:29:58,513 --> 00:29:59,646
off his lungs.

839
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,831
How's that I.V. coming?

840
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,610
Forget it... His
skin's like paper.

841
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,395
I'll do a central
line; grab me a kit.

842
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:06,069
Any attendings around?

843
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:09,405
Greene left the hospital
and Weaver's in radiology.

844
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,908
Betadyne, please.

845
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,620
All right, I want you to page
Weaver and call surgery.

846
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,245
Have them help us
put in the central line.

847
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,691
Cancel that, I got it.

848
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,199
Give me an eighth French.

849
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,668
Surgeons put in
lines all the time.

850
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:23,136
I said I got it.

851
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,808
BP's down to 60.

852
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,010
Standing by with dopamine.

853
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,529
How long is it going to be?

854
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,125
If you're looking
for something to do,

855
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,509
why don't you grab
the guy a pillow.

856
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,069
I'm calling surgery.

857
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:44,007
Line's in... run the
dopamine 400 in 250.

858
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,708
Titrate the BP to 90.

859
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,845
Hold the Lasix till
his pressure's back.

860
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,333
Here's the deal.

861
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:55,013
The ambulance will
take you to the dance

862
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:56,370
and pick you up at 10:00 sharp.

863
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:57,770
Take that.

864
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:58,771
10:15!

865
00:30:58,807 --> 00:30:59,739
10:00.

866
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,573
No dancing around.

867
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,753
Keep that I.V. in;
nothing too wild.

868
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,043
Don't worry, I won't.

869
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:05,045
For her, nothing to eat.

870
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,379
No alcohol, no smoking.

871
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:07,798
Make sure she's
back here by 10:30,

872
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,115
not a minute later.

873
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,384
Okay, Dr. Ross.

874
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:11,434
You can count on me.

875
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,952
Bye-bye, have fun.

876
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:14,421
Be good.

877
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:21,995
Close the door.

878
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:28,101
I have never seen as
devious, underhanded

879
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,353
and ultimately
self-destructive a maneuver

880
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,566
as you pulled today.

881
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,290
What the hell were you thinking?

882
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,608
I thought the patient
deserved a chance

883
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,745
and I had reservations about
Dr. Anspaugh's assessment

884
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:41,397
that the patient was
unstable for surgery.

885
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,766
I know that if I was the patient

886
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,834
I would have liked
a second opinion.

887
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,020
You led me to believe that mine

888
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,755
was the only opinion.

889
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,606
If I'd known otherwise,

890
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,942
it's unlikely I would
have proceeded,

891
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,278
certainly not without
consulting Dr. Anspaugh first.

892
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,246
Before Dr. Hicks and I decide

893
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,615
whether or not to
terminate your residency,

894
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,279
is there anything
you'd like to say?

895
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,785
Yes... I apologize

896
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,453
for not being

897
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,684
more forceful in making my
case to you when I spoke to you.

898
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,720
And I apologize to you,
Dr. Hicks, for not telling you

899
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:10,605
about Dr. Anspaugh's assessment.

900
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,656
But I still believe that
we owed this patient

901
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,980
a chance in saving his life.

902
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,533
I'm glad we gave it to him.

903
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,235
Anything else?

904
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,285
I have a question.

905
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,603
What?

906
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,755
Did Mr. Bartok
survive the surgery?

907
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:26,759
Yes, he did.

908
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,615
Labs are back.

909
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,250
BUN's 45, creatinine is 3.5

910
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,418
He's in renal failure.

911
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,720
Anyone page Weaver?

912
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,166
I did.

913
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,856
BP's down to 50.

914
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:41,903
We got to increase his output.

915
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,626
Prep some Vasotec.

916
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,963
You can't give ace inhibitors
to someone in renal failure.

917
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,209
We got to get his heart pumping.

918
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,260
Malik, give him 1.25.

919
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:50,478
It'll shut his kidneys down.

920
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,846
If we can improve
his cardiac output

921
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,136
it will help his renal failure.

922
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,348
Believe me, give the Vasotec.

923
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,773
Do you want me to read
the contraindications?

924
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,074
I can read as well as you can,

925
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,888
but if we don't get his
heart pumping, he'll croak.

926
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,311
It's a mistake.

927
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,845
Load the Vasotec.

928
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,214
What's going on?

929
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,049
Patient is in
congestive heart failure

930
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,117
and renal failure.

931
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,134
BP is crashing.

932
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,020
I have ordered 1.25 of Vasotec

933
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,389
but I can't convince
the nurses to carry it out.

934
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,906
Give him the Vasotec.

935
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:16,054
We got to get his heart going.

936
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,377
What about his kidneys?

937
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,652
Got to get the
heart going first.

938
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,151
Where is she?

939
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:26,264
Why didn't you tell me?

940
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:27,687
Still hanging on?

941
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:29,088
She's delirious.

942
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:30,657
From what?

943
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:32,337
The organophosphates,
methanol, tricyclics...

944
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:33,860
Take your pick.

945
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,340
BP's falling, she's
getting shocky.

946
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:36,663
Better get Kerry.

947
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,042
Looks like impending
respiratory failure.

948
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,210
You may need to intubate.

949
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,599
Roger, is that you?

950
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,149
She's blind from the methanol.

951
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:47,090
Roger.

952
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,158
Roger, I'm sorry.

953
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,659
She thinks you're her husband.

954
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,594
Roger, I'm sorry.

955
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,346
For-forgive me.

956
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,148
Roger's not here.

957
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:59,402
Please... please,
Roger, please forgive me.

958
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,787
Please... Roger,
please forgive me.

959
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:03,239
Just say it.

960
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,841
What?

961
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,842
Tell her you forgive her.

962
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,076
Please.

963
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,194
Please.

964
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:09,396
It's not my place.

965
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,880
Just say it.

966
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,043
Greg, say it.

967
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:13,277
Say you forgive her.

968
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,051
Please.

969
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:17,803
It's okay, it's okay.

970
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,822
What's her rate?

971
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,073
140.

972
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:21,341
Okay, let's tube her.

973
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:22,676
Roger!

974
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:23,976
Hold her.

975
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,431
Shh, shh, shh.

976
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:31,929
Hold her.

977
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:32,919
It's okay, sweetheart.

978
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:34,787
It's okay.

979
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:37,857
It's okay, sweetheart.

980
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:40,193
It's okay, it's okay.

981
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:42,962
It's okay.

982
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,094
Seeing as the test
was multiple choice

983
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,551
with a possible five answers

984
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,131
you could guess randomly
and expect to score 20%.

985
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,288
You got 15.

986
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,456
Fifteen?

987
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,636
Your days as a sperm
donor are over, Jerry.

988
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,327
But... but I was...
I was nervous.

989
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,295
I mean, I don't
perform under pressure.

990
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,974
You want to call or should I?

991
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,031
Kerry, I'm back on.

992
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,143
Hey, Rachel.

993
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,217
Oh, Mark.

994
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:07,470
One of your patients, Mrs.
Blinnder, was complaining

995
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,755
of abdominal pains.

996
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,973
I had to scope out her stomach.

997
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,742
I believe this is yours.

998
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,077
Thank you.

999
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,280
I was thinking we could
co-author an article

1000
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,133
about her and send
it out to the journals.

1001
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:21,500
I've even got a title...

1002
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,019
"The woman who ate the ER."

1003
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,338
Great.

1004
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,794
57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62...

1005
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,495
What's your problem?

1006
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,514
Excuse me?

1007
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,632
The attitude?

1008
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,195
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1009
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,151
You second-guess me,
you give me a hard time.

1010
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:40,202
What is going on?

1011
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,388
Nothing's going on.

1012
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:43,807
Whatever you say, but
don't ever disregard my orders

1013
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,207
like you did in that trauma.

1014
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,061
I may be younger than
you, but I am the doctor

1015
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,796
and you are the nurse.

1016
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:51,298
Keep that straight.

1017
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:03,076
Sweetheart, you've
got to do your homework

1018
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:04,677
before you watch TV.

1019
00:36:04,713 --> 00:36:06,012
I don't want to.

1020
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:07,547
Well, those are the rules.

1021
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,882
Can you help me?

1022
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,218
I got to help some sick people.

1023
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,454
You're always taking
care of sick people.

1024
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:19,392
Rach... Mrs. Hilderbrand told me

1025
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,461
that you told some of
your friends at school

1026
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:22,562
that you were sick.

1027
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,629
Is that true?

1028
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:25,598
They're not my friends.

1029
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,100
You wanted them
to be nice to you?

1030
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:29,314
Dr. Greene, quality
assurance wants you to finish

1031
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:30,303
these charts by 6:00.

1032
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:31,904
Just leave them.

1033
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,508
People aren't going to like
you because you're sick.

1034
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:37,705
You help people who are sick.

1035
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,929
You don't have to be
sick for me to love you.

1036
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,298
And I love you more
than anything in the world.

1037
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,533
You know that, don't you?

1038
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,118
Dr. Greene... Dr. Anspaugh

1039
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:46,553
is on the phone for you.

1040
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:47,920
Yeah, I'll call him back.

1041
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,589
Wait, I got to take this.

1042
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,258
Please, Daddy.

1043
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,794
Rachel, I have to do this, okay?

1044
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:59,098
We'll talk more when
we get home, okay?

1045
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:19,218
I'm sorry.

1046
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,330
I wasn't comfortable

1047
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:21,699
pretending to be her husband.

1048
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,089
You don't have to apologize.

1049
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:24,318
It's getting late.

1050
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,454
You still want
to go to the lake?

1051
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,639
We're going to
need to leave soon.

1052
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,979
I don't think so.

1053
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,226
Because of what
happened with her?

1054
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,299
No.

1055
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,251
I don't know.

1056
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:38,188
I guess I'm... I'm not ready.

1057
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,140
Okay.

1058
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,474
No problem.

1059
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,476
If, uh...

1060
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:44,811
Call me...

1061
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,747
if you want to get
together this weekend.

1062
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,098
How did it go?

1063
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,033
Not bad.

1064
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,337
We removed most
of your small intestine.

1065
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,751
I'm afraid you're
not going to be able

1066
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,559
to eat solid food again.

1067
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,295
Can I drink?

1068
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,330
Yeah, actually.

1069
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,615
Smoke?

1070
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,199
If you must.

1071
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:43,636
I'll be fine.

1072
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,376
Your daughter
is flying in tonight.

1073
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,997
Goosebumps.

1074
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,943
You want me to
get you a blanket?

1075
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:56,932
No.

1076
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,317
Goosebumps, our horse.

1077
00:38:58,353 --> 00:38:59,335
How did she do?

1078
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,036
Oh, oh, well...

1079
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,555
I don't know.

1080
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,409
Never mind.

1081
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,980
Jerry, would you call the morgue

1082
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,249
to pick up Suzanne Alner?

1083
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,239
I already did.

1084
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,418
Who put those here?

1085
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:21,574
I did.

1086
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,309
Somebody threw
them in the trash.

1087
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:24,744
They're perfectly fine.

1088
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,581
Yeah, this is
Dr. McGrath speaking.

1089
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,183
Yeah, Tuesday at
3:00 will be splendid.

1090
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:32,552
Go for it, dude.

1091
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:43,295
Who's there?

1092
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:44,864
Hey, it's me, Peter.

1093
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:46,432
Peter who?

1094
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,968
Ha-ha-ha... very funny, Carla.

1095
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:51,104
What do you want, Peter?

1096
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,142
I want to know how you
and the baby are doing.

1097
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:58,144
We're fine... see you.

1098
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,362
Carla...

1099
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:04,099
I know things haven't
been right between us,

1100
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,785
but I'm here and I'm
trying to do the right thing.

1101
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,974
I want to support you
through this, Carla.

1102
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,409
I want to be a father
to my kid, you know?

1103
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,410
Carla...

1104
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,623
Oh, excuse me.

1105
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,807
Can you hold that door, please?

1106
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,316
Thank you.

1107
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,965
Come by Saturday morning.

1108
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:38,167
I could use some
help around the house.

1109
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:42,021
All right, I'll be here.

1110
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:48,561
Hey.

1111
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:49,640
Hey.

1112
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,964
You know what I hate?

1113
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:52,065
Uh, Maggie Doyle.

1114
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,177
No, I don't hate her.

1115
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,946
I just hate that she's right.

1116
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,002
About what?

1117
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,214
She's younger than me.

1118
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:58,749
Yes, you're right,
she's younger than you.

1119
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:00,117
We grew up in the
same neighborhood

1120
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:01,485
and now she's a
doctor, I'm a nurse

1121
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:03,321
and I got to take orders
from her all day long.

1122
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:05,222
You're a very competitive
person; you know that.

1123
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:06,857
I can't help it... Every
time I look at her

1124
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,993
I'm just reminded that she
got through medical school.

1125
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,328
I can't even get
through the door.

1126
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:11,817
You can get through my door.

1127
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,165
Anything in a bra can
get through your door.

1128
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:15,488
No, no, I've reformed.

1129
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,534
Ask anyone.

1130
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,391
All right, kids, right on time.

1131
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:19,537
She wanted to stay

1132
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,239
for the best dressed contest,

1133
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:22,629
but I said, "No, Bets.

1134
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:24,531
Your surgery is more important."

1135
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,076
You're a good man, Jeffrey.

1136
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,267
Thank you, Dr. Ross.

1137
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:30,270
This was the best
night of my life.

1138
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:31,504
Me, too.

1139
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:35,992
I got to go.

1140
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,171
Good night.

1141
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,294
Good night.

1142
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:41,909
Which means if you
live close to a river,

1143
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,400
you need to keep
a close eye on this...

1144
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,735
Rach? Rach, come on.

1145
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,203
It's time to go home.

1146
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,304
I'm tired.

1147
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,672
I know, sweetheart.

1148
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:50,673
It's late.

1149
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,075
Can you carry me?

1150
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,610
Yeah, yeah, sure... grab on.

1151
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,249
There we go.

1152
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,362
Mark, I've got a
great case here...

1153
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,298
A guy with Takayasu's arteritis

1154
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,133
on a dual-chamber pacemaker.

1155
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,523
Make a good article.

1156
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,125
Tell Kerry to take it, okay?

1157
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,292
I'm going home.

1158
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,941
Carter... you're on probation,

1159
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,376
but you're still in the program.

1160
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,329
Thank you.

1161
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:30,390
Thank Dr. Anspaugh.

1162
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,659
I wanted you kicked out.

1163
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,994
John Carter is not
a law unto himself.

1164
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,562
I hope you've learned that.

1165
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,154
You won't get another chance.

1166
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:54,988
Hi.

1167
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:55,989
Hi.

1168
00:42:56,024 --> 00:42:57,323
Can I come in?

1169
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:00,910
Sure... come in.

1170
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,950
I was just finishing dinner.

1171
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,152
You hungry?

1172
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,427
No, thanks.

1173
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,589
So...

1174
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,525
You haven't been here.

1175
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,193
What do you think?

1176
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:20,696
Well, uh, honestly,
I'm glad I got the house.

1177
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,645
Look, I'm sorry
about this morning.

1178
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,335
No, you did a nice thing.

1179
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,570
I was rude.

1180
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,206
I'm the one who
should apologize.

1181
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,108
It's okay.

1182
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,252
You don't... really think

1183
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:46,622
that our marriage was a disaster
from start to finish, do you?

1184
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,226
We had a good beginning.

1185
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,063
The middle wasn't bad.

1186
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,548
Yeah, you're right.

1187
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,684
We had a pretty good middle.

1188
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:02,788
The end was my fault.

1189
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:05,391
And when I think about it,

1190
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:07,409
I don't blame you for hating me.

1191
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,862
I don't hate you.

1192
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,217
I don't want to be
angry anymore.

1193
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:18,203
I don't want to be
that kind of person.

1194
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:22,391
I never meant to hurt you.

1195
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:30,916
Hey.

1196
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:32,585
Hey, come on.

1197
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,919
No tears, okay?

1198
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:35,766
Because I'll start going...

1199
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,890
I've missed you.

1200
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,581
I miss you.
