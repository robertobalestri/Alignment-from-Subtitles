1
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,429
Hello?

2
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,697
Who is this,

3
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,066
and why are you
calling me at 7:00 am?

4
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,051
It's just a day off, Ma.

5
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,220
No big deal.

6
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,188
Yes, I usually do work Fridays.

7
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,624
Huh?

8
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,992
Marshall Field?

9
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:46,294
Uh... no, no.

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,330
I... I got enough sheets.

11
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,632
What?

12
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,967
No, no, I have a lot
of stuff I want to do

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,469
around the house today.

14
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:55,637
No.

15
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:57,639
No, I don't need your help.

16
00:00:57,674 --> 00:00:59,641
Nope, Mom...

17
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:01,143
Mom?<i> Mom?</i>

18
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:04,579
Ma! I don't need your
help, but thank you.

19
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:06,881
Yeah... no.

20
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:09,051
Go check out the sale, okay?

21
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,419
Okay, bye.

22
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,055
Morning, Leon.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,223
Morning, Carol.

24
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,491
Hate going to work
on a morning this cold.

25
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,006
Yeah, I know what you mean.

26
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,163
Hey, Leon!

27
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,231
Hi, Miss Hathaway.

28
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,449
Slow down there, Robert.

29
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:43,118
I hate that he calls
me Miss Hathaway.

30
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:46,187
Yeah, it's a real crime when
kids show that kind of respect.

31
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,173
Have a good one.

32
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,125
Oh, and Happy Valentine's day.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,110
Oh, God, I forgot.
Yeah, you, too.

34
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,569
Hiya.

35
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,921
Hey. Good morning.

36
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:22,590
Good luck. Thanks.

37
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:25,861
Good morning, Mrs. Novotny.

38
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,373
Good morning. Good morning.

39
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,364
No, Javier, not the dog cans.

40
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,366
We need the little biscuits.

41
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,813
Okay, Mrs. Novotny,
the little biscuits.

42
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:35,803
Hey, it's for my wife.

43
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,805
I think she has an ulcer.

44
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,807
Do you know which
one she should take?

45
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,154
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

46
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:43,144
This one says four times a day.

47
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,146
This one says two times a day.

48
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:47,148
I just do the baked goods.

49
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:48,816
Know what I mean?

50
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,018
Miss...

51
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,491
Just go now, no problems.

52
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,392
I don't call anyone.

53
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,344
Give us the damn money.

54
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,990
We should have waited. Shut up!

55
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,742
I'm going to need more
shelf space for the muffins.

56
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,681
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

57
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,049
Hang on. Hang on.

58
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,729
I'm not doing anything.

59
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,769
I'm not moving.

60
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:08,770
Get them down... all of them!

61
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,955
Let's go. What are you doing?

62
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,273
Just shut up and keep them down.

63
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:13,241
Okay, get down!

64
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,759
Face down!

65
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,428
You, too, go on!

66
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,247
Don't look at me.

67
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,227
James, let's just go.

68
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,263
Listen, didn't you hear him?

69
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,570
He said to get
down, so get down!

70
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,677
Let's go.

71
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,679
You stop right
there, you bastards!

72
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,465
Come on, Pops.

73
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,633
Joseph, no, no!

74
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:39,801
Go back!

75
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,055
Come on.

76
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,878
Oh, jeez.

77
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:52,063
Anton!

78
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,682
Oh!

79
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,173
Please, he needs help... please!

80
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,586
There's a police car
right down the street.

81
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,243
Oh, God.

82
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,912
Where's the back?

83
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,696
Where's the back?

84
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,060
Damn it.

85
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,051
Where are the keys?

86
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,231
Give me the keys!

87
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,387
Lady...

88
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,256
Lady, just give us the keys.

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,060
Just give us the keys.

90
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,496
You leave him
alone, you bastard.

91
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,314
Leave him alone!

92
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,266
Duncan, I need help.

93
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,884
Sure. I'll get you some help.

94
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,369
Just give me a minute.

95
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,154
I want everyone just to stay

96
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,489
where they are.

97
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,507
You got it?

98
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,708
I don't want anyone moving.

99
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,009
I don't want anyone talking.

100
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,495
I want everyone just
to stay where they are.

101
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,548
Anton! Anton!

102
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,761
Duncan, check out
those guys on the floor.

103
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,630
Over there... Two
of them on the floor.

104
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,620
Oh, God! He's so bloody!

105
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:41,523
We should have waited

106
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,141
till there weren't
any customers.

107
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,421
The welfare checks
come out today.

108
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,922
People come in to cash them.

109
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:46,845
We wait, we miss the money.

110
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,464
Oh, man.

111
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,483
Jeez.

112
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,612
How many?

113
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,318
Just a couple so far.

114
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,807
Robert...

115
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:00,475
Robert...

116
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,939
Get behind those crates.

117
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,740
I don't want anybody
moving around, right?

118
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,714
Nobody's moving

119
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,065
around here, right?

120
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,732
He needs a doctor.

121
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:08,945
You shut up! Just shut up!

122
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,268
Get behind those crates.

123
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,770
Okay, shut up!

124
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,537
We've got to go.

125
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,922
You shut up, too, okay?

126
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,073
Robert, listen.

127
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,502
Get behind those crates.

128
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:17,754
Just crawl in behind

129
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:18,904
those crates.

130
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,180
Why would he go and do that?

131
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,515
I just told him not to move.

132
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,384
Get over here.

133
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:30,872
I said, get over here.

134
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:32,707
I don't want to.

135
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,708
Don't want to?

136
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:34,893
What the flying...?

137
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,006
Robert, just come
over here by me.

138
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,508
It's okay, come on.

139
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,643
Come on.

140
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,033
That's it.

141
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,179
Come on. It's okay.

142
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,203
Quick.

143
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:49,658
Brilliant.

144
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,528
Please...

145
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:55,530
Oh, please!

146
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,698
Please!

147
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,115
He needs help!

148
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,116
Please!

149
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,785
Shut your mouth.

150
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,120
I need help here, too, you know?

151
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,323
Duncan, would you shut her up?

152
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,358
Just shut up.

153
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,591
Help us! Please!

154
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,677
Listen, lady, what are we

155
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:10,678
supposed to do?

156
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,180
Now, stop your yapping now.

157
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,826
Wait.

158
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,784
Wait, I'm a nurse, and
maybe I can help him

159
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,320
and then Mrs.
Novotny will be quiet.

160
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,921
Won't you, Mrs. Novotny?

161
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,752
Hey, James, that's a bit
of luck. We got a nurse.

162
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,675
Get her over here.

163
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,675
What's your name?

164
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,993
Carol.

165
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,629
Carol, well, maybe you can go

166
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,497
and help my cousin James, Carol.

167
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,343
I think her husband's
a lot worse...

168
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,479
Yeah, sure, but you better
take a look at my cousin first,

169
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,614
or else, he'll get pissed off.

170
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:35,953
Go on.

171
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:36,855
You, what was your name?

172
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,890
Robert, you go with her.

173
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,902
Please, he's just a little boy.

174
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,804
He shouldn't see
something like that.

175
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,539
None of us should
see something like that.

176
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,779
Now go on.

177
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:46,531
And you, you go with her.

178
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,050
Go on!

179
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:55,106
Miss Hathaway... I think
I'm going to throw up.

180
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,460
Don't look, Robert.
Robert, don't look.

181
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,315
You, what's your name?

182
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,670
Don't point that thing at me.

183
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,071
I want you to stay over here.

184
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,417
Where am I going
to go, 7-Eleven?

185
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,457
No talking, either.

186
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,409
Over here!

187
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,134
Please, someone!

188
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,086
Please...

189
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,638
Hey, Duncan, don't
you go anywhere.

190
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:32,662
I won't.

191
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,974
You stay where I
can see you, okay?

192
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,931
Look, I'm not going anyplace.

193
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,799
There's police everywhere.

194
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,336
I need to take your pulse.

195
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,437
Don't.

196
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:44,606
I need to take the
pulse in your neck.

197
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,795
Please!

198
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,863
Should we get that?

199
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,175
You just let it ring, okay?

200
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,450
Carol, help us!

201
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,470
What's the matter
with the old boy?

202
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,471
I'm fine.

203
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,973
I think he hurt his wrist.

204
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,042
God! You'd think
I'd shot everyone.

205
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,144
Now, you look like
a fairly strong guy,

206
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,179
but just remember

207
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,162
I got the gun, okay?

208
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,831
I'm not doing anything.

209
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,009
I... I'm not moving.

210
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,128
You should answer

211
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,417
the phone.

212
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,270
Please, we need
a doctor for him.

213
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,588
Get him some help!

214
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,957
Oh, please!

215
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,843
James, maybe we should get that.

216
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,479
I just need a minute to think.

217
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:25,724
Maybe it's not for you.

218
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:27,026
The wound is very serious.

219
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,528
The bullet may have
hit your kidney or spleen.

220
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,185
You just make it stop bleeding.

221
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:32,898
We need to get a doctor in here.

222
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,588
We're not getting
anyone in here,

223
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,540
so you better do
something yourself.

224
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,054
I don't have the supplies.

225
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,344
Look around.

226
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,562
You got a whole store full.

227
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,067
Okay.

228
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:48,402
No, he stays with me.

229
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,470
Let her go.

230
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,372
She's going to
look for some stuff.

231
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,719
If your friend doesn't...

232
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:54,620
He's not my friend;
he's my cousin.

233
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,128
If your cousin doesn't
get to a hospital soon,

234
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,323
he's going to bleed to death.

235
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,588
Please, help us. Please.

236
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,799
Carol!

237
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,711
Duncan, get something
in front of the door.

238
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,509
Come on. Come with me. Up.

239
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,933
Go around there.

240
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,903
We're going to
move this over there.

241
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,005
Okay.

242
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,485
Kind of a heavy sucker, huh?

243
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,674
I just stocked it.

244
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,720
I love America.

245
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,984
Everyone has a job here, huh?

246
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,298
You...

247
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,632
do you have a job?

248
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,429
Uh, yeah, I teach school.

249
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,986
Out.

250
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,021
What?

251
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,990
I teach school... first
grade. That's good!

252
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,341
If you get them young enough,

253
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,009
then you can teach them right.

254
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,288
I guess no one got to you, huh?

255
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:04,229
She has a mouth.

256
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,880
Duncan, stop chatting with them.

257
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,432
Get down there.

258
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,763
This will stop it for now.

259
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:11,752
Good. Good.

260
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:12,753
I'll come back

261
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:15,269
and change it in a while.

262
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,542
Do you still need me?

263
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,526
For what?

264
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:19,927
I'll just go and check

265
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:20,928
on the old man?

266
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,046
Whatever.

267
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,383
Pray for us sinners now

268
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,403
and at the hour of our...

269
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,172
Hail Mary, full of grace,

270
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,125
the Lord is with Thee.

271
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,728
Blessed art Thou
amongst women...

272
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,863
Mrs. Novotny...

273
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,599
Mrs. Novotny, I need you.

274
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,535
I'm going to do five
compressions in a row,

275
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,831
and on the fifth compression,

276
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,099
I want you to hold his nose

277
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,540
and blow into his mouth.

278
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,752
Hey, cops are
moving their cars back.

279
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,644
One, two, three, four, five.

280
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,062
I need some help!

281
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:56,080
She's helping.

282
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,326
Why are they doing that?

283
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,315
How should I know?

284
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,351
You're the American.

285
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,662
I can't do this.

286
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,797
I need medical supplies...

287
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,021
I.V. fluid, blood, monitors.

288
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,134
Shut her up!

289
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,218
I need someone to do CPR.

290
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,692
I can do it.

291
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,472
No, you... you don't move.

292
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,411
You sit there,

293
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:11,590
and you say nothing.

294
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:12,758
Listen to me, Duncan.

295
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,576
You do not want this man to die.

296
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,217
Okay? Those cops out there

297
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,352
consider that a
much bigger deal.

298
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,004
Now I need some help.

299
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,607
You, can you... can you

300
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,875
do this CPR thing?

301
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,207
We Just want to know
if everyone's all right,

302
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,241
if anyone needs
any help, that's all.

303
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:30,642
We need you to answer
the phone when we call you.

304
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,017
I got the straws, but
I couldn't find the...

305
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,018
What was it?

306
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,063
Rubbing alcohol.

307
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,131
That's good, Robert.

308
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,199
Get me some liquor.

309
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,334
What kind? Any kind.

310
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,591
Grain alcohol is the strongest.

311
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,873
That's all we need to know
right now. You got that?

312
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,897
We got to think
what to tell them.

313
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,866
Tell them anything.

314
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,879
You need to start
talking with us,

315
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,103
let us know what's going on.

316
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,873
I should just keep going, right?

317
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,908
Uh-huh.

318
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,584
Okay, you can move
back now, Mrs. Novotny.

319
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,265
Mrs. Novotny, you
can move back now.

320
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,390
Marita...

321
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,636
All right.

322
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:30,842
Oh!

323
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,042
It's okay.

324
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:37,096
Okay, it's okay.

325
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,929
Okay, Robert, pour
some on the straw.

326
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:41,919
Robert?

327
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,921
I'll do it.

328
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,676
We need to get out of here.

329
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:49,855
I know. I know.

330
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,124
I just... I just need
to think, you know?

331
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,949
You weren't thinking
very much at all, were you?

332
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,228
This is all my fault?

333
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,085
Well, it was your bloody idea!

334
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:05,042
Is that it?

335
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,995
Yeah, he's breathing.

336
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,449
He's got a pulse.

337
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,494
You can stop the compressions.

338
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,434
That's good. That
means you've got it huh?

339
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,436
Quiet, I'm trying to listen.

340
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,834
Listen I know you
say he's breathing,

341
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,152
but he looks kind
of blue, doesn't he?

342
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,475
He's going to be fine.

343
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:22,877
We're going to do this.

344
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,723
What is it? Is he all right?

345
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,258
I need a... ice pick.
Get me an ice pick!

346
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,148
They're by the freezer.

347
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,184
I'll get it.

348
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:30,685
No, Grandpa, you stay there.

349
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,886
I'll get the ice pick.

350
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,616
And I need a little tiny straw.

351
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,750
This is too big.

352
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,007
We don't have
anything like that.

353
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,120
Those little cardboard juices...

354
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,009
My kids drink them.

355
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,138
Those have those little straws.

356
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,044
Robert, get those straws.

357
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,291
Now, Robert! Please, now! Go!

358
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,325
Duncan, how long

359
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,198
is this going to take?

360
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,234
Have you got
someplace to go, James?

361
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:47,601
I shot the man.

362
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,872
If he pops off, then it's my
ass they've got, not yours.

363
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,123
Right. Like I'm going

364
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,558
to get probation.

365
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,500
Okay. Okay.

366
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,239
Should I start again?

367
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,842
No.

368
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,778
What we need to know is

369
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:17,515
how many people you got in
there and is everyone all right.

370
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,016
Are you guys all right?

371
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,618
Get on the phone.

372
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,221
If you need some help, we
can try to work something out.

373
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,501
What are we doing now?

374
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,613
He needs a chest tube.

375
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,418
Do it. Do it.

376
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,354
It's not what I do. I'm a nurse.

377
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,722
Please, we need supplies.

378
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,319
You've got to send
for a doctor in here.

379
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,542
They'd love that chance,

380
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,543
wouldn't they?

381
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,544
Oh, please,

382
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,862
you have to help him.

383
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,523
Okay.

384
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,735
Third... no, fifth intercostal

385
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,893
neurovascular bundle

386
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,095
above the rib.

387
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,716
All right, screwdriver.

388
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,217
Pour some liquor on it.

389
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,953
Rip open the tampons
and pull off the tube.

390
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,110
Ah!

391
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,128
Ahh.

392
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:22,997
All right, cut me a piece

393
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,398
of tape, Robert.

394
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,937
Give me the tampon.

395
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:35,442
All right, tape.

396
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,214
All right, I need more tape.

397
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,071
Great.

398
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:53,344
Okay, Mrs. Novotny,

399
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,174
blow into his trach tube.

400
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,731
We've lost his pulse.

401
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,798
Should I start CPR?

402
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,478
No, I got it. What's your name?

403
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:00,468
Angie.

404
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:01,869
I got it for now, Angie.

405
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:03,871
Thanks.

406
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,041
Come on.

407
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,660
Come on.

408
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,962
You can't do it, can you?

409
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,305
Come on.

410
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,291
Come on.

411
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:26,310
Come on.

412
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:30,843
Come on.

413
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,144
Come on.

414
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:33,467
Come on.

415
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,301
Your cousin's losing
more and more blood.

416
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,969
There's nothing more I can do.

417
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,215
We'll get out of this.

418
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,205
Yeah, right.

419
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,206
Shut up, bread man,

420
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,207
and just keep dragging.

421
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,375
I'm going to throw up.

422
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,709
I have to go to the bathroom.

423
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:16,727
He goes nowhere.

424
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,973
He's just a kid.

425
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,508
You don't want him
throwing up in here.

426
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,532
Believe me.

427
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,844
It's okay, James. I've
checked the bathroom.

428
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,929
There's no way out of there.

429
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,285
Hey, go on.

430
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,733
Guys, listen to me.

431
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:30,558
I don't need to talk to both
of you, okay, I just, uh...

432
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:33,193
Figure out which one of
you want to get on the phone

433
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:34,795
and start working with us.

434
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:38,065
Duncan, you've got
to help your cousin.

435
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,067
He's got to get to a hospital.

436
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:41,368
Yeah, and I have to get

437
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,381
to one of your fine
American prisons.

438
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,716
They'll go easier on you.

439
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,206
You've never killed before.

440
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,053
Just how do you know that?

441
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:49,877
You haven't, have you?

442
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:53,213
Duncan, what the
hell's taking so long?!

443
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,749
Come on.

444
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,585
You've got to start
working with me.

445
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,402
Hey! Hey!

446
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,926
It's me, Javier.

447
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,696
Quiet. Quiet.

448
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,863
There's a door

449
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,065
behind me, but I can't get out.

450
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,083
It's locked.

451
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,186
I've got a baseball bat.

452
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,265
No, no, no! They'll shoot you.

453
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,255
Just stay right there.

454
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,255
I'm going to try

455
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,223
and get the keys, okay?

456
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,375
Hang on. Don't move.

457
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,578
What are you going to tell them?

458
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:25,724
Tell them we want
a way out of here...

459
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,680
A truck or van... or something.

460
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:28,616
Tell them to send
in medical supplies.

461
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:29,695
Oh, right. Like<i> what?</i>

462
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,235
What do we need?
What medical stuff?

463
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,403
Don't be stupid.

464
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,672
Some blood... at least
four units of O-negative,

465
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,989
a couple I.V.s, saline...

466
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:37,586
Right, and then she fixes me
up and we just walk out of here?

467
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,226
I don't know. Maybe.

468
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,144
They send in medical supplies,

469
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,079
they'll send them in with a cop.

470
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,976
Now look what you did.

471
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,660
I don't like the big guy.

472
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,984
Tape him up.

473
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,551
What?

474
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,703
Tape him up.

475
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:50,303
I don't like him.

476
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,600
And I don't like her
moving around like that.

477
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,508
She's trying to help.

478
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,209
Here, put this on.

479
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:57,578
Thanks.

480
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,580
This wouldn't be necessary

481
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,499
if he hadn't shot the coffeepot.

482
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,535
Angie, don't talk back to them.

483
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,036
Next time, maybe you should

484
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,038
shoot the milk or
the cold drinks...

485
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:08,972
There won't be a next time.

486
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,101
I'm not listening
to you anymore.

487
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,242
What'd I do?

488
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,021
I said we shouldn't come in
when there were customers.

489
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,623
It was the flipping
owner that shot me.

490
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,957
You wouldn't listen to me.

491
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:16,914
Listen to you?!

492
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,159
Where are the keys?

493
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,767
The keys?

494
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,097
The keys to the door
off the storeroom.

495
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,704
Javier is hiding in there.

496
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:24,833
He could get out.

497
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,024
First shelf under the counter.

498
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,459
I try to get them.

499
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,977
Okay. Shh.

500
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,595
What's taking that kid so long?

501
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,341
He's throwing up.
Give him a break.

502
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,993
I want to talk to
the hostages now!

503
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:37,279
I want everyone to know
we've got lots of help out here.

504
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,136
Don't they ever shut up?

505
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,672
We're all going to resolve this!

506
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,835
You have a fracture dislocation.

507
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,637
I should reduce it,
but it's going to hurt.

508
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,439
You might want a
drink of that liquor.

509
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:49,496
I couldn't do that.

510
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,398
I'm an alcoholic.

511
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:54,251
Okay. Angie, can you get
us some aspirin, please?

512
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,652
Yeah.

513
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,637
No, no. I can do it.

514
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,004
I can do it.

515
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:01,653
Where do you
think you are going?

516
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,454
I'm going to get
him some aspirin.

517
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,918
I think I saw them over there.

518
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,402
Try not to shoot it, okay?

519
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,717
Angie!

520
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,172
Try not to shoot the aspirin.

521
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,874
That's not funny.

522
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,075
You know what?

523
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,711
Maybe the old man over there
will toss up his Alka-Seltzer.

524
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,791
You'll have a little
target practice... bang!

525
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:23,947
James, shut up!

526
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,944
Shoot out that whole
row of dishwashing liquid.

527
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:26,934
Just pow! Pow!

528
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,436
I said it's not funny.

529
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:30,449
You could shoot out the lights

530
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,451
while you're at it. Bang! Bang!

531
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:33,607
He shot my husband!

532
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,543
Isn't that good enough for you?!

533
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:36,626
He shot him here...

534
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,861
and here.

535
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,480
Mrs. Novotny!

536
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,098
All he could do was
bleed and bleed.

537
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,683
He couldn't move.

538
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,018
He couldn't breathe.

539
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,403
He couldn't... talk.

540
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,355
He couldn't...

541
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,852
He couldn't say good-bye.

542
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,003
He couldn't say how
much he loved me.

543
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:56,113
I wanted to hear him say
that just one more time!

544
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,148
Shh.

545
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,816
You see?!

546
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,968
You see? I shot her old man!

547
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,537
I killed her husband,
and a good job I did, too,

548
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,550
before he put a hole
through your other side.

549
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,656
You didn't thank me

550
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,792
for that, did you?!

551
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,493
Where's that flipping kid?

552
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,494
Wait a minute.

553
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,508
He's been in there half my life.

554
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:13,497
Yeah, but if he's sick,

555
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,498
he might need me.

556
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,499
Okay, okay, whatever.

557
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,500
Hey, kid!

558
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,335
Kid, are you still in there?

559
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,836
Come on out now.

560
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,605
You can't throw up forever.

561
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,258
We're all eating free
hot dogs out here.

562
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,676
Don't you want one?

563
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,544
That was a stupid thing to say

564
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,845
if he's chucking up.

565
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:29,881
You try.

566
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,682
Robert, come out now.

567
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,030
Robert, it's me. It's Carol.

568
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,853
It... it's Miss Hathaway.

569
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,355
"Miss Hathaway."

570
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,257
That's very sweet.

571
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,909
Come in.

572
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:47,347
Are you feeling any better?

573
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:48,849
Hmm?

574
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,183
That's good.

575
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,885
We can go back out now.

576
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:57,541
Duncan doesn't like me.

577
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,644
Well...

578
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,280
I don't think Duncan
likes any of us,

579
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,616
but you're going
to be okay, Robert.

580
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,934
You don't know that.

581
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,054
No, I don't, but there are
a lot of police out there,

582
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,707
and at some point, they'll
come in here and help us.

583
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,442
Duncan will shoot them

584
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,778
just like he shot Mr. Novotny.

585
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,846
No, he can't shoot them all.

586
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:22,349
'Cause there'll be like
80 of them or something?

587
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,067
Or something.

588
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:29,106
What if they all start
shooting at the same time?

589
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,173
Well...

590
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:33,827
Then we'll have to duck.

591
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,331
Why did you take your
shoes and socks off?

592
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,900
My feet were hot.

593
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:42,352
Okay, I want you to put
them back on and come out,

594
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,138
so we can join the others, okay?

595
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,393
I suppose you've seen
a lot of dead people...

596
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,145
I mean, in your line of work.

597
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,496
Yeah.

598
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,900
This is just the way it is?

599
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:16,386
Yes.

600
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,674
Guess you sort
of get used to it.

601
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,376
Not really.

602
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,545
Hey, there, buddy!

603
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,895
There you go!

604
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,731
Hey, hey...

605
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,049
what are you doing?

606
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:30,150
Robert?

607
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,619
Robert, come out!

608
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:32,814
What are you doing now?!

609
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,521
Stay away from me!

610
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,700
Robert, come out now!

611
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,707
You can't even
catch a little kid?

612
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,209
I don't see you helping me.

613
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,359
I'm not coming out!

614
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,073
Just leave him in
there. Who cares?

615
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,013
Robert, come out now.

616
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,381
Get away from me!

617
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,549
Come here!

618
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,533
Let go of me!

619
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,317
Don't hurt him!

620
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,318
Don't hurt him.

621
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,653
I'm not going to hurt him.

622
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,055
I'm just going to kill him.

623
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,390
James, will you answer
the frickin' phone?!

624
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,059
You're coming over here with me.

625
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,872
You're going to
sit in the corner.

626
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,206
Get down and stay there!

627
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,663
No, better still...

628
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:02,966
better still, I want you
feeding quarters into that thing.

629
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,601
Both hands on at all times.

630
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,870
I'm going over there
and answer that phone.

631
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,906
I want to hear a
little ping, ping, ping

632
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,307
coming from this direction.

633
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,009
I don't hear it, I'm most likely

634
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,677
to turn around and shoot, okay?

635
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:15,345
Ping, ping, ping.

636
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,915
Now, we all know that
I shot the coffeepot,

637
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,517
so I'm not afraid of
shooting this thing

638
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,187
or anything in the
way of this thing.

639
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,521
Get down!

640
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,872
You, breadman, down!

641
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,307
Miss Hathaway, do you want

642
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,727
to come and attend to
my poor cousin James,

643
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:33,447
who's so weak he can't
even pick up the phone?

644
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:35,449
What do you want?

645
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,450
Oh, we're fine.

646
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:37,663
Thank you very much.

647
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:38,863
Sweet of you to ask.

648
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:40,832
No, we don't want
much of anything

649
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:42,690
except perhaps a van or a truck,

650
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:43,940
or how about a tank?

651
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,260
No, we don't need
any medical help.

652
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,779
Our very own Nurse Hathaway

653
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,625
is doing quite beautifully

654
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,932
all on her own.

655
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,995
They don't think
you can handle this.

656
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,259
They want to send
in some doctor.

657
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,989
I think she resents

658
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,473
the implications of that.

659
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:01,975
I think we all do.

660
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:07,564
Hey, come down

661
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,665
from there!

662
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:09,701
Kid!

663
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,118
Get away from me!

664
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,386
Let go now!

665
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,204
Get down from there!

666
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:14,872
Get away from me!

667
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,940
I'm not coming down!

668
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,293
There are dead cats up there.

669
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,812
Is that what you want?

670
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,046
A face full of dead cats?

671
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,158
Just go away.

672
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,782
Get away!

673
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:31,088
Hey, hey, hey...

674
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,401
I need to start, Duncan.

675
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,815
How long does
that thing go on for?

676
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,872
I'm going to start now, okay?

677
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:54,812
Robert's probably told
them all about us by now.

678
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,447
"The Scottish one...
He killed the old man,

679
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,383
burnt the schoolteacher
and stole my shoe."

680
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,763
What are we going to do?

681
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,698
I don't know. I need
some time to think.

682
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,288
He's bleeding badly.

683
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,325
I don't know how
much time he has left

684
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,094
if we don't get
him to a hospital.

685
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,363
I can keep changing
his bandages,

686
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,082
but it's not going to matter.

687
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:16,683
Just shut up, okay?

688
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,152
Don't talk to me like that.

689
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:21,104
I've just tried to help him.

690
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,090
That's all I'm trying to do now.

691
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,490
Do you have any glue?

692
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:26,710
Yes, we do.

693
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,730
It's on the shelf
behind the counter.

694
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,205
I know, Duncan.

695
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,539
We'll ask for a chopper,

696
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,353
and they can fly us to a boat

697
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,521
out in the middle
of Lake Michigan.

698
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,779
The lake is probably frozen.

699
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,999
Then one of those
ice sailing boats.

700
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,000
I did that once...

701
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,253
A couple of winters
ago, up in Lake Geneva.

702
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:55,289
It was incredible.

703
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,603
They're really fast, right?

704
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:00,460
60 miles an hour.

705
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:01,861
Felt like 100.

706
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:04,364
They'll never catch
us at that speed.

707
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,016
We'll be home free, right?

708
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,501
Sure. Home free.

709
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,574
What are you doing?

710
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,026
The cut's too deep.

711
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,311
I can't close it,

712
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:19,913
unless you want me to
get you a needle and thread.

713
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,999
No, no. Glue's fine.

714
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,014
You weren't lying, were you...

715
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,453
About his bleeding?

716
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,725
You have to give up now, Duncan.

717
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,313
Duncan, maybe we
should go to that place

718
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,931
you were telling me about.

719
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,666
The fifth of something.

720
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,168
Firth, the Firth of Clyde.

721
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:43,420
You take a ferry.

722
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,706
Yeah. To the island
of Great Cumbrae

723
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:49,403
and then, sneak a tiny
boat over to little Cumbrae,

724
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,605
because it's privately
owned, you know?

725
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,081
You can get caught, of
course, but it's worth it

726
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:57,767
if the sun's in the sky
and the Firth is blue.

727
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:58,813
The big mountains of Arran

728
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,088
all purple, jutting up
in the background.

729
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:02,422
Sounds beautiful.

730
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,441
I wouldn't know.
I've never been.

731
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,242
Never even seen the Firth.

732
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:09,707
Maybe that's what I should have
pledged at Hogmanay, you know...

733
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:11,748
To go to little Cumbrae.

734
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,128
A clean break with the past.

735
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,669
A fresh start.

736
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:19,772
But I came to America
instead to stay with my cousin.

737
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,469
My father thought I was crazy.

738
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,720
He's a pallet driver

739
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:24,928
on the shipyards in Glasgow...

740
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,198
30 years, loading
on and loading off.

741
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,184
Got me the same
job when I was 19.

742
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,552
I was laid off by 20.

743
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:34,354
It was a good job, you know,

744
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:36,656
but I always wanted
something else,

745
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,542
wanted to be something more.

746
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,243
I have, too.

747
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,763
With all you can do? Why?

748
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:45,248
I don't know.

749
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,834
So then

750
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,936
I end up in here.

751
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:52,972
Duncan Stewart comes to America,

752
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:56,192
and on a Friday
morning, comes in here.

753
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,523
We just needed the money.

754
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,864
Yeah, but look
what we got, James.

755
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,382
Look! You're a bloody mess,

756
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:03,934
and I don't know what to do.

757
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,767
But you're all right.

758
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,470
I'm not all right at all.

759
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,971
I killed a man.

760
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,473
I killed a man!

761
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,475
Do you know
what that feels like?

762
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,687
Do you know
what that feels like?

763
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,427
Huh?

764
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:15,611
Do you?

765
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,647
I do.

766
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,150
I killed a man.

767
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,986
I gave him the wrong blood.

768
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,320
You didn't mean to kill him.

769
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,456
You didn't mean
to kill Mr. Novotny.

770
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,792
And how many of
those cops out there

771
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,794
are going to care about that?

772
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,062
It's all right, James.

773
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,930
I'll get us out of this somehow.

774
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,898
I just have to
think of something.

775
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,300
I don't know what, but...

776
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,353
I have to think of something.

777
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:40,631
Maybe Robert

778
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:41,938
had the right idea.

779
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,690
Maybe that's the way out.

780
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,470
We stack these
crates high enough

781
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:47,974
to support the ceiling.

782
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,980
Duncan, behind you!

783
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,514
Don't, Duncan.

784
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,116
You already know
what it feels like,

785
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,228
except this time,
you'll mean it.

786
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:54,951
Don't! Don't!

787
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,453
Where the hell were you?

788
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,705
Don't hurt him.

789
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,490
Where were you? Where were you?

790
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,970
The storeroom, by the door.

791
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,276
The door?

792
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:05,145
You're telling me
there's a door?

793
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,924
Here, just take them, take them.

794
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,548
Just take the keys, Duncan.

795
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,814
Where does it go?

796
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,067
It's a fire escape.

797
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:31,104
The ladder leads up to the
apartment building behind us.

798
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,317
There's a building behind us?

799
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,374
You're coming with me.

800
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:43,260
Just don't move your wrist.

801
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:44,428
You'll be fine.

802
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,770
I hope it is you
who will be fine.

803
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,305
James, I have to go.

804
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,722
There's a way out.

805
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:51,407
I have to go.

806
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,010
I don't want to
leave you, but...

807
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,163
We should have waited.

808
00:31:56,198 --> 00:31:58,226
They'll take good care of you.

809
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,530
I know they will.

810
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:04,971
Come on. Let's go.

811
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,372
Go on.

812
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,876
This is called taking
the long way around.

813
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:03,263
Come on.

814
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,810
We did it, Miss Hathaway.

815
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:52,779
We did it.

816
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:55,382
When we get to
the end of the alley,

817
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,550
I want you to let me go, Duncan.

818
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,755
Sure.

819
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,123
I wouldn't want you
to slow me down.

820
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,138
Hold it right there!

821
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:09,479
Stop right there please.

822
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,150
Stop!

823
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,280
Is that one of them?

824
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,636
Yes. Don't run, Duncan!

825
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:17,487
Don't run!

826
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,538
Stop or I'll shoot.

827
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,423
Don't run!

828
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,392
God!

829
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,599
Call the paramedics!
Call the paramedics!

830
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,784
This is unit 2418.

831
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,886
I'm in the alley
behind 3312 Woolcott.

832
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,553
I've got one offender down.

833
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,389
I need a wagon or an ambulance.

834
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:38,842
What about the other suspect?

835
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,510
The other suspect?!

836
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:42,757
Internal bleeding...
he's still inside.

837
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,180
Probably passed out.

838
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,366
The second suspect is
inside, possibly unconscious.

839
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,018
Come on.

840
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,689
Get the paramedics!

841
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,395
Clear Trauma 2!

842
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,897
Carol, you all right?

843
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,310
We can get it from here.

844
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,134
Duncan Stewart.

845
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,097
Multiple GSWs to
the chest and thigh.

846
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,161
Two liters saline in.

847
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,922
Just gave high dose epi for PEA.

848
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,802
James Rogers,
single entrance wound

849
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:11,903
left abdomen,

850
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:13,271
massive blood loss on scene,

851
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:14,338
shocky BP 80/45,

852
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,328
pulse 144,

853
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,683
good breath sounds bilaterally.

854
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:19,515
Okay, on my count...

855
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,183
<i>My</i> count.

856
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,651
One, two, three, go.

857
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,389
All right, give me
two more saline,

858
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,558
four of O-negative
on the rapid infuser.

859
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,510
We got spontaneous respiration.

860
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,695
Hold the CPR.

861
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,041
Okay, let's move him.

862
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:33,997
One, two, three.

863
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,266
Where's Benton?

864
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,484
Out with an appendectomy.

865
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,067
He's got a pulse.

866
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,681
What about Morgenstern?

867
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:40,981
He needs a surgeon.

868
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,005
I got it.

869
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:46,159
Duncan, hey.

870
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,677
You hang in there, okay?

871
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,313
Think of all the
beautiful places

872
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,814
you told us about.

873
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,377
Think about the Firth of Clyde

874
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,428
and little Cumbrae.

875
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,401
You hang in there, okay?

876
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:56,803
We'll pull you through this.

877
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:58,922
Are you all right?

878
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,823
Yeah, I'm fine.

879
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:03,609
Lost his pulse.

880
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:04,744
I'll intubate him.

881
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,629
Give me a 7.5 ET tube, please.

882
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,875
We need a portable chest!

883
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:08,899
Two units in!

884
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,855
I need the tube.

885
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,223
Got it?

886
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,743
Pulse ox is 85.

887
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:20,810
BP 75/50.

888
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,178
Sinus tach at 150.

889
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,257
Pulse thready.

890
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,547
Cap refill's poor.

891
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,249
There's no exit wound.

892
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,984
Probably got the spleen.

893
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,686
Give him a gram
of cefoxitin, CBC.

894
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,488
Type and cross for six.

895
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,584
Still no pulse.

896
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,375
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

897
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,942
He's going to need a chest tube.

898
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:38,044
Haleh, take over.

899
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,324
I'll do the Foley.

900
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,825
Malik, dip the urine for blood.

901
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:43,516
Kerry, Duncan
needs a chest tube.

902
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:44,629
Duncan?

903
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:45,751
The patient in 2.

904
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:46,964
I think Doug can
handle the tube.

905
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:49,108
Who's the senior
surgical resident on call?

906
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,773
Carol, what are you doing here?

907
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:51,574
I'm trying to help!

908
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,620
You know, I think we got it.

909
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,021
Why don't you take a break?

910
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,195
Call the OR.

911
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,797
They can explore
this guy up there.

912
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,365
Got a blood gas?

913
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,667
Done.

914
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:03,369
Two more units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser now!

915
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:05,638
Get an H and H
and cross for eight.

916
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:06,839
You want type-specific?

917
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:07,874
That's a good idea.

918
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:09,375
I already ordered it.

919
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,860
How about the portable chest?

920
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,827
I ordered that, too.

921
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,107
Doug, can you

922
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,175
take over CPR?

923
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,265
Yep.

924
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,844
Carol, call Radiology again.

925
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,451
Carol!

926
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,036
Hey, Carol.

927
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,182
Hey, Carol, let's go.

928
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,486
I got it.

929
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:27,610
Hi, this is Carol
Hathaway in the ER.

930
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,796
We need a portable
chest in Trauma 2.

931
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,015
Asystole!

932
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,683
Let's crack him.

933
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,885
Got it?

934
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,822
Give me a number ten blade.

935
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,512
Rib spreader.

936
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,365
Doug, can you start
internal compression?

937
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,279
Amp of epi.

938
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,320
Okay, two more units
of O-neg. Statinsky.

939
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,488
Mig of atropine.

940
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,884
Give me some suction.

941
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:11,782
Hey... anyone talked to Carol?

942
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:12,850
How's she doing?

943
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:13,973
From the looks of her,

944
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,508
she ain't giving up her job.

945
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,121
Is this guy going to make it?

946
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:18,210
Yeah, probably.

947
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:20,146
Weaver thinks
it's just his spleen.

948
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,181
How many units?

949
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,582
Four O-neg, four type-specific.

950
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:23,583
Last epi?

951
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:24,962
Five migs, three minutes ago.

952
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:27,170
How long has he been down?

953
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,538
25 minutes.

954
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:38,965
Time of death: 1348.

955
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,368
Hey, Carol, how are you?

956
00:38:58,403 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm fine, Jerry. Thanks.

957
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,482
Do you know where
the others are?

958
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,406
Yeah, the lady with
the burned hand

959
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,740
is right here, Curtain 2.

960
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,842
The rest got
transferred to St. Mary's.

961
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:07,922
The little boy...

962
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,423
Robert Potter, ten years old?

963
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,114
I didn't hear
anything about him.

964
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,215
Thanks, Jer.

965
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,918
Second-degree burns.

966
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,153
I'm going to go get
some Thermazine salve

967
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,922
and dressings.

968
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,491
Hey, you're okay now.

969
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,062
You're okay.

970
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,331
Yeah, I guess so.

971
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,999
And, uh... and you're all right?

972
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,567
Yeah, I'm fine.

973
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,819
How about the others?

974
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,955
Uh, that bread guy, Lockhart...

975
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,406
He was fine.

976
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:41,010
And, um... Javier and Mr. Dusak
went to some other hospital.

977
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,262
And Robert?

978
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,579
Robert.

979
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,332
Robert crawled back down
the hole he crawled up in.

980
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:49,285
He didn't have a scratch on him.

981
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,071
I didn't think I would
be this shaken.

982
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:57,810
But we got out all right, huh?

983
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,446
Yeah.

984
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,261
Well, they'll just
put some cream

985
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:05,796
and dressings on your burns,

986
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,531
and you'll be fine in no time.

987
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,155
Okay.

988
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,057
Hey...

989
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:13,660
you really saved
our lives in there.

990
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:16,095
None of us could have done that.

991
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:18,898
I'll see you around.

992
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,144
Are you all right?

993
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,980
Well, it's been
a busy day, but...

994
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,249
Hey, are you all right?

995
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,151
Yeah, I'm fine.

996
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,522
When we first heard
that you were in there,

997
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:45,769
and the police
didn't tell us anything,

998
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,671
we didn't know
what was going on.

999
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,395
You sure you're okay?

1000
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,499
Okay.

1001
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:56,681
Oh, and Doug...

1002
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,171
I'm really sorry about
what happened in there.

1003
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,239
I didn't mean...

1004
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:01,190
I don't care about in there.

1005
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:01,991
It doesn't matter.

1006
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,306
Just glad you're okay.

1007
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,430
Jerry, uh, could you...?

1008
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:41,340
Carol.

1009
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:46,257
Do you, uh... do
you need anything?

1010
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:47,312
No, thanks.

1011
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:48,481
I'm fine.

1012
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:50,500
You know...

1013
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,935
we've missed you around here.

1014
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,790
I've missed it, too.

1015
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,892
I love my job, Kerry.

1016
00:42:59,928 --> 00:43:01,777
I know.

1017
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,799
I'm going home.

1018
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,834
That's a good idea.
