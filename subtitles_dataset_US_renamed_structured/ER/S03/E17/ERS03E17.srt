1
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,586
- Fine...
- I'm fine...

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,610
I'm too old.

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,506
Shaq on Jordan at the buzzer!

4
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:16,030
Oh, no! Yes!

5
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,132
Sweet move, yes!

6
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,411
Still got your sneaks on, Doc?

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,401
Hang on.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,402
Point game.

9
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,404
You better be passing, baby,

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,538
you'd better be passing!

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,735
Good rebound!

12
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,303
All right, right,
time out, time out.

13
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:27,992
Time out?

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,378
Keep bonding, Mark, I got it.

15
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:31,580
Malik?

16
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,282
Time to save a life.

17
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,184
Oh, God... Hey, Doc,
you want some of this?

18
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,297
Dad, what are you doing?

19
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,303
Hey, Doc...

20
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,288
Hey, busy night?

21
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:41,689
Yeah, I thought the
sun would never rise.

22
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:42,991
One more for the road.

23
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:44,826
"Tearful and upset"?

24
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,995
That's her chief complaint?

25
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:49,831
Mr. Thomas here OD'd on
his son's jimsonweed tea.

26
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,849
We'll need to
send this to the lab.

27
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,801
Jimsonweed?

28
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:54,903
Got to keep up
with the times, Malik.

29
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,872
Is there anything
else in that tea?

30
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,618
No, but when my dad comes down,

31
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,253
he's really going to kill me.

32
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,911
Oh, nurse, it hurts
when I do this.

33
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:03,912
Dad!

34
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:05,246
Then don't do it, Mr. Thomas.

35
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,509
Dad!

36
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,882
I always use my diaphragm.

37
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,152
I'm, like, a total
fanatic about it, but...

38
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:12,954
Did you have unprotected
sex in the last 72 hours?

39
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,223
The girls at the dorm say

40
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:17,992
you can take like a quadruple
dose of birth control pills

41
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:19,161
the morning after

42
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:22,096
and it will keep you
from getting pregnant.

43
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,832
Yes, it can work in
some circumstances,

44
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,770
but it's not the best
method of birth control.

45
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:30,138
It's just so weird.

46
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,442
My boyfriend will kill me.

47
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:36,037
Did he force you
or threaten you?

48
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:41,450
Maybe I'm just having a
breakdown or something.

49
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,385
Look, I can help you

50
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,421
if you tell me what happened.

51
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:47,856
I had a few beers

52
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,036
at this party last night.

53
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,300
I saw this guy Mike

54
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,105
and I was going to
give him a ride home.

55
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,341
And then I woke up in my car

56
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,492
in the dorm parking lot.

57
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,849
My tights weren't up all the way

58
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,896
and I don't know what happened.

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,169
You don't remember?

60
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,487
No.

61
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,040
Well, how well do you know Mike?

62
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,108
You're a hunky
chunky one, aren't you?

63
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:08,555
What's wrong with this guy?!

64
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,078
Psychosis and hypersexuality

65
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,846
are toxic effects of jimsonweed.

66
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,660
Can't you guys
give him something?

67
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:14,749
Let's cover you up, sir.

68
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,618
What kind of work
does your father do?

69
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,119
He's a malpractice attorney.

70
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:19,137
Medical malpractice?

71
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,472
Ooh.

72
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,606
Really?

73
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,553
Did you ever see
anything so pretty, Doc?

74
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,577
Oh, my God! Dad!

75
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,912
It's not that pretty,
Mr. Thomas.

76
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,129
Pretty as yours, Doc?

77
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:30,114
Hey! Come on!

78
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,099
Peter!

79
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,134
Here we go.

80
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,146
Hey, light on Hicks'
service today?

81
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,403
Yeah. Covering the ER.

82
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,571
I don't know

83
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:38,873
what these guys are
always whining about.

84
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,109
ER's a cakewalk
compared to surgery.

85
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,655
Oh, a cakewalk, okay, okay.

86
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,312
How about a little OR versus ER

87
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:46,593
and loser takes the next Gomer

88
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,082
who comes through the door?

89
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,417
Nah, squash is my game.

90
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,485
He's kidding, yeah?

91
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,564
Yeah, he's kidding.

92
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,633
All right, turkey, same stakes.

93
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:55,457
You think there's an ER patient

94
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:56,591
that I can't handle?

95
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:57,704
I think there's one

96
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,639
that can tie you
up your whole day.

97
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:00,928
Let's go.

98
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:04,633
All right, skyhook,
left-handed, top of the key.

99
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,347
Oh!

100
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:09,221
Your shot, Dr. Carter.

101
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,202
Just leave her hair
in the doll's mouth.

102
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:04,871
The doctors will figure it out.

103
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:06,161
Sounds like one for you.

104
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:08,074
Or maybe for our
young Jedi surgeon

105
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,809
so recently humiliated in hoops.

106
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,032
I think I have a better one.

107
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,267
Bring on your worst.

108
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:13,613
Hey, who made the tea?

109
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:14,603
Yoo-hoo.

110
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:16,449
Is there a butcher in the house?

111
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:19,441
Oh, no, Mrs. Chenevert,
you need to stay in your room.

112
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,254
That little room makes me jumpy.

113
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:24,245
I need to get this chili
fry cut out of my throat

114
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,580
before it burns me up.

115
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:27,949
Sorry. I still need
to finish her history.

116
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,996
That's what they
said at St. David's

117
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,553
before they kicked me out.

118
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:33,199
I took two buses to get here.

119
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:34,367
Pulse is 130.

120
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,224
Uh-huh. Are you
high on something?

121
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,225
Me? Uh-uh.

122
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,226
No crack or...?

123
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,227
Crack? Never!

124
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,729
Why don't you let her finish

125
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:42,864
and you can tell her
what you're high on

126
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,867
and then I think I have
the perfect surgeon for you.

127
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:47,302
Surgeon? What kind of surgeon?

128
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:48,470
Uh, a young one.

129
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,839
Hey, private hospital
turfed that woman.

130
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,006
Can you imagine?

131
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,753
Crackhead with abdominal pain.

132
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,076
What do you think?

133
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,411
Oh, yeah. Carter. Yeah.

134
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,957
Dr. Ross, you want some tea?

135
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,581
I'm cutting back on caffeine.

136
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:00,915
I think it's herbal.

137
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,295
Dr. Greene, you want some?

138
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,518
No! Don't drink that!

139
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,287
You don't want to
go there, big guy.

140
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,904
Hey, there, Sasquatch! Huh?!

141
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,451
Dad, no!

142
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,142
Your drug screen came
back positive for roofies.

143
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,355
Roofies?

144
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,511
Rohypnol.

145
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,580
It knocks you out
and causes amnesia.

146
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,760
You mean he put it in my drink?

147
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,185
Well, someone did, unless
you took tranquilizers.

148
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,285
Never.

149
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,421
Oh, my God.

150
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,489
How could I have been so stupid?

151
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,690
Hey, you weren't stupid.

152
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,109
You just trusted someone
you shouldn't have.

153
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,663
So, what's going to happen?

154
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,966
Well, we need to do
a medical evaluation...

155
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,951
and we have to call the police.

156
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:39,070
But what if I'm wrong?

157
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,173
I don't really know
what happened.

158
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,275
I mean, when I woke up

159
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,911
I didn't really know for sure

160
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,930
that I'd had sex.

161
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,565
He may have used a condom.

162
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,045
Well, then it's just
my word against his.

163
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,386
Let's finish your
medical evaluation.

164
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,854
We may be able to find

165
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,955
some evidence.

166
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:02,960
Need some help here.

167
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,340
Two GSWs... Hope
you're in the mood.

168
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,597
What happened?

169
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,765
Drug deal went bad.

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
A guy opened fire

171
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,500
in the Flyburger on Third.

172
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,735
Injuries?

173
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,982
Single GSW to the left flank.

174
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,883
Vitals stable, good
breath sounds.

175
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,173
I.V. saline, TKO.

176
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,392
Some guy<i> shot</i> me!

177
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,360
Yeah. Some guy.

178
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:19,694
It's always "some guy."

179
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,841
Doyle, get him into
trauma two. Malik?

180
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,732
17-year-old employee
hit in the lower left chest.

181
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,435
Check for weapons and needles.

182
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,148
Plus a through- and-through
to the right deltoid.

183
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:31,055
BP's falling, 90/55.

184
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,056
Sinus tach at 120.

185
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,823
Two large-bore IVs,

186
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,724
a liter of saline in.

187
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,325
O2 at 15 liters.

188
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,026
This one's more critical.

189
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,793
Grab the portable from two.

190
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,495
On my count. One, two, three.

191
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,292
H and H, type and
cross four units.

192
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,127
Two units of
O-negative just in case

193
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,261
and a portable chest.

194
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:44,163
Can we give him
something for pain?

195
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,653
Stand by with morphine.

196
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,388
I guess you need
to get hazard pay

197
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:49,023
for slinging burgers these days.

198
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,691
Belly's tender. Set up a lavage.

199
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,138
Pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.

200
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,328
Ancef, one gram?

201
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,625
Yeah. He might have
a peritoneal violation.

202
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,576
Give him cefoxitin,
that same dose.

203
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,900
What do you got?

204
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,479
I got a cake for you to walk.

205
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,669
Exam two.

206
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,349
I need a surgical consult

207
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,151
on a lovely 50-ish crackhead

208
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,942
sent over courtesy
of the St. David's ER.

209
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:09,756
Oh, that sounds like a dump.

210
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,180
Yeah, well, you
lost fair and square.

211
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,514
What about this guy?

212
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,061
Uh, forget it, Carter.

213
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:17,063
It's Gomer tag, and you're it.

214
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,803
I can't believe he shot me.

215
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,716
Where's Malik?
Calling radiology.

216
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,106
I was just standing there, man.

217
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,819
Be quiet and hold still
so I can examine you.

218
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,843
You okay alone?

219
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,222
Yeah, he didn't have
a gun or any needles.

220
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,762
Gun? I don't own no gun.

221
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,380
Call me if you need me.

222
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,499
Can I help you?

223
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,278
Yeah. I'm looking
for my brother.

224
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:33,446
He's been shot.

225
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,403
Visitors can't go
in during a trauma.

226
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,606
Go to the desk and
tell them you're here.

227
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,251
Someone will come talk to you.

228
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,525
Kenny!

229
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,676
Kenny, you all right?

230
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,877
Chris, I got shot.

231
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:44,157
You have to wait outside.

232
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,480
That's my little brother.

233
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:46,759
Okay, but you still
need to wait outside.

234
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:47,794
Look, the cops wouldn't
let me catch the...

235
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:48,583
I couldn't get in the ambulance.

236
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,218
I'm staying right here.

237
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,770
Who capped you, Kenny?

238
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,805
I don't know.

239
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,623
Can't you give him something?

240
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,225
They think I'm a gangbanger.

241
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,576
Who?

242
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,072
I haven't finished
assessing him.

243
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:01,240
Please! Wait outside.

244
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,564
Stat-page Benton.

245
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,883
Why are y'all swarming
around this boy, huh,

246
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,213
when my brother's dying?

247
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,603
Nobody is dying anywhere.

248
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,116
Family members wait outside.

249
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,339
Are you in charge?

250
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,590
Haleh, could you...?

251
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,341
Don't send a sister
to shoo me away.

252
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:13,825
Get your ass in there

253
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,293
and fix him up now.

254
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,472
Look, we treat

255
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,230
the most critically
injured patients first.

256
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,248
Kenny's been shot.

257
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,694
You are tying up the staff

258
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:24,269
and delaying your
brother's treatment.

259
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,364
Why don't you wait outside?

260
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:26,120
We got work to do.

261
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,121
You think he's a gangster?

262
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,623
We treat everybody

263
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,953
the same. Same?

264
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,226
Seven for the white
boy, one for the brother?

265
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,406
Dr. Greene. I need you in here.

266
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,296
All right, Lydia, come with me.

267
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,731
He bradyed down.

268
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,166
His BP bottomed out.

269
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,796
Did you give him anything?

270
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,085
No.

271
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,337
All right. Give me a 14-gauge.

272
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:43,616
Pulse ox is only 85.

273
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,784
Lungs sounded okay to me.

274
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:47,108
He's got a tension pneumo.

275
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,928
Get that portable in here!

276
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,124
Neck veins are coming down.

277
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:52,847
What happened?

278
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:55,350
You've got to
constantly reassess

279
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:56,628
a penetrating trauma.

280
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:58,085
What's wrong with him?

281
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,554
BP's only 70 palp.

282
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,039
Doyle, I'm going to put
in the chest tube, okay?

283
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,475
You set me up with a 32 French.

284
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,444
I told that doctor my
brother needed help.

285
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,589
Your brother will be
fine. What's his name?

286
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,896
Kenny. Kenny Law.

287
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,075
The Southside basketball kid?

288
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:11,816
Yeah, man! You
gotta represent for him!

289
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,212
He was all-city point guard.

290
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,271
Yo! Black man.

291
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,322
You a doctor?

292
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,958
Yeah.

293
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,236
You need to get in here
and take care of Kenny.

294
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,555
Guy's stable. Go ahead.

295
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:23,278
You sure?

296
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,745
Yeah.

297
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,081
Hey, you, get off!

298
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:27,282
Hey, hey. Whoa!

299
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,461
Don't you touch him!

300
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,662
All right. I need a new tray.

301
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:30,952
Someone call security.

302
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,353
What's going on?

303
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:35,323
I got a tension pneumo,
trying to get a chest tube in.

304
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:38,292
All right, just let us
do our jobs, all right?

305
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,663
A mig of atropine and
hang a unit of O-neg.

306
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,598
All right, here we go.

307
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,015
Hook up the Thoraseal.

308
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,896
Looks arterial.

309
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,714
Somebody tell the
OR we're on our way up

310
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,483
and schedule the
guy in one to follow.

311
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,339
Let's move, people!

312
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,275
So, after you choked
on the chili fry?

313
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:56,644
Who said anything about choking?

314
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,812
You.

315
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,147
No, no. No.

316
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,284
The burning started right after.

317
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,487
All right, and the burning
has lasted on and off

318
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,556
for three weeks?

319
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,137
Babs?

320
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,260
What?

321
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:14,695
Where is your pain?

322
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,632
Yeah? That's more
like your chest.

323
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,269
You know, you're so much
nicer than that Dr. Smith.

324
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,171
Thank you.

325
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,917
I'm going to need
to examine you.

326
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,252
I'm going to put a
call over to St. David's,

327
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:28,421
see if I can find the doctor

328
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,456
who took care of you over there.

329
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,981
No, no. You can leave
your clothes on for now.

330
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,949
Take a deep breath.

331
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:38,653
And out.

332
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:39,971
Hey, Kerry.

333
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,818
Hey. I called you last
night for journal club.

334
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,975
I was out with Greg.

335
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,342
Hmm. How's that going?

336
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,344
Would you mind
writing me the scrip

337
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,479
for a new diaphragm?

338
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,492
So I guess it's going
pretty well, huh?

339
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,049
Well, we haven't done anything.

340
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,751
We've done some
stuff, but, uh...

341
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,953
I've got condoms, I'll
get a new diaphragm.

342
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,388
I'm just carefully planning

343
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,157
for a possible
spontaneous moment.

344
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,557
That's great, Jeanie.

345
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,326
You know, my viral load is down.

346
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,494
I'm just not sure

347
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,663
if I should risk exposing,
you know, Greg to HIV

348
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,598
unless he's the
love of my life...

349
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,167
not just because I'm lonely

350
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,335
and haven't had sex
in a year and a half.

351
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,804
I got one for you.

352
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,272
I'll take it.

353
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,041
29-year-old woman,
6½ months pregnant.

354
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,076
She was rear-ended
by a pickup truck.

355
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,478
Seat-belted, no
abdominal pain or cramping.

356
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,479
Vitals normal.

357
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,949
She refused an IV;
couple of minor lacs.

358
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,329
She's complaining
mostly of right ankle pain.

359
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,619
Hi. I'm Jeanie Boulet.

360
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,753
I'm Carla Reece.

361
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,089
Girlfriend, I've got to pee.

362
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,653
Dr. Greene, this is
Mr. and Mrs. Brodie.

363
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:35,521
Their son worked
at the Flyburger.

364
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:36,844
We heard he was shot.

365
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,513
Yes. He's stable now,

366
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,193
but he's going to need surgery.

367
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:41,949
Oh, my God. Is he
going to be okay?

368
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:42,917
I think so.

369
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,463
You can go on in and see him

370
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,299
before we take him up to the OR.

371
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,988
Oh, so that's what it is?

372
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:51,442
They get the red-carpet escort
while you call security on me?

373
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,289
The patient is
waiting for surgery.

374
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,357
He's not critical.

375
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,325
He was when you was
letting Kenny bleed to death.

376
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,916
They were being treated
based on what we saw

377
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,217
on initial exam.

378
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,418
What you saw?

379
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,321
Just another shot
nigger is what you saw.

380
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,417
He's had a gram of cefoxitin,
DT, and five of morphine.

381
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,453
BP's up to 110/70.

382
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,620
Good. In English, that
means he's doing well.

383
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,288
There's been some
internal bleeding

384
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,824
from the gunshot wound.

385
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,804
We'll need your consent
to take him to surgery.

386
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:25,460
Of course.

387
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,794
Was anyone else hurt?

388
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,073
There was another young man

389
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:29,141
we took up to surgery.

390
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,792
I know it's hard to
see your son like this.

391
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,583
He was in the wrong place

392
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,118
at the wrong time.

393
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,738
Billy is always in
the wrong place

394
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:38,206
at the wrong time.

395
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:40,391
Doesn't matter how
much we threaten

396
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,943
or worry.

397
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:44,244
Our son's a crack
dealer, doctor.

398
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,165
It was just a matter of time.

399
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,119
What?

400
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,921
I don't know, the
black kid isn't a banger

401
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:56,557
and he isn't a dealer
and we assumed he was.

402
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,126
I didn't assume anything.

403
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:00,445
One was stable,
the other wasn't.

404
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,591
There it is.

405
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,797
How can you tell?

406
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,377
Semen glows
in ultraviolet light.

407
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,178
I'm going to have
to take a swab.

408
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,487
Oh, my God, he raped me.

409
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:10,772
I'm afraid he did.

410
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,941
I'm also going to have
to comb for a few hairs.

411
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:15,843
Could I have VD?

412
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,245
Or AIDS?

413
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,864
We'll give you antibiotics

414
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,899
for any sexually
transmitted diseases,

415
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,285
and you should
be tested for AIDS.

416
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,337
Oh, my God.

417
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,389
I called Rita James.

418
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:31,159
She's a counselor
who specializes

419
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:32,493
in women in your situation.

420
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,390
Lori, if you don't tell

421
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,659
the police about this,

422
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,166
he's going to do it
to someone else.

423
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:41,480
The mixture of
alcohol and roofies

424
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:44,071
might kill his next victim.

425
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,678
Will you stay with me?

426
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:53,831
Of course I will.

427
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,451
Yeah. No, you saw her today.

428
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,985
Chili fry indigestion.

429
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,220
Yeah. I need her
records faxed over.

430
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,391
It shouldn't cost you much more
than the bus token you gave her.

431
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,793
No, I need them now!

432
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:08,228
Haven't you people ever
heard of the COBRA laws?

433
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,642
You know you can't
just dump somebody

434
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,376
because they don't
have insurance.

435
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,433
Go, Johnny, go.

436
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:13,434
Mark. Hello?

437
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,480
It's Dan Ferkich.

438
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:15,981
Uh, Kenny's basketball coach.

439
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,082
Mark took care of Kenny.

440
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,217
Yeah, I knew something was
wrong when he missed practice.

441
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,953
Someone from Woodlawn
Park must have got him!

442
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,455
They're scared to
face him on the court.

443
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,556
Settle down, fellas. I'm
trying to talk to the doctors.

444
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,091
Kenny's been taken up to the OR.

445
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,209
His brother went with him.

446
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,582
Chris is on it? Good.

447
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,712
Will he be all
right by Saturday?

448
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,280
Because we're playing
Woodlawn Park in the city finals.

449
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,503
He was shot, coach.

450
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,938
Damn, man!

451
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,205
We got to call the guys.

452
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,434
How can I check
on how he's doing?

453
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,920
You can go up to the
surgical waiting room

454
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,176
up on the sixth floor.

455
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,739
Someone up there can
tell you what's going on.

456
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:42,708
These guys are going to
have to wait down here.

457
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:45,749
Okay, just stay here.

458
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,038
Is that my baby's heartbeat?

459
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:53,407
Yep. Good and strong.

460
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:55,893
What a sweet sound.

461
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,478
Yeah, it is.

462
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:59,880
Everything appears to be fine.

463
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,216
Thank God.

464
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,718
How far along are you?

465
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:05,853
6½ months.

466
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:09,089
We'll have to monitor you for
contractions just to make sure.

467
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,309
We'll shield your baby

468
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,077
and take an X ray of that ankle

469
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,579
and put some
stitches in this arm.

470
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,114
Well, um... couldn't you

471
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,516
just tape it together
or something?

472
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,762
I could steri-strip it,

473
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,331
but you'd get a
much better result

474
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,399
with stitches.

475
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,256
The thing is, is I hate needles.

476
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,608
You're planning on
going through childbirth

477
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,243
without an epidural?

478
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,014
Honey, women were having babies
long before doctors and needles.

479
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,568
What do you mean,
they can't come up?

480
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,603
They're Kenny's friends.

481
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,815
Yup. We want to see him, too.

482
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,517
Only immediate
family are allowed

483
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,685
on the surgical floor.

484
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,375
Yeah? You let the coach come up.

485
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,621
Well, they shouldn't have.

486
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,610
I see what this is.

487
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,611
It's all right.

488
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,913
I'll hang with y'all here.

489
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,081
Man, how is Kenny doing?

490
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,348
Nobody knows.

491
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,095
That's because
they don't tell you

492
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,218
nothing around here.

493
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,753
Tricks.

494
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,888
What's going on?

495
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,467
Ah, natives are restless.

496
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,456
I heard that.

497
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,925
It's an expression, Connie.

498
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,293
Those guys live around here.

499
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,460
They're natives.

500
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,141
Yeah, well, that's
not what you meant.

501
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,543
Hold on. Jerry, let's knock off
those kind of remarks, okay?

502
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,733
Fine.

503
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,612
Those kids heard a
rumor that Kenny was shot

504
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,281
by some guy betting
on Woodlawn Park

505
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,549
for the championship game.

506
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,740
They think he was shot
over a basketball game?

507
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,619
Hey, kids get shot
over basketball shoes.

508
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,343
Maybe you ought
to set them straight.

509
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,978
The white kid was
a drug dealer, right?

510
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,524
Look, it's not our
job to spread rumors

511
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,514
or to stop them.

512
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,515
And it's a violation

513
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,028
of patient confidentiality.

514
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,297
Yeah, well, those kids
looked pretty riled up to me.

515
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,132
That's why the police
should handle it.

516
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,122
Daddy.

517
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,057
Hey, oh...

518
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,291
Daddy.

519
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,960
You're too big.

520
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,472
Oh, something wrong?

521
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,863
It's my mom.

522
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,509
She had a stroke this morning.

523
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,773
How is she?

524
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,412
She's in the ICU in Sarasota,

525
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,536
but, um, she's
paralyzed on her left side

526
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,238
and she can't talk.

527
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,554
All right, let's
go in the lounge.

528
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,521
Is there anything I can do?

529
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,545
Oh, no, thanks.

530
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,713
We're flying down
this afternoon.

531
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,783
Rachel just wanted to
see you before we left.

532
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,252
Is she going to be
home by the weekend?

533
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,531
I don't think so, Mark.

534
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,805
So, she's going to
miss school and soccer?

535
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,590
Maybe that's not
the best thing for...

536
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,354
I can't miss soccer...
I'm the goalie.

537
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,127
I'll talk to the coach, honey.

538
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,846
Why doesn't she stay with me?

539
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,882
How are you going
to do that and work?

540
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,416
You do it.

541
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,818
I can take her to school,

542
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,970
and then Ruth can pick her up

543
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,205
and keep her until I get home.

544
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,069
I want to stay here with Daddy.

545
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,445
I can handle it.

546
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,015
We're going to have to
transect at the sternum.

547
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,551
Lebshke.

548
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,253
I hear our patient's quite
the basketball player.

549
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,254
NBA material.

550
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,389
Have you been busy

551
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,840
in outpatient surgery?

552
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,442
Oh, I've been busy all right,

553
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,505
especially since I
don't have an intern.

554
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,773
Suction.

555
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,698
Yes, well, uh, Dr. Carter

556
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,900
asked to be
transferred to my team.

557
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,219
You don't think I'd poach
him from you, do you?

558
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:53,520
No, no, no. Of course not.

559
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,723
I mean, not unless

560
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,959
it was for his own good.

561
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:01,829
Richardson.

562
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:03,397
Suction.

563
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,667
I finally got someone
over at St. David's

564
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,569
to fax me your records.

565
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:10,037
What time you got?

566
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,272
I thought you said the
doctor's name was Smith.

567
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,441
No, that was my
doctor from before.

568
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,243
Was he a cardiologist?

569
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,811
Uh, heart doctor?

570
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,948
You know, I got
a party to get to.

571
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,816
Maybe I ought to head on home

572
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,352
and come back tomorrow.

573
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:27,872
Well, I'd love to let you go,
Babs, but this EKG is telling me

574
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,691
that you ought to stick
around for a little while.

575
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,554
She needs to be on a monitor.

576
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,756
O2 and a hep lock.

577
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,591
See if they've got enough blood

578
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,025
to do cardiac enzymes.

579
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,317
Didn't they run those
over at St. David's?

580
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,651
No.

581
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,714
And they didn't notice

582
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:42,670
the flipped T-waves

583
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,082
and nonspecific ST changes.

584
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:45,339
Is that bad?

585
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,657
It could be.

586
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,703
Or it could just be

587
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,454
the way your EKG always looks.

588
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:52,558
Dr. Smith ever tell you
that you had heart trouble?

589
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:53,997
You know, you're nice.

590
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,083
You sure you're a surgeon?

591
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,135
Sometimes I wonder.

592
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,264
Okay, here's your referral,

593
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,133
your antibiotic prescription

594
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:03,068
and your birth control pills.

595
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,860
I want you to take two
now and two in 12 hours.

596
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,263
If you don't get your
period in three weeks,

597
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,698
I want you to come
in for a pregnancy test.

598
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,734
Do you need any
help getting home?

599
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,013
My boyfriend's here.

600
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:16,904
Would you like me
to speak to him?

601
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:17,905
No. I'm fine.

602
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,306
Okay.

603
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,191
Hey, weren't you off hours ago?

604
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:27,648
Yeah.

605
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,494
You've been working a lot

606
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:30,863
since you got back.

607
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,897
You okay?

608
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,987
Yeah, Doug, I'm fine.

609
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,522
I'm going to go home
and sleep all day.

610
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:36,490
See you.

611
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:37,658
Okay.

612
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,027
Only a couple of
mild contractions.

613
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:41,428
Is that okay?

614
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,130
Less than six an hour is okay.

615
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,698
Is this your first pregnancy?

616
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,699
Yes.

617
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,567
You don't by any
chance happen to know

618
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,769
your blood type, do you?

619
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,048
Mm-hmm. It's A-negative.

620
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,138
And who's your OB?

621
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:52,139
Dr. Coburn.

622
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:53,285
Whoo. That stings.

623
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:54,258
Sorry.

624
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,777
So, when are you due?

625
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:57,878
June 15.

626
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:01,482
I'm going to be a
caboose by then.

627
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:03,784
You got any kids?

628
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,903
No, I don't.

629
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,890
You and your husband
must be very excited.

630
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,576
It's just me and the baby.

631
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,212
I'm fine with it.

632
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,698
The father, he
just be howling...

633
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,834
Trying to chew his leg
off like a trapped coyote.

634
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,320
I know the type.

635
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,882
Plenty of them around.

636
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:26,206
Wrapped up in themselves
like they're God's gift.

637
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:29,376
I definitely know the type.

638
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:32,880
Yep, there they are...
Two wedding rings.

639
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,149
He hates the idea of
Mommy getting married.

640
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:37,318
It's pretty normal at his age.

641
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:38,747
They should pass
in a day or two.

642
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,121
You mean we got to wait
till he poops them out?

643
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:41,905
Mm-hmm.

644
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,151
Dr. Weaver,

645
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,575
we need you out here.

646
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,614
We got a handicapped
guy jaywalking on Michigan.

647
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,249
Actually, he was jay-wheeling.

648
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,317
Handicapped, huh?

649
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,663
Oh, is that wrong now?

650
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,197
Back there's his wheelchair.

651
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,232
Car hit it.

652
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,489
Threw him 15 feet.

653
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,069
Obvious head, right
chest and shoulder trauma.

654
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,125
BP's 100/60.

655
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,427
Pulse is only 15, and GCS is 12.

656
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,547
So, what's the new way
of saying "handicapped"?

657
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:07,948
Try "person with a disability."

658
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:08,983
Okay.

659
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,996
Okay, everybody
got him? Let's go.

660
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,319
What's your name, sir?

661
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,549
Floor it, sister,
I'm breaking loose.

662
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,240
Pupils are sluggish.

663
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,575
Where are you injured, sir?

664
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,910
Everywhere. Just get off of me!

665
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,728
How much have you had to drink?

666
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,080
Oh, a couple of beers.

667
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,148
BP's only 90/50.

668
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,332
Pulse is 60 and thready.

669
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,445
He's high on something.

670
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:28,469
Cross table c-spine,
CBC, chem seven,

671
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:29,548
type and cross for four.

672
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:31,672
Also, get a blood
alcohol and a tox screen.

673
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,885
You want to pump his stomach
now or wait for the next dose?

674
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,644
No, we can roll him
on his side if he vomits.

675
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,645
Give me that Ewald.

676
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,396
Don't put that snake on me!

677
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,098
Get some soft restraints.

678
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,099
No snakes!

679
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,667
Okay, swallow when you feel this

680
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,753
at the back of your throat.

681
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:46,886
There you go.

682
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,888
What's that for?

683
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,146
I spoke with Dr. Coburn.

684
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,498
She agrees we should
do a Kleihauer-Betke test.

685
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:58,899
You mean stick
me with that needle?

686
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,050
You have A-negative blood,

687
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,385
which means you're RH-negative.

688
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,387
Do you know the
father's blood type?

689
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,655
No.

690
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,490
If he's RH-positive,
the baby can be, too.

691
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,092
That can cause a condition
called erythroblastosis fetalis.

692
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,368
Sounds bad.

693
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,357
If this test is positive,
we'll give you RhoGAM.

694
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,530
It'll protect the baby.

695
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,450
Wait, wait, wait, time out.

696
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:18,786
What if the father has
negative whatever?

697
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,320
Then you don't need the test.

698
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,725
I just don't think
I can bother him.

699
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,660
It's worth a phone call.

700
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,206
All you're asking
for is his blood type.

701
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,930
It's not like you're asking

702
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,398
for his love and support.

703
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,400
Yeah, well, he...

704
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,603
actually, he works
here in this hospital.

705
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,088
Which department?

706
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,489
He's a doctor.

707
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,685
We have a lot of doctors.

708
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,175
His name is Peter Benton.

709
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,415
Oh.

710
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,201
So, Dr. Smith has never seen
a patient named Chenevert?

711
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,136
Okay, thank you.

712
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,250
Still busy with that
chili fry woman?

713
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,541
You should be working
on your jump shot.

714
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,009
I'm trying to track down

715
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,711
a cardiologist named Smith

716
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,012
who saw her years ago.

717
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,581
Do you know how many Smiths

718
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,882
there are in Chicago?

719
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,461
Sounds like a big can of worms.

720
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,186
Hi, this is Dr. John Carter
from County General ER.

721
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,545
Malik, that group's getting
a little too big for chairs.

722
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,281
Could you ask them to
go to the waiting room?

723
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,482
Is there a problem?

724
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,985
No. Not a problem at all.

725
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,588
Dad... Where have you been?

726
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:30,757
When's Ruth coming?

727
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,626
I need you to wait in
the lounge, sweetheart.

728
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,694
Dad!

729
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,730
Come on.

730
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:37,998
Is everything okay?

731
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:40,334
I thought you were going
to draw me a picture.

732
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,580
Are you not taking
care of Grandma

733
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:44,716
because you and
Mom are divorced?

734
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,805
Of course not.

735
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,875
Rachel, the doctor
where Grandma lives

736
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,509
is taking care of her

737
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,879
just like I'd take care
of the doctor's family

738
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:53,046
if they were here.

739
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:54,381
Oh.

740
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,549
Excuse me, Mark.

741
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:57,895
Paramedics are
pulling in with a GSW.

742
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,404
What's a GSW?

743
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,555
I'll let you know
when Ruth is coming.

744
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:03,407
Kid they're bringing in

745
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,208
is from Woodlawn Park.

746
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,621
He's a center on
the basketball team.

747
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:06,905
He was shot coming
out of practice.

748
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,706
This could be payback
for Kenny Long.

749
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,713
We've got a drive-by shooting.

750
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,914
16-year-old, hit twice.

751
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,599
Left chest, right thigh.

752
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:13,600
BP's down to 60. Pulse 150.

753
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:14,762
Any witnesses?

754
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,298
Don't know. Cops
are right behind me.

755
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,237
O2 at 15 liters.

756
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,473
Two large-bore IVs,
a liter of saline's in.

757
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,798
Seven point five.

758
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,344
I'll call radiology
for a portable.

759
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,334
Start a central line.

760
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,302
First unit O-neg's in.

761
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,269
Need any help?

762
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,104
Check the thigh wound.

763
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,340
This guy's from Woodlawn Park?

764
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,858
Yep. He's the starting center.

765
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,742
The baby-sitter's on the line.

766
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,376
Should she call back?

767
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,589
No. Let me have the phone.

768
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:41,495
Where's he hit?

769
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,746
Hi. Can you pick up Rachel

770
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,813
at the hospital?

771
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,127
Left chest, right thigh.

772
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,794
How about tomorrow after school?

773
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,019
How many units do you
want cross-matched?

774
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,099
Okay, great. We'll
work it out later.

775
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,039
Six. I'm in.

776
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,927
BP's coming up, 90/50.

777
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,891
All right, we got a
handle on him now.

778
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,032
Doyle, how about
putting in a chest tube?

779
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,100
Sure. 32 French.

780
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,146
So, this was payback

781
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,797
for the kid from the other team?

782
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:08,422
I have no idea.

783
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,879
Your tox screen
came back positive

784
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,547
for opiates, cocaine, Benzos,

785
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,850
plus your alcohol level's
three times the legal limit.

786
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,913
You going to bust me on a WUI...

787
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,498
Wheeling under the influence?

788
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,439
I'm just saying
it's a lot of drugs.

789
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,285
I'm a cripple. I'm
in a lot of pain.

790
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:28,954
He's been asking for Demerol.

791
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:30,978
Looks like you've
got a T-4 deficit

792
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:32,179
from a gunshot wound?

793
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:33,713
About what, two years ago?

794
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,131
You the geek expert?

795
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,052
You stick with your rehab?

796
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,273
Are you getting
physical therapy?

797
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,846
I know it's a hard transition,
but nothing comes easy.

798
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,009
Oh, not that crap!

799
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,299
"You got to rise above"

800
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,129
and for what... so I can try out

801
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,563
for the Gimp Olympics?

802
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,865
Yeah, I wasn't
thinking that far ahead.

803
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,100
How about I just
get you into detox?

804
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,124
I'm not interested.

805
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,936
Once you're dried out,
you can get back in rehab.

806
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,670
Just get me
something for the pain!

807
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,178
All right?

808
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,515
There it is.

809
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,616
Bovie that one.

810
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,151
How many units has he had?

811
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:13,065
12. Two are fresh frozen plasma.

812
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:15,489
I doubt he'll ever
play basketball again.

813
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,669
Aah, he'll be lucky if he lives.

814
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,204
We'll have to resect this lung.

815
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,872
Dr. Benton, I
need to talk to you.

816
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,341
I'm in the middle of surgery.

817
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:24,064
I can see that. What is it?

818
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,643
I need to talk
to you in private.

819
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,633
Can't it wait?

820
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,779
I wouldn't have
changed into scrubs

821
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:28,880
and come in here
if it could wait.

822
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,704
Go ahead.

823
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,473
We'll be okay for a few minutes.

824
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,664
What is it?

825
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,410
Do you know your
blood type, Peter?

826
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,533
No. Why?

827
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,808
Carla Reece is in the ER.

828
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,303
Is she okay?

829
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,618
She had a minor TC, ankle sprain

830
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:50,685
and minor lacs.

831
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,942
She's Rh-negative

832
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,177
and Coburn's worried
about Rh incompatibility.

833
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,245
What about a KB?

834
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,563
She refuses.

835
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,932
Yeah. She's afraid of needles.

836
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,578
Yeah, so I need
your blood for typing.

837
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:02,380
I can get somebody
else to draw it.

838
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,171
No, no, no. That's fine.

839
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,605
You can do it.

840
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,752
Okay, how about the locker room?

841
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:10,077
Yeah.

842
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,178
Good breath sounds.

843
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,724
Got this one under control.

844
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:15,582
Drained about 300cc's,
but the bleeding's stopped.

845
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:18,018
Any word from the OR on
the other basketball casualty?

846
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,769
Kenny Law's still in surgery.

847
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,722
Think they'll cancel the
championship game?

848
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:23,473
Both teams lost their starter.

849
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,141
I hope they call it

850
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,758
before somebody else gets hurt.

851
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:28,628
Yeah, I'm waiting for the
next kid to be wheeled in.

852
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:30,264
All right, this guy's stable.

853
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,799
Haleh, call the OR
and get him transported.

854
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,191
Hey.

855
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,726
Family allowed to
use this machine?

856
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,361
The one in the
waiting room's broken.

857
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,473
Of course.

858
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,442
How's your brother
doing in surgery?

859
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,498
I don't know.

860
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,077
Would you like me to call up,

861
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,546
see what I can find out?

862
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,636
You could do that.

863
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,716
Listen, uh, I have
some information

864
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,384
about your brother's shooting

865
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,852
I didn't give you earlier.

866
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,370
Apparently, it was drug-related

867
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:00,906
and involved the other victim.

868
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,957
Your brother was an
innocent bystander.

869
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,765
Okay.

870
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,701
A Woodlawn Park student
was just shot in a drive-by.

871
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:09,869
So?

872
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,582
There's no need for retaliation.

873
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,618
Your brother was
not being targeted.

874
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:16,410
You accusing me of
having that white boy shot?!

875
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,006
No, no. I'm just
giving you information

876
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,207
in case you know anybody

877
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,658
who's thinking about revenge.

878
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:23,250
Who the hell you
think you're talking to?!

879
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,419
You don't know my 'hood,
and you don't know me!

880
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,386
Oh, yeah?

881
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:27,566
Well, I know about
the gunshot victims

882
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,388
who come in here every day

883
00:28:28,424 --> 00:28:29,389
one after another.

884
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:31,024
And you think you know my life?!

885
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:32,153
It's my life, too!

886
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,022
I see these kids dying
in here every day!

887
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,612
And you think I can stop that?!

888
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,613
Man, what do you know?

889
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,048
That's not your brother in there

890
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,166
with his blood spilled.

891
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,268
It's not your brother
lying on that table!

892
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,669
You don't know a damn thing,

893
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:44,254
so why don't you back off

894
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,373
and stay out my face?

895
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:51,845
I found Dr. Smith...
Yancey Smith...

896
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,248
And I got him to dig
out one of your old EKGs

897
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:56,550
and it was normal.

898
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:57,729
Ducky.

899
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:59,118
Well, maybe not so ducky.

900
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,021
That means that there's
been a change in your EKG,

901
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:04,052
which could signal
a heart problem.

902
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,642
All from chili fries?

903
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,411
A lifetime of chili fries maybe.

904
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,461
But I feel better.

905
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,191
And this thing's
getting on my nerves.

906
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,378
You know, you feel better
because of the nitro patch.

907
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:14,713
So why don't you behave
yourself and let the tech do her job?

908
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:16,381
I'm going to come back

909
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:17,515
and check on you

910
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,473
after I've looked
at your enzymes.

911
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,551
Don't forget me.

912
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:21,641
How could I?

913
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,839
So, uh, did she say

914
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,941
she wanted me to
come by and see her?

915
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,098
She didn't say that.

916
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,878
Did she say she <i>didn't</i> want me

917
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,168
to come by and see her?

918
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,735
She didn't say that either.

919
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,638
Okay.

920
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,441
I've got to go scrub in again.

921
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,910
Uh, Peter.

922
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,178
Yeah?

923
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,749
Thanks.

924
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,118
Sure.

925
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,857
Dr. Ross?

926
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,003
Yeah?

927
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,492
Collision at second base.

928
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,229
Uh-oh. You must have
got hit pretty hard, huh?

929
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,596
It's the All-Star League.

930
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,810
Get punched in the eye?

931
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,300
Landed on me with his elbow.

932
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,113
All right, let's
get orbital films

933
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,170
on that eye and set
me up for suturing.

934
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,250
Still here.

935
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,472
Hey, you on hold?

936
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,842
I just called the
cardiology consult for Babs.

937
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:14,278
They're getting her old
records out of storage.

938
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,445
Babs?

939
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,814
Are you on with the OR?

940
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,381
Tell them we're still waiting

941
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,583
to transport that kid
from Woodlawn Park.

942
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,785
Okay, thanks, Shirley.

943
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,753
Yeah, we're still waiting
for the transfer GSW.

944
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,029
Mark, I got a question for you.

945
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,190
Just a sec.

946
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,925
Malik, can you
tell the Law family

947
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,660
that there's still no word,
that Kenny's still in surgery?

948
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,095
They're in the waiting room.

949
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,208
Yeah, I know where they are.

950
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:34,898
I'd like them to have an update.

951
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,399
Yeah, okay.

952
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,736
There's this guy I
want to get into detox,

953
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,916
but he's kind of a hard sell.

954
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,239
He's angry and defensive

955
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,252
so it's hard for
him to ask for help.

956
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,386
Plus he's uninsured.

957
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,910
So he doesn't
want to be admitted

958
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,278
and he can't pay if he is?

959
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,914
That would be the "glass
is half-empty" viewpoint.

960
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,449
Well, it's Simonson's program.

961
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,683
His thing is commitment.

962
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,085
So you just have to assure him

963
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,486
that he's not wasting a bed

964
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,121
on someone who's not motivated.

965
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,301
That is a hard sell.

966
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,725
Mark, kid in trauma's
bradying down.

967
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,727
Carter, time to play surgeon.

968
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,863
Jerry, if that
cardiologist comes down,

969
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:07,576
tell him I'm looking for him.

970
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,627
He's been stable waiting for OR.

971
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:10,361
Then blood started
pouring out of his chest tube.

972
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:11,752
Carter, help me crack him.

973
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:12,787
Rib spreader.

974
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:13,865
Suction's ready.

975
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:14,988
Blood's here.

976
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:16,823
Put two units

977
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:18,074
on the rapid infuser.

978
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,210
I'll incise the
pericardium. Metz.

979
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,356
Look at that.

980
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,374
That is a bullet
hole, right atrium.

981
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,675
I don't think we're going
to be able to clamp it.

982
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,866
No, too much
tissue's blown away.

983
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,436
I'll tie in a Foley.

984
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,604
We'll get tamponade
and a blood port.

985
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,623
Give it a try.

986
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,307
4-0 Prolene, and, uh...

987
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:35,369
spike a unit

988
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,409
of O-neg.

989
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,627
Carter's on fire.

990
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,647
He's better with his
scalpel than his lay-up.

991
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,251
Yes, Dr. Simonson,
I know beds are tight,

992
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:47,554
but the patient's
brush with death

993
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:50,223
has given us a
window of opportunity...

994
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:54,161
No, I assure you, Mr. Brown
is highly motivated to change.

995
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:56,329
Okay, great.

996
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:57,798
I'll send him right up.

997
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,132
Thank you.

998
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,635
Now if you can just
sell it to the patient.

999
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,742
I'm seeing an
idioventricular rhythm.

1000
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,444
We need another mig of epi.

1001
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,445
Faint pulse.

1002
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,580
Heart rate's picking up.

1003
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,059
Okay, let's get him
ready to move up.

1004
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,395
You guys are keeping us
busy today... what have you got?

1005
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:19,886
A candidate for
a pericardial patch

1006
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:22,322
thanks to your
intern's good save.

1007
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,508
How's the basketball
player doing?

1008
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:25,942
First guy we sent up.

1009
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,261
Died on the table
20 minutes ago.

1010
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:29,395
Okay, let's move him.

1011
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,006
Sorry to keep you in
the ER all day, Carter.

1012
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,586
It's okay, I've actually
had a good day.

1013
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,642
Want to scrub in?

1014
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:43,721
No, thanks.

1015
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:45,122
I've got a surgical consult

1016
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:46,190
I should stick with.

1017
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,581
Okay. Slick piece of work.

1018
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,167
Hey.

1019
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,801
I thought you forgot about us.

1020
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,004
Sorry, I had an emergency
with another patient.

1021
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,238
All right,

1022
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,617
so how'd you guys get hurt?

1023
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,475
Tommy broke up a double play.

1024
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,110
The kid fell on top of him.

1025
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,378
The pictures look okay.

1026
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,991
That wasn't a slide,
Pelosi, it was a mugging.

1027
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,214
That was a clean, hard slide.

1028
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,327
All right, Mr. McDonald...

1029
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,545
Three feet outside
the base path?

1030
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,085
Your kid elbowed
mine on purpose.

1031
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,831
Guys, can I talk to
you outside real quick?

1032
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,605
If he can't take a hit,

1033
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:14,441
he shouldn't be in the league!

1034
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:15,942
Hey, he can take a hit.

1035
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,844
Excuse us, fellas.

1036
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,527
You got a couple of great kids

1037
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:23,761
who want to play ball.

1038
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:26,152
Why don't you let them
keep it on the field?

1039
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:28,288
All right, guys.

1040
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:29,822
Let me see this eye.

1041
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:31,491
Drop that thing down.

1042
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,871
Hey, Malik, can you join me?

1043
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:34,995
What for?

1044
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,207
Kenny Law died.

1045
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,175
I have to go tell his family.

1046
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:40,867
Well, if you're scared,
you should call security.

1047
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:42,102
I'm a nurse.

1048
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:55,649
Mr. Law...

1049
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:58,018
word just came down from the OR.

1050
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:00,586
I'm sorry to say
it's not good news.

1051
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,372
What is it?

1052
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:06,576
The surgeons weren't
able to repair the damage

1053
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,112
in time.

1054
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,580
They, uh...

1055
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,182
Is he dead?

1056
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:16,898
They were unable

1057
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,282
to save your brother's life.

1058
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:00,547
When did she start
having contractions?

1059
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:02,226
Right before
Dr. Coburn got here.

1060
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,628
It's way too early for this.

1061
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:04,662
Father's blood type?

1062
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,852
Yeah. He's Rh-negative.

1063
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:07,220
Good, no Rh incompatibility.

1064
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,895
I'm going to
ultrasound you in OB,

1065
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,824
but first we have
to stop your labor.

1066
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:11,825
How?

1067
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,359
We'll start with an IV drip

1068
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:14,561
of mag sulfate.

1069
00:35:14,596 --> 00:35:16,062
Oh, God, no IV.

1070
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:17,208
It's okay, Carla.

1071
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:18,531
It's okay, I'll do it.

1072
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,266
It's all right.

1073
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,514
If you're not going to
give me a pain shot,

1074
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,749
then I got no more
business here!

1075
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:25,939
Do you know how hard it is

1076
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:27,885
to get somebody without
insurance into the detox program?

1077
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,570
I don't give a rat's ass.

1078
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,943
Look, your chair is messed up.

1079
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,212
I'll have maintenance fix it

1080
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:33,613
while you're in the hospital.

1081
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:34,814
Give it 48 hours.

1082
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,144
How 'bout I give it no hours?

1083
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:36,882
I'm out of here.

1084
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,185
Should I write up an AMA form?

1085
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,269
No. Hold on.

1086
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,904
I'll make you a deal.

1087
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,072
Demerol 100...

1088
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,224
Phenergan 50.

1089
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,626
It's yours if you'll
check into detox.

1090
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:47,705
Dr. Weaver?

1091
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,929
Just give it a couple of days.

1092
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:52,698
Give yourself a chance
to get your life together.

1093
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,767
You trying to bribe me?

1094
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:56,186
Do you want it?

1095
00:35:58,173 --> 00:35:59,489
Okay.

1096
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,475
Okay. Let's do it your way, Doc.

1097
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,144
Just give it a couple of days.

1098
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,147
Okay, Mr. Brown...

1099
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:09,315
It's a deal.

1100
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,318
<i>I won't sneak up on you.</i>

1101
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:13,720
I'll tell you
everything I'm doing.

1102
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,723
Just close your
eyes and try to relax.

1103
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,357
Relax.

1104
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,026
Okay.

1105
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,906
It's already a little numb

1106
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,129
from the topical.

1107
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:25,632
Now I'm going to use
some local anesthesia

1108
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,344
with bicarb so it won't sting.

1109
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:30,202
Take some nice, slow
breaths and think of a place

1110
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:32,519
you'd really like
to be right now.

1111
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,026
Good.

1112
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,812
Just let yourself float.

1113
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,635
You want to tell
me where you are?

1114
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,971
I can't.

1115
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,040
It's X-rated.

1116
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,225
Never mind.

1117
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,345
Just keep it to yourself, then.

1118
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,416
Okay.

1119
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,017
It's in.

1120
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,118
It is?

1121
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,197
Mm-hmm.

1122
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,621
Really?

1123
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,723
Oh, girl, you got the touch.

1124
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:11,945
You sure you don't mind?

1125
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,781
Because if she doesn't
eat by 6:00, she gets cranky.

1126
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,683
I'll be over as soon as I can.

1127
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:19,085
Hey, it's macaroni night
at Magoo's. I never miss it.

1128
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,553
Is that okay with you?

1129
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:21,554
Yeah.

1130
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,555
Okay, good.

1131
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:23,656
Remember: no dessert

1132
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:26,258
unless you eat one
green vegetable.

1133
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:27,560
I know.

1134
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:28,795
Okay.

1135
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,441
My baby.

1136
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,198
He was my baby.

1137
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,121
Why is that lady sad?

1138
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:41,258
Well, she's sad
because her son died.

1139
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,759
Why'd he die?

1140
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,960
He was shot.

1141
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,096
Did you take care of him

1142
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,799
like Grandma's doctors
are taking care of her?

1143
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,001
Sure he did.

1144
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,105
Look, Grandma is going
to be just fine, okay?

1145
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,274
Okay.

1146
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,941
Get out of here. Go eat.

1147
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,110
Hey, last one to
touch Magoo's door

1148
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,624
has to eat two green veggies.

1149
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:05,693
I need your John Hancock.

1150
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,351
Haleh, when, uh,
Kenny Law came in here,

1151
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:12,722
do you think I made
racist assumptions?

1152
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,458
Black folks see
the world one way;

1153
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,171
white folks see it another.

1154
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,394
All white people?

1155
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,629
When something happens,

1156
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,966
you say it's got
nothing to do with race,

1157
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,668
but for us, it's always
got to do with race.

1158
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,837
Can I have my pen back?

1159
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,333
Carter needs you in here.

1160
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:30,567
His patient's crashing.

1161
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:31,557
What patient?

1162
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:34,021
You know, that chili fry lady.

1163
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,973
Let's get her in Trendelenburg!

1164
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,908
She's having multifocal PVCs.

1165
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:38,932
What's going on?

1166
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:40,278
Echo showed cardiomyopathy

1167
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:41,779
with wall motion abnormality.

1168
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,314
Enzymes confirmed acute MI.

1169
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:45,049
She was having a heart attack?

1170
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,408
Yeah. She was on her way
to the cath lab for angioplasty.

1171
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:49,825
I don't hear a BP.

1172
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,155
Lidocaine 100 IV
push, start a drip at two.

1173
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:53,312
I lost her pulse.

1174
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:54,480
Ah, damn! Bag her.

1175
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:55,543
She's in fib.

1176
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,660
Charge to 200.

1177
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:58,667
Okay. Hands off.

1178
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:01,571
Normal sinus rhythm.

1179
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,717
Got a carotid pulse.

1180
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,981
Check a BP.

1181
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,409
15 liters O2 by mask.

1182
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,212
Get a gas.

1183
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,646
That was close.

1184
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,383
BP's back... 100 systolic.

1185
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,448
Fundal placenta, no abruption.

1186
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:18,871
We're in good shape.

1187
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:20,205
Is it a boy or a girl?

1188
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,219
Well, I haven't
seen a penis yet,

1189
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:24,488
but sometimes
boys are a little shy.

1190
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:27,046
Are you still nauseated
from the mag sulfate?

1191
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,314
Uh-uh.

1192
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:30,316
Good, because your
contractions have stopped.

1193
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,317
Biophysical profile?

1194
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:32,668
Four parameters.

1195
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,638
Breathing, tone, movement...

1196
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,173
And amount of amniotic fluid.

1197
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,336
Zero to two points each.

1198
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,593
This one's a six,

1199
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,611
so we're okay.

1200
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:42,607
Oh, hello.

1201
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:43,946
There it is.

1202
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,581
Turtle sign.

1203
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,750
It's a boy.

1204
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,352
That little thing?

1205
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,620
They grow.

1206
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,639
Not as much as
they'd like to think.

1207
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,443
Oh...

1208
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,863
I'm having a little boy.

1209
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:06,619
An acute MI and I thought
she was a drugged-out Gomer.

1210
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,632
Aah, worked out okay in the end.

1211
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,967
How you feeling, Babs?

1212
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,058
What?

1213
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,326
Not too great.

1214
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,006
Well, you're going to be fine,

1215
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,329
thanks to Dr. Carter.

1216
00:40:16,364 --> 00:40:19,999
Damn. I never should have
smoked that crack, huh?

1217
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,425
We've got the
bleeding under control.

1218
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,926
Pressure's holding at 90.

1219
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,262
Six units are in.

1220
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,597
I've dissected off
the femorals for you.

1221
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,899
Not bad for a couple
of general surgeons.

1222
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,613
Okay, we'll take it from here.

1223
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,236
Arterial and venous cannula.

1224
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,571
Let's get the hoses up.

1225
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,883
Well, at least we saved

1226
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,552
one of the basketball players.

1227
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,310
It was a pleasure working
with you today, Peter.

1228
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,345
Likewise.

1229
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,358
I know you have your heart set

1230
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:52,014
on a high-end specialty, Peter,

1231
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,183
but I've got an
opening on my team

1232
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,951
for a good general surgeon.

1233
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:59,121
Not flashy, but we
still have a lot of fun.

1234
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,593
It's not ambition, Peter.

1235
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,395
It's about healing people.

1236
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,167
Okay, just let me know
if you change your mind.

1237
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,436
Dr. Hicks?

1238
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,072
I'd be honored.

1239
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,408
Good.

1240
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:20,677
What?

1241
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:25,014
Well, it means you'll be
working with Carter again.

1242
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,516
He'll love it.

1243
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,388
I thought you'd gone home.

1244
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,756
Carter wants a rematch.

1245
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,024
Not now.

1246
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,827
Come on, now. The
honor of the ER is at stake.

1247
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,829
Uh, Rachel's over
at Doc's with Doyle

1248
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:42,165
and I thought I'd
go check in on them.

1249
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,178
All right, look, you
got to help me out,

1250
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,980
because I'm still
nursing a bad leg

1251
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,137
and I don't think I can
take him by myself.

1252
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,772
All right, ten minutes, no more.

1253
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,052
Then you're on your own.

1254
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:51,807
You know what?

1255
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,654
I called up the OR
about Kenny Law.

1256
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,643
Mm-hmm.

1257
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,290
Whether my delay in diagnosing

1258
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,959
would have made a difference.

1259
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,282
And what'd they say?

1260
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,728
There's no way of knowing.

1261
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,717
Yeah.

1262
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,086
But you're right.

1263
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,721
I do make assumptions
about patients, about race.

1264
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,501
I try not to act on them.

1265
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,070
You know, I try to act

1266
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:11,527
the way I'd like
the world to be...

1267
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,440
Not the way it is or I am.

1268
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,299
Mark, you're the least
cynical ER doc I know.

1269
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,036
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

1270
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,037
Going home, Doc.

1271
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,250
No. You can't leave.

1272
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,040
Sure I can. I've signed out.

1273
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,376
They're expecting
you up in Detox.

1274
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,378
We made a deal!

1275
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:29,913
Yeah, well...

1276
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,614
never trust a junkie.

1277
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,550
He'll be back.

1278
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,252
Yeah, looking for drugs.

1279
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:39,088
And the nurses will
have to deal with him.

1280
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:47,191
He's going to miss again.

1281
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:48,181
And he scores.

1282
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:49,360
It was a lay-up!

1283
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:50,527
Here. Let's go.

1284
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:51,517
Eyes are closed.

1285
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:52,518
Malik!

1286
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:53,713
Hey, come on.

1287
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,827
You were right
to call me on that.

1288
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:03,246
A little two-on-two?

1289
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,492
Come on, Malik,
let's finish 'em off.

1290
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,560
Come on, Malik!

1291
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,500
Okay, just play ball, man.

1292
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,654
Down low.

1293
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,555
Let's go.

1294
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,191
Aah!

1295
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:19,528
I broke his heart.

1296
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,230
Good hands... let's go.
