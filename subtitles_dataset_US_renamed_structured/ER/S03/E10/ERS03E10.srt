00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,681
Hi.

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,894
Hi. I was starting to think

12
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,062
you weren't coming.

13
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,869
Dr. Angelo's office
is really backed up.

14
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:54,886
What did she say?

15
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,388
The tests no longer detect

16
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:57,489
any viral load.

17
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,707
I guess the drug
cocktail is working.

18
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:01,226
Jeanie, that is great news.

19
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,695
Yeah. Maybe I don't
have to get a lawyer now.

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,730
Maybe the hospital

21
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,381
will let it go.

22
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,399
No, I-I know.

23
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,834
It's still transmittable.

24
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,097
That doesn't mean the
hospital can keep you

25
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,538
shuffling papers for
the rest of your career.

26
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,540
If I still have a career.

27
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:20,978
I have a meeting with Dr. Greene
and Dr. Anspaugh in ten minutes

28
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,748
and I, for one, think
you're too valuable

29
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,684
to rubber-stamp admits

30
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,635
all day long.

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,687
Thanks. This is on me.

32
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,105
No matter what
happens in there, Jeanie

33
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,457
this is great news.

34
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,350
Rode your sled to
work, Dr. Greene?

35
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:45,020
Uh, no. It's a Christmas
present for my daughter.

36
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,166
That's it?

37
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,367
You remember sliding down
those snow-covered bluffs

38
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:50,725
with the cold wind
flying through your hair?

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,728
We didn't have too many
snow-covered bluffs in Atlanta.

40
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,063
We did in Grand Rapids.

41
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,232
Coasted right through
rush-hour traffic

42
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,333
got hit by a car...

43
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,335
Didn't they have
one of those dollies

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,336
that wet itself or something?

45
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,216
You know, every toy
that I saw in the store

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,451
had some tie-in to a
TV show or a movie

47
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,687
or something I've
been too busy to see.

48
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,989
I mean, I don't know
what Duke Nukem was

49
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,524
but he looked pretty nasty.

50
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,514
You made a good
choice with the sled.

51
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,850
Hey, you look awful.

52
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,251
How long you been on?

53
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,685
Since yesterday morning.

54
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,686
ER

55
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,966
Mark, you ready?

56
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,323
Uh, yeah. Morning, Kerry.

57
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,523
I just got to change.

58
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,859
It's for you, Dennis.

59
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,461
Is it Benton trying to
reach out and touch me?

60
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:28,396
It's a lady.

61
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,699
Hey, Monique.

62
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,535
You at the airport?

63
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,038
Was it canceled?

64
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,408
Come on. I thought we'd
been through this already.

65
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,850
You want the two
of us to decide?

66
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,797
I'm sure none of us in this room

67
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,532
would want anyone on our team

68
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,473
endangering patients in any way.

69
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,186
As attendings, you're closest

70
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,338
to the everyday
workings of the ER.

71
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:00,223
So, there<i> is</i> no
hospital-wide policy.

72
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,981
Legal advises we handle it
department by department.

73
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,266
So if we get sued

74
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,818
it's the individual attending's
butt that's on the line?

75
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,698
Let me remind you, Doctor Greene,
if we were aware that there was

76
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,850
an HIV-Positive health
care worker here at County

77
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:13,475
and the public got wind
of it, started filing suits

78
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,455
all of our butts
would be on the line.

79
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,240
HIV-Positive
workers can be fired

80
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,481
because the hospital
doesn't want to be sued?

81
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:20,816
No. In Illinois

82
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,884
it's forbidden to
fire any employee

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,886
because they're HIV-Positive.

84
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:26,733
In theory, but have
been forced to quit.

85
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,724
Nobody's forcing
anybody to quit.

86
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,203
What about restricting
their duties to the point where

87
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,777
they're not working
within the job description?

88
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,207
I wouldn't presume

89
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,448
to tell you two how
to run your department

90
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,551
but, uh, let me give you an
idea of the current thinking.

91
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,764
These are the CDC findings

92
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,923
Illinois State law and
pending legal cases

93
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,859
and various NIH
and journal reports.

94
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,972
Now, look, I know
you two have had

95
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,808
your differences in the past.

96
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,050
Do you think you can work
together and solve this?

97
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,219
Absolutely.

98
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,890
Sure.

99
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,210
Can you put on the card

100
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,456
"Merry Christmas,
Mom. Love, Doug"?

101
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,823
And could you make
that a rush order?

102
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:00,348
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, what
is up with that shower, man?

103
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,328
I nearly froze my
ass off this morning.

104
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,896
Did you hear that opera
coming through the pipes?

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,887
<i>Il figaro?</i> Mrs. Needlebaum.

106
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,588
45 Minutes of
sing-a-long with Pavarotti

107
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,624
and she uses up all the
hot water in the building.

108
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:10,836
You get any sleep last night?

109
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,028
No. I had 15 admits.

110
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,307
Fifteen? Wow.

111
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:15,563
Only ten more hours

112
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,243
and then Yuletide cheer
with the Carter family.

113
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,644
Oh, I feel bad subjecting you

114
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,213
and your girlfriend
to my family.

115
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,569
It's not going to happen.

116
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,071
Monique isn't coming.

117
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,283
Not at all?

118
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:25,473
No. She said she had to stay

119
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,142
in Baton Rouge... work.

120
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:30,945
Aw, damn. I thought you
guys worked it out, too.

121
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,191
It's her loss, you know?

122
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,759
I'll probably be a little late
with all these new patients.

123
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:34,749
Well, no worries.

124
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:35,895
Things don't really
get interesting

125
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,763
till my Uncle Branch
starts downing the bourbon.

126
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,598
Hey, Carter? You got
your picks for the bowl pool?

127
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,534
Yeah. Right here. How
much is it? Five bucks?

128
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:42,857
Twenty,<i> Mijo.</i>

129
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,692
$20? That's highway robbery.

130
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:45,871
How much is in the pot?

131
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,128
Almost $400.

132
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,297
You know, I'm with
you for Rose and Fiesta

133
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,932
but Cotton and Liberty Bowls...

134
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,367
You might want to
save your money.

135
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,313
Why is everyone standing around
while we're drowning in patients?

136
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:56,149
Hey, I'm on hold
with the florist.

137
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,638
Not anymore, you're not.

138
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,285
And a Merry
Christmas Eve to you.

139
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,753
Please don't talk to
me about Christmas.

140
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,222
At 5:00 am this morning, my mother
decided she had to start the Vareniki.

141
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,690
Are those little dumplings?

142
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:07,282
Yeah. She also picked the
pre-dawn hour to harass me

143
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:08,627
about dressing
for tonight's party.

144
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:09,695
So you going to wear

145
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,197
that sexy Ukrainian
shepherdess outfit?

146
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,288
It was either that or
endure hours of nagging.

147
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,957
Okay. Snowmobile foot
lac in the suture room

148
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,025
toddler eating
mistletoe in one...

149
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:19,561
We have a
slip-and-fall in three.

150
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:20,562
Watch out for Carol.

151
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:21,707
It's Christmas in the Ukraine.

152
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:22,975
Is her mom making
those little dumplings?

153
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,031
Don't ask.

154
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,311
Oh, hey, listen, I heard
Anspaugh is having

155
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:26,301
some kind of secret meeting.

156
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,013
Anything we should know about?

157
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:30,438
We have to hammer
out a departmental policy

158
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,640
on HIV-Positive
health care workers.

159
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,641
Anybody we know?

160
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,210
Really?

161
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,322
That son of a
bitch tried to kill me!

162
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:37,712
He ain't getting this goose

163
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:38,847
'cause<i> I</i> stuffed it.

164
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,693
Nurse, call my 83-year-old
grandmother in Tuscaloosa

165
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,117
to get her marinade recipe.

166
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,152
I sense a good one.

167
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,152
Oh, yeah. This gentleman...

168
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:45,253
a female illusionist.

169
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,532
Got into a
too-many-cooks argument

170
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,906
with his boyfriend
and things got heated...

171
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,737
and he<i> she</i> started
getting chest pains.

172
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:53,857
Girl, it was like an elephant
sitting on my chest... with attitude.

173
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,057
She was diaphoretic.

174
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,030
I never said that!

175
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,481
That means sweaty.

176
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,466
Oh... yeah.

177
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,735
It nearly ruined my gown.

178
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,137
Pressure 130/95.

179
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,638
Resps 25. Slightly tachy...

180
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,739
Tacky? Honey

181
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,491
this is a Bob Mackie original.

182
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,159
Okay, ready?

183
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,377
One, two, three.

184
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:10,378
Oh!

185
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:11,680
We need a chest X-ray

186
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,481
cardiac enzymes and an EKG.

187
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,382
Okay, Miss...

188
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,567
Understood.

189
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,513
I'm Miss Understood in the
Mighty Morphin Gender Changers.

190
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,404
We're at Club Cabaret
every Friday and Saturday.

191
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,884
Right. You've got to
give me the goose now

192
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,753
so we can attach an
EKG to your chest.

193
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,405
You want me to give
you my Christmas dinner?

194
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:26,394
Uh-uh, Miss Thang.

195
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:27,295
Give me the damn bird.

196
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,479
Where you gonna put it?

197
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,293
With the rest of your
personal belongings.

198
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,527
Well, it better, because
I don't want to wake up

199
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,251
and see you picking your teeth.

200
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,253
Are you on any medications?

201
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,905
Well, not besides the hormones.

202
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,740
Have you had chest pain before?

203
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:42,143
Well, when I get emotional...
around that time of the month.

204
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:43,161
Mm-hmm.

205
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,940
<i>I heard it was someone</i>

206
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,581
in this department that has it.

207
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,582
Who?

208
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:48,583
Uh, I don't know.

209
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,251
It's just the word
on the street.

210
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:52,387
A tech on three heard
it from a night guy

211
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,733
and now Weaver and Greene

212
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:55,668
get pulled into
some secret meeting.

213
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,258
See, that's how
rumors get started.

214
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,327
Ah. A rumor. Am I
missing a good one?

215
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,329
Attendings got
pulled into a meeting

216
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,409
but they won't say
what it was about.

217
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,066
It's about someone with HIV

218
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,801
but you didn't hear it from me.

219
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,214
Randi, can you do something

220
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,716
with these personal effects?

221
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,783
They're perishable.

222
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:11,773
Oh, good. Jeanie.

223
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,986
Head lac in exam two.

224
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,310
And, Connie, if
you're not too busy...

225
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,647
Some folks are
getting a little too fond

226
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:20,815
of the manager part
of nurse manager.

227
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:21,995
No kidding.

228
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:23,184
Carol? What?

229
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,554
Sorry, but Mark assigned
me to triage today.

230
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,621
Aw, come on, guys.

231
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:28,523
Why do I have to
push all the time?

232
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:30,358
I'm not your mother.

233
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,596
Uh, excuse me.

234
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:35,842
I need a doctor.

235
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,332
Okay, if you could go
back to the waiting room

236
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:39,500
and fill these out...

237
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,113
No, I'm looking for Dr. Ross.

238
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,336
For a medical problem?

239
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:43,449
Yeah.

240
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,574
You still need to
fill out these forms.

241
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,542
The waiting room's that way.

242
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:49,911
Hurt here?

243
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,912
Yeah. Okay.

244
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,126
Uh, we're going to need a facial

245
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,693
and a mandibular series

246
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:58,653
75 migs of Demerol
and Phenergan, IM.

247
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,733
Try and rustle up
an oral surgeon, too.

248
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,867
Good luck with that.

249
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:02,857
Oh, and, um...

250
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:04,570
give me a gram of Ancef IM.

251
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:07,195
You got it.

252
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,076
Um... are you
allergic to any meds?

253
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,151
Okay, I think that
your jaw is broken.

254
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,119
The antibiotics
will keep bacteria

255
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,254
from getting into
your bloodstream

256
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,656
at the fracture site.

257
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,892
But looking at
your chart here...

258
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,944
I guess you know the drill, huh?

259
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,665
Uh, "humerus fracture,
1993, nasal fracture, 1993

260
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,134
"Multiple visits
for sutures, 1994

261
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,020
"and your first broken jaw

262
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,271
was in December 1995."

263
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,467
I guess hubby thought

264
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,358
he'd go out with a bang

265
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,909
this year, too, huh?

266
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,460
It was an accident.

267
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,545
Yeah.

268
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,781
Your face got in
the way of his fist.

269
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,819
So, what if we change
the disclosure form

270
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,921
to include that people
might be treated

271
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,134
by an HIV-Positive
health care worker?

272
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,390
And start a witch hunt?

273
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,071
Well, we have to
inform the patients.

274
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,060
It's the law.

275
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,773
Okay, I take it you
haven't read this.

276
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,363
Americans with Disability Act?

277
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,632
I don't know. What?
Proposals, Addendums?

278
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,812
Here. Read this.

279
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,069
It states that you
can't disclose one risk

280
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,738
without disclosing equal risks.

281
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,739
Meaning?

282
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,073
Meaning that the patient

283
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,274
doesn't have a choice

284
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,287
of whether they're
treated by someone

285
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,655
with the flu or someone
with a hangover

286
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,557
a doc who had a
fight with his spouse

287
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,392
an intern who's
been on for days...

288
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,493
someone with HIV.

289
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,596
Yeah, and Illinois law
says not only can we not

290
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,587
prevent people from knowing
that they've been put at risk

291
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,922
but we have to tell them.

292
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,958
So you'd rather
follow the Illinois law

293
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,325
than the federal statute?

294
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,906
You know, because I'm
concerned doesn't mean

295
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,990
I'm some kind of bigot.

296
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,254
Your concern can't be extended

297
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,926
to prevent Jeanie
from earning a living.

298
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,950
Nobody's talking
about firing her

299
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,986
but we do have a
responsibility to our patients.

300
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:41,822
What about our
responsibility to Jeanie?

301
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,853
She's using
universal precautions.

302
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,060
Are you frightened
here, Mark? Is that it?

303
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:48,240
No, I'm trying to keep
us all from being sued.

304
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:49,464
You think I want to get sued?

305
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:52,116
But opening up
Jeanie's personal tragedy

306
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,696
to public scrutiny is
the surest way to invite

307
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,581
frivolous lawsuits
and mass hysteria.

308
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:56,905
So<i> we</i> break the law.

309
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,805
If we have to, yes.

310
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,857
I care about Jeanie, Kerry

311
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,091
but there is

312
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,811
a larger issue here
than your personal loyalty

313
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:04,913
to a friend.

314
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:07,265
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but we're swamped.

315
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,899
Whenever you're done.

316
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,383
We're done now.

317
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,120
Mark, we haven't
even made a dent.

318
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:15,072
Would you rather
jeopardize patient care further

319
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,876
by sitting here with
a traffic jam in triage?

320
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,240
Who's next? Ho-ho-ho.

321
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,341
Santa Claus?

322
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,365
No, that's who's
next, three hookers...

323
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,012
One with downstairs discharge

324
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,401
and two with frostbite.

325
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,447
I turned on the oven
for a few seconds

326
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,849
and the next thing I know,
he's the got the ribbon

327
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,239
hanging out of his mouth.

328
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,919
All I could get was the leaves.

329
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,743
How many berries
were on the stalk?

330
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:35,744
Maybe four?

331
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,011
And he wasn't vomiting?

332
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,379
No.

333
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,697
I know, buddy.

334
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,226
This mistletoe's good
stuff, but we got to get it out.

335
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,695
He's been asking for juice.

336
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,319
I didn't give him any
until you said it was okay.

337
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,088
Lily, why don't
you make a bottle

338
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,190
half juice, half
activated charcoal.

339
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,457
Coming right up.

340
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,998
Uh, Mrs. Romero, we're
going to give him a bottle

341
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,565
to absorb some of the toxins.

342
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,067
Okay?

343
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:01,602
All right, excuse me.

344
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:04,549
There you are, Ahmed.

345
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:06,852
I've been looking
for you at the shelter.

346
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,042
Come here.

347
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:09,043
How is he?

348
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:10,178
I changed his diaper

349
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,679
and there was blood in it.

350
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,092
In his stool or the urine?

351
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,081
I'm pretty sure

352
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,117
it was in the pee.

353
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,650
Listen, I got to
get him back home

354
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,186
before his mom gets back.

355
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,087
If she finds out I
brought him here

356
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,239
she'll kick me out.

357
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,252
You need to get
his mother here<i> now.</i>

358
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,709
Can't you just hook him up

359
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,277
with some pills or something?

360
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,224
No, I can't just hook
him up with some pills.

361
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,128
Get his mother here, all right?

362
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,229
Geez, what happened to him?

363
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,786
Guy's name is John Collins.

364
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,521
He was drunk and
sleeping it off in Grant Park.

365
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,190
Some kids thought it'd be fun

366
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,792
to pour lighter fluid on him

367
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,338
and play yule log.

368
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,773
He wouldn't let us
put oxygen on him.

369
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,131
Kept screaming about Nick.

370
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,355
He's got extensive 3rd
degree burns to the chest.

371
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,767
Who is this? The guy's dog.

372
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,125
Barked at a mounted cop
till he came to check it out.

373
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:00,127
Randi, can you
take care of this dog?

374
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,606
You take care of my Nick now.

375
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,881
You take care of my Nicky.

376
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,644
Take it easy, Mr. Collins.

377
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,234
We'll put him in a nice kennel

378
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:08,836
till you're back on your feet.

379
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,483
No! No kennel. He's all I got.

380
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:11,772
No I.V., No BP either.

381
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,285
He needs massive fluids.

382
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,076
You got to promise me, Doc.

383
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,143
You promise me now.

384
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,145
Mr. Collins, we're going
to take care of your dog.

385
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:19,392
Just be quiet for now.

386
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,626
On my count, everyone.

387
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,027
I'm going to need
a cut-down tray.

388
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,095
One, two, three.

389
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,119
All right, Chuny,
get me a blood-gas

390
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,332
with a CO level.

391
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:27,788
Get a CBC Chem 20

392
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,558
portable chest for openers.

393
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:32,977
Mm-hmm.

394
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,499
Is he okay?

395
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:41,268
He's got a mass in his abdomen.

396
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,838
Once I get inside,
I'll know how bad it is.

397
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:45,673
Inside? Is it bad?

398
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,674
Yeah.

399
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,142
Ultrasound's ready.

400
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,821
Did you get a
hold of the mother?

401
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:50,545
She isn't home.

402
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,146
Any other adult relatives?

403
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,731
There aren't any.

404
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,699
I take care of him

405
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,378
when Gloria's not around.

406
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,602
Okay. Hang on.

407
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,856
Well, there it is.

408
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:03,258
He's hemorrhaging

409
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,392
into his kidney.

410
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,060
Let's get lytes, CBC,

411
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,562
a CT of the abdomen,
get a chest film

412
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,580
for metz.

413
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,616
And, Haleh, page
the O.R., too, will you?

414
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,384
What does it say?

415
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,387
Ahmed's got something
called a Wilm's tumor.

416
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,066
You see that area right there?

417
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,056
That fluid?

418
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,057
The light gray?

419
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,392
Yeah. That's blood.

420
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,828
The tumor's invading his kidney.

421
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,374
That's why you saw all
the blood in his diaper.

422
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,876
I should have brought
him in before, huh?

423
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,311
I got to get him to
the operating room.

424
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,085
I knew he was sick.

425
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,089
Is he going to die?

426
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,141
You did a good thing, Charlie.

427
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,212
Now use the Metz and
dissect the right colon

428
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:48,214
off the anterior
surface of the tumor.

429
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,648
Should I retract
the tumor laterally?

430
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:50,782
Yep. Very gently.

431
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,773
That's it.

432
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,709
You say that the baby-sitter
brought the child in?

433
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:58,179
Yeah. Mother was
nowhere to be found.

434
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,048
Dr. Ross knows the
girl that brought him in.

435
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,450
Now retract the tumor laterally.

436
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,385
Right.

437
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:08,022
And tie off the renal vein...

438
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:10,724
and artery and
ureter and transect it.

439
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,596
Slowly now. Avoid
the left renal vessels.

440
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:17,998
Good.

441
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:19,945
Now, free up the kidney
and you can take it out.

442
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,302
Okay.

443
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,005
All the pretty twinkly lights.

444
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,974
And that's why you were dancing

445
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,110
with the elves at
Marshall Field's.

446
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,023
I'd like some Sherry now.

447
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,614
What's your name, ma'am?

448
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,949
I'm Blitzen

449
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:38,586
the most overlooked
of all the reindeer.

450
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,291
Blitzen.

451
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,692
It's your lucky day, Beth.

452
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:46,694
You only have a
fractured cheekbone.

453
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,162
What does that mean?

454
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,697
It means you can go home...

455
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,833
unless you don't want to.

456
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,135
There's a shelter
called Hope House.

457
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,683
It's for women and children
in trouble... I don't have kids.

458
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:58,739
That's okay.

459
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,018
You can go there by
yourself. They have security

460
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,525
He'll find me.

461
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,511
They have reciprocal agreements

462
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,457
with shelters all
over the country.

463
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,492
You could go anywhere you want

464
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,616
Sweetheart, are you okay?

465
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:11,063
I knew I should have
fixed that top step.

466
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:12,419
It's just I've been so busy.

467
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:13,648
You forgive me?

468
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,140
Can you forgive me, honey?

469
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,109
I love you.

470
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,846
That's my girl.

471
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,899
Is she going to be

472
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,094
all right?

473
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,152
We're actually
not done, Mr. Lang.

474
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,065
We still need to do a head CT,

475
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,800
facial tomograms, put her
on an I.V. and antibiotics.

476
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,106
Is that going to take long?

477
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:35,304
Well, we'll do the best we can
but with the holidays, you know?

478
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,627
Anyway, family

479
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,307
isn't allowed in the exam area.

480
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,031
Malik, could you show
Mr. Lang to chairs?

481
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,383
Sure.

482
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,467
I'll be right outside, honey.

483
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,465
So you want to hear some
more about those shelters?

484
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,483
No good?

485
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,513
No, and I've tried PB and J.

486
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,237
Cookies, fruitcake.

487
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,917
Nobody likes fruitcake.

488
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,584
I thought dogs ate everything.

489
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,786
Why don't you take
him to the morgue

490
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,587
and have him beg
for some table scraps.

491
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:11,713
That's Mr. Collins.

492
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,725
Maybe he knows what
you like to eat, huh?

493
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,051
I think he likes you.

494
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,572
How you doing?

495
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,721
What's going on?

496
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,623
We were moving
him up to the burn unit

497
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,357
and he had started
having shortness of breath.

498
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,526
BP's 80 palp,
Tachycardiac at 140.

499
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,696
All right, give me 40
mig I.V. Bolus of Lasix.

500
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,519
We need to intubate 7.5.

501
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,753
He's bradying down.

502
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,405
Rate's 40, no pulse.

503
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:39,407
Aw, damn it.

504
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,175
Give me a mig of atropine.

505
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,510
Start CPR.

506
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,178
Asystole!

507
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,625
All right. Let's give
him an amp of epi.

508
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,015
Come on, Mr. Collins.

509
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,500
Come on, come on.

510
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,869
I don't care if
psych is backed up.

511
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,203
She thinks she's a reindeer.

512
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,872
Well, dangerous?

513
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,373
You know, she bruised an elf.

514
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,552
Excuse me, Miss.

515
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,043
Who's the rocket scientist

516
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,378
that parked a Bentley
in the ambulance bay?

517
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,491
The Bentley's mine.

518
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,792
Actually, it's my employer's.

519
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,527
Miss, I'm looking
for a missing person.

520
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,229
Take a number, sir. The
line starts in the waiting room.

521
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,354
The woman I'm looking
for has a hand puppet.

522
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,989
Did you say puppet?

523
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,571
Hey, you found him
something to munch on.

524
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,895
He found it himself.

525
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,229
No kidding?

526
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,464
Mm-hmm.

527
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,566
Are dogs supposed
to eat chicken bones?

528
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,868
Is that a chicken?

529
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,889
Charlie, hey.

530
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,390
Ahmed's out of surgery.

531
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:31,826
He's going to be okay.

532
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,226
I can take him home now?

533
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,996
No. It's going to take him some
time to recover from surgery.

534
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,676
Oh, man. Gloria's
going to be pissed.

535
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,166
I'm going to have to call DCFS.

536
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,278
You're going to narc her out?

537
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,113
I'm not narcing on anybody.
That little boy's been sick.

538
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:44,338
The mother should have
seen that weeks ago.

539
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,484
Gloria didn't know.

540
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:46,652
She just found out.

541
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:47,820
She sounds really worried.

542
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,888
Come on, or she'll throw me out.

543
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,278
So you live with her?

544
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,331
So you lied to me
about the shelter.

545
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,577
Come on, please.

546
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,350
All right, I'll give
her a chance

547
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,285
but I'm not promising
you anything.

548
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,636
Okay?

549
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,157
You're eating hospital food?

550
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:04,891
You're that desperate?

551
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,527
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

552
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,764
Boo.

553
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,954
You scared me.

554
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,155
I thought the surgery

555
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,156
went really well.

556
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,202
Yeah, it did.

557
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,670
My 3:00 hernia was canceled

558
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,160
so I<i> am</i> free tonight.

559
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,174
So I figured, if you
hadn't made plans

560
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,474
I could make

561
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,100
my traditional Christmas
phone call to Pizza Ring.

562
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,835
I actually got a family thing

563
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,986
and I already asked a
friend of mine to go with me.

564
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,234
Well, the... I understand.

565
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,658
It was last minute, anyway.

566
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:38,675
Christmas Eve.

567
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,377
It's okay. I'll just stay home

568
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,113
and rent a movie.

569
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,658
That's what I usually do.

570
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,982
No. You know what?

571
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,516
Let me talk to my buddy

572
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,385
because he was tired earlier.

573
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,687
He may prefer to
go home and crash.

574
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,260
So, um... yeah.

575
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,340
Yeah, let's do something later.

576
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,644
Pizza sounds great.

577
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,667
Gingerbread; that always
reminds me of Christmas at home.

578
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,769
You ever do that?

579
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,971
You ever make
gingerbread at home?

580
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,839
You know, in a civilized society

581
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,786
people acknowledge each
other when they speak, Charlie.

582
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,054
I'm just trying to
make conversation.

583
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,039
Want to talk about
Christmas at my home?

584
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:15,063
Sure. Where is it?

585
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,708
Home is where my mom got bombed

586
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,410
out of her mind and brought home

587
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,312
some fat, smelly
trucker after closing time.

588
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:21,368
Then she'd pass out

589
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,465
giving him the idea
he'd rather sleep with me.

590
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,301
All right, we know why you left.

591
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,740
How far did you run?

592
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:27,958
From Cleveland.

593
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,610
Did you call her lately?

594
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,924
She's probably moved on by now.

595
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:34,848
She never stays
anywhere for very long.

596
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:37,368
All right, both of these
plus the three danish

597
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,371
the two packets of cocoa
and the two dinner rolls

598
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,838
she's got in her pocket.

599
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,575
Great. Thanks.

600
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,610
Hey.

601
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,778
Hey, man.

602
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,047
Okay, I have now officially
changed every drain

603
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,327
and lanced every
boil in this hospital.

604
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,351
34 hours, man.

605
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,151
I'm ready for
some of that, uh...

606
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,920
what's that Jell-o thing
you said your cook makes?

607
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,055
Aspic.

608
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,268
Yeah. Some Aspic.

609
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,459
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

610
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,604
Say no more.

611
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,273
I have an Aunt
who makes Chitlins.

612
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:06,263
You don't want to
know what that's about.

613
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,265
Uh... okay.

614
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:09,478
There's a chance

615
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,935
that I may not be
able to make the party.

616
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,604
Oh. You working?

617
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,940
No. No.

618
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,942
There's this girl.

619
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,155
Oh, that's cool.

620
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,357
You know. I understand.

621
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,546
You sure?

622
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,393
Who wants to hang
with his homeys

623
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,495
when he could be
with a honey, right?

624
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,684
You going to be...?

625
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,919
I'll be fine.

626
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,299
Well, this gives you
a chance to at least

627
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,367
go home and get more sleep.

628
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,051
You don't have to hang
on me, man. I'll be fine.

629
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:34,386
Well, let's do something
tomorrow night;

630
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,753
go out, get a couple
beers or something.

631
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:36,857
I'm on tomorrow night.

632
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,342
<i>I know what universal</i>

633
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,798
precautions are usually,

634
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,278
but what does it refer
to here, double gloves?

635
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,102
You're going overboard
with these guidelines.

636
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,781
Well, what about employee X's

637
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,882
participation in bloody trauma?

638
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,217
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

639
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,252
Bloody trauma?

640
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:51,942
Maybe that's the
deal with Dr. Lewis.

641
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,188
Susan, HIV-Positive?

642
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,256
I don't think so.

643
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,979
Look, Susan is fine.

644
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,092
That's what I said.

645
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,449
Lydia's been sick a lot.

646
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,749
Oh, shut your mouth.

647
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,329
You know, I would have
expected more from the two of you

648
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,237
than gossiping about a
co-worker's HIV status.

649
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:06,151
Look everybody. Kerry and
I have been hammering out

650
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:07,919
a policy, there's
no secret there.

651
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:09,554
But this shouldn't be grist for

652
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,477
the rumor mill.

653
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:12,240
Is there a reason
we have to have

654
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,430
HIV-positive employees

655
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,848
in the ER at all?

656
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:16,617
Well, according to current law

657
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:19,153
employee or employees X...
We'll call them employee X...

658
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,972
Cannot be fired because
of their HIV status.

659
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,952
But they can stick their
hands in a bloody trauma?

660
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,270
Why not if they're gloved?

661
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:26,938
Is this someone got
it from a needle stick?

662
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:28,407
What difference does
it make how they got it?

663
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,831
These are the issues
that we've been discussing.

664
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,500
Should employee X be restricted

665
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:33,934
to noninvasive procedures?

666
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,964
Or continue with
their duties...?

667
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,372
Won't universal precautions
prevent transmission?

668
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:40,852
Yeah, that's what they tell us when
we work on HIV-positive patients.

669
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:43,710
The real question here
isn't in law and policies.

670
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:46,213
It's do our patients
have the right to know.

671
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,282
This in no way
has any reflection

672
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:50,595
upon my opinion on
employee X's work.

673
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,997
Is there an actual employee X

674
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:52,986
or are we just talking?

675
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:54,966
We're talking
policy here, people.

676
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,323
Employee x could be

677
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,436
any one of us.

678
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,159
Excuse me.

679
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,632
Would everyone stop
calling me employee x?

680
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,068
I am HIV-Positive.

681
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,959
We talked about this, Mark.

682
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,927
The risks are a million to one

683
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,197
that Jeanie will bleed into
an open wound while suturing.

684
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm not saying she can't work.

685
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:28,989
I'm just trying to set the
boundaries of where she<i> can</i> work.

686
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,019
You set the boundaries at
triage and answering the phone...

687
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,043
That's not her job.

688
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,060
I have no trouble

689
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,272
if she performs her
duties within limits.

690
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:36,046
Dispensing
medication... That's fine

691
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,231
but some things aren't.

692
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,801
For example... it says here...

693
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,370
"deep, penetrating,
poorly visualized cavities."

694
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,138
Okay? That's from the CDC.

695
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,174
I think that should
be off limits.

696
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,742
I wouldn't feel comfortable

697
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,093
doing that anyway.

698
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,095
Okay. See? Progress.

699
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,596
You know, Mark,
since I found out,

700
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,415
I have been more careful.

701
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,844
Do you think I want

702
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,212
to do something that
may harm a patient?

703
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,535
No, I don't.

704
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,838
But unfortunately

705
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,458
the hospital administration
has left it up to Kerry and I

706
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:07,061
to create a policy that the
state and federal governments

707
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:08,662
can't seem to make
up their minds about.

708
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,781
I've agonized over this.

709
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,150
I have considered
quitting, but I believe

710
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,436
my life can still have
value... I can still help people.

711
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:17,504
I'm sure you can.

712
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,419
What else are you worried about?

713
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,676
Dementia.

714
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,279
You're fine now, but
what if you decline?

715
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:28,532
Dementia may be the
first sign of full-blown AIDS.

716
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:32,169
I've heard that there
are some hospitals

717
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,587
that have instituted
a physician monitor

718
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:36,551
someone to help keep
tabs on the person's health.

719
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,609
I could do that.

720
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:40,844
Okay.

721
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,345
So, that's one thing.

722
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,714
What else?

723
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,720
Hi.

724
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,499
So was it a needle stick?

725
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,801
I guess so. You
don't think that she...?

726
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,136
Oh, hi, Jeanie.

727
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,304
Hi.

728
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:13,543
Hey, Jeanie.

729
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,028
Hey.

730
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,408
I wish I had known.

731
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,832
Why? Would it have
made the two of us friends?

732
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,334
Now, that's not fair.

733
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:21,535
Nothing is.

734
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:27,808
Well?

735
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:29,142
Oh, Mr. Lang. Hi.

736
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:30,322
Is Beth okay?

737
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:32,023
I been sitting here for hours.

738
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:33,314
I'm sorry, but your wife's fall

739
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:34,848
was worse than
we initially thought.

740
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:37,484
She might have to stay
overnight for observation.

741
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,764
Oh, God.

742
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,987
Anyway, the coroner's
going to have my butt

743
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,989
if we don't get
this guy over there.

744
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:45,025
So why don't you just wait?

745
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:54,701
Hey, buddy?

746
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:56,798
This patient's going
to the bus station.

747
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:57,854
A stiff?

748
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,307
Miraculous recovery.

749
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,276
Uh, here you go...

750
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,792
For your bus ticket
and some burgers.

751
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,635
Oh, I... I can't
take this from you.

752
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,281
You got a 3:15 to
Abilene to catch.

753
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,438
I don't know

754
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,739
where Abilene is.

755
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,094
Hopefully, neither does he.

756
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,024
Bye.

757
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,798
Uh, you won the pool.

758
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,300
Congratulations.

759
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,302
That was the
football pool money?

760
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,737
Yeah. I thought
she was a better bet.

761
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:33,473
All right. "Alternators,
amusements, ammunition..."

762
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,475
There's no animal shelters.

763
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,312
Sometimes they list them
under Humane Societies.

764
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,813
Aw, You can't give
him away, Mark.

765
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,481
You promised Mr. Collins.

766
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,662
Yeah, that was before
I shelled out 50 bucks

767
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,930
to a drag queen for
a free-range goose.

768
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:48,172
You know what
happens when they can't

769
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,089
find homes for dogs?

770
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,158
What am I going
to do with a dog?

771
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,326
Dogs are great.

772
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,911
They're good company.

773
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,191
They watch your
stuff when you're gone.

774
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,748
Your daughter will love him.

775
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,416
You think?

776
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,453
Yeah. My dad got me a
dog... Skippy... when I was six.

777
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,887
Best present I ever got.

778
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,807
The two of us were like
peanut butter and jelly.

779
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,341
<i>Ay, mi perrito!</i>

780
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,424
<i>No me puedes hacer eso, ah?!</i>

781
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:13,591
<i>Yo soy su madre!</i>

782
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:14,859
<i>Yo tengo derecho!</i>

783
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,227
I'll get you for kidnapping!

784
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,379
Don't you think I
won't! He was sick!

785
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,047
Don't tell me how
to raise my son...

786
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,204
Excuse me, I'm Dr. Ross.

787
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,538
Can I help you?

788
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,240
You can give me back my baby

789
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,208
is what you can do for me.

790
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,476
Your son had major surgery.

791
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,522
I'll call the cops on your ass.

792
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,079
Are you high, Gloria?

793
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,825
I'm clean. You don't
know nothing about me.

794
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,860
Well maybe we should just let
Children and Family Services decide.

795
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,201
You promised you wouldn't narc!

796
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,064
I said I'd give her a
chance. I gave her a chance.

797
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,054
She's just scared.

798
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,000
You come in here, messed
up on God knows what

799
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,035
you don't even ask about

800
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,069
your critically-ill son

801
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,425
so why don't you have a seat...

802
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:43,638
I'll get my kid
back, you bastard!

803
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,574
You think you can mess
with me because I'm a Latina?!

804
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:47,597
Well, I'll call a lawyer

805
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,332
and sue all you all!

806
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,601
You're just like
the rest of them.

807
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,170
Gloria, wait up!

808
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:04,331
What's that?

809
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,600
This homeless guy's dog.

810
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,303
The dog saved his life.

811
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:11,382
I told him that I'd, you
know, watch out for him

812
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:12,873
and next thing I know

813
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,474
the guy up and dies on me.

814
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,643
So now you're the
proud owner of...

815
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:17,978
His name's Nick.

816
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:20,981
Given the season, you
should call him St. Nick.

817
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,851
Yeah, well, Rachel can
call him whatever she wants.

818
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:25,352
Rachel?

819
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:27,299
Yeah, I thought I'd give
her a puppy for Christmas.

820
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,223
Mark, in case you hadn't noticed

821
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:31,558
that dog is, like,
eight years old.

822
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:34,111
It's ready for
a mid-life crisis.

823
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,163
It's ready for a
fur replacement.

824
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:38,343
What do you mean? With a
wash, a little bow around his neck

825
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,034
he's not going to
look a day over... five.

826
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:43,537
What do you know
about giving dogs a bath?

827
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:45,550
What's to know?
Could you hold him?

828
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:46,717
I could, yeah, for 20
bucks. I could do it.

829
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,141
20 bucks, that's a little steep.

830
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:49,942
I lost my wallet. I need a loan.

831
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,110
Deal.

832
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,445
Okay.

833
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,547
Hang on.

834
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:54,614
You got him?

835
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,448
Hold on.

836
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,182
Ho!

837
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,218
Come here, come here...

838
00:28:58,254 --> 00:29:00,003
Whoa! Ah!

839
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,171
Oh, damn it!

840
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,550
Let me see. You
take care of your head.

841
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,856
I'll get the dog.

842
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,594
Can I get some help?

843
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,795
Yeah.

844
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,936
Ouch. That looks pretty deep.

845
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,038
Yeah. Dog trauma.

846
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:37,541
He went that way. He was
giving Doug a run for his money.

847
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,287
Looks like it could use stitches

848
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,610
don't you think?

849
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,429
You want me to call someone?

850
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:44,097
No. I want you to do it.

851
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,101
Okay.

852
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:53,290
Oh, Wow. Wow.

853
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,875
Very William Powell.

854
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,026
Aren't they great?

855
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,411
Silk.

856
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:58,446
Try it on. Yeah?

857
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,398
Dr. Keaton?

858
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:04,717
Yes. Dr. Benton?

859
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:06,336
Is this a bad time?

860
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:07,654
No, no, no.

861
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:09,500
I was just reviewing
some anatomy.

862
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:10,490
May I come in for a moment?

863
00:30:10,526 --> 00:30:11,526
Sure.

864
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:16,663
Uh... first of all, I
wanted to thank you

865
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:19,399
for, uh, letting me
take such a large role

866
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:21,413
in the Lopez Nephrectomy today.

867
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:22,919
Oh, you did a great job.

868
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,056
Thank you. That's
actually why I'm here.

869
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:29,176
I'd like to do another
pediatric surgery rotation.

870
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:31,194
Uh, well, you know, as you know

871
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,346
I won't be here for
the next rotation.

872
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,031
I know. Uh, I was hoping

873
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,534
that you could leave your
recommendation for me

874
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,604
with your replacement.

875
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,673
Um...

876
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:47,076
Well, you're a very
good surgeon, uh, Peter

877
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,697
but that's not enough for pedes.

878
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:53,416
You've got to live and
breathe for children.

879
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,253
You took this rotation
just to challenge yourself

880
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,754
and I applaud that

881
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,956
but I can't, in good conscience

882
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,960
give up a space that
could possibly be filled

883
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,846
by a future pediatric surgeon.

884
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,514
I'd be happy to talk

885
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:09,248
to Dr. Anspaugh or Morgenstern

886
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,883
and I hear that Don's doing

887
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,319
some really interesting
stuff in Thoracics.

888
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:16,072
No, no. No, thank you.

889
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,557
I, uh...

890
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:20,844
I wouldn't want to waste
any more of your time.

891
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:38,862
Hmm...

892
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,530
You've got an old scar.

893
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,765
Looks like you've
done this before.

894
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,435
I played Rugby in high
school for a few weeks

895
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,937
to impress a girl

896
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,872
but after ending up on
the bottom of a few scrums

897
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,208
I decided to rethink
the relationship.

898
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,015
Jeanie, you're a great P.A.

899
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,296
You're an asset to the ER.

900
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,786
But...?

901
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,188
But nothing.

902
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,890
I think you should stay.

903
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,726
And do my job;
not do clerical work?

904
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,378
Yeah.

905
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:14,213
Within the limits
that we set earlier.

906
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:17,517
But you still wouldn't want
me suturing your daughter.

907
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,621
I don't know. I...

908
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:30,980
Okay.

909
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,553
Good as new.

910
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,088
All right. When I finally
caught up with him

911
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,158
he'd already been made
mascot of the children's ward.

912
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,326
Watch him.

913
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,494
Thank you.

914
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,829
Good catch.

915
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,097
All right. Now, I am
on my way home

916
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,099
for a beautiful holiday

917
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,670
with Mu Shu pork,
Channel 11 Yule log

918
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,238
and my easy chair.

919
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,740
How's your forehead?

920
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,408
Jeanie fixed me right up.

921
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,911
Yeah. She's a great P.A.

922
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,780
All right. My work here is done.

923
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,549
Merry Christmas.

924
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,655
I'm sorry I lied to you, Mark.

925
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,024
Good night.

926
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,242
Good night.

927
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,365
What happened here?

928
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,066
Long story.

929
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,110
I swallowed a bunch
of pills a few years ago.

930
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,212
When I got back to work

931
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,363
people either smothered
me with kindness

932
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,332
or treated me
like I was invisible.

933
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,937
If we aren't friends,
maybe we should be.

934
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:51,878
Well. I have a house full of
crazy relatives waiting for me.

935
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:54,380
Merry Christmas, Carol.

936
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:56,749
Merry Christmas.

937
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,481
Hey.

938
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,350
Hey.

939
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,352
What are you doing?

940
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,020
What...?

941
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,091
How did you find
out where I lived?

942
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,728
I thought I lost this.

943
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,198
You did... at the cafeteria.

944
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,766
And the 50 some-odd
bucks that was in here?

945
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:31,851
I needed cab fare.

946
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:32,897
50 bucks' worth?

947
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,504
What are you doing here?

948
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,190
Gloria's pissed, and
she blames it on me.

949
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,508
I can't stay there anymore.

950
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,543
And?

951
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,778
And I thought I
could crash with you.

952
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,558
You're 14 years old,
you stole my wallet

953
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,509
you've been nothing
but a pain in the ass.

954
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,334
You want me to stay
out on the streets?

955
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:48,612
In a shelter.

956
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:51,404
A shelter on Christmas Eve?

957
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,090
Sounds like fun.

958
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,841
Hey.

959
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,309
Hi.

960
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,844
How'd you find me?

961
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,380
Dr. Weaver told me
you were taking a break.

962
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,415
I, uh...

963
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,529
I got a lot of Christmas cards

964
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:22,852
forwarded to me

965
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,655
addressed to
Mr. and Mrs. Al Boulet.

966
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,457
I thought you might
like to look at them, too.

967
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,095
You can sit down, Al.

968
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,496
I don't bite.

969
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,235
Aunt Nonni.

970
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,204
I wonder what
get-rich-quick scheme

971
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,823
she's looking for
partners in this year.

972
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:46,393
Southwestern land development.

973
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:49,095
Beats the
envelope-stuffing scheme.

974
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:50,430
And the roller disco.

975
00:35:57,306 --> 00:35:59,839
Uh... I also thought...

976
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:04,344
You might like to have this.

977
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,831
Where did you find this?

978
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,616
I finally got a chance

979
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:13,386
to go through some of
the boxes from the house.

980
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,488
I found my socket set, too.

981
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:19,292
Remember that ridiculous
tree in the old apartment?

982
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:22,094
There was nothing
ridiculous about that, baby.

983
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,397
That was a... a
prime piece of pine.

984
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,399
Except it was
about six feet too tall

985
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,634
for a studio apartment

986
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,569
and you refused
to cut the top off.

987
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,681
That would've been sacrilege.

988
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,383
I bet you can still see
the stucco scratches.

989
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,318
Like you didn't
eat all the popcorn

990
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:35,753
before I could string
it with the cranberries.

991
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,211
Well, that's different. How?

992
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:42,015
'Cause you know how
I feel about popcorn.

993
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,835
Hey, Dennis.

994
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:54,177
Dennis?

995
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,495
You were sleeping.

996
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,408
No, I was just resting my eyes.

997
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:59,065
What are you still doing here?

998
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:00,511
I've got all these charts.

999
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:01,834
They can wait.

1000
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,681
No. I want to finish them up.

1001
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:04,849
You are going to go home right?

1002
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:06,116
You are going to get some sleep?

1003
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,807
Yeah, absolutely.

1004
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,461
I'm good.

1005
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,929
All right, man.

1006
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,160
Hey.

1007
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,396
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

1008
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,798
Well, actually, I
was just seducing

1009
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,717
this fat man in a fly
red suit, you know.

1010
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:54,470
He came down the chimney.

1011
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,122
But other than that...

1012
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:58,958
Um, here.

1013
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:01,072
I brought you this Poinsettia.

1014
00:38:01,096 --> 00:38:05,131
Who knew the Zippy Mart was
still open on Christmas Eve?

1015
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,234
Busted, huh?

1016
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,869
I just didn't want

1017
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:12,705
to show up here
empty-handed, that's all.

1018
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:27,820
Thank you...

1019
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:31,590
for the Poinsettia.

1020
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,259
Yeah, uh...

1021
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:34,894
You're welcome.

1022
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:37,563
Are you going to come in

1023
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:40,833
or are you just going to
let all this cold air in here?

1024
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:48,352
You forgot the extra chair.

1025
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:50,576
Mom, I already
borrowed folding chairs

1026
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:52,144
from the guy next door.

1027
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,781
The extra chair is for
the unexpected guest

1028
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,016
a tradition much
older than you or me

1029
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:58,284
or the guy next door.

1030
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,464
Okay, well, there
isn't enough room.

1031
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,668
And as much as I'd like
to sit on Uncle Myko's lap...

1032
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:05,458
Fine, fine. Have it your way.

1033
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,360
First we have to
have <i>Sviata Vechera</i>

1034
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,661
on American Christmas Eve.

1035
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:11,464
Then it's like pulling teeth
to get you to help me cook.

1036
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:12,998
Now, one last tradition

1037
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:15,335
I ask you to assist
me with and...

1038
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,573
An unexpected guest maybe?

1039
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,941
Maybe.

1040
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:25,862
Hey.

1041
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,013
Don't say a word.

1042
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:29,164
I thought you were
planning a quiet evening

1043
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,317
with the Channel Nine Yule log.

1044
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:33,633
Yeah, well, the plans changed.

1045
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:36,339
You're kidding me.

1046
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,019
She just showed up at my place.

1047
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,686
I can't have her sleeping there.

1048
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,754
It wouldn't look

1049
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,061
very good, so...

1050
00:39:42,096 --> 00:39:43,762
Oh, no. No way, Doug.

1051
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,783
It's bad enough I've got
eight drunken sword dancers

1052
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,601
re-enacting the purge
in my dining room.

1053
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,953
It's Christmas, Carol.

1054
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:54,089
Doug, I am painfully
aware of that.

1055
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,018
Come on.

1056
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:07,403
Come on, Nick.

1057
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,925
Nick, let's get out of here.

1058
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,929
Come on, buddy. Come on.

1059
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,164
Mark.

1060
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,066
I, uh, I didn't hear you

1061
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,668
ring the bell.

1062
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,837
Jennifer, guess who's here?

1063
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,155
You won't believe what
he's got with him either.

1064
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,991
It's just funny
because I got Rachel

1065
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,227
a couple of Labrador
puppies for Christmas

1066
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:49,795
and here you are with a...

1067
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,575
what is he, some
kind of a Setter?

1068
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,299
Mixed breed, actually.

1069
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:54,967
Daddy!

1070
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,985
Daddy!

1071
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:58,036
Hi, sweetheart.

1072
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:03,476
Mark, we weren't
expecting you until tomorrow.

1073
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:05,445
Yeah, well...

1074
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Daddy

1075
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:07,814
you brought me a doggie.

1076
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:09,748
Great minds think alike.

1077
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,135
Actually, I, uh...

1078
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,103
he's my dog, and
I just wanted you

1079
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,333
to meet...

1080
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:16,489
Ow!

1081
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:17,506
Oh, I'm sorry.

1082
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,307
You all right?

1083
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,708
You okay?

1084
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:20,843
Bad dog!

1085
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:21,844
The doggie

1086
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,945
didn't mean it.

1087
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,391
No, of course
he didn't, darling.

1088
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,614
Here, let me take a look.

1089
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,867
Has he had his shots yet?

1090
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,119
Craig, let Mark
take a look at it.

1091
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,186
He's a doctor.

1092
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,523
Come on in, Mark.

1093
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,258
Okay. Let's go.

1094
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:39,262
Good, doggie.

1095
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,938
Thank you.

1096
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,786
If I had known it was
this easy to get my mother

1097
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,455
off my back, I would have had

1098
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,224
you bring her by
a long time ago.

1099
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:57,513
So she can stay?

1100
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,360
No, I do not think
that's a good idea.

1101
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:00,394
Check it out... It's
a Christmas egg.

1102
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:01,428
That's nice there, Charlie.

1103
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,046
You should make
one. It's pretty cool.

1104
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,337
I don't know, Charlie.

1105
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:05,338
I'm no Picasso.

1106
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:06,506
You chicken?

1107
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:07,768
Yeah, you a chicken?

1108
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:08,891
Yeah, I'm a chicken.

1109
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:09,892
Get over there.

1110
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,207
I'll paint it.

1111
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,497
Okay, one night.

1112
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,732
All right.

1113
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,400
Just one... tonight.

1114
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,597
So Long as we
have hands to clasp

1115
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:22,522
Christmas day will always be

1116
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:25,291
just as long as we have...

1117
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:27,493
Welcome, Christmas...

1118
00:42:27,529 --> 00:42:31,631
Oh, I am never going
to get sick of that one.

1119
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,433
Do you think they have
Dr. Seuss in Pakistan?

1120
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,236
Oh, I don't think
it's a priority.

1121
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:38,638
Will you be safe?

1122
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:41,474
I don't think you can
guarantee safety anywhere.

1123
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:44,260
Oh, I feel safe here.

1124
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:46,478
I remember my
father used to read

1125
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:49,215
<i>The Christmas Story</i>
every Christmas Eve.

1126
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,351
I'm so tired, I don't
even think I remember it.

1127
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:55,555
Um, "'Twas the night
before Christmas...

1128
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,540
"and all through the house

1129
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,926
"not a creature was stirring...

1130
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:01,627
not even a mouse."

1131
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,197
I'm going to miss you.

1132
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:06,849
That's not the next line.

1133
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,368
I'm really going to miss you.

1134
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,580
What are you looking at?

1135
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,914
This tree.

1136
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,830
It's missing
something, you know?

1137
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:42,918
Yeah.

1138
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,387
Well, pedes did a good job

1139
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,667
with this construction
paper chain, huh?

1140
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:47,857
Yeah.

1141
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:51,009
That was a real gutsy
thing you did today.

1142
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,095
Thanks.

1143
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:58,217
You know, I have just the thing.

1144
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,149
That looks good.

1145
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,468
Where did you get it?

1146
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:17,136
My ex-husband brought it by.

1147
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:19,222
It came off our
first Christmas tree.

1148
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:20,206
It's an heirloom.

1149
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,886
You should put it
on your family tree.

1150
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,793
I just did.
