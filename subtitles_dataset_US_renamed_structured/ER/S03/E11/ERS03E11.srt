1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,257
Oh, ooh! My God, it is cold!

2
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,059
It must be 20 below
with the wind chill.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,284
This is no place for a Mexican.

4
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,086
I thought you hated
to work night shift.

5
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,522
I'm filling in for Haleh.

6
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,490
I think we're going to see

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,069
plenty of frostbite tonight.

8
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,059
And bumsicles.

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,846
I hate the smell when they thaw.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,906
Oh, place looks dead.

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,345
Well, this guy certainly is.

12
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,065
Randi, you know we
got a DB in the hallway?

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,144
The morgue's slow.

14
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:53,802
I put him next to the
door to keep him cool.

15
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:54,837
Ah, good thinking.

16
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,054
Is this board right?

17
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,233
Yeah. Not a single patient.

18
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,284
Yeah, it's too cold to be sick.

19
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,559
I guess I'll have some time

20
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,527
to work on my curriculum vitae.

21
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,528
What's that?

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,564
That's a fancy word for resume.

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,743
I've got tenure
review this week.

24
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,977
You want to join the faculty?

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,001
It'd be nice.

26
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,079
Dr. Greene?

27
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,448
Legal sent you this letter

28
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:14,105
and these charts to be signed.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,441
They're writing me up
for not co-signing charts.

30
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,355
Will that hurt your
chance for tenure?

31
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,944
It won't help.

32
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,991
Competition pretty stiff?

33
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,367
It's about 5' 4",
red hair with a limp.

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,558
Lydia?

35
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,761
How'd you like to
make an easy 50 bucks?

36
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:36,945
How?

37
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,680
I got a grant to
study the effect

38
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,448
of exercise on the
circadian rhythms

39
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:41,799
of night-shift workers.

40
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,684
Is that why E. Ray's doing

41
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,880
jumping jacks in
the suture room?

42
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,032
Yes, but we need
one more subject.

43
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,106
My publishing
deadline's in two days

44
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,974
so I'm kind of in a bind.

45
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,776
Sorry. Not interested.

46
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,180
All right, we'll keep looking.

47
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,182
Wendy.

48
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,064
Mafkariyega keya wakt hoowa-hey?

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,453
Repeat.

50
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,123
<i>Mafkariyega keya wakt hoowa-hey?</i>

51
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,825
<i>Mafkariyega keya wakt hoowa-hey?</i>

52
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,660
Very good.

53
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,796
How much are a dozen bananas?

54
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,465
<i>Ek darjan kele kitne ke-hey?</i>

55
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,501
Repeat.

56
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>Ek darjan kel kitne ke-hey?</i>

57
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,916
Very good.

58
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,906
Thank you.

59
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,185
Aren't you supposed
to be on a plane

60
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,319
in 12 hours, to Karachi?

61
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,110
I left the packing
till the last minute.

62
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,444
I'm going to be here all night.

63
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,857
Well, that presents
certain opportunities.

64
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,846
I have to pack.

65
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,847
Please.

66
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,861
Why don't you come back at 3:00?

67
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,984
I'll set my watch alarm.

68
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,386
Dr. Keaton?

69
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,123
Hey, have you seen Carter?

70
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,124
Someone said he came in here.

71
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,204
Doesn't look like it.

72
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,327
Oh, sorry.

73
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,628
Have a safe trip.

74
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,943
Thank you. Bye-bye.

75
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,051
Carol?

76
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,052
Mary, what's up?

77
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,365
Budget just came out.

78
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,234
We've got a crisis conference

79
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,069
tomorrow morning, first thing.

80
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,204
Crisis conference?

81
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:58,960
E.R. nursing's $94,000 over.

82
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,407
Well, can't we
add to the budget?

83
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,064
No, you're gonna have
to let two nurses go.

84
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,212
But, Mary, I'm
understaffed as it is.

85
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,968
Name me a department
that isn't, Carol.

86
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,370
The County's out of money.

87
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:09,771
There's just no way around it.

88
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,117
Now, you've got
three junior RN's.

89
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,686
You've got Maleek... <i>Malik.</i>

90
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,926
Malik Mcgrath, Chuny
Marquez and Connie...

91
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,106
Oligario.

92
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,262
You can keep one of them.

93
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,342
Well, which two get the axe?

94
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,099
That's your decision.

95
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,467
Oh, Mary, I don't know.

96
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,169
I've never done this before.

97
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,538
I have to have an answer
by the meeting tomorrow.

98
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,706
Are you on tonight?

99
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:28,724
Yeah.

100
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,009
Leave it on my e-mail.

101
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,695
Make sure I get it by
8:00 in the morning.

102
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,435
Okay, if you could choose

103
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,436
how to check out,
how would you do it?

104
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,748
That's morbid.

105
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,218
I guess if I could choose
how to die, I'd go by OD.

106
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,752
A quick stroke would be better.

107
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,754
If you survive, then
you're an end table.

108
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,822
Still no patients, Malik?

109
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,558
Nope, but we got
takeout... Antonio's.

110
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,259
We couldn't find you,
so we ordered your usual.

111
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,827
Oh, great. How much
do I owe you, Chuny?

112
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,817
Ah, put it away.

113
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,818
No, come on, Connie.

114
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,819
No, we've got you covered.

115
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,820
Hey. Thanks, guys.

116
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,821
Hey, tell me, are my hands cold?

117
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,955
Oh, God! Sadist!

118
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:51,956
Listen, I'm sorry about

119
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,503
that old surprise
Christmas morning.

120
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,926
Santa didn't come?

121
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,439
I stuck in a tag of
Christian goodwill

122
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,241
and I opened my door to
a homeless street urchin.

123
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,764
Actually, Doug,
you opened my door.

124
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,665
That's right. I opened her door.

125
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,367
She stole my
mother's silverware.

126
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,480
Tell Helen I'll pay for it.

127
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,614
She won't accept your money.

128
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,149
All right, but I'm not
going to offer again.

129
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,383
My New Year's resolution

130
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,974
is to resist
charitable impulses.

131
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,654
Mark, Risk Management called,

132
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,123
said we're overdue
for a safety check.

133
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,112
Why tell me?

134
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,925
You're the designated
safety officer.

135
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,827
They want it done
tonight. That's the checklist.

136
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,496
Wait, look, I've got 50
more charts to do here.

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,763
Why don't Carol and I take it.

138
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,898
Hey, what happened to
resisting charitable impulses?

139
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,334
Speaking of, anyone
want to sign up

140
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,401
for our night shift study?

141
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,825
No!

142
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,721
Boy, it is dead.

143
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,023
Finished all my charts.

144
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,846
It's not even 9:00 yet.

145
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:33,014
Want some action?

146
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,126
What do you got in mind?

147
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,416
Edson's sick.

148
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:37,852
If you're willing to sprint
at a moment's notice

149
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:39,621
you can take his
place on the code team.

150
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:40,733
Absolutely.

151
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,425
Hey, John, he boned me, man.

152
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,094
Benton wouldn't
let you off, huh?

153
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,941
Two days is all I asked for.

154
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:49,008
Son of a bitch.

155
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:50,165
You know, Dennis

156
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,150
if Monique is already
with this other guy

157
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,953
then there's probably
nothing you can do about it

158
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,922
even if you did fly down there.

159
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,469
Well, I'd sure as hell
like the chance to try.

160
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,628
Hey, you want to go to
that place down the street

161
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,464
and get some of those
home fries with gravy?

162
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,367
No, I wish I could. I've
got all these charts to do.

163
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,185
Okay. I hear you.

164
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,888
Look, if Benton asks,
I'll be back in an hour.

165
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:14,939
Yeah.

166
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,145
I thought you
finished the charts.

167
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,291
I have been
listening to him moan

168
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,882
about that girlfriend
for two weeks.

169
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,501
Tonight is slow enough.

170
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,286
So who's our first
lucky customer?

171
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,621
Lady with a fever.

172
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,467
Fell asleep at Doc Magoo's.

173
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,857
Waitress brought her in.

174
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,671
She's kind of loopy, no I.D.

175
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,194
Says her name's Shelly.

176
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,295
No needles.

177
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,030
I just want to sleep.

178
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,209
Temp's 103.

179
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,377
And look at this.

180
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,184
Photophobia.

181
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:45,353
Shelly, I'm Dr. Greene.

182
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,122
I need to examine you.

183
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,234
Leave me alone.

184
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,924
You have symptoms of meningitis,

185
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,292
which is really serious.

186
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,527
We need to do a spinal
tap, just to be sure.

187
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:54,780
No.

188
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,144
At least, let me give
you a shot of antibiotics.

189
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,684
No. No needles, I said.

190
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,916
Shelly, if you do
have meningitis

191
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,741
and we don't treat
you, you could die.

192
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,943
Die, cry, let me fry.

193
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,050
Do you know where you are?

194
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,451
In the hospital...

195
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,654
talking to Dr. Greene
with a head like a bean.

196
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,791
Do you know what day it is?

197
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,142
Thursday, January 16.

198
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,127
Bing!

199
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:28,396
Correct, Alex Trebek.

200
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:32,183
Next: "Stupid
questions" for 200.

201
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,863
I'm 90 percent
sure it's meningitis,

202
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,954
which is probably causing
her altered mental status.

203
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,901
She won't even
let me take blood.

204
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,470
She's not competent to
make her own decisions.

205
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,792
I need a consent override.

206
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,806
You've got to run it
by Risk Management.

207
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,363
No, I don't.

208
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,347
Yeah, you do. It just came down.

209
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,593
All consent overrides
go through legal.

210
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:49,550
Fine. Call them and tell them

211
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,419
that I'm doing a spinal tap

212
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:53,955
on a demented woman
without her consent.

213
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,492
Well, we've got
some loose tile here

214
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,761
and some crumbling grout.

215
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,162
Faulty tile and grout.

216
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:04,432
Yeah, this could be trouble
if it fell into an open wound.

217
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:05,611
Trouble, indeed.

218
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:06,812
Good catch.

219
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,047
Did you write down
those wobbly I.V. stands?

220
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,181
Roger that.

221
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,349
You know, you've got
a real flair for this, Carol.

222
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,473
Thank you.

223
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,442
You know...

224
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,095
This clock looks like it
could fall right off the wall.

225
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,948
You know, I don't
know how you do it.

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,762
It's well established that night
work disrupts circadian rhythms.

227
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,469
Yeah, I've heard that.

228
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,516
Our study hopes to prove
that moderate physical exertion

229
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,484
can switch circadian rhythms

230
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,874
back into phase.

231
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,160
When you say "moderate
physical exertion...?"

232
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,123
Oh, you know, just a
few minutes' exercise,

233
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,092
a jog around the block...
Nothing strenuous.

234
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,226
It's all set up in
the suture room.

235
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,728
I don't know if I'll be
a really good subject.

236
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,718
I'm not in really good shape.

237
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,419
You look plenty healthy to me.

238
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:44,972
Ow!

239
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,307
Whoa!

240
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,895
Oh, my God.

241
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,262
Kerry, are you all right?

242
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,976
What were you doing up there?

243
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,310
Safety check. You okay?

244
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,634
I'm bleeding.

245
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,435
I can stitch it up.

246
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,970
Yeah, I prefer Jeanie.

247
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,282
Okay.

248
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,842
And we were doing so well.

249
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,368
Hey, Maggie, you
got anything good?

250
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,971
Carol Hathaway dropped
a clock on Weaver's head.

251
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:18,306
Deliberately?

252
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,819
I'm foggy on the details.

253
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,487
Hey, kids, we got
paramedics pulling up.

254
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,576
Now we're talking.

255
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,723
Hey, nobody called
for a surgical consult.

256
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:27,382
I'm saving you the trouble
of having to page me.

257
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,429
Found him on the floor of
his house in acute distress.

258
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,552
Complains of
chest and belly pain.

259
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:32,966
Vitals normal. Wouldn't
let us start an I.V.

260
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,200
Does this hurt?

261
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,802
Ow! Looks like a
surgical abdomen.

262
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,459
I haven't made that assessment.

263
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,460
Since I'm here,
you don't have to.

264
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,161
Should I call for an attending?

265
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,390
No. No.

266
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,548
Up and over.

267
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,251
All right, let's get
an I.V. started.

268
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,618
I think I hear a rub.

269
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,432
I may have a pulsatile mass.

270
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,656
Give me a 12-lead
and a chest film.

271
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,524
Give me a cross-table abdomen.

272
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,625
Which one first?

273
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,905
Chest.

274
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,363
Abdomen. He could have
an aneurysm about to blow.

275
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,441
I don't want to
miss an acute MI.

276
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,781
I don't want to miss a triple-A.

277
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,244
If it's an MI, he
needs TPA right away.

278
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,730
An aneurysm needs
to go to the O.R.

279
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,820
Time is heart muscle.

280
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,734
You ever have an aneurysm
blow up in your face?

281
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,507
Hey, guys.

282
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,742
I'm feeling much better.

283
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,710
Sir, you need to lie down.

284
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,679
You need X rays.

285
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,081
No, I'm fine, except
for a stuffy nose.

286
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,401
Could I have a flu shot?

287
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,830
Oh, man. I remember this dude.

288
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,966
When he wants a
ride to the hospital

289
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,700
he calls 911 and plays possum.

290
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,358
But I'm on Social Security.

291
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,686
I can't afford a cab. And
it's too cold for the bus.

292
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,177
You came in for a flu shot?

293
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,763
If it wouldn't be
too much trouble.

294
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,232
He's all yours.

295
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,566
Gee, thanks.

296
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,401
I'm just saying,
there's no point in me

297
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,803
going back to general surgery.

298
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,549
You've learned all
there is to know?

299
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,807
I want to do another
pediatric rotation.

300
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,886
Why?

301
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,676
I want to be a
pediatric surgeon.

302
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,623
Without Dr. Keaton's
recommendation

303
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,013
that's not very likely.

304
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,293
Look, Dr. Keaton and I
had stylistic differences.

305
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,527
She herself said that my
technique was excellent.

306
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,095
Who would you work under?

307
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,152
Kenner.

308
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,153
Well, you're in luck.

309
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,199
He's doing a jejunal
atresia tonight. Talk to him.

310
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,275
If he'll take you,
you're back in Pediatric.

311
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,511
Okay. Would it be possible
for me to cover Pedes SICU?

312
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,747
That way, I can
get an opportunity

313
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,214
to work with Kenner.

314
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:10,351
Anything else?

315
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,803
No, thank you.

316
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,554
Chuny, you got that LP tray?

317
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,711
By the door.

318
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,256
Lydia, why don't
you give us a hand.

319
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,947
We may need to muscle her.

320
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,281
Uh, Mark...

321
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,295
Why won't you tell
me your address?

322
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,652
Excuse me. Who are you?

323
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,831
Dr. Greene?

324
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,933
Pat Guinet, Associate
Hospital Counsel.

325
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,024
You want to do a spinal
tap on this patient?

326
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,091
That's right.

327
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,138
She's not too keen on the idea.

328
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,229
Well, I've assessed her
as mentally incompetent.

329
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,942
We just had a fairly
coherent conversation.

330
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,549
Is that a medical diagnosis?

331
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,501
Look, Doctor, she's
clearly a borderline case.

332
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,571
We have been sued by
these patients in the past.

333
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,574
I'm trying to save her life

334
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,786
and you're talking
legal exposure.

335
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,437
Yeah. That's
what I'm paid to do.

336
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,029
Well, I'm paid to help
sick people get better.

337
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:56,942
Listen, I'm not going to
wrestle with you, Doctor,

338
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,078
but I'm writing on the
chart you're advised against

339
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,414
doing any procedure
on this woman

340
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:02,903
without her consent

341
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,422
and you and anyone

342
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,258
who assists you will be putting

343
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,826
your jobs in jeopardy.

344
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,478
Get a Psych consult.

345
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:14,215
If they agree she's incompetent

346
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,562
put her on a hold and proceed.

347
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,786
Until then, don't touch her.

348
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:27,928
Just one more stitch.

349
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,398
So, have you given
any more thought

350
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,077
to participating in my study?

351
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,669
I've got a lot of paperwork
I need to catch up on.

352
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:35,969
It won't take much time...

353
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,050
It's just 15 minutes
every couple of hours.

354
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:39,640
If we get busy, that
could be a problem.

355
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,108
It's been slow so far.

356
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,646
My being HIV-positive
won't skew the results?

357
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,114
Won't make a bit of difference.

358
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,317
Tonight's my last
night to collect data

359
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,668
and if I... ow!

360
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,437
My findings will be incom...
well, worthless, really

361
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,139
but if you're too busy

362
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,935
I respect your decision...

363
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,828
Just as I've always respected
and supported your decisions.

364
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,384
What would I have to do?

365
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,551
He scores!

366
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,757
Ah, we finally get
a bona fide patient?

367
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,960
Yeah, but we're not
allowed to touch her.

368
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,107
She asked for another
blanket and a snack.

369
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,199
Oh, so we're not a hospital...
We're a bed-and-breakfast.

370
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,367
Did Psych come down?

371
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,402
No, not yet.

372
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,314
Try again. I'll
be in the lounge.

373
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,804
You call missing persons?

374
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,001
Yeah, but so far,
no one's missed her.

375
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,575
We got a wheelchair
with no brakes

376
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,410
and three I.V.
stands are wobbling.

377
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,491
What are we supposed
to do with them all?

378
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,480
Hey!

379
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,815
Ugly...

380
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,050
Well, if it isn't

381
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,118
my favorite thief.

382
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,430
Hey, you got your wallet back.

383
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,265
What about my
mother's silverware?

384
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,067
I didn't take it, I swear.

385
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,591
Charlie, do I have
to call security

386
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,627
or you going to
leave by yourself?

387
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,941
No. Listen, man, I
need some bread.

388
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:52,930
No, I'm serious.

389
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,276
There's this dude
trying to pimp me,

390
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,266
and I don't want to...

391
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,646
He says I got to
pay him 100 bucks

392
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,813
or he's going to kill me.

393
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,871
Well, maybe we
should tell the cops.

394
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,083
No, man. I don't deal with cops.

395
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,273
And I don't deal with liars

396
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,809
who take advantage of
people who try to help them.

397
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,355
You're a creep, you know that?

398
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,344
Yep.

399
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,147
A creep and a pervert!

400
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,225
That's right!

401
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,227
This doctor made
me go down on him!

402
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,184
He gave me VD!

403
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,552
He got me pregnant

404
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,833
and now he wants me
to pay for the abortion!

405
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,324
Child molester!

406
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,842
Lovely girl.

407
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:24,673
Dr. Kenner, I'm Peter Benton.

408
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,841
I wanted to talk to you

409
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,910
about doing a pediatric
surgical rotation.

410
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,200
You were with Dr. Keaton.

411
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,379
Yeah. She's leaving...

412
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,668
This isn't a good time.

413
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,070
I'll find you later.

414
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,973
Okay, well, I'll be in
Pedes SICU all night.

415
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,280
You were looking for me?

416
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,393
Yeah, you're on
SICU with me tonight.

417
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,183
I thought Zeidenberg
was on SICU.

418
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,462
Order everyone's labs

419
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,087
and advance the
drain on bed three.

420
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,303
Here's one for you:

421
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,861
"Longing for your embrace.

422
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,396
"Financial Officer
seeks life of adventure

423
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,898
with very special lady."

424
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,049
Forget it.

425
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,717
Sounds like money, honey.

426
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:05,919
What are we gonna talk
about, Dow averages?

427
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,054
Keep going.

428
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,773
"Sensual MD, 35, 6'1."

429
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,042
I like tall.

430
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,343
"Makes up in passion

431
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,046
what he lacks in hair."

432
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,182
Not<i> me.</i>

433
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,444
I'm not so desperate

434
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,486
that I have to use personals.

435
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,853
You calling me desperate?

436
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,232
No, no, no. That's
not what I meant.

437
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,557
So where do you
find all your dates?

438
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,675
Actually, I haven't
had one in a while.

439
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:29,677
See?

440
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:30,944
Don't knock it

441
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,013
till you try it.

442
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:33,681
Dr. Greene, Psych's here

443
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:34,598
on that lady.

444
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,317
Who is it? McDonald?

445
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,718
No. It's some intern.

446
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:48,529
I didn't realize we were
coming down<i> this</i> hallway.

447
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:49,863
Neither did I.

448
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,667
Hey, which room was it, anyway?

449
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,213
I don't know.

450
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:57,238
Either this door or this one.

451
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,251
No, Doug, it's this one.

452
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:00,674
Oh, you're right.

453
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,410
A lot of stolen
moments in there, huh?

454
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:04,612
Yes, there were.

455
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:06,263
So should we?

456
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,598
What?

457
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,250
Open the door.

458
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:10,651
Yeah, sure. Why not?

459
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:11,819
Come on.

460
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:12,820
You got it?

461
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:13,938
Mm-hmm.

462
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,486
Oh. Did it always
smell like this?

463
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,444
I think it did.

464
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,379
Now, if I remember

465
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,648
I bet we've still
got some candles.

466
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,784
What?

467
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,453
Yep. Look at this.

468
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,687
Got a match?

469
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,091
Oh, my God.

470
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,494
Shelly, I'll ask you to commit
three things to memory:

471
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,396
A fire engine, a mobile home

472
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,864
and, um, a pen.

473
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,865
Why?

474
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,533
Just try to remember them.

475
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,452
Now, can you tell me the date?

476
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,920
Get away!

477
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:47,488
Temp's up to 103.5.

478
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,390
We're running out of time.

479
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,959
Shelly, the date?

480
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,562
I already told Dr. Green Bean.

481
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,831
Was she oriented to time?

482
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,499
More or less.

483
00:16:58,535 --> 00:16:59,884
Oriented to time.

484
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:05,306
Shelly, can you spell
"world" backwards?

485
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:10,928
U-o-y-w-e-r-c-s.

486
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,231
Screw you...

487
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,599
Backwards.

488
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,101
Right.

489
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,503
Good concentration.

490
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,907
Now, can you remember
the things I told you earlier?

491
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,408
Yes.

492
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,243
What are they?

493
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,896
Fire engine, a
pen, a mobile home.

494
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:31,365
Now, leave me alone, Cornpone.

495
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,686
She's oriented to
person, time and place

496
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,955
and her mental
status exam is normal.

497
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,768
She's uncooperative,
she speaks in rhyme

498
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,170
and she's
indifferent to the fact

499
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,804
that she could die
without treatment.

500
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,580
There are specific criteria
to define incompetence.

501
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:46,781
She doesn't meet them.

502
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,327
We're talking about
a woman with no I.D.

503
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,095
found passed
out in a restaurant.

504
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,786
She still doesn't
meet the criteria.

505
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,932
Do you realize that your
decision could kill her?

506
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,274
You know, that kind of
hyperbole isn't very helpful.

507
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,477
The fact is, patients have a
right to make bad decisions.

508
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,212
Not when they're demented.

509
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,947
That's where we disagree.

510
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,983
Get McDonald down here.

511
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,052
Tell him it's life or death.

512
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,269
Dr. Benton? Yeah.

513
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,094
The Serena kid's in
second-degree heart block.

514
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,373
Where's his chart?

515
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,608
This is Kenner's patient?

516
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,977
Yeah, but Kenner's
back in surgery.

517
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,433
Where're the labs?

518
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,835
On the chart.

519
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,137
The calcium's not here.

520
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,572
Well, it must not
have been picked up.

521
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,641
Give him 30 of Lasix, I.V. push

522
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,476
and run a liter of saline.

523
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,844
We've got to diurese him.

524
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,845
Where the hell is Gant?

525
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:35,846
I don't know.

526
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:36,847
Damn!

527
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,993
Dr. Fogg at Cambridge

528
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,695
did a similar study with rodents

529
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,964
and found he could
double serum-cortisol

530
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,688
with five minutes
on the treadmill.

531
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,523
How many more minutes do I have?

532
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,757
Fifteen.

533
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,827
Dr. Weaver, I'm getting
a reading of 500 lux.

534
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,328
Put the goggles on her.

535
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,479
Goggles?

536
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,815
The lights in here
approximate daylight.

537
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,551
We want to make sure
your body thinks it's night.

538
00:18:57,587 --> 00:19:00,020
Aha. What else do
I have to do, Kerry?

539
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,321
One more exertion test

540
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,590
heart and lung
readings, and that's it.

541
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,943
Yeah, Wendy, let's
take the RPM's up to 90.

542
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
No.

543
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,819
Okay.

544
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,572
You know, I met the
guy once, last summer.

545
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,608
Some type of mortgage broker.

546
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,343
Mm-hmm.

547
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,178
I just don't know when
she started seeing him.

548
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,324
Gant, what are you
doing down here

549
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:26,425
when there's a
kid up in the SICU

550
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:27,314
dying of hypercalcemia?

551
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,315
Kenner's patient.

552
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:29,828
You were supposed
to monitor his calcium.

553
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:30,651
I sent the labs in.

554
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:31,814
What good is sending the labs in

555
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:32,669
if you don't check them?

556
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,882
They said it was
going to take an hour.

557
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,839
Gant, look at this.

558
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,157
13.5.

559
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,852
The kid went into
a Brady arrhythmia.

560
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,677
I was about to go get them.

561
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,291
You know, Gant, that's the
kind of excuse that kills patients.

562
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,542
Now, look, if you
can't do the job,

563
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:44,532
or don't want to the job

564
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,811
then you don't need to be here.

565
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,368
You make another stupid,
lazy mistake like that

566
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:49,837
man, you won't be.

567
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,849
Hey. Hey, you okay?

568
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,220
Uh... oh, it's a code.

569
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,688
I'm on the code team.

570
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,490
Listen, we'll talk, all right?

571
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,792
We'll talk when I get back.

572
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,459
It's weird being
down here again.

573
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,750
Makes me realize how
unhappy I was then.

574
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,418
When you were with me?

575
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,220
Yeah. I mean, it
wasn't your fault.

576
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,856
I just didn't think
much of myself.

577
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,435
I'm sure I didn't help.

578
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,593
Well, a lot of
stuff didn't help.

579
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,113
But it's just different
now, you know?

580
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,597
I actually feel good.

581
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,350
So, what's different, besides
us not being together?

582
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,686
Well, you know, I used to
think I couldn't do things.

583
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,354
Now I'm taking a pre-med course.

584
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,957
Well, I trust you did
well on your midterms.

585
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,726
B-plus.

586
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,673
Clearly, you're not
trying hard enough.

587
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,030
Yeah.

588
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:51,732
I guess it's about feeling
in control, you know?

589
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,100
I guess.

590
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:56,570
And then, of course, there's
things you can't control.

591
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,072
Such as?

592
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:00,307
Administration's making
me fire two nurses.

593
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,276
Really?

594
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,927
Yeah, but don't tell anyone.

595
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:04,928
None of them know

596
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,675
and I don't know
who it's gonna be.

597
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,210
I'm not going to say a thing.

598
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,078
You know what's
really depressing?

599
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,051
What?

600
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:12,703
Being here right now.

601
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,748
It makes me realize

602
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,884
how much happier
I was back then.

603
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,509
God, you're pathetic.

604
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,528
Yes.

605
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:27,334
You're on the code team?

606
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,536
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

607
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:30,782
Well, where is A-360?

608
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,706
I was just going
to ask that, too.

609
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:33,752
Hey, you know where A-360 is?

610
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,486
Somebody's having
a heart attack.

611
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,723
Sorry. Have you
seen the men's room?

612
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,024
Got a report of a
toilet overflowing.

613
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,198
Nope, can't help you.

614
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,066
290, 310...

615
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,352
that's 320...

616
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,353
330...

617
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,669
It must be this way.

618
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,028
I'll do central
line, you intubate.

619
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,340
I'll do the central line.

620
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:56,664
Ever run the code before?

621
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:59,059
I've run more
codes than you have.

622
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,553
Well, here's the toilet.

623
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:05,990
Code team? Yeah.

624
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,035
You're a little late.

625
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,339
Oh, no.

626
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,510
All right, I'll take over.

627
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,649
I got it.

628
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,986
He's got a rhythm.

629
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,103
Yeah, I got a pulse.

630
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,204
Oh, thank God.

631
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,851
CPR course finally paid off.

632
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,603
Now, if I could
just find that john.

633
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:26,726
Dr. Carter will show you.

634
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,064
You know why I hate
going to a shrink?

635
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,215
Why?

636
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,329
Because you have to talk
about yourself all the time.

637
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,570
That's kind of the point, Doug.

638
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,738
No, it's embarrassing.

639
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,306
I tell her about my patients.

640
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:40,724
She lets you do that?

641
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,121
Sometimes.

642
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:43,739
She says I prefer
talking about them

643
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:46,497
'cause solving their problems
is easier than solving my own.

644
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,099
That's probably true.

645
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,785
Sometimes yeah, sometimes no.

646
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,308
You thinking about Charlie?

647
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,128
No. It's... I was
tough on her today.

648
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,530
Well, no, you gave her a chance.

649
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:04,698
Several.

650
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,066
There's a certain point

651
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:08,251
you just got to
say, "no, it's over."

652
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,887
Hmm.

653
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,723
Why do those words
sound familiar to me?

654
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,435
Hey, Mark.

655
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,548
Connie and I wrote
a personal ad for you.

656
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,537
Want to hear it?

657
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,806
Sure.

658
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,974
Okay, "Sensitive doctor,
tall, white and handsome..."

659
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,309
Handsome? Really?

660
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,344
Sure. Why not?

661
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,262
"Loves the Cubs
and Kawasakis..."

662
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:36,975
Wait, wait. Hold
on. I own a bike.

663
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,882
I don't know if I love it.

664
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,345
Say it anyway. Chicks
love guys with bikes.

665
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:41,334
That reminds me, I
got mine in the garage.

666
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,268
Your bike?

667
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:44,165
Yeah, the attendant
let me keep it here

668
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,435
for the winter, but I
haven't run it in awhile.

669
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:47,591
Your battery is gonna die.

670
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,288
I know. I've got to start it up.

671
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:51,178
Don't mention the bike thing.

672
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:54,431
I mean, I don't want to
attract motorcycle chicks.

673
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,834
You mean someone like me?

674
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,986
No, I didn't mean...

675
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,671
Mark, Shelly's not in her room,
and her clothes are gone too.

676
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:02,772
Check the rest rooms.

677
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,018
I did that already.

678
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,543
Randi, Randi, did you see
a female patient leave here?

679
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,479
Brown hair and red hat? Yeah.

680
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,724
Yeah, she just left.

681
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,925
I'll get security.

682
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,216
Can you grab my coat?

683
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,317
Yeah.

684
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:24,261
Shelly.

685
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,895
Shelly?

686
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,232
Shelly, you need
to come back inside.

687
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,666
I want the bus.

688
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,168
Shelly, listen to me.

689
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,402
You're very sick.

690
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,238
We need to treat you, okay?

691
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,339
Right away.

692
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,440
Go away.

693
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,508
Shelly, come on.

694
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,009
Hey. Hey, hey!

695
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,455
Put me down! Help! Help!

696
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,779
I want to go on the bus!

697
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,148
Hey!

698
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,683
Put me down!

699
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,286
Help! Help!

700
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,255
Help!

701
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:56,059
Why are you hurting me?

702
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,111
Grab her legs.

703
00:24:58,147 --> 00:25:00,030
Chuny, take her shoulders.

704
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,699
Malik, bring her knees

705
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:02,700
up to her chest.

706
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:03,701
What are you doing?

707
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,136
I'm going give you a
shot to numb the skin.

708
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,188
No! No needles, please!

709
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:10,190
No!

710
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,693
I don't see a Psych hold.

711
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:13,711
Help me.

712
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,261
I got tired of waiting.

713
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,610
Help... Help...

714
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,851
Hold still. Help me!

715
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,230
I want the names
of everyone here.

716
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,320
Chuny Marquez.

717
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,366
Lydia Wright.

718
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,489
Malik McGrath.

719
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,974
No, please.

720
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,327
No.

721
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:33,680
No.

722
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:36,733
I got fluid.

723
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,051
Nope. It's just that there I was

724
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:41,622
baring my soul in a way
I never really have before

725
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:43,234
and all of a sudden,
I hear snoring.

726
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:44,725
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

727
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,627
Oh, God, and I've got 5½ hours

728
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,862
to make my big staff decision.

729
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:49,974
What am I gonna do?

730
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:52,065
I'm sorry. I wasn't
listening. What?

731
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,400
Oh, you're hilarious.

732
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:54,735
Oh, my God.

733
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,236
Charlie?

734
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,604
Connie, get a gurney!

735
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,605
Let's go!

736
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,218
What happened? Let me see.

737
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:01,208
He found me.

738
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:02,209
The pimp?

739
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,944
Get the gurney, Connie!

740
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,278
Hey.

741
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,913
Benton was out of line.

742
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:07,914
Was he?

743
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,316
Way out of line.

744
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:11,630
I felt like punching
out the bastard.

745
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,354
That would be unwise.

746
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,922
I suppose I could tell Anspaugh.

747
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,636
Then again, I don't know.

748
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,938
I think Benton's
right, you know?

749
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,040
Lately, I been one step behind

750
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:23,630
five minutes too late.

751
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,965
See you.

752
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:28,335
I thought you were
covering the E.R.

753
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:29,514
It's dead.

754
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:30,937
What I wouldn't give

755
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,517
for a good five-car pileup.

756
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:35,476
It's 3:00.

757
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,780
Time for the Charlie
Chan mystery movie.

758
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:45,552
<i>And what's the
point of this, exactly?</i>

759
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:48,099
We want to compare
your Cortisol levels

760
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,968
after indoor and
outdoor exertion.

761
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:51,124
That's it, right, Kerry?

762
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,659
No more sweating after this.

763
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,161
Get your knees up,
like a drum major.

764
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,475
That's it. There you go.

765
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:58,065
Go. Go. Go.

766
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,519
Okay, sweetheart,
now squeeze this hand.

767
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,021
Good. All right.

768
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,555
Now squeeze this hand.

769
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,556
Ow!

770
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,557
That's okay.

771
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,769
That's all right.

772
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,106
Okay, she's got a
broken right ulna.

773
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,562
Ears are clear.

774
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,898
All right. Can you
move your jaw for me?

775
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:15,899
Side to side.

776
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,434
It hurts.

777
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,503
It's okay. You're
going to be fine.

778
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,837
Let's get a Panorex.

779
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,906
I think she's got a broken jaw.

780
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,143
Let's get a film of the
chest, right arm, orbits.

781
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,612
Doug?

782
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,283
She has bruising
around her groin.

783
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,318
She may have been raped.

784
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,821
Okay.

785
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,274
All right, kiddo.

786
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,259
It's okay.

787
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:48,081
So you got an idea

788
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:49,082
that's gonna make
you a millionaire?

789
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:50,083
Yeah. Money in the bank.

790
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,529
All right. Let's hear it.

791
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:52,519
Flypaper in a can...

792
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:53,520
Say what?

793
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:54,654
It's like aerosol.

794
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:57,424
You spray it on your
car so bugs will stick to it.

795
00:27:57,459 --> 00:28:00,893
Then you peel off one big sheet,
then boom, your car is clean.

796
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,129
You're kidding, right?

797
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,608
No. I'll call it "bug-off."

798
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:05,665
That's the dumbest
idea I ever heard.

799
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,878
Yeah. Why not just
clean it with a hose?

800
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:10,370
Okay, I got another one.
Stethoscope condoms.

801
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,838
I don't even want to know.

802
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:14,124
Take my advice:
Don't quit your day job.

803
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,248
How's it going?

804
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,283
Oh, Dr. Kenner.

805
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:25,585
We had a bit of a
scare with this one.

806
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,186
His calcium went up to 13.5,

807
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:29,990
which sent him into
second-degree heart block.

808
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:31,224
I had to diurese him

809
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:33,779
but we got him back
to a normal sinus.

810
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,750
Well, looks fine now.

811
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:42,752
Good work.

812
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,221
Thank you.

813
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,623
Oh, uh, Dr. Kenner...

814
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:50,961
I'd like to do another
pediatric rotation

815
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,930
and I'd like to do it with you.

816
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,500
Uh... correct me if I'm wrong.

817
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:00,020
I understood that Dr. Keaton
isn't recommending you.

818
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:03,123
Hmm. She told you that.

819
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,058
Well, it is a pretty small club.

820
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,505
We do talk occasionally.

821
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:09,062
Dr. Kenner, I learned
a lot from Dr. Keaton

822
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,614
but, um...

823
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,766
our styles were very different.

824
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,668
We didn't quite... mesh.

825
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:20,707
Why don't you
talk to her and, uh...

826
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:25,128
tell her your perspective
about not meshing and so on

827
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,164
and maybe she'll reconsider.

828
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,731
And if she did?

829
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,883
Then we could talk.

830
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,903
But, um...

831
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,173
without a recommendation,
I really can't help you.

832
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,513
Where am I going?

833
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,514
To Radiology.

834
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,882
We're going to take some X rays

835
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,251
and then we're gonna use a
machine called a CAT scan,

836
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,519
make sure your head's okay.

837
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,122
I'm scared.

838
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,106
It's okay.

839
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,858
I'll come with you.

840
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,076
Doug?

841
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,165
Hang on.

842
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,900
You want me to get a rape kit?

843
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,335
I'm gonna talk to her,

844
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,481
see if I can find
out what happened.

845
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,756
Okay.

846
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,210
Which bone would you choose?

847
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,645
I don't know, maybe a finger.

848
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:23,002
No. If I had to choose
which bone to break

849
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,103
I'd choose a clavicle.

850
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:25,617
Oh, that's good, no
surgical intervention.

851
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:28,174
Personally, I'd go
with a skull fracture.

852
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,175
Oh, you would.

853
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,577
Hey, Carol.

854
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:33,257
<i>"Venture to Karachi

Put the book down.

Dr. Keaton?

861
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,047
Did you lock the door?

862
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,198
I thought you did.

863
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:53,199
No, I...

864
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:54,434
Dr. Keaton, I...

Peter, could you
wait outside, please?

866
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,519
Anything?

867
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:15,700
Just doing the ink stain now.

868
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,690
I admire you, Dr. Greene.

869
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:19,192
That took guts.

870
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:21,155
Well, thank you
for your support.

871
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,124
And don't worry
about that lawyer

872
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,849
'cause I'm going to
take full responsibility.

873
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,184
They can't fire all of us.

874
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,836
Yeah.

875
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:32,405
Sorry if I offended you earlier

876
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,435
with that motorcycle crack.

877
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,059
Takes a lot to offend me.

878
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,744
Yeah, but seriously

879
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,064
I'd be lucky to find
someone like you.

880
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,150
Want to get the lights?

881
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:45,384
Oh, yeah.

882
00:31:55,064 --> 00:31:57,630
Is it meningitis?

883
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,049
Cryptococcus.

884
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,235
You were right.

885
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,599
Randi, have you seen
a big, black binder?

886
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:17,934
The nursing budget?

887
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:18,969
Yeah.

888
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,637
Uh, it fell out of the cubby.

889
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,505
So, I sort of
started looking at it.

890
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,473
Well, where is it?

891
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,074
Bad news for some people, huh?

892
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,154
You shouldn't have
been looking at it.

893
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,144
I was curious.

894
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,256
I took an accounting course

895
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,825
for my fashion line, you know.

896
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,849
Well, that's no excuse.

897
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,598
It's the overtime
that's killing you.

898
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,805
What?

899
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,618
ER nurses work 12-hour shifts

900
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:43,037
and after eight hours,
they get overtime.

901
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,356
That's what's screwing
with your budget.

902
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,647
Well, I don't know
what else we can do.

903
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:49,694
Put everybody on
eight-hour shifts.

904
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,052
You'd save 100 grand a year.

905
00:32:57,693 --> 00:33:00,744
I know how these
teacher/intern relationships

906
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,678
can undermine reputations...

907
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,647
The innuendo and rumors.

908
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:09,385
I need to know if you're
going to be discreet about this.

909
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,720
Dr. Keaton, I came by

910
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,022
to see if you would
reconsider writing me

911
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,007
a recommendation.

912
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,141
Oh.

913
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:17,861
I mean, you've always
complimented my surgical skills.

914
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,708
A recommendation on that basis

915
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:22,532
I could get another
pediatric rotation.

916
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,735
And if I don't?

917
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:28,933
What do you mean, if you don't?

918
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:32,776
Will you report my
relationship with Dr. Carter?

919
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:36,362
You think I'm threatening you?

920
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:38,481
Are you?

921
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:44,103
Dr. Keaton, if your
recommendation

922
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:46,890
isn't based on my
abilities as a doctor

923
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,643
I don't want it.

924
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,715
I can't do that, Peter.

925
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,885
You've got the makings
of an excellent surgeon

926
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,972
but not a pediatric surgeon.

927
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:20,784
Dr. Greene, another
letter from Legal.

928
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,009
Ah, what do you know?

929
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,777
I've been written up again.

930
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,246
Wow. Twice in one night.

931
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,580
They CC'd Anspaugh.

932
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:29,127
That was very thoughtful.

933
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,283
Jerks.

934
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,530
Why don't I just get
some 8 x 11 frames

935
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:34,432
and I can just put these
right up on the wall.

936
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:35,888
You should do it.

937
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,990
Dr. Greene, this is
George Dunleavy.

938
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,737
Hi. What can I do for you?

939
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:43,212
The police said that you may
have found my sister, Shelly.

940
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,332
She called a couple of days ago

941
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:46,899
and said she was sick.

942
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:48,868
I told her to go see a doctor.

943
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,738
Haven't heard from her since.

944
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:55,241
Does your sister have
any psychiatric problems?

945
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:56,476
No.

946
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,811
She was pretty incoherent.

947
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,797
Meningitis can cause

948
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,315
temporary dementia.

949
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,161
Will she be all right?

950
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:08,004
Take a day or two,
but she should be fine.

951
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,673
Thank you, doctor.

952
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,940
Sure.

953
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,552
Dr. Benton, I just
want to let you know

954
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,621
that Dr. Keaton and I

955
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,534
never talked about you,
never said anything about you

956
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,192
remotely negative<i> ever.</i>

957
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,796
Carter, it never occurred
to me that you had.

958
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,531
Dr. Benton, we were
just talking about you.

959
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,466
Dr. Gant feels

960
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,468
that you've treated
him inappropriately

961
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,204
by publicly upbraiding him.

962
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,905
Calling him lazy and stupid,

963
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,874
I understand?

964
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,444
No, no, no. I said what
he <i>did</i> was lazy and stupid.

965
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,889
I don't think that
was inappropriate

966
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,475
due to the fact that his
inattention almost killed a child.

967
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:51,765
That's not true.

968
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,032
You neglected your duties.

969
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,478
If you feel that way, then
you come speak to me...

970
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:55,185
You don't yell at me...

971
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,252
All right.

972
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,220
Settle down.

973
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,604
Carter...

974
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,490
You were there, weren't you?

975
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,591
Mm-hmm.

976
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,576
Do you feel

977
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:05,195
Dr. Benton's reaction
was inappropriate?

978
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,599
Well, his language was strong,

979
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,286
and I can certainly
understand how Dennis feels.

980
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,173
But given the circumstances

981
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,126
I'm not sure I'd
call it inappropriate.

982
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:22,139
Sounds like you

983
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:25,531
have to develop
thicker skin, Dr. Gant

984
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:28,067
and if similar issues
arise in the future

985
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,502
I suggest you

986
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,637
take them up with
Dr. Benton directly

987
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:33,573
before you come crying to me.

988
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,369
The hard truth is, we
don't have any more money.

989
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,188
Word came down that they
want me to let people go.

990
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,411
So who gets fired?

991
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,663
Nobody.

992
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:57,897
I just sent up a proposal

993
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:59,293
that will solve our
budget problems

994
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,812
without anyone
losing their jobs.

995
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:03,236
You're cutting back hours?

996
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:05,972
No. But instead of working
three 12-hour shifts a week

997
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:08,140
everyone will work
five eight-hour shifts.

998
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:09,437
For the same money?

999
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:10,677
A little less.

1000
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:14,664
But we have to work
four hours more a week.

1001
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,516
That sucks.

1002
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,529
Guys, the alternative is
that two of you are history.

1003
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:20,737
I don't buy that.
They got the money.

1004
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,249
I'm not giving up my
OT, I'll tell you that.

1005
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,506
None of us are.

1006
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,136
We've got a contract
negotiation coming up.

1007
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,188
If management pulls this

1008
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,478
we walk.

1009
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:29,646
That's right.

1010
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,066
I didn't think you'd
really go to Anspaugh.

1011
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,031
Look, I'm sorry.

1012
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,737
Don't worry about it.

1013
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,689
I didn't know what to say.

1014
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:58,468
With Benton
standing right there...

1015
00:37:58,492 --> 00:37:59,776
John, John, it's okay.

1016
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,794
I didn't mean to
put you on the spot.

1017
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:05,765
So we're cool?

1018
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,734
Yeah, we're cool.

1019
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:11,004
I better get back to the ER.

1020
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,039
I'll see you later.

1021
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,808
It's like an x-ray of your head.

1022
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,143
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1023
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,679
Will you stay with me?

1024
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,681
I'll be in the next room.

1025
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,070
Charlie, were you raped?

1026
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:51,177
Promise you won't tell the
cops or the social worker?

1027
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:53,946
I'm not going to tell anybody.

1028
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,089
Okay.

1029
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:04,774
You're going to be okay.

1030
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,642
Here we go.

1031
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,422
Hey, Mark!

1032
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,591
Mark!

1033
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,925
Mark!

1034
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,105
Hey, you forgot
your curriculum vitae.

1035
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,429
Oh, thanks.

1036
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,731
But after tonight, I
figure my chances

1037
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,700
for making tenure are about nil.

1038
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,101
But hey, I did my job

1039
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,936
and I can do my job somewhere

1040
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,255
tenure or no tenure.

1041
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,489
Same here.

1042
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:38,336
They're trying to
mess with our overtime.

1043
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,620
I say screw them.
I'll go someplace else.

1044
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,810
That's the spirit.

1045
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,122
Well, got to go.

1046
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,666
Hey, Chuny, you hungry? You
want to grab some breakfast with me?

1047
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:45,899
Sure.

1048
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:48,935
Okay, first, I got to
take the bike for a spin

1049
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,114
around the garage just
to charge the battery.

1050
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,505
Why don't I charge
it up with you?

1051
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,173
Sure. Hop on.

1052
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:05,530
You want me to
get inside this box?

1053
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:07,720
This<i> box</i> is a body
plethysmograph.

1054
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,189
It's the most accurate method

1055
00:40:09,224 --> 00:40:10,790
for measuring lung capacity.

1056
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,503
And why is that important?

1057
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:13,993
I need accurate specifications

1058
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:15,528
on all my research subjects

1059
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,229
or I can't correlate the data.

1060
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:18,509
I'm sorry, Kerry. I
get claustrophobic.

1061
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,177
Jeanie, look at all the
windows. You can look out.

1062
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,478
I'm sorry, I can't.

1063
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,102
Jeanie, if you
don't get in the box

1064
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:24,882
I have to throw out the entire
study. That's two months work.

1065
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:26,739
I'm not getting in the box.

1066
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:27,818
You're getting paid $50.

1067
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,986
Shut up, Wendy.

1068
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,075
Jeanie, please.

1069
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,321
I'm sorry. I can't.

1070
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,745
Well, how about that?

1071
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,746
Wendy...

1072
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:34,747
What?

1073
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:35,915
Get in the box.

1074
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,828
First, we'll test
your lung volume

1075
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,597
and then you're
getting on the bike.

1076
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:40,920
But it's almost daylight.

1077
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,254
Wear the goggles.

1078
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,809
You won't know the difference.

1079
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,096
How is she?

1080
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,917
She's got a broken arm.

1081
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,920
A lot of bruises, concussion.

1082
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,588
She was raped.

1083
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,307
I'll get the rape kit
and call the police.

1084
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,826
What time does that
social worker get here?

1085
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,495
They should be on now.

1086
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,146
You want me to call?

1087
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:12,168
No. I'll do it.

1088
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,906
Hey, the eggs are burning.

1089
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:34,407
Oh, well.

1090
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:37,043
I'll just have to
make some more.

1091
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,744
Mm.

1092
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:44,133
I don't remember
calling for a surgeon.

1093
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,345
Well, this one's surgical.

1094
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,413
Finally got a good one.

1095
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,757
Some guy got hit by the El.

1096
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,518
What you got?

1097
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,285
We got a mess. Take a look.

1098
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,726
Yuck.

1099
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,693
Which end is up?

1100
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,729
Jumped or fell
in front of a train.

1101
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,732
Open skull fracture,
multiple extremity fractures,

1102
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,134
flailed chest.

1103
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:02,468
Any signs of life?

1104
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:04,070
He's got a weak pulse.

1105
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,039
Now all he needs is a face.

1106
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:07,440
BP's 60/40.

1107
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:08,841
He ain't going to last.

1108
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:11,044
All right, grab
hold, on my count.

1109
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,578
One, two, three.

1110
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,097
What is this?

1111
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,464
Man versus moving El train.

1112
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,599
Suicide?

1113
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,345
One guy said he jumped,
the other guy said he tripped.

1114
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,519
Just lost the pulse.

1115
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:22,238
Put O-neg on a rapid
infuser, set up a central line.

1116
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,184
Somebody page Gant he's
supposed to cover the ER.

1117
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,341
I'll do it.

1118
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,943
Carter, how are his eyes?

1119
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:27,843
He's lost one.

1120
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,062
The other one is swollen shut.

1121
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,080
Grey matter in the hair.

1122
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,176
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

1123
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,077
I'll put in a chest
tube. I'll do it.

1124
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,562
No. I'll do it. It's a
surgical procedure.

1125
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,702
Whose beeper?

1126
00:42:36,738 --> 00:42:37,932
It's coming from the patient.

1127
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,973
Lydia, what number
did you page Gant to?

1128
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,241
This room. 3376.

1129
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,475
That's the number

1130
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:44,710
on this pager.

1131
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:46,378
Oh, my God.

1132
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:47,379
What?

1133
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:48,380
The patient.

1134
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:50,366
It's Gant.

1135
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,568
Dennis?

1136
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,205
Oh, sweet Jesus!

1137
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,274
Carter, put the tube in!

1138
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,609
Oh, God!

1139
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:00,943
Set up a thorasceal!

1140
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,712
Flatline.

1141
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,530
Give an amp of epi and atropine.

1142
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:06,983
Hang another two
units. Let's go, Carter!

1143
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,263
I'm trying! I'm trying!

1144
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,920
Come on Carter! Get it in!

1145
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,221
Come on, Gant.

1146
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,459
Come on.

1147
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:17,626
Come on.

1148
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:18,828
Come on.
