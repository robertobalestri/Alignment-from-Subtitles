1
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,646
Mom?

2
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,099
Oh, did I wake you?

3
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:36,201
What are you doing?

4
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,003
I'm making you breakfast.

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,422
Where's the coffee?

6
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,608
How are you feeling?

7
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,177
Sleeping okay?

8
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,545
Like a baby.

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,580
No nightmares?

10
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:49,648
No.

11
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,767
It would only be natural.

12
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:55,804
Mom... I see worse
stuff at work every day.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,007
Today's the big day, right?

14
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,393
The test?

15
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,595
No. Find out about your job.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,230
Mom, they suspended me.

17
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,776
I might not get my job back.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,033
Those eggs done?

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,019
No, still too runny.

20
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,121
I like them runny.

21
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,624
Another couple minutes.

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,225
What test?

23
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,745
Medical school
admissions test, Mom.

24
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,364
I thought you gave up on that.

25
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,950
No.

26
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,036
Hmm, big commitment.

27
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,672
Here we go.

28
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,207
Perfect.

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,580
Hmm... doctor...

30
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:39,731
That would be something.

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,598
I could do it.

32
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,666
I know you could.

33
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,650
I could.

34
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,518
I said so.

35
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:45,137
Why do you always do that?

36
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,004
Do what?

37
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,989
Make me feel

38
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,257
like I'm incapable, stupid.

39
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,259
I said I thought
you could do it.

40
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:53,495
I just wish that for once
you would believe in me.

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,729
I believe in you.

42
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:56,242
You're always criticizing,
belittling, making me feel

43
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,632
like I can't do anything.

44
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:58,516
That's not true.

45
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,717
Why didn't you ever tell me

46
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,681
I could be a lawyer or a
pilot or a damn astronaut?!

47
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,138
You wanted to be an astronaut?

48
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,501
No, but I wanted
you to tell me I could.

49
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,692
Fine. Go be an astronaut.

50
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,530
I'm your mother.

51
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,498
I love you, whoever you are...

52
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,249
doctor, nurse, housewife...

53
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:17,686
Oh, right... housewife.

54
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,254
You hold you back, not me.

55
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,834
You're the one that always

56
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,073
quits everything,

57
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,420
always frightened that
you're not good enough.

58
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,145
I finish things.

59
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,830
Ballet, cheerleading,
uh... the flute.

60
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,082
I was 13.

61
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,917
Business school...

62
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,081
your own wedding.

63
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,274
I finished nursing
school, didn't I?

64
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,336
Right.

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,442
Exactly.

66
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,861
You've got a great
job you're good at,

67
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,941
so why is the grass
suddenly greener?

68
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,143
You have a good life.

69
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,684
I'm proud of you.

70
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,904
Why aren't you
proud of yourself?

71
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:01,329
Carla! Carla!

72
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:02,831
Hey, Carla.

73
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,243
I was coming to see you.

74
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,047
I didn't know you had
to be to work this early.

75
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,437
I don't.

76
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:11,039
Look, uh...

77
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:12,819
Carla, I'm sorry
I haven't called.

78
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,353
This... lot of stuff came up.

79
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,744
Uh-huh.

80
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,179
I just had a lot of stuff
going on, you know?

81
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:20,582
I had minor surgery
and all this other...

82
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:21,717
Sorry to hear that.

83
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:22,784
Are you okay?

84
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,397
Yeah, it was just my appendix.

85
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,466
I mean, I'm still a
little sore, but I'm okay.

86
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,823
How about you? You okay?

87
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,190
Peter, what do you want?

88
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:30,336
Well, we need to talk.

89
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,593
Uh-uh.

90
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,162
I told you that I was
pregnant weeks ago, okay?

91
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:35,764
Then nothing... no phone calls,

92
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,799
no coming by to
see how I was doing.

93
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:38,800
Silence.

94
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:39,801
I got the point.

95
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:40,969
It's cool, I got it.

96
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,540
Look, I wasn't trying
to make a point.

97
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:46,575
Look...

98
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,743
Carla...

99
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,978
I realize there's going
to be a baby here.

100
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:52,147
He's going to be as
much my responsibility

101
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,364
as he is yours.

102
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,784
I just needed some time
to think about this thing.

103
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,052
I mean, no, it's not the
way I would've planned it,

104
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:59,554
but I'm not going to let you

105
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,055
go through this
thing by yourself.

106
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,402
You going to marry me, Peter?

107
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,059
That's not what I'm saying.

108
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,973
So what are you saying? What?

109
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,342
You're going to stop
by every so often

110
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,910
and change a few diapers,

111
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,612
bounce the baby on your knee

112
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:14,581
for a couple of Kodak moments?

113
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,872
The child's going to
need a good school,

114
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:18,272
a nice place to live.

115
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:21,420
And you're saying I can't
provide those things?

116
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:23,378
I'm saying I can help, Carla.

117
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,846
Money.

118
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,893
So that is what
this is all about.

119
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,817
Yeah, that, among other things.

120
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,386
The child's going to
need a man in his life.

121
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,822
Well, who says that this baby

122
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,424
will not have a man in his life?

123
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,826
So what are you saying?

124
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,327
You seeing somebody else?

125
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,942
Peter, you know, you and I...

126
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:46,167
We've known each
other for a very long time.

127
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,581
I never expected
you to marry me.

128
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:51,406
I never expected a
damn thing from you.

129
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:52,841
You care about you.

130
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,677
And that is the way
it has always been.

131
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,479
But, you know, it's
comforting, really.

132
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:01,500
It's one of the few
constants in my life.

133
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,113
You don't have to
worry about it, Peter.

134
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,337
This baby's going to be fine.

135
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,655
Plenty to eat, nice clothes,
good man around to call Daddy.

136
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,458
I'm going to take
care of all those things.

137
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:12,827
You go back to
worrying about yourself,

138
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,279
because that's what you do best.

139
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,881
Dr. Benton! First day back, huh?

140
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,604
How's the incision
healing? Any discharge?

141
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,717
It's fine, Carter.

142
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,774
You know, you really
shouldn't be back on your feet

143
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,109
for extended
periods of time yet.

144
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,111
Did you finish that whole
course of antibiotics?

145
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,946
You don't want to
develop resistance.

146
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,059
Peter, how's the scar?

147
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,149
Is it itchy yet?

148
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,550
I made a Rocky-Davis incision,

149
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,185
running stitch,
McBurney's point.

150
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,831
You know, when the
hair starts to grow back,

151
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,599
that's when the
itching gets worse.

152
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,524
You going to show
us your scar, Peter?

153
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,525
Come on, let's see.

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,126
Yeah, come on,
let's take a look.

155
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,994
I did it one-handed, you know.

156
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,408
Come on, Carter, stop.

157
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,597
Carter, Carter!

158
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,310
You know, that's really a shame,

159
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,667
because it's a great job.

160
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,402
Good thing I took pictures, huh?

161
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,472
What is that, a mole?

162
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,617
Yeah, a big one, too.

163
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,974
Good morning, everybody.

164
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,076
What are you doing?

165
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,555
Ooh, yikes, what is that?!

166
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,213
That's Benton's appendix
in a jar on my mantel.

167
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,082
Wow! They really
shaved him good.

168
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,583
Somebody got carried away.

169
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,252
Dr. Carter, you're
still backed up.

170
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,587
Okay, on my way.

171
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,855
Carter looks beat.

172
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,657
Yeah, he was on
again last night.

173
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,571
Surgical interns
are still covering

174
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,795
all Dr. Gant's shifts.

175
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,729
What is that, like
a 90-hour week?

176
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,964
More like 95.

177
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,466
Thank God for Pediatrics.

178
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,514
Jerry, what is that all about?

179
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,239
Oh, nurses and management
are still at the table.

180
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,174
Their contract
expires at midnight.

181
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,478
Mark, paramedics are pulling
up with a 35-year-old female...

182
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,645
Respiratory failure.

183
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,713
Duty calls.

184
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,780
Hey, lunch?

185
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,016
Only if you're buying.

186
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,584
Carol finds out today, right?

187
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,263
Yeah, the investigation is done,

188
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,764
and nursing has the report.

189
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,921
You've seen it?

190
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,867
No, and I haven't heard anything

191
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,225
on the grapevine either.

192
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,304
How's she doing? She okay?

193
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,638
Yeah, she claims she's fine.

194
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,628
Okay, thanks. Nothing yet.

195
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,707
They're still at it.

196
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,531
Oh, man, I do not want
to walk a picket line.

197
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,233
Not in February,
that's for sure.

198
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,278
Hey, we stand firm.

199
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,635
That's easy for you to say.

200
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,303
You've got a husband with a job.

201
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,682
Believe me, they'll settle.

202
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,618
They can't run this
place without us.

203
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,908
That's what the air
traffic controllers said

204
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,278
before they started
parking cars for a living.

205
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,724
<i>One, two, three.</i>

206
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,114
37-year-old Down's patient.

207
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,051
Her mother found her in
bed in respiratory distress.

208
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,135
Resps shallow at 30.

209
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,236
BP's 100/50.

210
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,715
Mom said she had
a respiratory infection

211
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,704
a couple of weeks ago,
never fully recovered.

212
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,707
Where's the mother now?

213
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,053
She went to gather
up some of her stuff.

214
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,043
Said she'd follow in her car.

215
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,511
Two-plus pitting edema.

216
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:17,628
Hi, Louise.

217
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm Dr. Greene.

218
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,349
You having a little
trouble breathing?

219
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,484
Mm-hmm.

220
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,968
We'll make you
feel better, okay?

221
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,570
She's sweet,

222
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,772
scared, held my hand

223
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,918
all the way over.

224
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,459
Louise, can you tell
me what day it is?

225
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,160
No, you can't tell me?

226
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,312
No. Okay.

227
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,081
Dr. Doyle, why don't
you take a listen,

228
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,482
tell me what you hear?

229
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,217
Chuny, come hold Louise's hand.

230
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,318
You bet.

231
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,855
CBC lytes, EKG, chest film,

232
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,657
O2, six liters by mask.

233
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,607
Hi, Louise.

234
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:47,776
My name's Chuny.

235
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,822
S3 gallop and mitral regurg.

236
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:50,978
Indicating?

237
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,841
Possible cardiomyopathy,
probably from that viral infection.

238
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,150
Hey, Mark, I think she's
trying to say something.

239
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,285
Hey, Louise.

240
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,070
Louise, you need something?

241
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,272
Huh?

242
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,741
Louise, what's wrong?

243
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,543
Where's my mom?

244
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:06,644
Your mom?

245
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,745
Your mom

246
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,647
is coming real soon, okay?

247
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:10,765
Don't you worry.

248
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,433
So you can just relax.

249
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,802
You're doing great.

250
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,303
Okay?

251
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:18,273
Human Resources, Carol,
reviewed your incident report

252
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,540
in the ER procedures,

253
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,609
and they passed their
recommendations,

254
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,028
along with mine, on to
the Safety Committee.

255
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,180
And?

256
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,582
And they agreed with
us... That your mistake

257
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,200
was a result of systems problems

258
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,236
and not of negligence.

259
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,802
There will be a written warning

260
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,404
placed in your
file for one year,

261
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,107
and the three weeks you
missed due to your suspension

262
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,209
will be deducted from
your vacation time.

263
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,327
And that's it?

264
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,946
You preferred a public flogging?

265
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,048
You can start back today.

266
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,337
You don't have
to start back today.

267
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:52,673
No, thanks, I'm okay.

268
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,079
I, uh... I'd better
get back to work.

269
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,311
<i>La Bohème?</i> Don't say it

270
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,447
like it's a new strain
of resistant bacteria.

271
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,904
What is it, like
five hours long?

272
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,117
Forget it, really. I wouldn't
take you now if you begged me.

273
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,103
It's just that I've never
been much of an opera fan.

274
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:12,127
Now, if you had
Marcus Roberts tickets,

275
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,595
I would be there in a flash.

276
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,113
I got it, Greg.

277
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,759
You don't want to go, fine.

278
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,817
Is<i> La Bohème</i> the
one where they, like,

279
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,019
lop off all the nuns'
heads at the end?

280
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,153
It's set in Paris.

281
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,499
They're star-crossed
lovers and artists.

282
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,488
Artists?

283
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,035
Jeanie, hang on a
second. Look, I'm sorry.

284
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,336
If you really want
to go... we'll go.

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,404
Don't do me any favors, Greg.

286
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,438
I-I'd love to go.

287
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,661
What time's it start?

288
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,479
I just thought we
could do something

289
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:34,243
spontaneous,
something romantic, fun.

290
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,316
Opera?

291
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,085
I have to get
back to my patient.

292
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,598
Jeanie, let's hang
out anyway, okay?

293
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:40,099
Look, we'll order take-out.

294
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,884
The Bulls/Warriors
game is on channel nine...

295
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,142
You think you're
charming, but you aren't.

296
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,377
Good-bye, Greg.

297
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,456
Lunch, then?

298
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,491
At least let me buy you lunch.

299
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,541
Hey, Jeanie?!

300
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,393
That's one big, boggy heart.

301
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,117
God, it's taking up
most of her chest.

302
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,553
EKG shows ST and T
wave changes and PVCs.

303
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,828
What do you want to do?

304
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,589
Get an echo and page Cardiology.

305
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,991
Okay.

306
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,127
Mark, Louise's mother's here.

307
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,495
Hi, Mrs. Cupertino.

308
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,897
I'm Dr. Mark Greene.

309
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,031
How's Louise?

310
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,177
Not good.

311
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,679
Her heart isn't pumping well,

312
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,681
and her lungs
are filling with fluid.

313
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,804
Can I say hello?

314
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,079
Yeah, sure.

315
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,542
Hello, Louise.

316
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,944
It's Mommy.

317
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,262
Hi, Mommy.

318
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:22,464
You okay, baby?

319
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,699
You're not scared, are you?

320
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,802
Oh, baby...

321
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,904
I, uh... I brought
some of her things,

322
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,193
uh... just to make
her feel more at home.

323
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,179
I'll just put this quilt on her,

324
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,214
make sure she's good and warm.

325
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:41,499
Mrs. Cupertino,

326
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,551
can I speak to you for a minute?

327
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,910
She had trouble
understanding me earlier.

328
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,112
Can she communicate?

329
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,257
Oh, yes.

330
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,881
She likes to talk.

331
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,517
Is she suffering from any
dementia or Alzheimer's?

332
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,464
No, no, she's a good girl.

333
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,587
Okay.

334
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,739
Echo's on its way.

335
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,410
Is she competent to make
her own medical decisions?

336
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:10,795
No, I'm her guardian.

337
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,364
Louise can't make
decisions on her own.

338
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,334
You are aware that
Louise's condition

339
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,585
is very serious.

340
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,870
I'm worried that Louise

341
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,472
may need a heart transplant.

342
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,707
Is she already on
the UNOS waiting list?

343
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,841
The list? No.

344
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:24,876
She's not?

345
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,938
They wouldn't do it.

346
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:26,928
Wouldn't do what?

347
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:27,973
Put her on the list.

348
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,031
They wouldn't put Louise

349
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,760
on the heart transplant list?

350
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,401
No. Why not?

351
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,039
My daughter is mentally
retarded, Doctor.

352
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:44,595
Peter, sorry to
keep you waiting.

353
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,729
Welcome back.

354
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,876
Thanks.

355
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,965
We've missed you.

356
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,001
I was surprised
not to see my name

357
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,702
on today's schedule anywhere.

358
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,882
How are you feeling?

359
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,083
Well rested?

360
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,206
Yeah.

361
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,340
And mentally?

362
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,393
Feeling sharp?

363
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,061
No postoperative depression?

364
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,362
No.

365
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:02,997
No depression of any kind?

366
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,983
Dr. Hicks, if you're asking

367
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,286
if I can perform my
duties adequately, I can.

368
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,772
I'm asking how you are, Peter.

369
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,193
I'm fine.

370
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,561
Okay, then.

371
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,596
Let's see what we've got.

372
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,983
There's two portacaths,
a circumcision

373
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,886
and a nevus removal.

374
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,904
A mole?

375
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,239
UNOS can't refuse
to put her on the list

376
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,786
just because she has Down's.

377
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,678
I'm sure there are other
mitigating circumstances.

378
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,825
She's a retard, so
why bother, right?

379
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,416
Dr. Kayson, do
you know Dr. Doyle?

380
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,453
Echo shows left
ventricular dilatation

381
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,500
with an ejection
fraction of 18%.

382
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,908
There are also signs of
wall motion abnormality.

383
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,821
I'm worried about her breathing.

384
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:52,864
We've given her 40 Lasix,
and she's still struggling.

385
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,626
I'd like to try a vasodilator.

386
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,662
Sure, do whatever you
can to make her comfortable

387
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:57,797
before you release her.

388
00:13:57,821 --> 00:13:58,903
Release her?

389
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,466
Louise will be much happier

390
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,884
at home with her mother.

391
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,008
She needs a heart
transplant, right?

392
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,246
That would be the standard
operative course, yes.

393
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,647
Louise's mother told us

394
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,110
that she's not on
the transplant list.

395
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:11,949
That's correct.

396
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,018
UNOS can't refuse
to put a dying patient

397
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,815
on the list because of
a congenital birth defect.

398
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,932
UNOS didn't refuse

399
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,289
to put her on the list.

400
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,368
We did.

401
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,457
Cardiology?

402
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,138
Hospital Transplant Committee.

403
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,238
She was evaluated

404
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,174
and we chose not to
submit her name to UNOS.

405
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,497
That's a death sentence.

406
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,811
She's a 37-year-old
Down's patient.

407
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,434
She's lucky to have lived

408
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,752
this long.

409
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,272
Down's patients can
live into their 60s easy.

410
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,434
That's extremely rare.

411
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,741
What are you, an intern?

412
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,892
First-year resident, yes.

413
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,127
Why don't we just step in here?

414
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:46,417
Dr. Kayson,

415
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,835
Dr. Doyle, I think

416
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:51,138
is just expressing a frustration
that we probably all feel.

417
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:53,975
It seems that Louise would
be an obvious candidate

418
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,659
for the UNOS transplant list.

419
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,028
I'm a cardiologist.

420
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,697
I'd like nothing better than
to give her a new heart.

421
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,660
If you have a problem
with the decision,

422
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,918
take it up with the
rest of the committee.

423
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:04,953
Short of that...

424
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,104
send her home.

425
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,423
Nice guy.

426
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,618
Yeah.

427
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:15,796
Carol? You back?

428
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,797
Yeah.

429
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,399
Thank you, Jesus.

430
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:20,834
Hey, y'all, Carol's back.

431
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,835
Carol!

432
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:22,836
You're back.

433
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:23,915
Yeah, starting now.

434
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:25,339
Man, did we miss you.

435
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,841
We didn't think we
were going to make it.

436
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:29,010
Hi.

437
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,155
They dock your pay?

438
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,745
No, just some vacation time.

439
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,415
It's been a disaster
around here without you.

440
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,416
A complete zoo.

441
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,151
Hey, I didn't do that bad a job.

442
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,520
Oh, no, girlfriend, you
did worse than bad.

443
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:41,467
If you need to call a
union meeting, Haleh,

444
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:42,456
do it after work, please.

445
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,957
No union... Carol's back.

446
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,526
Oh, thank God.

447
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:47,039
We'll talk to you at lunch.

448
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,207
Yeah, we'll catch
up later, girl.

449
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:49,930
See you.

450
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,810
We're glad to have you back.

451
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:52,933
Thank you.

452
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:53,934
You okay?

453
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,202
Yeah, you know,

454
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:57,838
I'm sorry to disappoint
everyone's expectations,

455
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,873
but I'm fine.

456
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,144
Oh, it started a few
hours ago after breakfast.

457
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,978
It's a sharp pain?

458
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,281
No, sort of all over.

459
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,683
I just started my morning walk.

460
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,618
Any recent illness?

461
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,555
I take digoxin
for atrial fibril...

462
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,790
I never say that word.

463
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,125
Fibrillation?

464
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:19,293
Anything else?

465
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:20,544
No.

466
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,980
What did you have for
breakfast this morning?

467
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,192
Oh, the usual...

468
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,561
Three fried eggs,
bacon, glass of buttermilk,

469
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,763
toast and jam.

470
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,689
Oh, the American Heart
Association breakfast.

471
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,056
Don't lecture me, Doctor.

472
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,920
My mother had the
exact same breakfast

473
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:36,305
every day of her life.

474
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,863
Died last year at 96.

475
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,314
Car accident.

476
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,000
Vitals?

477
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,168
130/90.

478
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,571
Heart rate 110, resp 24.

479
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,607
Did Dr. Weaver get a CBC?

480
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,909
Yep, crit's 53,
white count's 12.2.

481
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,163
You drinking enough
fluids, Mrs. Jarnowski?

482
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,615
Is that what's wrong with me?

483
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,934
It's too early to tell.

484
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,670
Um... chest film?

485
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:03,705
Not back yet.

486
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:08,659
Okay, I'm going to call for
another surgical colleague

487
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,377
to come down and take a look.

488
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,230
Her breathing's improved.

489
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,066
Hi, Louise.

490
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,367
You feeling better?

491
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,886
For you.

492
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,455
Oh...

493
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,939
She likes to share.

494
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,874
Malibu Barbie was
my favorite, too.

495
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,559
I was kind of partial to Ken.

496
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:26,410
Ken?

497
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,094
You don't like Ken?

498
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,246
Too pretty.

499
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,126
I'm with you,
Louise... Ken's trouble.

500
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,301
Louise, can you
hold on to her for me

501
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,368
while I do my work?

502
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:35,369
Okay.

503
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,405
Thanks.

504
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,771
She misses her friends.

505
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:38,884
Since she got sick

506
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:40,952
and had to move
back into the house,

507
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,187
it's been hard for her.

508
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,344
She had her own place?

509
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,607
Uh-huh, an apartment
above the garage,

510
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,693
and she had a job at the Jewel

511
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:50,167
helping people
with their groceries.

512
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,518
Father even let her

513
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:53,815
be an altar girl at the church.

514
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,023
Everybody loves Louise.

515
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,458
Excuse me, Dr. Greene...

516
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,593
got that list from upstairs.

517
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,313
Thanks.

518
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,626
Transplant Committee?

519
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,716
Yeah.

520
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,563
Who are the bastards?

521
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,635
Excuse us.

522
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,723
Doctor, your attitude
can get in the way

523
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,191
of achieving your goals.

524
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,204
What? You're not
going to vote for me

525
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,708
for Homecoming Queen this year?

526
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,199
Like that, you mean?

527
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,567
Recognize any names?

528
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,736
One.

529
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,787
Hey.

530
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:29,456
The vanquished
return victorious.

531
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,270
Hi, Doug. You miss me?

532
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:32,526
You have no idea.

533
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:35,095
I hear they clipped you
for some vacation time.

534
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,430
I never take it anyway.

535
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,277
I have a couple
of years saved up.

536
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:39,444
This place is a mess.

537
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:40,400
How you doing?

538
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:41,401
No complaints.

539
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:42,937
Today's the 20th, isn't it?

540
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:44,338
I think so.

541
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,041
MCATs are this
afternoon, aren't they?

542
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,209
You going?

543
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:49,288
Got to work.

544
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:52,079
With all that saved-up
vacation time?

545
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:54,459
You know, it was a stupid idea.

546
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,594
I mean, four years
of med school,

547
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:57,796
<i>if</i> I ever get in,

548
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,897
all that debt.

549
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,333
I'd be about 50 by
the time I got out.

550
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:02,522
What's the point?

551
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,524
Well, I could bring you coffee

552
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,494
in the middle of the
night to the med library,

553
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,730
and I could teach
you how to cheat

554
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,232
on the biochem exams.

555
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:14,202
Doug, they need
you upstairs in Pedes.

556
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,269
Mm-hmm, okay.

557
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,571
Think about it.

558
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,523
Carter, where you been?

559
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,491
Getting some food.

560
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,637
You don't have a
spoon on you, do you?

561
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,271
On me? No. Anspaugh's
in with your patient.

562
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,261
Anspaugh? Why?

563
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,262
Said you paged him.

564
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,263
No, no. I paged Dr. Hicks.

565
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,476
Well, you got Anspaugh,

566
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,634
and he dragged down
all the surgical rounds...

567
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,635
What do you hear, Edson?

568
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,336
Rales at the base of the lungs.

569
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,650
Dr. Anspaugh, I'm sorry to have
dragged you all the way down here.

570
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,184
I actually called Dr. Hicks

571
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,319
just for a consult.

572
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,675
Dr. Hicks is in surgery,

573
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,677
and we were on the prowl

574
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,044
for an interesting
teaching case.

575
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,548
I heard that you had
a surgical abdomen.

576
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,384
Yes, at least
that's my suspicion.

577
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,269
Pain vague and diffuse,

578
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,771
very little tenderness
to palpation.

579
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:57,110
The, uh... chest films
show bi-basilar effusions.

580
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:59,863
Rales heard on auscultation.

581
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,331
Would you consider this

582
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,317
a surgical patient, Dr. Edson?

583
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:04,602
No, I'd bet on CHF.

584
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,897
Yeah, yeah, but, uh...

585
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:09,940
I was more concerned
with... with the CBC.

586
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,278
Previously diagnosed

587
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,329
atrial fibrillation?

588
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,630
Her diet?

589
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,599
I'd assume that she, uh...

590
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,201
went into fib or
ate a salty meal

591
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,753
and that was enough

592
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,822
to push her into
congestive heart failure

593
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:29,109
as demonstrated by the
rales and chest effusions.

594
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:33,130
The diffuse abdominal pain
is probably due to congestion

595
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,332
in the liver, secondary to CHF.

596
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,651
In other words, boys and girls,

597
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:41,155
congestive heart
failure, secondary to a-fib.

598
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,958
Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Carter?

599
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,894
Yeah, yeah, that
sounds about right.

600
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,413
Is Dr. Pomerantz available?

601
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,414
And you are?

602
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,882
Mark Greene from the ER.

603
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:52,883
She knows you?

604
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,968
Yeah, Steph, I do.

605
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,003
It's okay. Hi.

606
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:55,803
Hi. You got a minute?

607
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,838
Sure.

608
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,285
Just move those.

609
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:01,675
Put them anywhere.

610
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:03,922
What can I do for you?

611
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,212
You're on the committee

612
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,882
that evaluates prospective
transplant patients?

613
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,450
Yeah.

614
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,969
I have a patient dying
downstairs... Louise Cupertino.

615
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:12,970
Dr. Kayson tells me

616
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,788
that she was denied
access to the UNOS list.

617
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:16,023
Yeah.

618
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:17,357
Kayson says he wanted to do it,

619
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:19,092
so it doesn't sound
like she was excluded

620
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,128
for medical reasons.

621
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:21,646
What do you want, Mark?

622
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:24,181
There are five people
on the committee.

623
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,315
Kayson's already a "yes."

624
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,368
If I can get you and one
other person to sign on,

625
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,503
Louise can get a new heart.

626
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,015
Our decisions have
to be unanimous.

627
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,201
But I'm the one that
turned Louise down.

628
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,909
Why?

629
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:37,811
Do you know how many
people die each year

630
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:40,091
because an organ doesn't
become available for transplant?

631
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,431
3,500.

632
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,068
She had a job, an apartment,
a mother who loves her.

633
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,702
Is her life somehow
less valuable

634
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,688
than a businessman
with a wife and kids

635
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,657
and a two-pack-a-day
cigarette habit?

636
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:50,719
Don't patronize me, Mark.

637
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:51,887
I agonized over this.

638
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,210
Louise has an IQ of 40.

639
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:55,357
She can't comprehend
the surgical risks.

640
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,965
Yes, she had a job, sure,
but she was always late.

641
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,011
Do you know why?

642
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,062
Because she doesn't
know how to tell time.

643
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,781
How is she going to
adhere to the rigors

644
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:04,416
of the posttransplant regime?

645
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,740
Her mother will make
sure she gets her meds,

646
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:08,391
get her where she needs to go.

647
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,172
She's a 120-pound
eight-year-old, Mark.

648
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,591
We do the operation, and
assuming she doesn't die

649
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,359
for lack of postoperative care,

650
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,211
she's in a state
home in two years,

651
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:20,203
and her mother is adamant
she not end up in a home.

652
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,555
Those are all bureaucratic
perfectly logical reasons

653
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,157
we give ourselves so
that we can sleep at night.

654
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,303
Louise can make people smile.

655
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,012
She can laugh, cry,
touch or hold someone.

656
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,664
I have an eight-year-old,

657
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,782
and if she never
grew a day older,

658
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:52,369
I would still cherish every
moment we spent together.

659
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,108
It's not our place to decide
whether Louise lives or dies.

660
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,429
She has as much right to
be here as you do or I do.

661
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,516
Nina, don't let her die.

662
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:13,885
I'm freezing.

663
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:15,120
I thought you liked picnics.

664
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,188
I love picnics.

665
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm just not used to
breathing on my sandwich

666
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,908
to try and thaw it
out so I can eat it.

667
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,748
Where's your sense
of spontaneity?

668
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,184
This isn't what I meant.

669
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:24,451
Your sense of romance?

670
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,435
The dip is frozen solid.

671
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,870
It's pâté.

672
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,065
It's a brick.

673
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:33,193
Okay, I'm sorry.

674
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:34,445
I'm sorry.

675
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,446
I was wrong.

676
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,697
You're very romantic.

677
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:38,198
You're very spontaneous,

678
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,466
and you're very crazy.

679
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,052
So please put your parka
on before you freeze to death.

680
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,119
I'm fine.

681
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,183
You can't be fine. It's
ten degrees out here.

682
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,358
I think we should
start sleeping together.

683
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,662
What?

684
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,880
Sex.

685
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:56,216
I think we should have some.

686
00:23:56,252 --> 00:24:00,821
In fact, I think we
should have a lot.

687
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,039
Are you sure?

688
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,327
Hell, yeah, I'm sure.

689
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,948
This isn't a joke, Greg.

690
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,732
No, it isn't.

691
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:15,102
Jeanie Boulet...

692
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,989
would you please sleep with me?

693
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,223
Hi. How's she doing?

694
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:37,369
Her breathing's worse.

695
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,758
The resp's up to 36.

696
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:39,759
How's the pain?

697
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:40,760
It hurts.

698
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:41,695
It's bad.

699
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,896
Hi. Who are you?

700
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,247
Her daughter, Yolanda.

701
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,565
She's so stoic,

702
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,835
if she says it hurts,
it must be awful.

703
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,720
Okay, let's take a look.

704
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,021
Oh, God!

705
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,022
Ooh.

706
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,040
Uh... okay.

707
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,742
I need to order a repeat
CBC and a blood gas.

708
00:24:55,778 --> 00:24:57,122
You want me to page
Dr. Anspaugh again?

709
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:58,112
No. God, no.

710
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,279
Uh, call Dr. Hicks.

711
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:00,697
Don't page her... call her...

712
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,666
And when you get
her on the phone,

713
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,335
tell her that I need her
down here right away.

714
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,571
My fiancée's been
begging me for years

715
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,239
to get this thing taken off.

716
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,585
Betadine.

717
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,911
I'm not very religious,
but her family...

718
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,245
Oh, boy!

719
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,082
They wouldn't even
consider letting us get married

720
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,482
if I didn't convert.

721
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,133
Whoa!

722
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:21,335
Whoa.

723
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,286
Stuff's cold.

724
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,756
I probably wouldn't
have started dating her

725
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,074
if I'd known this was
going to be part of the deal.

726
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,171
Lidocaine. You'll
feel a small prick

727
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,712
in the area that I'm
going to anesthetize.

728
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:33,847
Please, do not move.

729
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:36,144
Oh, good, you
haven't started yet.

730
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,645
I have three eager students

731
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,285
visiting today from Evanston.

732
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,538
I thought they might
enjoy watching you

733
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:42,906
perform a circumcision.

734
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,091
Don't mind us, sir.

735
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,644
I'm converting to
Judaism for my fiancée.

736
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,513
She must be quite a girl.

737
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,176
Dr. Hicks, you've got a
phone call from the ER.

738
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,366
Peter, make them

739
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,367
feel welcome.

740
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:54,767
You're in very capable hands.

741
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,437
Number 15 blade.

742
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,226
I'm Dr. Ross from the ER.

743
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,227
Someone page me?

744
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,228
I paged you.

745
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,562
Hi. Samantha Ewing.

746
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,409
I got a CF kid up here.

747
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,610
Jad Heuston. Know him?

748
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:09,600
Yeah.

749
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,934
He's been on respirator

750
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,370
last couple of weeks
at his mother's request.

751
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,505
I know. I'm the one
who put him on it.

752
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,951
Yeah, well, today's
his 18th birthday,

753
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,941
and he wants off.

754
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,942
So why page me?

755
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,545
He wants you to
be the one to do it.

756
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,892
Hi, Norma. Hi, Katy.

757
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,194
Happy birthday, Jad.

758
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,096
Jad's first act as an adult

759
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,287
was to sign a DNR

760
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,856
and demand we remove
him from the respirator.

761
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,224
I've explained the
dangers to him,

762
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,242
but he's insistent.

763
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:36,243
You still sure?

764
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:37,628
I've explained to him

765
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,180
that with the advanced
nature of his disease

766
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:41,977
and the number of weeks he's
been dependent on the machine,

767
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,368
he's unlikely to live more
than a couple of minutes.

768
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,331
I was hoping you
might talk him out of it.

769
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,222
What's his tidal volume?

770
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:50,874
350. PCO2 38,

771
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,859
pO2 120.

772
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:54,294
This is what you really want?

773
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,495
Okay, then.

774
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,114
You said your good-byes?

775
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:01,018
Yes.

776
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,439
Okay.

777
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,643
All right, buddy.

778
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,707
You know the drill, right?

779
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,314
I'm going to count to three.

780
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,583
And you're going to
take a deep breath,

781
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,263
and you're going to blow
out while I pull, all right?

782
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:19,653
Can you give me a hand

783
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,554
with this, please?

784
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:27,227
I love you.

785
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,064
All right, here we go, buddy.

786
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,349
Okay, on three.

787
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,950
Ready?

788
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,735
One, two,

789
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:36,687
three... blow!

790
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,455
Blow, blow, blow.

791
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,639
Okay.

792
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:55,305
Is he going to be okay?

793
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,984
<i>Good afternoon, Doctor.</i>

794
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,430
What could be so important

795
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,332
to call me off
the surgical floor?

796
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,488
64-year-old woman,

797
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,657
onset of abdominal
pain five hours ago.

798
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,226
Pain was vague and diffuse.

799
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,627
Belly wasn't too tender.

800
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,807
She takes Digoxin

801
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,964
for a previously
diagnosed atrial fib.

802
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,298
Rales, chest X ray

803
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,534
show basilar
infiltrates bilaterally.

804
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,603
Dr. Anspaugh came
down for a consult,

805
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,039
and he diagnosed
congestive heart failure

806
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,640
with diffuse abdominal pain

807
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,475
due to congestion of the liver

808
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,777
secondary to the CHF.

809
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,212
We gave her 40 of Lasix.

810
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,357
That's a good story.

811
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,948
What's the problem?

812
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,916
I think Dr. Anspaugh's wrong.

813
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,746
Page Dr. Anspaugh, please.

814
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,070
I think he's still eating
lunch in the lounge.

815
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:45,906
Get him quickly.

816
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,874
You have a better story?

817
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,993
Mm-hmm. Her abdominal
pain is worsening.

818
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,262
Her resps are up to
39, and she's acidotic.

819
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,964
When she came in
here, she was dehydrated,

820
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,566
so why was there
fluid on her lungs?

821
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,967
And the pain isn't
really explained

822
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,168
by congestive heart failure.

823
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,236
It doesn't all add up.

824
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,116
And what is your thinking?

825
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,906
I'm thinking that
she's suffering

826
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,241
from atrial fibrillation,

827
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,026
which puts her at risk
for developing clots.

828
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:07,360
And she threw an embolus,

829
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:09,195
and it's blocking
her small valve.

830
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,641
What the hell is
going on in here?

831
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,349
Dr. Carter believes you have
diagnosed this patient incorrectly.

832
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,334
He what?

833
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,585
Her pain is worsening,

834
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,921
her resps are up to
39, and she's acidotic.

835
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,472
CHF made sense at the time,

836
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,174
but I believe she has

837
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,742
ischemic small bowel disease,

838
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:25,478
secondary to an embolism
in the mesenteric artery.

839
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,041
Pretty good story,
don't you think?

840
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,281
Damn it!

841
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:29,866
I diuresed her.

842
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,212
All right, normal saline,
200 cc's per hour.

843
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,886
Call the OR, book a room.

844
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,588
We're moving her right now.

845
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:35,805
What's happening?

846
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,335
Your mother needs
immediate surgical attention.

847
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,157
An operation?

848
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,776
Yes, but she's going

849
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:40,955
to be just fine.

850
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,545
Dr. Anspaugh, can I assist?

851
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,247
Assist? You're going to do it.

852
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,582
Perform an embolectomy?

853
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,683
You're damn right.

854
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,719
You're the only one
around here today

855
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,288
that seems to know
what the<i> hell</i> they're doing.

856
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,563
It's going to fall.

857
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,824
It's not.

858
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,158
Yes, it is.

859
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,359
No, it's not.

860
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,527
Hmm.

861
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,663
She looks like
she's feeling better.

862
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,242
Yeah. She ate a little bit.

863
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,877
Seems to be breathing okay.

864
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:03,867
Who's her friend?

865
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,851
That's my brother.

866
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,286
I had my mom bring him down.

867
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:08,388
I figured Louise could
use some company.

868
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:09,534
Hey, Jimmy.

869
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,968
Say hi to Dr. Greene.
That's my boss.

870
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,392
Hey, Dr. Greene.

871
00:30:12,428 --> 00:30:14,861
Hi, Jimmy. How are you?

872
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,879
What'd they say?

873
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,547
Good.

874
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,915
Come here.

875
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,230
Psych feels that she's incapable

876
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,764
of handling the post-op regime,

877
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,071
and they don't think

878
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:27,507
the mother's going to
be around long enough

879
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:28,875
to get her through it.

880
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,043
That's a lot of crap.

881
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,645
She could go to a group home.

882
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,746
Jimmy takes classes

883
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:34,392
out at Glenkirk, and they
have a great program.

884
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,977
Mom doesn't want her in a home,

885
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,261
and she has guardianship.

886
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:39,080
I've called Loyola and Rush.

887
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,738
They both have
transplant centers.

888
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,641
Maybe we can get
them to get her on the list.

889
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:47,010
Mark?

890
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,913
Dr. Doyle, this is
Dr. Pomerantz from Psych.

891
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,260
She's the one who
evaluated Louise.

892
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,394
Hi, Louise. Hi.

893
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,817
How are you doing?

894
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,820
Mrs. Cupertino.

895
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:00,690
She's doing better.

896
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,404
She's out of heart failure.

897
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:03,793
You need to fill this out.

898
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:04,839
What is it?

899
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,746
Transplant Candidate
Registration Form.

900
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,698
I can't get her on
the network without it.

901
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,199
Kayson filled out most of it,

902
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,602
but I need today's history
so that I can rank her.

903
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,121
So you have to
get this back to me

904
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:16,839
as soon as you can, okay?

905
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,724
Nice meeting you, Doctor.

906
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,881
Nina?

907
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,833
Thank you.

908
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,707
Jad... why don't
you come and go?

909
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,709
You take off during the day.

910
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:37,555
You do whatever
the hell you want to do

911
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:38,895
and you come back at night.

912
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,981
We hook you up
with I.V. antibiotics.

913
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:43,595
We get PT to pound
your chest in the morning.

914
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:44,751
No, thanks.

915
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,719
You'd be a lot more comfortable.

916
00:31:46,755 --> 00:31:48,772
You might even...
you know, squeak out

917
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,907
a couple extra
weeks out of this thing.

918
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:55,344
I said, no, thanks.

919
00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:59,232
All right.

920
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:00,884
This is my beeper number.

921
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,080
That is my home number.

922
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:05,238
You call me anytime,

923
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,473
day or night, all right?

924
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,747
Let's go.

925
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,128
Thanks.

926
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,517
Where are you going?

927
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,987
Anywhere but here.

928
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,119
Whoa!

929
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,275
Sorry, Dr. Ross.

930
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,610
I raided the cafeteria.

931
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,724
Bought every piece
of cake they had.

932
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,214
Ladies, here's your cake!

933
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,885
What's going on?

934
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:10,798
The nurses got
their new contracts.

935
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,889
Did they get everything
they asked for?

936
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,558
Current employees are protected,

937
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,561
but the hospital won the
right to replace existing RNs

938
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,030
with unlicensed
technicians through attrition.

939
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,208
Technicians?

940
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,933
It's the wave of the
future, I'm afraid.

941
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:23,934
Come on, Doctor, dance.

942
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,201
No. No, thank you.

943
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,837
I'll get the next song.
I'll get the next song.

944
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,172
Have you seen Carol?

945
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,406
Hathaway?

946
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,642
She changed her mind
about working today.

947
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:33,977
Went home before lunch.

948
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,256
I'm starving. Want
a piece of cake?

949
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,947
No, thanks.

950
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,018
Hey.

951
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,920
I just dropped off
all the paperwork

952
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:45,221
with Nina Pomerantz.

953
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,824
Louise should be on the
transplant list tomorrow.

954
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,826
All we have to do
is wait and hope.

955
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,227
Where's your brother?

956
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,007
In the lounge, watching TV.

957
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,742
She won't sign the release.

958
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,910
Louise's mother...

959
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,984
She won't sign the
surgical release.

960
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:59,819
Kayson was just down here.

961
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:02,688
She doesn't want Louise
to have the transplant.

962
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:03,807
Kayson explained to her

963
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,403
that Louise will die
without the operation?

964
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,410
Twice. Then I tried.

965
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:10,113
She wants to take her home.

966
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,872
Ms. Cupertino...

967
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:24,243
you don't want Louise
to have the operation?

968
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,992
I was, uh... 41

969
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,377
when Louise was born,

970
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,381
and I knew right away
that something was wrong.

971
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,551
I couldn't see Louise,
but I could see the doctor.

972
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,099
He was frowning and
snapping his fingers

973
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,722
over the little bassinet.

974
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,502
And, uh... they took her away

975
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,259
before I ever got a
chance to see her,

976
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,545
and I thought maybe she'd died.

977
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,883
Maybe that umbilical
cord had gotten wrapped

978
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:04,384
around her neck.

979
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:07,103
Nobody told me
anything, and then...

980
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,534
then they put me in another room

981
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:11,774
with mothers with their babies,

982
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,427
and I waited there for hours

983
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:18,932
until the doctor finally
came back and...

984
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,750
he looked very sad.

985
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,254
And he told me
Louise was Mongoloid.

986
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,290
And he said that
I should put her

987
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,945
in a state hospital and
never ever see her again.

988
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,279
She will die

989
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,998
if she doesn't
have this operation.

990
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:39,452
We all die, Doctor.

991
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,337
Louise has been

992
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:45,308
the light of my
life for 37 years.

993
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,978
God blessed me with
this... this wonderful girl,

994
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,164
and I wouldn't change a thing.

995
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,986
I'm not going to be
here much longer, and...

996
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:01,190
I'm her whole life, just as
she's always been mine.

997
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,509
There are group homes...

998
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:06,446
Places where she
can make friends,

999
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:10,516
enjoy life, even if it's
only for a few more years.

1000
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:16,706
I went to a home 20 years
ago when my husband died

1001
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,642
and I was afraid that if
something happened to me,

1002
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,078
who would... who would
take care of Louise.

1003
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:27,684
And there were women
there like her with Down's...

1004
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,052
wandering around half naked.

1005
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,488
They didn't even
know their own names.

1006
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,325
I couldn't put Louise
in a place like that.

1007
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:42,165
You want to save people, Doctor?

1008
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,467
If my daughter dies, you lose.

1009
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:48,454
But I'm not afraid of death.

1010
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:51,474
Jesus is there waiting for us

1011
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,544
to hold us and
bring us into the light,

1012
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,566
to show us the
kingdom of Heaven.

1013
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:04,537
And if Louise dies before I do,

1014
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:09,859
I know where I'll see her next,
with angels where she belongs,

1015
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:14,413
because she's an angel...

1016
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:15,949
my angel.

1017
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:27,727
Something new?

1018
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,061
Mesenteric embolectomy.

1019
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,396
Who's doing it?

1020
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:31,564
Dr. Carter.

1021
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,898
Dr. Carter?

1022
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,301
Just rolled the woman into 3.

1023
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,636
Sweet God in Heaven,

1024
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,549
I hope somebody's helping him.

1025
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:43,075
<i>We're putting in a
portacath... a catheter used</i>

1026
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:44,476
to deliver chemotherapy.

1027
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,579
Should you pursue
a career in surgery,

1028
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:49,115
you'll perform this
procedure dozens of times

1029
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,983
in your first year of residency.

1030
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,319
And this can be done
in the patient's room,

1031
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,155
but you need to check
the position of the catheter

1032
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,356
with the fluoroscope.

1033
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:59,759
Does everyone know
what a fluoroscope is?

1034
00:37:59,795 --> 00:38:01,261
This is a fluoroscope.

1035
00:38:01,296 --> 00:38:02,406
Dr. Benton, can I steal Debbie?

1036
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,230
We can use her in OR 3.

1037
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,581
What's going on?

1038
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,278
Dr. Carter's performing

1039
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:09,163
a mesenteric embolectomy.

1040
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,470
By himself?

1041
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:13,573
Anspaugh and
Hicks are supervising.

1042
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,150
What's the score?

1043
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:27,153
Bulls are down by one.

1044
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:30,640
Oh, that was a nice shot.

1045
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:36,729
So I let a kid with CF
leave the hospital today.

1046
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,564
He's 18 years old.

1047
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,250
Went off to die
with his girlfriend.

1048
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,002
Didn't want any of my help.

1049
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,466
Is there anything you
could have done for him?

1050
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,774
No, not really.

1051
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:49,787
I spent the day

1052
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:52,173
trying to get a CHF
patient with Down's

1053
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,608
on the UNOS list
for a heart transplant.

1054
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,932
Any luck?

1055
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,118
Mother wouldn't sign
the surgical release.

1056
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:02,221
Fine couple of
doctors we are, huh?

1057
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:06,643
Remember when we were
going to change the world?

1058
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,628
No, I was always
in it for the money.

1059
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,530
All right.

1060
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:13,516
I'll see you later.

1061
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,051
You want to grab a pizza?

1062
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,219
No, I can't.

1063
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,587
I got to be someplace.

1064
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:18,766
Anybody I know?

1065
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,090
No, just helping
out an old friend.

1066
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,625
See ya.

1067
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,807
Hi.

1068
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,863
Are you ready to go?

1069
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,010
Go where?

1070
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:29,999
Dinner at Morton's

1071
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,078
and then<i> La Bohème.</i>

1072
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:31,968
I already told Kerry

1073
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,436
that we couldn't
use the tickets.

1074
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,882
I told her you were wrong.

1075
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,205
But I'm not dressed.

1076
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,618
We'll stop by your place.

1077
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:38,674
We'll be late.

1078
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,542
If we miss a little bit,

1079
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,621
you can tell me what happened.

1080
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,611
What about the basketball game?

1081
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:43,791
Taping it.

1082
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:44,780
You know, Greg,

1083
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,615
you don't have to
prove anything to me.

1084
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,783
I don't?

1085
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,053
I mean, this has
all been pretty fast.

1086
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:53,156
You know, we can slow it
down, make sure it's right.

1087
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,236
So this means
we don't have to go

1088
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,192
to the opera.

1089
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,177
No, seriously.

1090
00:39:58,213 --> 00:40:00,279
Can we just slow it down?

1091
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,569
Sure.

1092
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,755
Okay.

1093
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,210
Hey. What are you doing here?

1094
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,378
Waiting for you.

1095
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,125
You been waiting long?

1096
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,449
Uh... a while.

1097
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,784
Ah.

1098
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,664
So you took it, didn't you?

1099
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,070
Ha-ha, yeah, I did.

1100
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:26,239
And?

1101
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:30,176
Well, I knew a lot more
than I thought I would.

1102
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:32,578
There were a lot of
people taking it... kids.

1103
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:34,347
I felt about a
hundred years old.

1104
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,317
They all seemed so
confident and smart.

1105
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,652
I<i> guessed</i> a lot.

1106
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,187
I bet you did great.

1107
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:43,539
Thanks.

1108
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,874
Was your day okay?

1109
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,053
Oh, you know...

1110
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,378
just saving lives, as usual.

1111
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,696
Have you seen my mom
lurking around here at all?

1112
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:52,009
No, I banged on the door,

1113
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,493
and nobody answered, so...

1114
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,984
Well, you want to come in?

1115
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,320
I'll make you some
coffee, burn some eggs.

1116
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,654
No, I can't.

1117
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,635
I'm up early. I'm
going to go home.

1118
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,325
Okay.

1119
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,404
All right.

1120
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:04,494
See you tomorrow, then.

1121
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,861
Yeah.

1122
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,197
Doug?

1123
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:08,364
Mm-hmm?

1124
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,200
I know everyone's
worried about me,

1125
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,818
but I'm fine.

1126
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,336
I mean, I was
scared in that store,

1127
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:15,671
but I'm okay now.

1128
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,557
So why'd you go
ahead and take it?

1129
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,737
The MCATs?

1130
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:20,921
Mm-hmm.

1131
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,095
For me.

1132
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,297
Just wanted to see
if I was good enough.

1133
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:29,969
You are.

1134
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:47,853
I love this place.

1135
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:48,854
You should.

1136
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,568
You're a wonderful surgeon.

1137
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:55,094
You belong here.

1138
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,929
You know, you were
right this morning.

1139
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:59,866
I haven't slept much
the last few months

1140
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:02,334
since Gant's dying.

1141
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,837
And before that, me
almost killing that baby

1142
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:07,607
and then Keaton not
recommending me, and...

1143
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:16,115
Six months ago, I
thought I was invincible.

1144
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,520
And now I don't even...

1145
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:24,690
I don't even know.

1146
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:30,563
I guess life isn't working out
the way I thought it would, huh?

1147
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,264
You're not responsible

1148
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,801
for Dr. Gant's death, Peter.

1149
00:42:34,836 --> 00:42:37,303
Yeah, but I could
have stopped it, maybe.

1150
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:39,706
You know, told him
he was doing well...

1151
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:41,557
Encouraged him.

1152
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:42,908
You know, Dr. Hicks,

1153
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:45,878
I wish I could tell you
that it was all intentional...

1154
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:47,808
That it was a part
of some master plan

1155
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:51,134
that I had going on, but...

1156
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:55,120
truthfully, I never even
thought about Gant.

1157
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,507
I mean, he was just an intern,

1158
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:04,229
and I was more involved
with my career, my... ambitions.

1159
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:08,100
We all have to find
our own way, Peter.

1160
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:09,635
You're not invincible.

1161
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,805
You're a young doctor,
learning, making mistakes,

1162
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,140
saving lives.

1163
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:19,495
It takes a lifetime.

1164
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,181
You just have to have faith.

1165
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:25,985
Go home.

1166
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,965
You've got a busy day tomorrow.

1167
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:32,191
More circumcisions
and portacaths?

1168
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:37,864
No, I've signed you up
for a lap chole at 6:00

1169
00:43:37,899 --> 00:43:40,316
And I'd appreciate
if you'd assist me

1170
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,634
on a splenectomy at 11:00.

1171
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,021
Thank you, Dr. Hicks.

1172
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,090
You're welcome, Peter.

1173
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,892
See you in the morning.
