1
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,186
<i>Traffic and weather on the ones.</i>

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,577
It's another steamer
today. Hot, muggy weather.

3
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,357
High in the 90s
with high humidity.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,293
They say never
trust air you can't see,

5
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:17,582
and you will see it today,

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,018
with no end in sight to
the hot, humid weather.

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,954
WMAQ traffic. Maybe the only
thing hotter than the weather

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,624
are the tempers of folks
stuck in rush-hour traffic.

9
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,504
It's wall-to-wall,
you all out there.

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,694
Double the travel times

11
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,995
on the Edens, Kennedy,
Eisenhower, Stevenson,

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,397
Ryan, Borman expressways.

13
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,200
And the tollways... they're
not much better... maybe worse.

14
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,468
The Tri-State and 355 have...

15
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,532
Jeanie, hey, sorry.

16
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:40,167
I'm running over this morning.

17
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,458
I hope I'm not making
you late for work.

18
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,859
No. I'm not on
until this afternoon.

19
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:46,606
I did my residency at County.

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,508
Three years of
too many patients,

21
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,310
too little time
and no resources.

22
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:51,567
Sounds about right.

23
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:54,203
Yeah, hard to believe
we had no CTs, no MRIs

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,537
and glass IV bottles.

25
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:56,538
Glass?

26
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:58,056
Yeah.

27
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,609
Well, your lab work's back

28
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,378
and the results show
a viral load of 15,000,

29
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,479
which is good.

30
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:05,481
Coffee?

31
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:08,099
No. I've already had too much.

32
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,267
Yeah, so have I.

33
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,631
Listen, there's a
fairly new HIV cocktail

34
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,605
that I recommend
you start on now.

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,807
The three drugs?

36
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,277
Yeah, AZT, 3TC and
a protease inhibitor.

37
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,746
You know, there is
no long-term research

38
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,332
but the preliminary
findings are positive.

39
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:24,583
Not quite a cure.

40
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,068
No, but more hope than
we've had in a decade.

41
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,854
There may be
some side effects...

42
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,054
Nausea, vomiting, rash.

43
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,289
How much does it cost?

44
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,091
Oh, your insurance
will cover it.

45
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,210
Actually, I'm going
to stick with cash.

46
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,381
Well, that could cost
up to $16,000 a year.

47
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,083
I'm sure I can work that out.

48
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,487
Afraid of letting
the hospital know?

49
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,535
Well, I've heard of health
care workers getting fired

50
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,659
or reassigned for
being HIV positive.

51
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,777
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

52
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,728
I've got a couple
of them as patients

53
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,230
but not from County, though.

54
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,232
So I don't know
what their policy is.

55
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,928
It's hard to ask without someone

56
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,764
wanting to know
why you're asking.

57
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,182
Listen, I'm gonna
write the prescription,

58
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,290
but these'll get
you started, okay?

59
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,041
You're to take two of the 3TC

60
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:10,062
and six each of the AZT
and the protease inhibitor.

61
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,107
14 pills a day?

62
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,230
Yeah.

63
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,306
The 3TC twice a day
with plenty of water

64
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,718
the protease
inhibitor before meals,

65
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:18,619
always on an empty stomach,

66
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,623
and two each of the
AZT, three times a day.

67
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:24,292
Jeanie.

68
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:28,964
Just follow these
written instructions, okay?

69
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:32,217
Does your watch have an alarm?

70
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,202
Yeah.

71
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,803
Good. Get used to hearing it.

72
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,137
Miss a couple of doses

73
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:38,407
and this virus could
develop resistance.

74
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,853
How much do I need to worry

75
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:41,888
about transmitting
this to a patient?

76
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,611
If you use universal precautions

77
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,914
and are careful when
disposing of sharps

78
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,417
there shouldn't be a problem.

79
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:49,417
Shouldn't.

80
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:51,670
With the exception
of one dentist,

81
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,172
there has been no
case documentation

82
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,176
of any health care worker
transmitting HIV to a patient.

83
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,012
None.

84
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,349
So I'll see you in three weeks.

85
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,435
Three weeks.

86
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:09,872
Jeanie.

87
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,075
There are a lot of diseases
that can take your life.

88
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,093
But this one

89
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,689
can take over your life.

90
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,713
Don't let it.

91
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,373
Oh, are you the doctor?

92
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,144
I saw the name on
the... on the mailbox.

93
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,945
"John Truman Carter, M.D."

94
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,047
Well, I am

95
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,550
Betty from 318.

96
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,786
Are you a<i> doctor</i> doctor?

97
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:52,157
Because I'm feeling
a little short of breath.

98
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,559
Might want to lose the
cigarettes for starters.

99
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:58,130
You really think that might
make a difference at my age?

100
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,126
I don't know, Betty.
Just a wild guess.

101
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,117
Well, I tried one of
those humidifiers.

102
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:04,135
I stuck my head
in the darn thing.

103
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,136
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

104
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,070
What time is it?

105
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,807
Well, uh, I just turned off

106
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,076
<i>Regis and Kathie Lee.</i>

107
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,188
Oh! Oh, God!

108
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,912
Oh, God! Benton's
going to kill me.

109
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,609
Betty, I can't help
you now; I'm sorry.

110
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,578
I'm late, and I am
going to die soon.

111
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:20,412
I'm sorry you're
not feeling well.

112
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,603
Maybe you should
try an albuterol inhaler

113
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,072
maybe an atrovent inhaler.

114
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:25,724
You know, that kind of thing.

115
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,059
You can't keep me here.

116
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,406
Settle down now.

117
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,040
Get off of me!

118
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,514
I want to get out of here.

119
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:34,715
What happened?

120
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,595
Can't take these
fat people on PCP.

121
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,131
Broke out of her restraints.

122
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:39,187
Where's security?

123
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,022
Where are the men?!

124
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,501
Get off of me, you bitches!

125
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,859
I want to get out of here!

126
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:47,874
Sorry, sir. Oh, geez.

127
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,118
Geez, Louise! God!
We've got to get her down.

128
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,471
You can't give it to me!

129
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,340
Keep her down. Sit on her.

130
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:02,193
You okay? What is this?

131
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,678
Psycho day?

132
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:06,014
Some lunatic in four
kept trying to lick me.

133
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,160
Maybe it's the heat.

134
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,549
Oh, God. Full moon?

135
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:11,419
I think the patients know
that County's going to close.

136
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,654
Getting their last
digs in while they can.

137
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,867
In here, right?

138
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,691
What the hell kept you?

139
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,593
Got the call five minutes
ago. We ran all the way.

140
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,062
Oh, man.

141
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:24,432
Hey, you don't think County's
really going to close, do you?

142
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,900
I mean, it can't, can it?

143
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,680
Have you been
reading the papers?

144
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:30,371
$150 million shortfall in
the Cook County budget.

145
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,740
Be real tough giving
this all up, won't it?

146
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:33,925
Where's Carter?

147
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,443
Do I look like his mother?

148
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,323
You can't do this
to me! Let me go!

149
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:38,546
Randi, you seen Carter?

150
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:40,014
He's a surgical intern now.

151
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,894
We don't really keep
track of him anymore.

152
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,329
Peter, sorry you were late.

153
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:44,497
We already saved him.

154
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,688
What are you talking
about? I'm not late.

155
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,634
You know Wayne
Lentloff, don't you?

156
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,898
Good to see you, Peter.

157
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,337
Hey, you missed a good one.

158
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,094
Nobody called me. Thanks, Wayne.

159
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,107
It was fun, Kerry.
We'll do it again.

160
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,009
Uh, listen, I
wanted to talk to you

161
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,044
about a fellowship
in cardiothoracic.

162
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:02,103
Uh, yeah, look, um, I haven't
made up my mind, but, uh...

163
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,378
Oh, I know.

164
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,974
I hear vascular wants
you, trauma, critical care.

165
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,642
Yeah, I talked to them, but...

166
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,956
I know, I know, but
you need to talk to us.

167
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,280
Cardiothoracic is
a great specialty.

168
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:14,549
Good man like you...

169
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,451
You could finish up the
fellowship in three years.

170
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,020
Listen, are you free Sunday?

171
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:21,255
I would like you to
come out for brunch.

172
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,025
Lake Forest, and you
are going to love it.

173
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,026
Hey.

174
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,238
Hey, you want a ride?

175
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:28,796
Oh, thanks. I think I
can make it from here.

176
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,242
So how'd it go last night?

177
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,232
How'd what go?

178
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,233
Your blind date.

179
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:33,300
Oh, God.

180
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,301
You know better

181
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,982
than to tell anything to Doug.

182
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,705
I only told him after he told me

183
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:39,507
about<i> your</i> blind
date last week...

184
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:40,975
The girl with the retainer.

185
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,644
I don't believe him.

186
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,612
Don't worry. Mine was worse.

187
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:45,947
Nothing could be worse.

188
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,314
This girl had an entire

189
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,261
vegetable garden
stuck in her teeth.

190
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:51,252
That's the baby pool
compared to Tad.

191
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,486
Tad?

192
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,923
Hey, Manny, can I get
a cup of coffee, black?

193
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,924
You got it.

194
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,436
I can't believe you'd go out

195
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,687
with a guy named Tad.

196
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,910
I did.

197
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,646
Here you go. I made
it fresh just for you.

198
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,747
Hey, Joey!

199
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,016
Yeah, fresh from
yesterday's grounds.

200
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,385
First of all, I order

201
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,987
a Manhattan straight
up, two cherries.

202
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,424
He orders a "fruity, yet
selfless" glass of Cabernet.

203
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,859
What does that even mean?

204
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,227
I have no idea.

205
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:20,365
Then he talks for 45 minutes
about his ex-girlfriend...

206
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,584
Whose name also
happens to be Susan...

207
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:23,729
How much he loved her

208
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,364
How much he wanted to marry her

209
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,366
how he wanted to father
her five or six children.

210
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,686
And by the way,
do I want children?

211
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,788
Do I want five or six children?

212
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,811
Okay, Tad could be worse.

213
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,507
I'm not even there yet, Mark.

214
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:38,099
I look over and he has
this drop of red wine

215
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,484
hanging from his nose.

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,646
What? You heard me.

217
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,915
This puny, little blob
just hanging there.

218
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,384
So, of course, I cannot
take my eyes off of it.

219
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,486
Is it going to fall?

220
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,421
Is it going to hang
there all night?

221
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,106
Is his skin going to absorb it?

222
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,295
How did it get there?

223
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,063
Mark!

224
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,130
No, really.

225
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:53,964
How do you get your nose

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,044
that far down into a wine glass?

227
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,512
What? Was he smelling it or...?

228
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,968
Mark, please.

229
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,837
Okay, what happened?

230
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,674
I went to the bathroom
and snuck out the window.

231
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,175
You're kidding.

232
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,344
Nope.

233
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,846
Wow.

234
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,276
Did he ask you to
the house for brunch?

235
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,399
How did you know?

236
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,535
Wayne Lentloff is
nothing if not predictable.

237
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,937
That's why I like him, actually.

238
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,808
He gets the residents out
to Lake Forest every year.

239
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,076
Shows them the
seven-bedroom colonial

240
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,647
the tiered garden,
the Olympic lap pool.

241
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,149
Very impressive.

242
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,518
All the benefits of
cardiothoracic surgery.

243
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,864
Of course, we're only in it

244
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,999
for the satisfaction of
helping our fellow man

245
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,834
aren't we, uh...
what's your name?

246
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,091
Gant, Dennis Gant.

247
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,304
Step in, Mr. Gant.

248
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,239
Take a look-see while I divide

249
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,607
this anterior rectus fascia.

250
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,064
Tonsil clamp.

251
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,495
A little bovie, please.

252
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,631
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Not you, Gant.

253
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:41,083
Boys and girls in
vascular pull you aside?

254
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,952
Yeah, that's mostly
diabetics and smokers though.

255
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,109
Not for me.

256
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,955
What about a
pediatric fellowship?

257
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,106
Surgery above

258
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,346
and below the
diaphragm... Very high-tech.

259
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,116
Actually, no one's asked me.

260
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,679
Hard as it is to believe, Peter,

261
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,748
there are some of the
more elite fellowships

262
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,812
you might have
to go after yourself.

263
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,307
Hmm.

264
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,420
Carter, your colleague,
Dr. Gant here,

265
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:03,155
was kind enough
to cover the E.R.,

266
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,258
seeing as you were
nowhere to be found.

267
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:08,816
Perhaps you should
do the same for him.

268
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:10,362
Okay, let's yank

269
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,119
this little hyperemic sucker.

270
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,232
Pean clamp.

271
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,534
You got it?

272
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:15,802
Mm-hmm.

273
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,376
The key to landing a
good job is presentation.

274
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,489
I'm not going to
dress like you, E. Ray

275
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,413
if that's what
you're talking about.

276
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,083
Two summers, assistant
night manager, McDonald's.

277
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,196
Actually, that's a bit of a lie.

278
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,298
I just manned the
drive-through window.

279
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,788
Well, no, that's better.

280
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:34,158
That's managing the
communication and distribution system

281
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,660
of an international
Fortune 500 company.

282
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,661
Okay, okay.

283
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,796
I like that.

284
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,332
What you're saying
is make it a big lie.

285
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,768
Semantics can be
your friend, Jerry.

286
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,082
Ah, man, some guy's
puking over at chairs.

287
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,438
I'll get it.

288
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,308
Jerry, did you get the
liquor out of four yet. Jerry?

289
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,653
You can't bother him now.

290
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,144
He's rephrasing his resume.

291
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,179
Going for the
presidency of Chrysler.

292
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,848
You know, it's not necessarily
county that's going to close.

293
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,628
There are three other hospitals.

294
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,997
Yeah, but what if it does?

295
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,320
I don't know about you

296
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,822
but I've only got eight
hours' worth of savings.

297
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,702
You know what, you
guys ought to get E. Ray

298
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,126
to help you revise your resumes.

299
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,127
I'm a nurse, Jerry.

300
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,062
How many ways you
going to rephrase that?

301
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,664
Mark said something
about a couple of teenagers.

302
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,433
Does anyone have
a chart on them?

303
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,046
Oh, I haven't made one up yet.

304
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,647
Two 15-year-olds
won't call their parents.

305
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,916
Mark said he'd see them.

306
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,905
Who am I seeing?

307
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,618
The 15-year-olds over at chairs.

308
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,741
Right.

309
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,843
81-year-old ALOC
with abdominal pain,

310
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,011
coming in by private.

311
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,112
Anything surgical?

312
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,713
Nope.<i> Nada.</i> Nothing.

313
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,928
Carter, abdominal
pain at the back door.

314
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:32,995
Susan? Yeah.

315
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,919
Can you help me
with a chest tube?

316
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,720
Yes, I'm going
to see those kids.

317
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,290
Mark, did you get a
chance to read that synopsis

318
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,725
of Donald Anspaugh's
speech at Northwestern?

319
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,827
"Modern Architecture

320
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,728
for Emergency
Medicine Management"?

321
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,098
Anspaugh? Isn't he
the Chief at Southside?

322
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,967
Yeah. Doug did
his rotation there.

323
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,069
He said the guy's
a bit of a crackpot.

324
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,471
Well, you might want
to consider the source

325
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,583
in that evaluation.

326
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,185
I found his ideas intriguing.

327
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,542
Kerry, rearranging
the physical layout here

328
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,111
is not one of my priorities.

329
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,959
Well, could we at least
rearrange where security sits?

330
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,827
Three of our nurses
had to restrain

331
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,228
a PCP patient this morning

332
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,496
because it took the guys

333
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,432
more than four
minutes to get there.

334
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,588
Was anybody hurt?

335
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,834
Fortunately, no.

336
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:15,293
You know, Mark, just
because it's my suggestion

337
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,463
doesn't, by definition,
make it a bad idea.

338
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,600
She just has a way

339
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,087
of making you feel
really small, doesn't she?

340
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,295
Sorry, I had no idea
they'd send the bill to you.

341
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,296
Your insurance
company doesn't pay.

342
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,908
Your insurance
company doesn't pay.

343
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,278
What, you think the
hospital's just going to eat it?

344
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:40,302
I don't know.

345
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,136
I mean, what do
they do, you know,

346
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,188
with immigrants and poor people?

347
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,858
They go after anyone
who's legally responsible.

348
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,858
That's me, Al.

349
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,572
We're still married, remember?

350
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,762
I screwed up when
I changed jobs.

351
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,297
This guy I'm working for...

352
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,599
He's independent,
doesn't give benefits.

353
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,852
CTA said I could
stay on their plan

354
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,204
but there was this
COBRA payment and...

355
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,839
I had no idea I missed it.

356
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:06,044
It was... it was real confusing.

357
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,913
They're going to
let me know if...

358
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,447
if I can get reinstated.

359
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,469
Can it maybe go
on your insurance?

360
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:16,549
You're not on my insurance, Al.

361
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,650
I joined my plan
after we separated.

362
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:21,119
$3,200 is what I'm
supposed to pay for you?

363
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:24,295
In about a week, I
get another bill for me.

364
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,528
Thomas, time to come in.

365
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:41,696
Where are you?

366
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,442
Franklin Heath,
81, sweet old guy

367
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,244
looking for someone
named Thomas.

368
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,580
His private-duty nurse,
Mr. Vincent travels

369
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:48,947
is over there bulking up.

370
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,070
Oh, he looks dedicated.

371
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,116
He's dumping him right?

372
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,351
It's not for me
to say, of course,

373
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,387
although I guess I can
mention he's done this

374
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:56,377
a number of times,
always on a Friday.

375
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:57,545
Thomas, getting dark.

376
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,292
Carol, what
happened to your car?

377
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,281
What do you mean?

378
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,450
Tow truck hauled it off.

379
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,618
What are you talking about?!

380
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,063
Go, go, go. I'll
take care of this.

381
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,754
Thomas, is that you?

382
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,122
Strong old guy, isn't he?

383
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,374
Thomas... where are you, Thomas?

384
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,827
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

385
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:15,129
Wait, God, please!

386
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,297
Hey, no!

387
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,865
Um, that's my car.

388
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,611
Hey, yourself. Stop
beating on my truck.

389
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,369
Well, stop stealing my car.

390
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:22,547
You Carol Hathaway?

391
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,038
Yeah.

392
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,572
Repossessed.

393
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:27,241
N-n-no-no, that can't be right.

394
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:28,620
You missed three payments.

395
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,177
Oh, God, so I'm a little late.

396
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:31,929
I made the other seven on time.

397
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,831
No... come on! Wait!

398
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,568
Oh, man!

399
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,854
I know that you did,

400
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,857
which is why that I
thought tonight, we could...

401
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:47,194
No, I understand your parents
don't come into town that often.

402
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:50,197
Yes. Yes, I would
love to meet them

403
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,867
but I'm working tonight, so...

404
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,202
What time do they go to bed?

405
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,539
I'm kidding.

406
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,041
Okay, yeah.

407
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:03,044
Uh... okay, I'll
talk to you soon.

408
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,378
Okay, bye.

409
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:08,049
That's, uh, uh, old
friend from college.

410
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,717
Radiology called.

411
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:12,219
The films on that
Berman kid are back.

412
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,388
You want to
rephrase your resume,

413
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:16,390
you should talk
to him, not E. Ray.

414
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:18,292
Hey, I heard your car got towed.

415
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:19,905
It's definitely a mistake.

416
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,428
I know a couple of guys

417
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,998
who can track a repo
man down like that...

418
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,332
if you want.

419
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,201
Carter said I should tell you

420
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,356
he's in curtain three.

421
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,684
Nurse Hathaway?

422
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,007
You're still here?

423
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,220
We've been sitting
in those chairs

424
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,288
just like you told us to.

425
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,656
That doctor never showed.

426
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,642
Well, if you tell me
what the problem is

427
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,631
I probably could help you.

428
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,866
We need to see a doctor.

429
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,850
Jerry...

430
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:43,918
where's Ross?

431
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:44,786
Radiology.

432
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:45,469
Greene?

433
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,581
Trauma two.

434
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,571
Follow me.

435
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,573
B.P.'S 100/50, pulse 120.

436
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,687
Good bilateral breath sound.

437
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,676
Toes upgoing.

438
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,011
Trachea's midline.

439
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,346
E.T. tube 7½.

440
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,525
Mark, you said

441
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,316
you'd see these
kids an hour ago.

442
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,611
Carol, we were diverted.
Well, they need to see a doctor.

443
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,085
As much as I'd like to do

444
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,437
your entire job for you...

445
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:03,454
Thank you, Carol.

446
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,733
Perhaps they could wait

447
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,068
just a little bit longer?

448
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,304
Let's get a
non-contrast head CT.

449
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,495
You know where you
were waiting before?

450
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,113
Go back there and wait again.

451
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,630
Thomas.

452
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,132
Thomas.

453
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,146
B.P.'S 90/60, pulse 104.

454
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,335
He's been agitated

455
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,210
complaining of abdominal pain...

456
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,807
That is, when he's
not looking for Thomas.

457
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,791
Thomas!

458
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:24,542
Who's Thomas?

459
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,621
Who knows?

460
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,523
Malik, get a C.B.C., Chem
7, U.A. abdominal series,

461
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,247
and let's get an E.K.G.

462
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,260
So, if you don't
need me anymore...

463
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,251
Have a nice
weekend, Mr. Travels.

464
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,053
Thomas, come on in.

465
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,687
Dinner's ready.

466
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,200
Carter...

467
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,157
what are you doing?

468
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,240
81-year-old ALOC.

469
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,075
Complaining of abdominal pain.

470
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,544
No vomiting or diarrhea

471
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:44,828
and yesterday, he had

472
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,213
a normal bowel movement.

473
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:48,649
Mild tenderness, no
rebound or guarding.

474
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:50,952
I'd say you have
nothing here, Carter.

475
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,319
Did someone dump him?

476
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:54,321
I think that's a possibility.

477
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:57,419
Mm-hmm. Well, I
suggest you do the same.

478
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,160
You're in surgery

479
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,061
not Geriatrics, okay?

480
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:04,193
I'm really sorry about
my little blowup before.

481
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,660
It was completely out of line...

482
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,829
No excuses whatsoever.

483
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,163
Don't worry about it.

484
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,721
Thanks. Can I borrow
your motorcycle after lunch?

485
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,789
What?

486
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,535
Well, you see, I have to
be at my house at 3:00.

487
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,691
My car got towed

488
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,693
and I won't have
time to catch the el.

489
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,528
Mark, we're going
to grab a drink.

490
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,708
Walk with us.

491
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,977
Okay, Mark, I'll
check on those kids.

492
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,379
Do you know how
to ride a motorcycle?

493
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,771
It's just like a
big moped, right?

494
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,283
I guess.

495
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,606
Hi. I'm Dr. Lewis.

496
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,653
What seems to be the problem?

497
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,793
A woman doctor?

498
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,078
Best I could do.

499
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,609
We could call your
parents, if you'd prefer.

500
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:37,833
No. No.

501
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,668
Uh...

502
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,670
We...

503
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,706
lost our condom.

504
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,961
Okay, so you're
trying to tell us

505
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,462
the condom is...

506
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,113
Deeply...

507
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:54,965
deeply lost.

508
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,419
<i>I thought the decision
wasn't being made</i>

509
00:18:58,454 --> 00:18:59,753
for another week.

510
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:01,200
That's what we all thought

511
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,901
until they called this meeting

512
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:03,935
for this afternoon.

513
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,393
So they gave no indication

514
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:07,495
as to what the
outcome is going to be?

515
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,996
<i>Nada, niente,</i> zip.

516
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,931
Could be us, could be Southside

517
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,667
could be Central, but
someone's closing down.

518
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:14,668
Here, I got this. Here you
go, Manny, three cans of pop.

519
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:15,669
Thanks.

520
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,838
I didn't think
they'd actually do it.

521
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:18,839
Neither did I.

522
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,274
Neither did Donald Anspaugh.

523
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,409
He called me about it.

524
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:22,776
Sounded like he was having

525
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,245
a psychosensory disturbance.

526
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,913
He's afraid he's losing his job.

527
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:26,958
You know him?

528
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:28,782
Did my last two
years of residency

529
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:29,883
at Hennepin with him.

530
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,118
Guy's completely lumpy.

531
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:32,464
I rather like him.

532
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,499
Heh-heh-heh. Give it time.

533
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,489
He eats med
students for breakfast,

534
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:36,757
residents for lunch,

535
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:37,969
and the attendings

536
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:39,938
are who he chews up for dinner.

537
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,840
There was this guy Michaelson...

538
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:44,510
He was a new E.R.
attending when I was there.

539
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:47,879
Anspaugh vetoed every
research topic he submitted.

540
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:48,869
What for?

541
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:50,682
He just didn't like him.

542
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:53,374
Wanted to make sure
he didn't get tenure.

543
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,920
So the meeting's at 5:00?

544
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,788
Yeah, and I want you two there.

545
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:58,323
But let's not mention it

546
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,380
to the staff.

547
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,415
They're nervous enough as it is.

548
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,432
Carol?

549
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,634
Yeah.

550
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,914
Could we be possibly
be out of Decadron?

551
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,905
No, it's on one
of the top shelves.

552
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,239
Yeah, oh.

553
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,542
Hey, so they repoed
your car, huh?

554
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,877
You knew that's what
they were doing, didn't you.

555
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,157
I didn't have the
heart to tell you.

556
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,346
You are such a coward.

557
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,860
You have a problem with that?

558
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,094
Look, it happened to me once.

559
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,262
I'm a little strapped right now.

560
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,764
I could help you out next month.

561
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,154
Thanks, but I'm way beyond

562
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,783
a little help from my friends.

563
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,117
I'm meeting a
realtor this afternoon.

564
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,369
I'm going to try
to sell my house.

565
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,759
That's news.

566
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,327
Well, it needs so much work.

567
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,663
I still haven't paid
for the new roof

568
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,094
and I don't even know
if I have a job next week.

569
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,984
But, hey, how's life with you?

570
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:38,152
How's Gretchen?

571
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:39,653
Uh... Gretchen...

572
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,538
The one who went to Smith.

573
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,257
Gretchen is fine.

574
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:46,527
And now, I am armed
with my trusty Decadron.

575
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:50,114
I'm going to go out
and cure the croup.

576
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,296
So, what did Morgenstern want?

577
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,452
Oh, I can't tell you.

578
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,188
There's a meeting today at 5:00

579
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,191
to announce if they're
going to shut us down or not.

580
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,204
Ah, that's the bad news, huh?

581
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,961
Don't worry about it yet.

582
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,108
Well, yeah, but it
affects my vacation.

583
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,198
Your vacation?

584
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,913
Oh, yeah... I'm going
to Hawaii, I decided.

585
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:10,968
What?!

586
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,336
Nothing. Just for
a moment there,

587
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,383
I thought you might be
worried about your residency.

588
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,456
Any news yet, Jerry?
Are we jobless?

589
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,492
No news, but you
can have your share

590
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,606
of rumors, if you'd
like to hear them.

591
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,596
No, thanks. This
day's been bad enough.

592
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:23,809
Hey, Carter, call me crazy,

593
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,176
but I think that woman's

594
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
trying to get your attention.

595
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,656
What is she doing here?

596
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,460
Ugh! Ugh!

597
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,462
Manny, Manny, what happened?

598
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,309
I think I ate something.

599
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,799
Yeah, uh... are you okay?

600
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,812
Yeah, it's just this
day's getting worse.

601
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:44,968
Great. Uh...

602
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:46,970
Ugh!

603
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,472
Um...

604
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,541
Anybody seen E. Ray?

605
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:54,294
Mrs. Bradley? Alex?

606
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,462
Yes. Hi. Hi.

607
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:57,475
Hi. Sorry to have
kept you waiting.

608
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:58,465
That's okay.

609
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,634
Alex, let's take a look here.

610
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,480
Well, it's not too bad.

611
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,804
Didn't even hurt.

612
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,350
No, I wouldn't think so.

613
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:06,835
How did you cut that?

614
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,126
Pulling the top off
a can of tennis balls.

615
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,294
He's taking lessons.

616
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,294
I hate them.

617
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,508
Oh, yeah? How much?

618
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:13,747
What do you mean, how much?

619
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,427
As much as doing your homework?

620
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:17,161
As much as going to the dentist?

621
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:19,052
Well, definitely as
much as both of them.

622
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,505
I hate it as much as
taking the trash out,

623
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,574
cleaning up after the dog...

624
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,908
<i>You</i> wanted a dog.

625
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,644
Yeah, but I didn't want Robert.

626
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,180
Now, you don't talk like that

627
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,048
about your brother. You
know better than that.

628
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,083
Alex, he loves you.

629
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,133
I know.

630
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:34,134
Who feeds the dog? Me.

631
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,214
No, you don't. I always do.

632
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:36,948
So, those shots you get
at the dentist... Novocain...

633
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:38,249
You're not allergic
to those, are you?

634
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,223
Mom?

635
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,224
No.

636
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,309
No.

637
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,712
They stuck these
things in my nose

638
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:47,214
and gave me this oxygen
tank to take home with me.

639
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:48,215
Mm-hmm.

640
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,653
That inhaler thing,
it didn't work at all.

641
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:55,489
Now, Betty, you
can't smoke in here.

642
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:57,919
You can't smoke around
this oxygen tank, either, okay?

643
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,010
Even at home. It'll blow up.

644
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,398
I want you to know

645
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,251
that I asked for you specially.

646
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,618
Thank you.

647
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,020
Very flattered.

648
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,883
Carter, Malik
needs you in three...

649
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,086
Something about an
old guy, uh, Mr. Heath.

650
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,275
I'll be right back.

651
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,312
Call Carol and page
Dr. Lewis or Greene.

652
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,050
Oh... God.

653
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,384
He's Bradying down.

654
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,719
All right, get a mask on him.

655
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:26,787
What happened?

656
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,634
He arrested.
Monitor's flatlined.

657
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,768
Where's Dr. Lewis and Greene?

658
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,758
Up in MRI; I paged them.

659
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:31,903
Want to call that
private-duty nurse?

660
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:33,756
No. Mr. Travels
has gone traveling.

661
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,257
Let's give him, uh...
Let's give him, uh...

662
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,948
Carter, you're pumping
too hard. Thank you.

663
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:38,915
How about an amp of, uh...?

664
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:39,700
Epi! Epi...

665
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:40,879
And a mig of Atropine.

666
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,373
I think I just broke his rib.

667
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,953
I'm getting a faint pulse.

668
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,745
Whew!

669
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,228
Okay, ten mics per kig...

670
00:23:56,252 --> 00:23:58,330
That's about... 500 mics.

671
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,770
Give him 500 mics of Dopamine.

672
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,105
Pretty damn good job, Carter.

673
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,640
I'll call for transfer.

674
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,275
Man, I can't believe...

675
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,822
I can't believe I broke his rib.

676
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,957
I mean, I knew
he was frail, but...

677
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,781
Well, that's better
than letting him die.

678
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,515
Yeah, huh?

679
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,727
Carter. Didn't I tell you

680
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,562
to transfer this
guy up to Medicine?

681
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,498
Come on, I've got
a hernia that needs

682
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,602
an H-and-P upstairs.
Now, move. Let's go.

683
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,155
Hello?

684
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,373
Hello?

685
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,629
Hello?

686
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:16,897
Mrs. Puro?

687
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,333
Oh, Carol. Hi there.

688
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:20,800
I-I'm sorry I'm late.

689
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,403
How did you get in?

690
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,005
Oh, your mother. She
makes a killer cup of coffee.

691
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,006
There you are, sweetheart.

692
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,852
I was just going
to call the hospital.

693
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,643
Mom, what are you doing here?

694
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:32,078
The material I told you
about for the kitchen curtains...

695
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,458
I thought I would drop it off.

696
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:34,726
And frankly, I am
just as glad to hear

697
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,983
you've changed your mind.

698
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:37,551
About what?

699
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:38,735
About selling.

700
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,903
I told Elizabeth.

701
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:40,988
Elizabeth?

702
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,806
First names only in my business.

703
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,042
I told her you must
have changed your mind.

704
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,877
Why else would
we put up curtains?

705
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,456
Not to sell it. Wouldn't help.

706
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,615
Mom, why don't you go
and see how those curtains

707
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,928
would look in the bedroom.

708
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,852
You want the same in the bedroom

709
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,853
as the kitchen?

710
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:56,853
Mom, we'll talk later.

711
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,666
Elizabeth, I haven't
changed my mind.

712
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,401
I really want to
sell this place.

713
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,442
You're kidding.

714
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,444
No.

715
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,812
Is there a problem?

716
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:06,613
How can I put this delicately?

717
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,365
I couldn't sell this house

718
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,201
if the rest of Chicago
burned down around it.

719
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,886
Well, I know it needs work.

720
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,054
The roof is...

721
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,138
The roof is new!

722
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,540
I was going to
say... The roof is fine

723
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,104
but I checked the basement.

724
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,494
The furnace
doesn't even turn on,

725
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,112
not to mention the asbestos.

726
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,113
There's no central air,

727
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,359
there isn't even a window unit.

728
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,449
Exposed two-by-fours

729
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,351
dry wall... the rug is lovely

730
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,102
but there are holes

731
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:30,854
in the carpet underneath it,

732
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,467
which unfortunately reveal
the subterranean termites.

733
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,091
The plumbing is not copper.

734
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,792
The electrical is a
fire waiting to happen

735
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,293
and as much as I
hate to mention it

736
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,098
you do live next
to the el tracks.

737
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,666
Frankly, I'm impressed

738
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,785
someone managed
to sell it to you.

739
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,548
Then a month after
the abscess was drained

740
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,438
she had to have a hysterectomy.

741
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:52,108
My God, was she in pain then.

742
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,277
Weeks. Weeks. Weeks!

743
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,965
And what's so unfair is
that, with all four of our kids,

744
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,428
cesareans, which
is a lot of slicing

745
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,696
right in the middle.

746
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,165
Couldn't stand up
straight till 1987.

747
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,307
So you can see why,
with this hernia thing... Ow!

748
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,609
Which is also

749
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:11,773
somewhat in the middle,
if you know what I mean,

750
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,808
I'm-I'm obviously
a little nervous.

751
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,800
Although being able to
talk to you is helping a lot.

752
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,801
I'm very grateful.

753
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,881
Of course, I'm not
going to be able to do this

754
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,649
while I'm out
cold, and Doctor...

755
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,106
What's his name again?

756
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,174
Benton.

757
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,686
Yeah, that's it. Benton.

758
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,378
When I'm under the
knife and he starts cutting.

759
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,292
Oh, my God. My God.

760
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,226
What if I don't come
out of this? Mr. Hartley...

761
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,945
I mean, I won't
know what happened.

762
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:35,035
Have you considered

763
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,297
having a local anesthetic
instead of a general?

764
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,255
I-I didn't know I had a choice.

765
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,018
Oh, yeah, and the
advantage to a local is that

766
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,821
while you feel no
pain whatsoever,

767
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:44,511
you're still completely awake,

768
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:47,030
and you can talk to the
surgeon all you want.

769
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,093
Can I ask questions?

770
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:49,516
Dr. Benton encourages it.

771
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:50,450
Right in the middle of surgery?

772
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:51,818
All the way through.

773
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:53,169
In fact, you can...

774
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,106
you could read up on
hernias in this book.

775
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,926
And anything that
you don't understand,

776
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,962
you can ask Dr. Benton.

777
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,227
That's great.

778
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,368
Yeah.

779
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,264
Jeanie! Ross was
looking for you.

780
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,365
Some kid needs suturing.

781
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,389
Going to be a while.

782
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,357
I have to go to radiology
and the cath lab.

783
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,358
Randi. Yeah.

784
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,993
Have you seen Mark?

785
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,895
I believe he's lounging.

786
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,364
Come on.

787
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,967
Wait, wait, wait.

788
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,836
This is a...

789
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,236
Hey, there you are.

790
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,972
I'm not talking to you.

791
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,708
You know, you made
poor Tad very sad.

792
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,743
What'd he say?

793
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,028
You don't even know him.

794
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:35,963
Got you.

795
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:36,998
That's a low one, Doug.

796
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:41,135
So I take it you don't want me

797
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,720
to tell anybody about
your date tonight.

798
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,463
You have another date tonight?

799
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,009
I hate this place.

800
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:54,915
Right there.

801
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,483
She hit it with her...

802
00:28:58,436 --> 00:28:59,447
Carol, it really would be better

803
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,421
if we sewed them.

804
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:02,100
Everything in this entire house

805
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:03,106
could be better.

806
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,107
Fine.

807
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,275
Fine.

808
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,209
But why are you mad at me?

809
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,078
I didn't put holes
in your floor,

810
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,879
break your furnace.

811
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,151
You're right. You're right.

812
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:18,088
I'm sorry.

813
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:22,292
I just... I really want
to sell this place.

814
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,646
I<i> need</i> to sell this place. Oy.

815
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,747
Is it because of Shep?

816
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:31,668
I mean, does it make
you think of him?

817
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:35,455
God, Mom, I never
even thought of that.

818
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:37,140
No.

819
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,487
No, I feel good being on my own.

820
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,788
I'm enjoying myself.

821
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,345
I just can't afford it.

822
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,880
The house, the car.

823
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:47,217
Somehow, I've accumulated
the debt of a 50-year-old.

824
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,020
We should call
your Uncle Mykola.

825
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,688
Uncle Myko? Why?

826
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,703
He made all that
money in real estate.

827
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:56,655
He could advise you.

828
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,646
Ma, it's not advice that I need.

829
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,847
Maybe not.

830
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,549
But spend some time there.

831
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:05,352
Keep him company.

832
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,739
You know, he has so much money.

833
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,291
He has no children of his own

834
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,960
and, sadly, he has not
been feeling well lately.

835
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:16,291
Are you suggesting
that I ingratiate myself

836
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,614
to Uncle Myko so that
he'll leave me his money?

837
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,383
Well, he's going to die.

838
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,484
I can't help that.

839
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,353
I mean, he has no children.

840
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,572
What's the poor man going to do?

841
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,508
God.

842
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:30,076
This feels like surgery.

843
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,077
It really does.

844
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:32,690
And I am floating,
floating, floating...

845
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:35,415
Except I always thought
you guys played music,

846
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,384
although I don't really miss it.

847
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,419
Is this going to
hurt, Dr. Benton?

848
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,399
I've already made the incision,
Mr. Hartley, and you didn't feel a thing.

849
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,022
No, no. I mean in
a couple of days.

850
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,619
Yeah. It's going to be tender.

851
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,441
No, I mean, like,

852
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,593
when I go back to work.

853
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:49,329
Look, go back to work when
you feel comfortable, okay?

854
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:50,542
Well, that's what I'm asking.

855
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:51,665
When will that be?

856
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,943
Are we talking Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday?

857
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:53,950
Another week?

858
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,869
What do you do, Mr. Hartley?

859
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:57,854
You know the
drawbridge on Michigan?

860
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,222
I send it up.

861
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,206
Send it down.

862
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:01,208
Send it up.

863
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:02,209
Send it down.

864
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:03,659
Up, down, up, down.

865
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,928
Rain, shine,

866
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,429
sleet, snow.

867
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,798
Some days, I count boats.

868
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:08,865
Some days, I don't.

869
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,651
By the way, what are the borders

870
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,287
of Hesselbach's triangle?

871
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:17,491
You might want to
shift a little to the left.

872
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,860
Manny threw up
right around there.

873
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:21,828
Manny from the roach coach?

874
00:31:21,864 --> 00:31:22,864
Food poisoning?

875
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:23,864
I told you.

876
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:25,799
It wasn't the coffee, was it?

877
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,934
Are you ever
getting off that thing?

878
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,714
I'm on hold with the airlines.

879
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:31,237
At least, that's what

880
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:33,050
their reservations department

881
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:34,386
has told me 97 times.

882
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,609
Mark, you ready?

883
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,478
Or not, as the case may be.

884
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:40,614
We'll be waiting.

885
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:43,060
All right.

886
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:46,185
I told Susan Lewis
about the staff meeting.

887
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,655
I told Jeanie Boulet,
Malik and Carter.

888
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,958
I figure if you don't
tell Doug Ross

889
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,593
then you're okay.

890
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:54,909
Huh.

891
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,278
Thomas. Thomas.

892
00:32:00,302 --> 00:32:02,268
How you doing there, Mr. Heath?

893
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,637
Thomas, where are you?

894
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,783
Your dinner's ready.

895
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,005
I bet those ribs hurt.

896
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,240
I'm sorry about that.

897
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:09,120
You hear me? Get inside now.

898
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,945
I'll get you something
for the pain.

899
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,548
Thomas, listen to me.

900
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:17,216
Listen to me!

901
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,385
I'm listening to you, Mr. Heath.

902
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:21,087
I'm listening to you.

903
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:31,398
There he is.

904
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:32,932
This is impossible.

905
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,535
Maybe you should yell "fire."

906
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,903
So crowded.

907
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:40,473
Every buzzard in the county
showed up for this one.

908
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,909
Present company excepted.

909
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:43,927
Alice Wakely.

910
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,262
She's run the county

911
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,596
health services since

912
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,597
the Paleolithic.

913
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,598
You know her?

914
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,233
Went to school together.

915
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,235
She was ahead of me, of course.

916
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,153
Okay! Okay, everybody!

917
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,189
I'll spare you and
make this quick.

918
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,635
While we obviously
regret the need

919
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,793
to close any county
medical facility...

920
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,278
She's lying already...
This isn't quick.

921
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,692
Our extremely strapped
budget has made it unavoidable.

922
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,883
As of two weeks from today,

923
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,159
Southside will close its doors.

924
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:13,551
Okay, there's the
good news for you.

925
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,076
Obviously, we're concerned
about the loss of jobs,

926
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:17,789
so we're going to consolidate

927
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:19,763
as much of the
staff as possible.

928
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,848
There's some people
here I want to introduce,

929
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,516
for those of you who
might not know them.

930
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,502
Harrison Holman is coming over

931
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,687
as new Chief of Obstetrics

932
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:28,738
Harrison!

933
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,073
Bonnie Brown

934
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,675
will share the CFO office

935
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,659
with James Malkovitch.

936
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,361
I've heard she's excellent.

937
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,197
Did a great job at Deaconess.

938
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:38,531
And with Mike Babcock

939
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:41,601
taking early retirement,
Donald Anspaugh

940
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:45,772
will become county's
new Chief of Staff.

941
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:48,007
Donald.

942
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,586
♪ ...Duke, Duke, Duke

943
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,955

Hit it! Hit it!

947
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,009
♪ Nothing can stop

948
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,366
Now, jazz it up.

949
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:14,446
Jerry!

950
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,303
Come on, dance with us.

951
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:17,504
No way.

952
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:18,871
Just a little.

953
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:22,209
You got it.

954
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:24,911
I was just thinking
how unusual it is

955
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:28,482
to see our whole ensemble,
you know, this happy.

956
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:30,695
Especially about keeping a job

957
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,530
where people puke on you.

958
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:33,720
Oh, is that the guy?

959
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:34,721
That's the guy.

960
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:36,283
Which guy?

961
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,942
He looks fairly normal.

962
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:42,446
So did Morgenstern.

963
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:45,415
So they finally came
down for Heath.

964
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,317
Took him to the CCU.

965
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:48,768
Oh, poor old guy.

966
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:50,853
Who do you think Thomas was?

967
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,889
His son maybe?

968
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,656
I know this sounds crazy,

969
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,875
but I think Thomas was his dog.

970
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,344
His dog?

971
00:34:57,379 --> 00:35:00,325
Yeah. At one point, he seemed
to think that I was Thomas.

972
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,677
And he pulled me in really
close, ear to his mouth,

973
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:06,541
and he whispers, "Kibble,
Kibble, Kibble, Kibble."

974
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,873
It was oddly touching.

975
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,708
It was, Carol.

976
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:12,942
How are you?

977
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,277
Don Anspaugh.

978
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,356
Oh. Randi.

979
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,345
How are you?

980
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,346
Lydia Wright.

981
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,347
Pleased to meet you.

982
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:19,849
E. Ray. Please join us.

983
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:21,851
Excuse me. I got it. I got it.

984
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:22,852
Sorry, Lydia.

985
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:23,853
Help!

986
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,188
E.R.

987
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,758
Yes.

988
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,093
Uh, okay.

989
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,195
I'll let everybody know.

990
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,883
That was, uh, Dr. Weaver
calling from the lounge.

991
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,918
Dr. Morgenstern will be unable

992
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:41,621
to attend the party.

993
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,437
David, I'm sure
it's not going to be

994
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:47,927
as bad as you think.

995
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:50,941
I mean, look how bad everybody
thought it was going to be

996
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:52,432
when I came aboard.

997
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,067
True.

998
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:57,920
Funny how life
is so like surgery.

999
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:00,790
Sometimes you can
make that Rocky-Davis

1000
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,809
in the right lower quadrant.

1001
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:05,027
And then, there are those days

1002
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:09,198
when your bowel ruptures
and spills into your peritoneum

1003
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:13,052
and all you're left with is
intense pain and sepsis.

1004
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,604
Oh, brother.

1005
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,874
My kingdom for a ten
blade when that happens.

1006
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,367
Lookit, so today's
not a total loss,

1007
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:31,137
you want to grab some
dinner, maybe catch a movie?

1008
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,590
The Music Box has some
really fine independents.

1009
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,026
Sure.

1010
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,195
Maybe a midnight
show at the Village.

1011
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,247
Have you seen<i> Caligula?</i>

1012
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,838
Uh-oh.

1013
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,785
No, no, no...
don't do this to me.

1014
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,475
Some of us have to date.

1015
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,327
See ya.

1016
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:55,662
Hi, there.

1017
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,113
Don Anspaugh.

1018
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,276
Mark Greene.

1019
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,251
So, uh... what
do you like, Mark?

1020
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:06,256
"Stars and Stripes Forever"
or "Dauntless Battalions"?

1021
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,492
Actually, I got to get going.

1022
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,459
Just kidding.

1023
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:30,730
This is, this is torture.

1024
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,365
I was off five minutes ago.

1025
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,345
My plan was to
be in bed by 8:30.

1026
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:36,769
No, no, no, no. I was saving
this guy for the two of you.

1027
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,738
Oh, vomiting,
abdominal pain, nausea...

1028
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:39,972
Thanks a lot, Malik.

1029
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,452
What have you been doing,
training with Dr. Benton?

1030
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,242
Trust me. You'll thank me.

1031
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:49,365
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Thank you, Malik.

1032
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,766
Mr. Travels, right?

1033
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,001
Yeah.

1034
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:52,969
Mr. Heath's nurse?

1035
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:53,836
I'm Dr. Carter.

1036
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,116
This is Nurse Hathaway.

1037
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,485
So, you're feeling bloated,
nauseous and flatulent.

1038
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,187
Must have been something
I ate, don't you think?

1039
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,390
It could be just so many things.

1040
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,541
Toxic megacolon.

1041
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:05,164
Intestinal parasitosis.

1042
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,243
Scleroderma.

1043
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:07,333
Ulcerative colitis.

1044
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,369
Pyloric stenosis.

1045
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:12,472
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:13,684
Crohn's Disease.

1047
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,185
Where would you
like to start, Doctor?

1048
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,754
I don't want to waste any time.

1049
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,027
Barium enema.

1050
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,364
Oh...

1051
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,348
Hi.

1052
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,883
I hate it when you do that.

1053
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:24,928
Come on, it's fun.

1054
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:25,985
No, it's not fun.

1055
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:27,753
It scared the
living daylights...

1056
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:29,088
All right, I'm sorry.

1057
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:30,490
It'll never happen again.

1058
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:33,159
Hey, Heather, let's go
get a drink, you and I.

1059
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,761
You couldn't get anything
going for tonight, huh?

1060
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:37,774
Oh, now, come on. I'm here.

1061
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:38,964
Thanks a lot.

1062
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,433
Come on, let's get a drink.

1063
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:42,301
It's never just a drink, Doug.

1064
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:44,537
Is that all that
you want it to be?

1065
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,183
Just once, it would be nice

1066
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:48,018
if you could call
the day before.

1067
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,842
Heather, you know my schedule.

1068
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:51,989
It's hard enough for me to
plan two hours ahead of time

1069
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,329
much less a day.

1070
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,431
Some really sick little
kid would come in,

1071
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,067
and then I would be
canceling on you all the time,

1072
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,069
and then, you'd be
mad at me for doing that.

1073
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,571
I am not mad at you.

1074
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,742
Heather...

1075
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,279
Hey.

1076
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,547
Heather...

1077
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,884
You look as though

1078
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,920
you've had a very
long, very hard day

1079
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,334
and I would like to take you out

1080
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,725
and see you
relax just a little bit.

1081
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,063
I'll throw in a lottery ticket.

1082
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,637
I've got to drop these
off at Neurology first.

1083
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,600
So did you actually
give him an enema?

1084
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,757
No. Compazine.

1085
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:39,259
Carter went home to bed.

1086
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,361
Benton's been beating up
on him pretty badly these days.

1087
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:44,697
I'm shocked and horrified
to hear that, Carol.

1088
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:48,168
Ding-dong. Avon calling.

1089
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:50,170
Oh, please, allow me.

1090
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:52,405
This is County
General on one alpha.

1091
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,751
Unit 85.

1092
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:55,909
We're en route with
a 32-year-old-male,

1093
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:59,612
jumped or pushed in front of
an el train at Garfield station.

1094
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,648
Massive head, face,
chest and extremity trauma.

1095
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:04,717
Garfield's closer to Southside.

1096
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:07,736
They're closed to trauma.

1097
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,705
I came out of the
ambulance entrance

1098
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,307
and my motorcycle had a flat.

1099
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:13,076
I'd given myself plenty of time

1100
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,278
to go home to the
apartment and change...

1101
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,612
I don't care.

1102
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,747
Really.

1103
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,916
So, you live up
on the Gold Coast?

1104
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,729
I'm renovating a three-flat.

1105
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,888
Oh! Must be a lot easier
when you're an architect.

1106
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,222
Yes, it probably is.

1107
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,224
You know, you know the pitfalls,

1108
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,427
how long things kind
of take, that sort of thing.

1109
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,029
Uh-huh.

1110
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,198
Oh... I see some friends.

1111
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:38,201
Well, actually,
a friend... Susan!

1112
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,835
Mark.

1113
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:43,506
You didn't tell me
you were coming here.

1114
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,842
Susan and I work
at County together.

1115
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,244
Oh... Brent Smythe.

1116
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,645
How do you do?

1117
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,646
Hi.

1118
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,382
This is Julie...

1119
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,383
Mathers.

1120
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,517
Mathers.

1121
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,019
Julie's an architect.

1122
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,387
Oh, really? Where?

1123
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,922
Uh, Higgin, Bloom.

1124
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,852
You're kidding. I
represent them.

1125
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,786
You with Jackson,
Gearson, and Robe?

1126
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,709
Going on 12 years.

1127
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:05,611
They recruited me
right out of Stanford.

1128
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:06,657
I don't believe this!

1129
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,225
My brother went to Stanford Law.

1130
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:09,532
He graduated in '85.

1131
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,567
Jack Mathers. Of course!

1132
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:11,834
He went to, uh, don't tell me,

1133
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,304
Dudzik, Hiltzik, and
Strauss in New York.

1134
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,722
You have a good
memory, don't you?

1135
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:21,778
Multiple lacerations,

1136
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:25,281
including a chunk of
his left rib cage missing.

1137
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,382
B.P. 60 Palp.

1138
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,584
1½ liters of
saline in the field.

1139
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,920
He's got obvious open fractures

1140
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,656
to the right femur
and left humerus.

1141
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,224
Okay...

1142
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,493
One, two, three.

1143
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,078
Hey, congratulations

1144
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:40,696
on staying open.

1145
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,126
Thanks! I'll intubate... 8.0.

1146
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,383
Get radial pulse.

1147
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,512
Contact refill.

1148
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,747
Jeanie, give me
an in-line traction.

1149
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,171
All right.

1150
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,301
BP's down, 40 palp. Pulse ox 80.

1151
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,841
Set up a vent.

1152
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:52,975
No response to pain.

1153
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:53,893
Call Radiology.

1154
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,312
Get a cross table C-spine.

1155
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,713
Okay... I'm in.

1156
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,115
Hang the O-neg.

1157
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,117
Oh, man. Sucking chest wound.

1158
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,713
How many units?

1159
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:05,355
Type specific four,
type and cross ten.

1160
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,689
What do we got?

1161
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,023
Open chest wound

1162
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,092
with severe
respiratory compromise.

1163
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,695
He's intubated but
still not saturated.

1164
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,413
Four units of O-neg are in.

1165
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,760
B.P.'S still 40.

1166
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,428
We got a pumper.

1167
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,918
Elevate that flail segment.

1168
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,464
I've got it. Okay, I've got it.

1169
00:42:20,488 --> 00:42:22,266
Kelly, okay, Jeanie,
you can go now.

1170
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,316
Grab me some more Kerlix.

1171
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,473
I've asked her to leave.

1172
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:31,447
Jeanie, could you check
with the blood bank,

1173
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:34,483
find out what's keeping
that type specific?

1174
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:40,500
How long do you think it
takes to get a couple of drinks?

1175
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,142
Hopefully, all night.

1176
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,213
Mmm. I guess this is
how perfect couples meet.

1177
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:49,926
Yeah, somebody
else's blind date.

1178
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,318
Great story for
the grandchildren.

1179
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:54,665
You know, you should call
Tad, and give him the tip.

1180
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:57,240
Did you really think you
were going to impress her

1181
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,224
in scrubs?

1182
00:42:58,259 --> 00:42:59,837
You don't think
she went for them?

1183
00:42:59,861 --> 00:43:01,911
I mean, I find it a turn-on,
but some women...

1184
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,145
What, are they coming?

1185
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,381
Follow me.

1186
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:12,271
Oh, I know. I got some quarters.

1187
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:17,677
I don't remember these
things being so small.

1188
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:20,179
Well, you probably
haven't been in one

1189
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:21,663
since you were 12.

1190
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,664
Okay?

1191
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,011
All right. Okay.

1192
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,334
What do we do?

1193
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,736
Look into the camera.

1194
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,982
No fair. You're
hogging the frame.

1195
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,223
All we're going
to see is my neck.

1196
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:33,075
That was a great one.

1197
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,210
Just sit there and look.

1198
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,280
They don't give you
any warning at all.

1199
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,999
Okay, it's coming up.

1200
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,161
No, come on.

1201
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,618
Okay, okay, I'm
ready. One good one.

1202
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,697
There. See? That wasn't bad.

1203
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:44,820
Nice.

1204
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,465
Don't you ever treat
me like that again.

1205
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,678
What the hell were
you trying to do?

1206
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,536
Trying to save that man's life.

1207
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,471
By giving him AIDS?

1208
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:03,472
I was careful, Peter.

1209
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:04,635
I used universal precautions.

1210
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:06,136
You were working
on a chest wound.

1211
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,088
What if you made a mistake,
cut yourself and bled into it?

1212
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:08,911
I didn't.

1213
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:09,895
Okay, what if I made

1214
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:10,958
a mistake and cut you?

1215
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,999
No person has ever got it
from a contact in an E.R.

1216
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:14,644
So, does that mean no one can?

1217
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:16,580
You pile up all the
data you want to,

1218
00:44:16,604 --> 00:44:17,914
but you better
damn well remember

1219
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:20,138
what really happens
in this room, okay?

1220
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:23,508
So, if you'd tested positive,
you would have quit?

1221
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:24,944
In a minute.

1222
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:29,999
Yeah, but you didn't
test positive, did you?
