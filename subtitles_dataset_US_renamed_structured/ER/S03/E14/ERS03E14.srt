1
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,045
Knock, knock.

2
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,380
Ahh. Who's there?

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,715
Me.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,049
You want some company?

5
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,418
Sure.

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,489
Whoa!

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,858
Oh, whoa, Nick.

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,413
Nick, get out of here, Nick.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,910
Nick, come on.

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:32,809
Sorry.

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,798
I'll be right back.

12
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:34,834
All right.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,769
Nick, get out of here.

14
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,575
Please leave a
message at the tone.

15
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,310
Hey, sweet pea.

16
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,279
Out of bed, sleepyhead.

17
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,747
Hi.

18
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,915
Hi, Polly.

19
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,752
Yeah... no, I was
just about to call you.

20
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,087
Dinner tonight?

21
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,022
Yeah, that sounds great.

22
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,340
About 8:00?

23
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,441
Mark...

24
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:00,609
You ran out of shampoo.

25
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,711
Yeah, it's, uh... on the shelf.

26
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:03,712
Okay.

27
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,463
I got to go.

28
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,032
Yeah, bye-bye.

29
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,537
Who was that?

30
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,672
That was a doctor.

31
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,842
We've got a staff
meeting tonight.

32
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,810
Oh, but we have
basketball tickets.

33
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,240
I thought that was
tomorrow night.

34
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,181
No, it's tonight.

35
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,515
Remember?

36
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:24,850
But you know,

37
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,085
if you really can't make it...

38
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,888
No, I think I can postpone...

39
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:35,126
<i>Morning, Dr. Carter.
What have you got?</i>

40
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,505
City bus versus
drunk pedestrian.

41
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,930
Open-book fracture of the
pelvis, blunt abdominal trauma.

42
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:39,931
You want to take this?

43
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,344
Lavage was
positive, so I thought

44
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,411
we'd start with an ex-lap.

45
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,869
I haven't got your
paperwork... Go.

46
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:44,981
Benton told me he'd do it.

47
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,338
Hasn't arrived in my office yet.

48
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,038
It's on its way.

49
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,039
I told you yesterday,

50
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,252
you can't begin the new rotation

51
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,720
until he's signed
off on the last one.

52
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,461
What am I supposed to do?

53
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:54,429
Until I get your
evaluation, nothing.

54
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:55,447
Dr. Hicks, please...

55
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,448
Find Benton,

56
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,682
get your paperwork.

57
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,551
Until then, you're grounded.

58
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,167
Oh, come on, man.

59
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,490
Let it go.

60
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,870
You was out of control.

61
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,193
It was offensive?

62
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,527
You charged.

63
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,062
Malik, if I'm up in the air,

64
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,398
you got to give me
room to come down.

65
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,178
So what you trying to
say? You get up so high

66
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,479
that I slide right up under you?

67
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,803
That's right.

68
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,149
So white men can jump?

69
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,471
That's right.

70
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,073
They just can't land.

71
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,641
That's why we don't do it.

72
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,677
Oh, man.

73
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,011
Hey, you want me to carry you?

74
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,451
Hey, Kerry.

75
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,219
Doug, that's not funny.

76
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,355
I sprained my
ankle playing hoops.

77
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,756
We've got a kid choking.

78
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,506
On what?

79
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,458
I don't know.

80
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,493
How long ago?

81
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,055
About ten minutes... I
drove as fast as I could.

82
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,511
He's not breathing.

83
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:44,858
Let's get him in. Go, go, go.

84
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:46,448
Connie.

85
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,250
All right, take care of the dad,

86
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,318
would you, please?

87
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:51,364
Magill forceps.

88
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,388
There you go.

89
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,122
Find him a sterile drape.

90
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:56,357
Let me borrow this.

91
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,293
He'll be all right.

92
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,727
Come on.

93
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,329
Move him over.

94
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,800
Get him on a monitor.

95
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,113
All right, what's in there?

96
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:10,054
Looks like a jacks ball.

97
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,801
Pulse ox is 80.

98
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,225
He's cyanotic.

99
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,642
Can you reach it?

100
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,344
No... the ball's
wedged in there.

101
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,580
He's in V-tach.

102
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,126
Give him 15 of lidocaine.

103
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,310
I'll shock him.

104
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:24,853
Go.

105
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,121
Get some lidocaine on board!

106
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:27,138
Clear. Everybody off.

107
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,174
Clear.

108
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:29,808
Still in V-tach.

109
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,009
Okay, here we go.

110
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,093
Clear.

111
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,130
Here we go.

112
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,594
Okay, prep for a trach.

113
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,835
Give me a 16-gauge
needle on a syringe.

114
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,835
Trach kit...

115
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,148
Hang on, hang on.

116
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,138
Just one second.

117
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:44,173
Let me try this.

118
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,641
Trach tray.

119
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:49,177
What the hell are you doing?

120
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,997
Trying to boost
the jack ball up.

121
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:52,981
Oh, man.

122
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:53,982
I can feel it.

123
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,217
This kid needs an airway.

124
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,551
Okay.

125
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:57,953
Get the forceps.

126
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,476
I can feel the ball.

127
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,912
It's moving.

128
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:07,896
It's moving.

129
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,209
I almost got it.

130
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,810
It's... it's moving.

131
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,750
Can you get it?

132
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,039
I got it.

133
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,507
All right, good.

134
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,309
All right.

135
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,572
Pedes resident's
on their way down.

136
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,912
Is he breathing?

137
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,368
Yep, he's breathing.

138
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,187
What on earth made
you think to do that?

139
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,176
Peter.

140
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,511
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,548
Hey.

142
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,127
Hey, yourself. I've
been calling for days.

143
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,384
Where you been?

144
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,697
I've been busy.

145
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,153
Oh, this place is a mess.

146
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,568
Yeah. I've been
working long hours.

147
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,091
You feeling all right?

148
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,437
Yeah, I'm just
a little tired is all.

149
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,944
You look terrible.

150
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,080
I saw Carla yesterday.

151
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,014
She's put on weight.

152
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,416
You noticed?

153
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:05,436
She's pregnant.

154
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,961
How could you be so stupid?

155
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:16,598
Are you going to marry her?

156
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,400
I don't know.

157
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,951
Be a father to your child?

158
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,487
What, she's not
good enough for you?

159
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,766
I didn't say that.

160
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,607
So what's the problem here?

161
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,709
Don't walk away from me.

162
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,044
Hey, look.

163
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,378
Hey.

164
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,115
Now, you don't
have to do this alone.

165
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,599
You've got family...

166
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,434
People who care for you, Peter.

167
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,802
Jackie, I know.

168
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,016
I'm... I'm going to
handle it, all right?

169
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,317
I'll take care of it.

170
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,657
How?

171
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:43,972
I don't know.

172
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,278
I, uh, I got to get
dressed for work.

173
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,541
Damn.

174
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,439
So when do you get off the cane?

175
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:54,429
About a week.

176
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,730
How'd you end up going out

177
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:57,599
with two women
on the same night?

178
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,378
Scheduling mix-up.
Any suggestions?

179
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,336
Dinner with one,
drinks with the other.

180
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,749
Yeah, I think they're
both expecting the works.

181
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,373
Who do you like more?

182
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,342
Well, Heather's a lot of fun.

183
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:08,554
Fun is good.

184
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,356
Polly, she's...
she's very spiritual.

185
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,946
Spiritual like what?

186
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,515
Like crystals or something?

187
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,228
Heather's got Bulls' tickets.

188
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:16,384
Bulls! Say no more.

189
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,530
Yeah, you're right.

190
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:19,532
I'll call Polly,
make up an excuse

191
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:21,601
and go out with
her tomorrow night.

192
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,258
You're playing with fire here.

193
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,470
I can juggle.

194
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,227
I think you'll get burnt.

195
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,263
Women can smell deceit.

196
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,796
Yeah, you ought to know.

197
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,798
Those days are
long gone, my friend.

198
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,077
So what do you do now?

199
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,268
Uh... give advice.

200
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,738
The form was very confusing.

201
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:37,939
Evidently.

202
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:39,273
What's going on?

203
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,877
Haleh's playing at nurse
manager while Carol's away.

204
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:44,779
I ordered 12 emesis basins.

205
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:46,014
She ordered 12 gross.

206
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,860
Hey, anybody seen our paychecks?

207
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,718
Ask your friendly nurse manager.

208
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,352
They always come in by noon.

209
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,122
Did you guys see this
memo from Dr. Fischer?

210
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:57,491
He wants to swab and culture
everyone for resistant staph.

211
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:58,927
What? What's this about?

212
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:01,229
Eight of our patients
came down with staph.

213
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,231
They think one of
us is spreading it.

214
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,276
Any idea who?

215
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,000
Could be anyone: you, me...

216
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:09,104
Jerry, get these
boxes out of here.

217
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,608
You still haven't
filled this out?

218
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:16,043
It's the evaluation I need
to transfer to Hicks's team.

219
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,044
Put it in my box.

220
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,846
I can't operate until
you sign off on it.

221
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:19,847
Leave it in my box.

222
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,015
No, do it now.

223
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,593
"Satisfactory work"?

224
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:33,962
Thanks for your time.

225
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,610
<i>What have you got?</i>

226
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,800
28-year-old female.

227
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,269
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest, arms.

228
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:42,437
This is my case.

229
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:43,582
Looks surgical to me.

230
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,706
Well, I'll page you
if I need a consult.

231
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,453
There's plenty
here for everyone.

232
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:48,654
Superficial lacerations,

233
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:49,938
deep penetrating wounds.

234
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,242
I'll get the bloods.

235
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:53,748
Spin a crit.

236
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,086
Sounds like a pneumo.

237
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,154
Haleh, chest tube tray.

238
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:00,088
Connie, I need a tray
over here too, please.

239
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,605
Why don't you two work together?

240
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,818
Doyle can suture.

241
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,743
You first. Connie, give
Carter some 4-O nylon.

242
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,739
Who's going to put the tube in?

243
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:07,940
I am. I am.

244
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,830
Trouble in the sandbox?

245
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,143
I'd like to put in a chest tube.

246
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,465
I don't know what you're doing.

247
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:14,335
Surgery's always
hogging our procedures.

248
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,514
I agree.

249
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:16,821
Dr. Doyle, you do it.

250
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,451
But, I've got more
experience, right?

251
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,407
Dr. Benton?

252
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:20,708
Ask Dr. Hicks.

253
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,454
Well, you're in luck.

254
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,273
The patient has
bilateral pneumothoraces.

255
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,792
You can each put
in your own tube.

256
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,131
I'll take this side.

257
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,344
Fine.

258
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,819
Peter, are you okay?

259
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,436
Yeah... yeah.

260
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,340
I like to make a
subcutaneous tunnel

261
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,503
above the rib to
avoid an air leak.

262
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,644
It's a nice technique...
Where'd you learn that?

263
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,295
I don't remember.

264
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,497
Kerry, you got this?

265
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:43,932
Yeah.

266
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,034
Are you sure you're okay?

267
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,069
Yeah, it's just a
little indigestion.

268
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:50,605
Try to avoid hitting
the intercostal bundle.

269
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,017
It's a common intern mistake.

270
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,191
For surgical interns.

271
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,506
Mine's in!

272
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,531
How you doing
over there, Maggie?

273
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,212
This pamphlet says
that 40% of all doctors

274
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,047
don't wash their
hands between patients.

275
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,237
Oh, no kidding.

276
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,317
Yeah, and medical
personnel pick their noses

277
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,952
an average of
three times an hour.

278
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,687
Many interns only
bathe twice a week.

279
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,379
Wendy, there's a limit to
how well informed I want to be.

280
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,458
Hey, Doug, we've
got a sick kid out front.

281
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,681
All right.

282
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,420
Nice technique.

283
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,156
Perhaps I could interest
you in a little detective work.

284
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,157
I doubt it.

285
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,503
I'm trying to track the culprit

286
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,588
that's been spreading
staph infection down here.

287
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:30,161
Good luck.

288
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:30,912
Jeanie,

289
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,013
please,

290
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,248
I could really use your help.

291
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,194
Well, it's not a very
attractive proposition.

292
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,801
We both know where
staph comes from.

293
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,948
Somebody's not
washing their hands

294
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,082
after going to the bathroom.

295
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,889
How do you propose
to flush them out?

296
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,224
Carefully.

297
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:44,625
Very carefully.

298
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,761
Can't catch his breath...
He's got cystic fibrosis.

299
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:52,751
What's his name?

300
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,985
Jad Heuston.

301
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,620
All right, Jad, hang
in there, buddy.

302
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,621
Fix you right up.

303
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,555
What's your name?

304
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,456
Katy Reed.

305
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,457
How old is he?

306
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,458
He's 19.

307
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,570
Has he been here before?

308
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,028
No, he hasn't...
We live in Racine.

309
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,029
Let's go.

310
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,363
What are you doing down here?

311
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,509
We were just visiting.

312
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,750
A kid this sick
shouldn't be traveling.

313
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:10,463
Wendy, get a CBC, portable chest

314
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:11,886
and O2 ten liters, please.

315
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,054
Pulse ox is bad: 82.

316
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,406
He's coughing up blood.

317
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,043
He's got rales, and
he's wheezing bilaterally.

318
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,477
Want a bronchodilator?

319
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,123
Yeah, give me five migs
of nebulized albuterol

320
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,347
and 200 of
aerosolized tobramycin.

321
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,927
Pulse ox is down to 78.

322
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:25,978
Heart rate's 130.

323
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,079
We're going to
have to intubate him.

324
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,353
No.

325
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,520
We can't wait.

326
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,666
He doesn't want to
be put on a machine.

327
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,856
Does he have a DNR order?

328
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,536
I think so... yes,
he does, he does.

329
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,093
If he's DNR, we can't tube him.

330
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,662
You understand he's going to die

331
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,774
if we don't tube him.

332
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,897
Jad, please.

333
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,716
No... no.

334
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,267
Please don't leave me.

335
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,535
What's his doctor's name?

336
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,382
Dobry, I think...
Something like that.

337
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,973
All right, Lydia, call
Dr. Dobry in Racine.

338
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,140
Call about the DNR order.

339
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,926
Find out now... <i>now,</i> please.

340
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,845
One, two, three.

341
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,063
Mr. Papillon?

342
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:57,148
One... yes, three.

343
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,277
One, two, three.

344
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm Dr. Greene.

345
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,102
What seems to be the problem?

346
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:01,836
Busy.

347
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,015
Paged psych?

348
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,205
On the way.

349
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,174
One, two, three. One, two...

350
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,963
Mr. Papillon, would you like me
to give you something to relax?

351
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,147
No... two, three.

352
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:15,549
Got any other ideas?

353
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,518
I'm thinking.

354
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,320
Hey, Archie.

355
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:20,465
Hi.

356
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,700
Psych consult?

357
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:24,375
You stopped taking your
medication, didn't you?

358
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,095
Yeah... two, three.

359
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:29,630
Nina Pomerantz.

360
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,709
Mark Greene.

361
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,867
He's one of our regulars.

362
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,618
Archie! Snap it.

363
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,273
Thanks.

364
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:40,808
That's amazing.

365
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,893
Basic behavior therapy.

366
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,539
You think it'd work on my
seven-year-old daughter?

367
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,512
What's her problem?

368
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,525
She started sucking
her thumb again

369
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:47,827
when my wife and I got divorced.

370
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,518
My six-year-old started to wet
the bed when I got divorced.

371
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,064
Did you use behavioral therapy?

372
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,421
No... electroshock.

373
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:54,489
Works like a charm.

374
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,360
Kidding.

375
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,511
I'm just kidding.

376
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,579
I hate to interrupt...

377
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,081
Oh, yeah... gosh, Archie.

378
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,259
Come on, let's go
upstairs and talk.

379
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,516
Nice meeting you.

380
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,871
You, too. See you around.

381
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,385
We're losing him.

382
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:14,843
Any word on the DNR?

383
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,044
Not yet.

384
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,261
I found a pipe

385
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,379
and some weed in his socks.

386
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:19,881
He's smoking dope with CF?

387
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,948
Must be a death wish.

388
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:22,283
They're paging Dr. Dobry.

389
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,198
Guess what? He's a pediatrician.

390
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:27,538
How old is he?

391
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,740
I told you, he's 19.

392
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,443
19-year-olds don't
go to a pediatrician.

393
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,811
How old is he?

394
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,599
He's 17.

395
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:39,818
Eight ET Tube!

396
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,030
He's crashing!

397
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,253
Should we restrain him?

398
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,589
Yeah, give him sux and pav.

399
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,724
I'm tubing him.

400
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,596
Hold his head.

401
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,014
I'm sorry, Jad.

402
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,601
Yeah, it hit me suddenly,

403
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,058
so I have to cancel.

404
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:06,394
Bless you.

405
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,395
He's not sick.

406
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,607
He's blowing off a date.

407
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:09,931
Oh, yeah?

408
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,665
So yeah, I'm going
to get to bed early.

409
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,934
So I'll call you tomorrow.

410
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:14,201
Okay, bye, Pol.

411
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,547
What's wrong with Polly?

412
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,938
Don't start.

413
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:19,373
He had to make room for Heather.

414
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:21,186
So you got two on the line.

415
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,142
Hi, Mark.

416
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,889
I forgot Mr. Papillon's chart.

417
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,547
Oh, well, that's a coincidence,
because I have it right here.

418
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,778
A Freudian might say
I forgot it on purpose.

419
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,168
Oh?

420
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:33,666
Actually, you know,
I was supposed to

421
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,835
have dinner tonight with a
colleague, and they canceled.

422
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,169
I was wondering, are you free?

423
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:38,792
I'd love to, but
I'm all jammed up.

424
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:39,726
Oh.

425
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,295
But I'd really like to.

426
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,408
Well, it's just an impulse.

427
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:43,575
Probably another time.

428
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,565
No, no, no, no.

429
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,817
It's a great impulse.

430
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,618
I got to have
dinner with a friend...

431
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,954
My accountant, Roy...
But we could do drinks.

432
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:50,637
Are you sure?

433
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,573
Yeah... meet down here at 6:00?

434
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:53,802
Okay, I'll see you then.

435
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,159
All right, good.

436
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,300
Jerry, can we lose these boxes?

437
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,600
Busy boy.

438
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:06,270
Pulse ox is up to 94.

439
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,771
Prep for an extubation.

440
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,640
Okay... his mother's out front.

441
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,076
Said she would have
been here sooner,

442
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,146
but her car was stolen...
The one that's outside.

443
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,730
You want to fill me in?

444
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,249
We were going to Mexico.

445
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,985
We were going to get
a place on the beach

446
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,682
and be together till the end.

447
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:26,173
The doctors gave
him three months.

448
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,875
Why can't you be together here?

449
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,011
His mom wants to put him back

450
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,379
in the hospital.

451
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:32,414
Is he all right?

452
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,615
He's fine, his
airway was blocked,

453
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:36,116
but we got it cleared.

454
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,117
Oh, thank God.

455
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,053
Sweetheart, I was so worried.

456
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,021
Katy, I knew <i>you'd</i> be here.

457
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:42,590
What are you trying
to do... kill him?

458
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,803
He'd rather be dead
than be with you.

459
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,327
Katy, would you give
us a minute, please?

460
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,929
Sure.

461
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:54,418
He wants me to stay.

462
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,255
Can we, uh, talk over here?

463
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,350
Yes, absolutely.

464
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,753
I was in the process
of taking the tube out.

465
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:01,742
Already?

466
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,121
Well, his lungs
are fairly clear,

467
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:04,590
and, uh... he wanted it out.

468
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:06,358
When I first brought him in here

469
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,993
he didn't want to be intubated.

470
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,060
He said that he had

471
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,662
a "Do not resuscitate" order.

472
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:11,686
He lied.

473
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,754
Look, he has this...

474
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,356
romantic notion about dying.

475
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,042
Well, I just needed to know

476
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,206
that if he stops
breathing again...

477
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,778
Intubate him.

478
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,298
Okay.

479
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,702
All right, Jad.

480
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,838
We'll get this tube out for you.

481
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:34,075
Now, why don't
you do me a favor?

482
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,210
I want you to take
a real deep breath,

483
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,595
as deep as you
can... Now blow hard.

484
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,147
Blow, blow. Okay.

485
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,603
You okay?

486
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,522
Hmm?

487
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,185
Don't ever...

488
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,926
tube me again.

489
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,127
Why are you taking our picture?

490
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,751
It's the best way to keep
track of the suspects.

491
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,796
Two swabs?

492
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,786
Nasal and rectal.

493
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,066
We need them back by 3:00.

494
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,423
God, I feel like a convict.

495
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,058
The number
matches your lab slip.

496
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,937
I hope the doctors
get the same treatment.

497
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,139
Oh, yeah, they
have to swab, too.

498
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,107
Staphylococcus
does not discriminate.

499
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,214
Smile, Wendy.

500
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,484
Give me the bullet!

501
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,685
Give me the bullet.

502
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,286
23-year-old I.V. drug user,

503
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:20,287
multiple GSW's,

504
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:21,683
BP 80 palp, pulse 140.

505
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,502
Lost at least a
liter at the scene.

506
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:25,003
His buddy says he's got AIDS.

507
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,306
Okay, let's have him
cross-matched for six.

508
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,796
And get some O-neg down here.

509
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,797
All taken care of.

510
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,032
I can run this one.

511
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:32,767
So can I.

512
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,668
I'll run it.

513
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,369
We'll start with the ABCs.

514
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:36,715
He's bleeding from his mouth.

515
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,372
Pressure's falling, 60 palp.

516
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,535
I got the O-neg.

517
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,158
Run it through the transfuser.

518
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,142
Intubation tray.

519
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:43,955
He may have a
hemopneumo... Chest tube tray?

520
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,363
You need help, Dr. Doyle?

521
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,431
No, thank you.

522
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,432
I got the film.

523
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,449
Clamp.

524
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,334
Don't touch it, Carter!

525
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,302
The bullet. What?

526
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,387
Where you're about
to stick your finger.

527
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,088
This guy has AIDS.

528
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:54,838
So?

529
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,824
It's a black talon... the edges

530
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,975
are like razors.

531
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,778
Okay... I'm never
going to find this thing.

532
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,593
Oh, I don't believe
it, I don't believe it.

533
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,783
It's right there.

534
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:08,213
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

535
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:09,347
He's arrested.

536
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:10,304
Let's crack him.

537
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,572
Want to do the honors?

538
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,840
Second unit's in.

539
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,847
Has anyone seen the
damn nursing schedule?

540
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,860
I thought you
were in charge of it.

541
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,517
I better have this weekend off.

542
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,186
I've got National Guard duty.

543
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,253
Oh, God help us.

544
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,788
Anybody seen the ultrasound?

545
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:30,002
Everything's a little
disorganized here

546
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:30,991
without Carol.

547
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,037
I would try Exam 2.

548
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:33,493
When's she coming back?

549
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,680
We just hope she<i> is</i> coming back.

550
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:37,881
One unit plasma.

551
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:38,882
Suction!

552
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,829
She can't see a thing in here.

553
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,464
Bullet must have
nicked an artery.

554
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,499
All right, Statinski.

555
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,783
Intracardiac epi ready.

556
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,774
What the hell? This
thing is jammed.

557
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:47,841
I can't use this.

558
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,571
I'll find another one.

559
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,961
Doyle, put pressure on the lung.

560
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:51,962
Carter, do compressions.

561
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,191
I'm squeezing.

562
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,247
No, it's me.

563
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:55,561
Oh, I got it, I got it.

564
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:58,285
Good job, you two...
Now, can you hold on

565
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
while we take him upstairs?

566
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,521
Yeah.

567
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,556
Sure.

568
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,572
Can I assist?

569
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,824
Is your paperwork done?

570
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,953
Signed and in your box.

571
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,121
Okay, let's get him
to the OR, people.

572
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,678
Come on, let's go!

573
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,883
What's the ultrasound
doing in there?

574
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:12,984
I don't know,

575
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,285
but that CF kid wants
to talk to an attending.

576
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,481
All right, I'll be right there.

577
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:20,992
Peter?

578
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,493
What are you doing?

579
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,761
Nothing.

580
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,162
It must be something.

581
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,797
When did the pain start?

582
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,865
Last night.

583
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:28,866
Location?

584
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,101
Mid-epigastric.

585
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,736
Shifted to the right lower
quadrant this morning.

586
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:33,782
Fever?

587
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,955
100.2.

588
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:36,540
Lie down, Peter.

589
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,753
You know what, Kerry,
it's probably just a virus.

590
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:38,821
Lie down.

591
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,277
Lydia, can you assist?

592
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,525
Dr. Benton?

593
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,750
Just relax, Peter.

594
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,500
Sorry.

595
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,723
Alert the OR.

596
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,941
Dr. Benton has

597
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,943
a hot appendix.

598
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,943
So?<i> ¿Oistes lo de</i> Mark Greene

599
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,011
<i>y las tres chavas?</i>

600
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,167
¿<i> Tu crees?</i>

601
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,870
<i>Ya parece un doctor</i> don juan.

602
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,048
<i>¿Estas celosa?</i>

603
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,139
<i>No, nosotros tuvimos
algo, tu sabes,</i>

604
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,674
<i>un</i> little fling,<i> pero...</i>

605
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,545
Is it true what they
say about<i> los calvitos?</i>

606
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,346
Girl,<i> ese es bien apasionado.</i>

607
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,849
<i>Todo lo que quiere
hacer es sexo, sexo, sexo.</i>

608
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,965
No!

609
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,720
Hey, uh, you guys seen Doug?

610
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,755
Uh... try the admit desk.

611
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,792
What?

612
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,075
N... nothing.

613
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,602
Hey, Doug, you busy?

614
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,938
What's the
recommended antibiotics

615
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,052
for end-stage cystic fibrosis?

616
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,041
Oh, I'm sorry.

617
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,242
So I took your advice,

618
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,643
and I canceled with Polly.

619
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,644
Good.

620
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,779
And then I met Nina.

621
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,147
So now it's drinks with Nina

622
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,415
and basketball with Heather.

623
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,416
Great.

624
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,417
Listen, do you think

625
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,385
I should call up Heather,

626
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,830
and have her meet
me at the stadium?

627
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,732
Then I could spend a
little more time with Nina.

628
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,523
Mark, I'm a little busy
here with a sick kid.

629
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,891
Can we just talk
about this later?

630
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,892
Oh, yeah, sure.

631
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,893
Catch you later.

632
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,894
Hi.

633
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,209
Hi, Mark.

634
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,176
That's a tough case.

635
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,210
You know, that kid
with end-stage CF.

636
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,251
Yeah, if he had a jacks
ball caught in his throat

637
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:12,353
maybe I could fix him.

638
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:15,572
You know, he wants
to be made DNR.

639
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:17,775
You talked to him?

640
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,776
Yes.

641
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,011
He's my patient.

642
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,790
Well, he spoke to me,

643
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,381
maybe because you
haven't been listening to him.

644
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,378
He's 17 years old... It's
his mother's decision.

645
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:27,813
He'll be 18 in three weeks.

646
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:28,986
So?

647
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,082
So maybe we should
consider his feelings.

648
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,272
He's a teenager.

649
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,007
He's mixed up... He
ran away from home.

650
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,137
He's also terminally ill

651
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,821
and doesn't want
to be on a respirator.

652
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:37,873
You know, I can't go along

653
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,297
with letting him
die... Can't do it.

654
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,018
Whose problem is
this, his or yours?

655
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:53,527
Oh, my God. It's true.

656
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,407
I thought the nurses
were just kidding.

657
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:56,997
Look, Dr. Hicks, I don't want

658
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,999
any residents
operating on me, okay?

659
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:00,295
Don't worry, Peter.

660
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,132
It's just your average
run-of-the-mill appendectomy.

661
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,522
All right, so
you'll do it, right?

662
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,523
I'll be there.

663
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,558
Okay.

664
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,180
I'd better go scrub.

665
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:14,893
I need you to sign
this consent form.

666
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,428
If you have any questions,
Dr. Hicks will answer them.

667
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,618
That won't be necessary.

668
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,722
All right.

669
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,723
Come on, let's, uh...

670
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,159
let's get this thing over with.

671
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,760
Okay, time to prep.

672
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:28,162
Raise your gown.

673
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,953
It's a mystery.

674
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,220
Doesn't add up.

675
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,100
Here are the patients
with resistant staph.

676
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,625
But none of them were treated
by the same doctor or nurse.

677
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:42,704
Where's the missing link?

678
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,562
Well, we could put
cameras in the bathrooms

679
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,564
to see who doesn't
wash their hands.

680
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,146
Wait a minute.

681
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,152
What?

682
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:53,804
All these charts

683
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,989
have the same
handwriting on top.

684
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:57,057
You recognize it?

685
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,643
Uh-huh.

686
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,797
Yeah, fine.

687
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:07,234
Hey, Jeanie, Dr. Fischer.

688
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,437
Can I offer you guys
a homemade brownie?

689
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,488
No, thanks.

690
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,192
What, something wrong?

691
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:18,445
Hey.

692
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,557
What are you doing?

693
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:20,948
Scrubbing in.

694
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,783
Dr. Hicks said I could help
out on that thoracotomy.

695
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,530
Oh, you're
interested in surgery?

696
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:26,519
Yeah, you know,

697
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:28,505
I'm thinking about
doing an elective.

698
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,851
Hey, I want to thank you again

699
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,653
for warning me
about that bullet.

700
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:32,677
My dad's a cop.

701
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,444
We talk ammo at
the dinner table.

702
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Seriously?

703
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,059
Yeah, you should
see my gun collection.

704
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,417
I got a Beretta 687, a
Winchester Golden Quail,

705
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,087
and I got a Tommy gun
that belonged to Dillinger.

706
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,088
Wow.

707
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,288
Change in plans.

708
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,291
Simon's got the gunshot,
we're doing the Appy.

709
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,559
The Appy?

710
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,828
Disappointed?

711
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,830
Yeah... yeah,
they're kind of boring.

712
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,565
You haven't seen
the patient yet.

713
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,907
Ho...

714
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:08,228
Oh... there is a God.

715
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:11,064
What are my chances
of getting out of here?

716
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:12,799
I can't say.

717
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:15,201
Don't give me that crap.

718
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,281
You still have some time.

719
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:18,939
Three months, max.

720
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,353
You could spend
that time with Katy.

721
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,476
Great.

722
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:25,579
She can suction the
snot out of my lungs

723
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,147
while I stare at the ceiling.

724
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:30,884
I've been in hospitals
my whole life.

725
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,905
I watched two friends
die on a respirator slowly...

726
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,907
wasting away.

727
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,675
No, thanks.

728
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,093
It's not your decision.

729
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:41,161
Oh, please.

730
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:43,563
I'll be 18 in three weeks.

731
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,265
I can't do it.

732
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:46,317
Screw you!

733
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,470
What about me?

734
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,207
It's up to your mom.

735
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,725
She's been telling me

736
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,927
what to do my whole life.

737
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,829
For once, let me do what I want.

738
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,218
No.

739
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,120
She's afraid of losing you.

740
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,323
She's going to lose me anyway.

741
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,962
Talk to her.

742
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,363
Tell her to let me go.

743
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,340
Hey, look who it is.

744
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:28,475
Hi.

745
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,877
What are you doing here?

746
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,056
Came to pick up my paycheck.

747
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,290
Not here yet.

748
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,626
Thanks for taking our
side against management.

749
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,028
I guess you're paying for it.

750
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:37,017
Yeah.

751
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:38,618
What are all these
boxes doing here?

752
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:39,987
Procurement screwed up.

753
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:42,556
Oh, some fool ordered
by the gross, huh?

754
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:43,724
Here's my paycheck.

755
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,203
Any idea when
you're coming back?

756
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:46,227
No...

757
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,328
The hearing's in a couple
of weeks, though, so...

758
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:49,329
We've missed you.

759
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:50,530
Thanks.

760
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:51,910
Well, I'm off to Pottery Barn.

761
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,244
Going to go buy some candles.

762
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,268
See you.

763
00:25:57,573 --> 00:26:00,074
Someone order some hypodermics?

764
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,064
Ah, this is ridiculous.

765
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,401
I do not need
hand-washing lessons.

766
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,731
Scrub hard, Jerry, to
scrape off the bacteria.

767
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:14,333
The most important
thing is to wash your hands

768
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:15,366
after you go to the bathroom.

769
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,990
What, every time?

770
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:24,042
You have the Roux retractor?

771
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,032
Yes, Peter, and the Army-navies

772
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,367
and the Kocher.

773
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:28,669
Okay, listen, listen.

774
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:31,121
Make sure you put
an "X" on my right side,

775
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,575
because I don't want you
taking out my left kidney, okay?

776
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,376
I'm putting you to sleep now.

777
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:38,445
Where's Dr. Hicks?

778
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:42,766
Oh, there's been a
last-minute substitution.

779
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,852
Carter?

780
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:47,954
Don't worry, Dr. Benton.

781
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:50,607
I'm going to take
very good care of you.

782
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,380
He hates me.

783
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,216
I know he loves me,
but he also hates me.

784
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,218
Is he an only child?

785
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,785
After he was diagnosed,

786
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,255
we decided not to
risk passing it on.

787
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,491
So I spoke to Jad,

788
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,759
and he wants you to
sign his DNR papers.

789
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,074
Of course he does.

790
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,032
And he's got a pretty
convincing argument.

791
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,667
Just wants to hurt me.

792
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,802
I don't... I don't
think that's true.

793
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,571
Shouldn't you give him a chance

794
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,507
to, you know,
make this decision?

795
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,008
He's almost 18 years old.

796
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,255
He was a beautiful
baby, Dr. Ross.

797
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,414
When the doctors told us
that he had cystic fibrosis,

798
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,483
it was like somebody
plunged a knife into my heart.

799
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,286
And now he's grown up

800
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,089
and he wants to
take control of his life

801
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:43,276
and he doesn't want to die
hooked up to a respirator.

802
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:44,862
And you agree with him?

803
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:45,962
It doesn't...

804
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,165
He doesn't have much time left.

805
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,568
It seems a shame
to-to spend it...

806
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,837
you know, fighting
with your son.

807
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,574
I don't know what to do.

808
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:03,330
Well, he does.

809
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,117
Jerry, how we
doing on the board?

810
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,674
Actually, there's a
psychotic wrestler in 2.

811
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,222
Would you like me to page
a certain psych consult?

812
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:18,745
That's an excellent idea.

813
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,214
Hey, sweet pea.

814
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:22,749
Oh, you poor thing,

815
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,462
having to work
while you're sick.

816
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:25,919
Polly, I-I-I can't talk.

817
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,154
I got laryngitis.

818
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,839
This is Elderberry
extract. It's homeopathic.

819
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,809
Cleared my flu right up.

820
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,743
Thank you, but excuse me.

821
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,712
Cancel that page.

822
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,347
Look, you should go.

823
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,516
I don't want you to catch this.

824
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,617
Mm-mm.

825
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,885
Not until I make
you an herbal steam

826
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,850
of lavender for your throat.

827
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:47,558
Yeah... uh, Jerry,
we'll be in the lounge.

828
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:50,594
Shirley?

829
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,762
Yes, sir.

830
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:54,364
Would you put on my
special music, please?

831
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,844
Certainly, Dr. Carter, sir.

832
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,657
Scalpel.

833
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,745
Hold it, Dr. Carter.

834
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,930
Shirley.

835
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:14,515
Come here... let's get this one.

836
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,227
Let's get one with
Dr. Hicks and Dr. Doyle.

837
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,366
What's your approach?

838
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,101
I'm going to make a
minimal Rocky-Davis incision

839
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,755
in the right lower quadrant
at McBurney's point.

840
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,889
Proceed.

841
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:47,300
Inhale.

842
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,838
The steam won't work
unless you breathe it in.

843
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,372
Uh, excuse me, Dr. Greene.

844
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:55,392
Um, your psychiatrist
is at the desk.

845
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,907
Oh, uh, I'll be right back.

846
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,275
Thought I told you to cancel.

847
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,498
The page went through.

848
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,665
Sorry.

849
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,666
Hi.

850
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,934
Did you page me, Mark?

851
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,181
Uh, yeah.

852
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,838
We have a patient in 2
who needs evaluating.

853
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,874
Okay, I'm looking
forward to this evening.

854
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,020
Me, too.

855
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,511
Uh, Dr. Greene to
the front desk, please.

856
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,846
Emergency at the
front desk, Dr. Greene.

857
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:17,847
I'll see you at 7:00.

858
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:18,848
6:00.

859
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:19,924
Right.

860
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,321
Mark, my brother got
us court-side seats.

861
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,156
I was so excited,
I had to come by.

862
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,157
That's terrific.

863
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,925
We could get a bite
before the game.

864
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,372
I've got that meeting at 6:00.

865
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,461
Safety committee?

866
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,608
Yeah, I was hoping I could
meet you at the stadium.

867
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:34,964
Okay, how about
dinner afterwards?

868
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,744
You know, we should
talk, but I'm really swamped.

869
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,635
Well, that's okay,
I'll just have a seat.

870
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,636
Uh, Dr. Greene.

871
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,637
You know what?

872
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,239
You don't really
want to sit in there.

873
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:43,806
There's this rampant
staph infection

874
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,941
that's going around the ER.

875
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,510
So why don't you
just sit over here?

876
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,622
Here?

877
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,445
Yeah, yeah, this is fine.

878
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,546
I'll be right back.

879
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,083
Mark, you really
shouldn't be on your feet.

880
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,762
You know, Polly,
why don't you go back

881
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,998
and keep that lavender
steaming? Okay?

882
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,422
Thanks.

883
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,202
That is a very
interesting case, Mark.

884
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,237
He says he's diagnosed

885
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,977
with multiple
personality disorder.

886
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,096
Really?

887
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,308
Are you okay? Yeah.

888
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,398
Nina?

889
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,749
Polly?

890
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,829
Oh! I haven't seen
you in a blue moon.

891
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:14,204
I thought you practiced
at Northwestern.

892
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,221
I used to.

893
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:17,190
Are you still at the gallery?

894
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:18,369
I sure am.

895
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:19,626
Mark, this is Polly McKenzie.

896
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,461
My old friend
Polly, Mark Greene.

897
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:22,462
I know.

898
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:24,209
Mark and I are
seeing each other.

899
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,865
We were supposed to have

900
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,883
dinner tonight,

901
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,230
but he came down with the flu,

902
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,203
poor baby.

903
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:32,872
That's funny... I thought
we were having drinks.

904
00:31:32,908 --> 00:31:34,006
Gee...

905
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,870
was that drinks before or after

906
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,677
the basketball game?

907
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,814
You're not sick.

908
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:42,348
Uh, no, but I'm starting

909
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:44,033
to feel a little nauseous.

910
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:48,383
Did he spike a fever?

911
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,373
Five minutes ago.

912
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,885
Get blood cultures times three.

913
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,242
I'll get the intubation tray.

914
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:53,243
No, no...

915
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,889
His mother signed a DNR order.

916
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,880
How you doing, buddy?

917
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,368
Remember, Dr. Ross...

918
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:03,331
Put an O2 mask on him, please.

919
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,121
You're sure?

920
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,440
Yes.

921
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:08,108
Where's his mom?

922
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,675
She's in the cafeteria.

923
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:11,444
Get her now, will you? Go!

924
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,652
♪ Fancy gloves, though ♪

925
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,956
♪ Wears old Macheath, babe... ♪

926
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:25,469
Shirley, could you
turn that down?

927
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:27,694
Just a bit.

928
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,763
I am ready to close.

929
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,898
Nice work, Carter.

930
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:32,983
Thanks.

931
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:35,118
Maybe I'll staple my
name into his belly.

932
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:39,350
All right, let's irrigate
one more time.

933
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,975
We don't want to give
Dr. Benton an abscess.

934
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,410
Dr. Doyle, you want to
suction out Dr. Benton?

935
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,630
Can I have O-PDS on a CT-3?

936
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,299
I will close out with
a running stitch.

937
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,418
You ever done a one-handed tie?

938
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:53,453
No.

939
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,541
I often practice on pigs' feet,

940
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:01,144
but since Dr. Benton
is available...

941
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,311
Hold the suture

942
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,064
in your left hand,
and don't let go.

943
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:07,467
And you take it between your
thumb and your forefinger...

944
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:08,568
All right...

945
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:10,102
Around...

946
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,504
and through.

947
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,673
Pretty nifty.

948
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,541
Yeah... yeah.

949
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,695
Would it be all right
if Dr. Doyle tried one?

950
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,147
I don't think
Dr. Benton would mind.

951
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:23,460
After all, we are a
teaching hospital.

952
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,972
Thanks for all your help today.

953
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,973
Yeah, sure.

954
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,674
You know, we make a good team.

955
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,793
Maybe we should go
out again sometime.

956
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:35,144
No, I don't think so.

957
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:35,895
It could be fun.

958
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,207
I don't think it's a good idea.

959
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:38,264
Come on, Jeanie, dinner.

960
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:40,819
Let's just keep it
professional, okay?

961
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,639
His pulse ox is falling, 83.

962
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:46,640
What happened?

963
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:48,608
He's in respiratory failure.

964
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:49,993
I'm here, sweetheart.

965
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,330
Sweetie.

966
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,915
He stopped breathing.

967
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,001
Oh, my God.

968
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,736
Oh, God. I can't watch this.

969
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,677
Intubate him.

970
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:41,878
Yeah, please.

971
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,330
No, we promised.

972
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:45,498
No, no.

973
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,117
Mrs. Heuston. Do it!

974
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:47,834
No, no.

975
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:48,751
Mrs. Heuston, no.

976
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:49,752
You signed the paper.

977
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,438
Well, then, rip up the paper!

978
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:53,657
Just do it!

979
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,743
I said do it!

980
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,051
I'm sorry.

981
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,052
Intubation tray.

982
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:07,053
Hold him down.

983
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:08,387
50 Of sux.

984
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:09,733
We'll have to paralyze him.

985
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,657
Hold him down.

986
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,826
Number eight ET Tube

987
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,428
Please.

988
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,434
I'm in.

989
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:23,214
There you go... bag him.

990
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:25,406
He's tubed.

991
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,037
I feel like such a klutz.

992
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,017
Lots of people fall
off step ladders.

993
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,741
I fell<i> over</i> one... I
was hanging a picture

994
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,678
took three steps back
and landed on my ass.

995
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,745
You're lucky.

996
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,580
I guess.

997
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,217
I bet you don't
remember me, do you?

998
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,285
Should I?

999
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,898
I was in here about a year ago.

1000
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:57,821
I weighed 40 pounds less.

1001
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,350
I had pneumonia and almost died.

1002
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:02,058
You took care of me.

1003
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,477
You have AIDS.

1004
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:05,478
Yeah.

1005
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:06,896
I was all set to die.

1006
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,226
I said good-bye to everyone.

1007
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,360
I got rid of my stuff,

1008
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:10,944
even cashed in
my life insurance.

1009
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,269
Then everything changed.

1010
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,352
Really?

1011
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:14,966
You've heard of the cocktail.

1012
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,990
Mm-hmm.

1013
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:17,101
My doctor put me on it.

1014
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:20,210
I haven't felt this
good in a long time.

1015
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,411
That's great.

1016
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:22,690
It's weird.

1017
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,592
It's like I was on death row

1018
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,160
and the governor called.

1019
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,768
Takes a little getting used to.

1020
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:31,921
But it is a hell of a
lot better than dying.

1021
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,546
Peter?

1022
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,568
Peter, I'm pregnant.

1023
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,620
What?

1024
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:50,806
I'm pregnant.

1025
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,676
No.

1026
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,340
Dr. Benton.

1027
00:36:55,364 --> 00:36:57,163
I'm pregnant.

1028
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,950
Dr. Benton?

1029
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,501
Dr. Benton?

1030
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:06,272
Dr. Benton?

1031
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:11,777
There we go.

1032
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,780
The surgery was a
complete success.

1033
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,118
You had an acute
suppurative appendicitis

1034
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,802
with no complications.

1035
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:22,989
Here's your appendix.

1036
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,074
What?

1037
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,475
Shh, don't try and talk.

1038
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,994
You're just coming
out of the anesthesia.

1039
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,328
I really screwed up.

1040
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:30,558
I really did.

1041
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,564
You did?

1042
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,678
I never gave the kid a chance.

1043
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:35,401
And Carla...

1044
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:36,836
I'm so sorry.

1045
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,083
I don't... I don't
know what to do.

1046
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:40,957
No, it's... it's me... Carter.

1047
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,395
What's going on?

1048
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,582
Uh, you're in the recovery room.

1049
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:51,551
I just took out your appendix.

1050
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,020
You want me to call Carla?

1051
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:55,221
What?

1052
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:58,624
You were asking about her.

1053
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:00,259
What else did I say?

1054
00:38:01,296 --> 00:38:03,112
Uh, that you screwed up.

1055
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:09,168
That... you regret
treating me so badly.

1056
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,771
That... if you could

1057
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:14,491
change things, if you
could do it over again...

1058
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,491
Carter, Carter.

1059
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,293
Just...

1060
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:24,517
Oh, I was just
coming up to see you.

1061
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,518
Really?

1062
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,665
Did you settle
things with Polly,

1063
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:28,866
and was it Heather?

1064
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,973
I want to apologize.

1065
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,190
I was a real jerk today.

1066
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,809
Uh-huh.

1067
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,144
I-I-I was hoping I could
make it up to you somehow.

1068
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,424
Are you free Tuesday night?

1069
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,881
Sure.

1070
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,232
Great... that's the night

1071
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:42,280
of my sex addicts and
compulsive liars therapy group.

1072
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:44,437
Nina, I've never
acted like this before.

1073
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:47,139
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

1074
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:48,741
Maybe we could, uh...

1075
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:50,710
maybe we could have lunch.

1076
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,344
Maybe.

1077
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,314
In the meantime,
whenever you have an urge

1078
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,469
to date three women at once...

1079
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:00,086
Snap it.

1080
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:07,210
Hey... Hope I'm not

1081
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,711
disturbing you.

1082
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,746
No, no.

1083
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,248
What's on your mind?

1084
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:14,724
I thought I'd take
you up on your offer.

1085
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,936
For dinner?

1086
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:17,937
Yeah.

1087
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:19,505
How about tonight?

1088
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,751
That sounds good.

1089
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,486
Do you, uh... like zabaglione?

1090
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,276
Should I?

1091
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:26,479
I know a great Italian place.

1092
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,450
Okay.

1093
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,969
Transfer papers
on the Heuston boy.

1094
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,470
I see you got a bed.

1095
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,006
Yeah, they're moving him now.

1096
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,797
Thank you, Dr. Ross.

1097
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,282
Thanks.

1098
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,967
Okay.

1099
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,374
I'm sorry.

1100
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,534
Chuny, I need a
couple vials of lidocaine.

1101
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,770
You still here?

1102
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,371
I thought you had a date.

1103
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,639
Canceled.

1104
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,974
They busted you.

1105
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,408
They busted me.

1106
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,576
Men are so stupid.

1107
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,344
How many women were you dating

1108
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,712
when you were with me?

1109
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,713
Just you.

1110
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,714
Really?

1111
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,228
Yeah, you know,
except for that night

1112
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,596
that my neighbor the ballerina
broke up with her boyfriend.

1113
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,865
You know, I had to comfort her.

1114
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,354
So that was like
a public service?

1115
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,634
Yeah, yeah... other than that,

1116
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:27,701
I was totally faithful.

1117
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,758
Oh, I feel blessed.

1118
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,571
You know, I still have
dinner reservations.

1119
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,595
Where?

1120
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,595
La Soiree.

1121
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,597
How come you never
took me to La Soiree?

1122
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,878
Just an oversight
which I'd like to correct.

1123
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:40,136
Well... I'll have to take
a look at my calendar.

1124
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,574
Hey, what are you doing?

1125
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,942
Practicing one-handed sutures.

1126
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,004
What is that?

1127
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,761
An eggplant.

1128
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,607
What, did they run
out of pigs' feet?

1129
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:51,463
No, I'm a vegetarian.

1130
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:52,731
Ah...

1131
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,233
So, uh...

1132
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:55,913
You doing anything later?

1133
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:59,105
Um, actually, I,
uh... I got plans.

1134
00:41:00,574 --> 00:41:01,707
Okay.

1135
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:03,359
Well, maybe some other time.

1136
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,262
If you want, you
can come with me.

1137
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,959
I'd love... yeah, I'd love to.

1138
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:10,716
Where?

1139
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,800
How could you forget to
send in our time cards?

1140
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:18,035
I didn't forget to
send in the time cards.

1141
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,292
Then how come we
didn't get our paychecks?

1142
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:21,827
I don't know.

1143
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:24,363
Someone in administration
must have screwed up.

1144
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,132
I distinctly remember
collecting all the time cards,

1145
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,846
wrapping them in a rubber band,

1146
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,870
and then stuffing
them in my purse...

1147
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:36,308
Mm-hmm.

1148
00:41:44,953 --> 00:41:47,080
Pretty good, except you're

1149
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,749
supposed to hit your own target.

1150
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:49,738
You might want

1151
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,418
to keep your eyes
open this time.

1152
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,875
Let me show you.

1153
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,376
Okay, now relax.

1154
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,079
The trick is...

1155
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,248
to caress the butt,

1156
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,094
and squeeze the trigger slowly.

1157
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,196
Oh, my God. What?

1158
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,864
Uh... over there. Where?

1159
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,432
Don't look... maybe
she won't see us. Who?

1160
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,767
That woman in the red sweater.

1161
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,690
The tall one?

1162
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:08,675
Don't look.

1163
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,710
Why?

1164
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,622
That's-that's my ex-girlfriend

1165
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:12,612
Amy Elliot.

1166
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:13,613
Girlfriend.

1167
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:14,747
Cop.

1168
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:15,842
I broke up with her
two months ago.

1169
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,183
She's jealous as hell.

1170
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,287
Here.

1171
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,482
Would you like some
more champagne?

1172
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,796
Are you trying to get me drunk?

1173
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,553
Yeah, I need the company.

1174
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,822
So you lost all three, right?

1175
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,723
Yes!

1176
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,391
I told you.

1177
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:45,661
How was your day?

1178
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,163
I don't want to talk about it.

1179
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,164
All right.

1180
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,382
So what do you want
to do after dinner?

1181
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,414
See a movie?

1182
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,520
Mmm.

1183
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:55,555
Go bowling?

1184
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:58,874
I forgot.

1185
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,057
Let's just, uh... get another
bottle of champagne.

1186
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,464
I like that idea a lot.

1187
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,381
I had a really nice time.

1188
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:13,539
I<i> hope</i> it is the first of many.

1189
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,254
So there's my car.

1190
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:18,477
Want to get some coffee?

1191
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,913
I know a great little place
a couple blocks from here.

1192
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:22,693
You know what?
It's getting late,

1193
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:25,197
and I got to work
early tomorrow.

1194
00:43:25,954 --> 00:43:27,820
Are you sure that's the reason?

1195
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:33,860
Well, I'm afraid.

1196
00:43:33,895 --> 00:43:35,161
Of what?

1197
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,496
Of liking you too much.

1198
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,106
What's wrong?

1199
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,332
Nobody's done that
in a really long time.

1200
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:03,889
Aren't you afraid?
