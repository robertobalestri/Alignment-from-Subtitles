1
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,015
What are you doing?

2
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,017
I'm sorry, lover.
Did I wake you?

3
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:38,281
No. I just... I didn't know
that you were still here.

4
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,338
I can't figure out these locks.

5
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,708
No, don't-don't do
that. Let me, let me...

6
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,686
Thanks.

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,521
Hey, hey, hey, here.

8
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,190
You're not driving, are you?

9
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,025
Oh, is that an
invitation to stay?

10
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,361
No. I'll call you a cab.

11
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,608
Leave my car all
the way over here?

12
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,632
No. I swear, Officer,

13
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,520
I can walk the line and
I can touch my nose.

14
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,266
You can pick up
your car whenever.

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,790
If you want me to drink

16
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,825
a pot of coffee, I can...

17
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,862
I'll drive you.

18
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,363
Hang on.

19
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:22,865
Well...

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,550
Well, gee, they
say chivalry's dead.

21
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,535
Good morning, boys.

22
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,880
It's not good. It's
not even morning.

23
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,371
I brought doughnuts.

24
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:31,206
You guys catch
the game last night?

25
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,374
You're kidding, right?

26
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,220
Conway went 70
yards for the touchdown.

27
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:35,544
It was mayhem.

28
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,213
Somebody remind me
again why I picked surgery.

29
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:39,592
For a scut zombie, Carter,

30
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,060
you're looking very crisp.

31
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,385
Yeah, that's part of the
joy of moving back home.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,554
Reina insists on
using the extra starch.

33
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:46,555
Reina? The maid?

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,767
I haven't had time to breathe,

35
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,302
let alone look for
another apartment.

36
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,192
My place burned down.

37
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:51,671
I've been living
out of a suitcase.

38
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,061
A Louis Vuitton suitcase.

39
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:56,231
You might want to dress down
for the plumbing accident in Two.

40
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,566
He's very stinky.

41
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,067
Thanks for the carbs.

42
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,402
Yo.

43
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:02,571
Hey, your parents live
out in Oakbrook, huh?

44
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:03,683
Oh, don't start.

45
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,207
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just saying.

46
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:06,708
I got an extra bed in my place.

47
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,210
It's two minutes away.

48
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:10,078
Got all the Cup O'
Ramen you can eat.

49
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,524
And best of all, you
don't have to worry

50
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,582
about the help
overstarching your shirts.

51
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,250
Are you serious?

52
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,419
It's time to leave the nest.

53
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:18,920
That's great. Thanks.

54
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,923
Okay. I'll see you at
the firm conference.

55
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,592
Firm conference?

56
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:25,594
That's not next week?

57
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,061
Pancreatectomy lecture?

58
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:29,025
Presented by Dr. Peter Benton,

59
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,476
assisted by John
Carter? Oh, my God.

60
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,595
Benton's slides were
in the fire. They're toast.

61
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,604
Why couldn't I just have
been home at the time?

62
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,505
I could've had smoke inhalation.

63
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,825
I could be sucking air
through a nice ET tube.

64
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,413
Where's the fire?

65
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:47,249
I'm just trying to
get back to bed.

66
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,484
Me, too.

67
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,926
Oh, damn it.

68
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:01,196
I forgot my watch
and stuff at your place.

69
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,165
Can we go back, please?

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,967
You know what? I'll...
I'll send it to you, okay?

71
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:13,341
Oh! Do you mind?

72
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:14,876
I have a headache.

73
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,148
I'm not surprised.

74
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,132
All right. Come on. I'm
not in the mood, all right?

75
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:28,968
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't.

76
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,970
Just don't mess around
with me right now, okay?

77
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:33,728
If you're going to throw up,
just roll down the window there.

78
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:34,807
Lean out of the window.

79
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,531
You all right? Hey...

80
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,067
Hey, hey, hey! Are you...?

81
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:40,335
Hey!

82
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,538
Hang on... Hang on!

83
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:45,239
Have a doughnut if you want one.

84
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,442
Oh, no, thanks.
Weaver's looking for you.

85
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,945
Yeah, it takes a while
to get in from "D" lot.

86
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,024
Did you get your
car back yet? I will.

87
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,326
I need some help
here! She's in status!

88
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,894
I don't know if she's epileptic

89
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,062
or it's what she drank.

90
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:57,652
What was she drinking? How much?

91
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:58,887
Vodka and tequila shots.

92
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,289
Give me four migs of
Ativan and an amp of D-50.

93
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,024
Doyle, clear Trauma Two!

94
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,859
What have you got?
Tonic-clonic seizure.

95
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:08,663
Need a CBC, Chem 20,
blood glucose, tox screen

96
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:09,664
and a blood alcohol.

97
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,665
Where'd she come from?

98
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,666
Get me a blood gas kit, too.

99
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:12,667
Where'd you find her, Doug?

100
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:13,846
My house. What's her name?

101
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,902
I don't know.

102
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:09,557
70/40. Pressure's
still dropping.

103
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:10,603
Keep the fluids wide open.

104
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:11,959
Temp's up to 105.

105
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,205
This seizing's burning her up.

106
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,642
Get some cooling blankets
in here before her brain fries.

107
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,699
Morning, folks. What's the word?

108
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,579
We've got a Jane Doe in status.

109
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:20,797
We're about to
put her in a coma.

110
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,037
Load her up with Dilantin?

111
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,115
Maxed out on the Benzos.

112
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,105
History?

113
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,167
Came in 30 minutes ago.

114
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,335
Seizure history unknown.

115
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,659
Meds unknown.

116
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,643
Could it be meningitis?

117
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,156
Doug seems to think
she's been drinking.

118
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,997
Thought you
weren't on till noon.

119
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,881
I'm not. She's with me.

120
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,899
Temp's 106.2.

121
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,218
She's hyperthermic.

122
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,336
Doyle, alert Neuro
and Anesthesiology.

123
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,321
Bring in a two-channel EEG.

124
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:41,623
Done.

125
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,692
We need a loading
dose of pentobarbital,

126
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:46,127
100 milligrams over two minutes

127
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,529
and an intubation tray.

128
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:48,591
Jumping the gun
now, aren't you, Kerry?

129
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,109
She's been seizing
for a half hour, Doug.

130
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,344
You have a better suggestion?

131
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,083
Mark...

132
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,017
Her blood gas is back.

133
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:53,901
PH is 7.1.

134
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,187
She's acidotic.

135
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,422
Let's put her in a coma.

136
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,173
Kerry, you want to
help me intubate?

137
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,191
Okay.

138
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,476
7.5 ET tube.

139
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,178
Let me go to the car,
find the registration,

140
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:07,081
see if I can get some
kind of an ID or something.

141
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,262
Another modification
to the system will be

142
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,286
a return to professionalism.

143
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,655
We're surgeons.
Let's look like it.

144
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,535
From here on
out, I'm instituting

145
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,326
a jacket-and-tie
policy for all surgeons

146
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:20,428
outside the OR.

147
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,981
Except, of course,
for the ladies on staff,

148
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,783
who I trust will
dress appropriately.

149
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,838
As I was saying...

150
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,459
Well, so much for
the dos and don'ts.

151
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,172
Oh, I would like to
remind everybody

152
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,414
that we're still woefully short
on surgical volunteers for...

153
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,216
Pancreatic versus
local procedures...

154
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,651
Carter, you're late.

155
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:44,997
I had to set up the projector.

156
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,332
I know, but I
want to talk to you.

157
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:47,667
Look, you can run a
projector, can't you?

158
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,335
Yeah, I can, but... Right,
aw, damn, it's starting.

159
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,820
Will be presenting
a fascinating paper

160
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,276
on total pancreatectomy

161
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,330
versus the Whipple procedure
in the palliative treatment

162
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:57,665
of pancreatic carcinoma.

163
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:58,866
Dr. Benton.

164
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:04,105
Thank you, Dr. Anspaugh.

165
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,907
I'm going to be talking
today about, uh...

166
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,110
the use of the Whipple procedure

167
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,196
in lieu of total pancreatectomy,

168
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:16,050
which is, I guess, what
Dr. Anspaugh just said.

169
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,553
Lights, please?

170
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,575
Uh...

171
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,378
Pancreatectomy removes...

172
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:30,431
the potential for recurrence
due to multifocal disease

173
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:34,035
and avoids
pancreatico-jejunostomy.

174
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,687
Now, uh, uh, slide, please?

175
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:40,291
If you observe here, the
attendant risk of leakage

176
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,442
is... the...

177
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,801
Path slide one, please?

178
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,403
That's... that's what I
was trying to tell you.

179
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,573
<i>What</i> were you trying to tell me?

180
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,643
Maybe I could speak to
you alone for a moment.

181
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,828
Is there a problem, Dr. Benton?

182
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,608
Oh, no, no, Dr. Anspaugh.
No, not at all.

183
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,198
Carter, put in the damn slide.

184
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,351
I can't. My apartment
burned down.

185
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,952
I lost the pathology slides.

186
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,172
The tables?

187
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,424
And the operative

188
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,174
photographs?

189
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:14,526
Those, too.

190
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,497
Looks like she's stabilizing.

191
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,999
No spikes. That's more like it.

192
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,467
All right, I'm going
to check with Neuro,

193
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,690
see what's keeping them.

194
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,037
Uh, could I have a minute?

195
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:32,061
Sure.

196
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,747
What's up?

197
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,448
In, uh, all the commotion,

198
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,950
I wasn't sure if you remembered

199
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,685
that today we start
our pilot study...

200
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,221
Th-the medical-surgical
division of duties.

201
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,734
All right, that's
where one attending

202
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,902
gets all the real emergencies

203
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,704
and the other hands
out aspirin and antacid?

204
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,594
Well, actually, one
takes the medical cases

205
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,661
one takes the surgical.

206
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,831
You wanted surgical when
we discussed it before.

207
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,643
No, I wanted neither
when we discussed it before

208
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,812
'cause I think it's a bad idea.

209
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,102
Well, Dr. Anspaugh approved it,

210
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,470
and since you just walked
in and effectively took over

211
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,072
this seizure patient,
perhaps you...

212
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,086
Okay, fine. Why don't you
take surgical, I'll take medical.

213
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,075
She's seizing!

214
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,945
She's all yours. Report to him.

215
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,181
All right, looks like you and I

216
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,917
are going to be handling
all the medical cases today.

217
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:13,918
Only medical?

218
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,754
That's the grand plan.

219
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,190
Thought she was stabilized.

220
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,192
Okay. Uh, six of Pavulon.

221
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,194
We going to paralyze her?

222
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,863
Yes. And do you know why?

223
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,909
'Cause it's her only chance?

224
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,582
That's right.

225
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,352
Hey, girl. Hey.

226
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,665
You missed all the drama.

227
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,001
Dr. Ross brought
a lady in in status.

228
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,158
Oh, yeah?

229
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,826
You okay?

230
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,327
Yeah. It's just autumn.

231
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,029
You know, my allergies go crazy.

232
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,439
Dr. Benton

233
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,208
I just want to apologize again

234
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,209
for the slides.

235
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:29,388
Did you replace them?

236
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,422
Not yet. Well, get busy.

237
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,924
Dr. Anspaugh was kind enough

238
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:34,448
to reschedule the lecture
for tomorrow morning.

239
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,484
Tomorrow? Is there a chance...

240
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,799
Bye-bye, Carter.

241
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,508
Oh, the infamous Dr. Carter.

242
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,553
We haven't been introduced.

243
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,010
I'm Abby Keaton.

244
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,379
Pleased to meet you!

245
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,748
Uh, this morning
was totally my fault.

246
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,750
Oh, it was a godsend.
May-may I join you?

247
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,996
Oh, yeah, please.

248
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,120
No offense, Peter...
Oh, thank you.

249
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,122
No offense.

250
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,291
I love a nice, juicy gut lecture

251
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,459
but your intern bought
me an extra half hour

252
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,611
for my dictations.

253
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:04,946
So...

254
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,281
what did you think of
Laura-Lee, Dr. Carter?

255
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:08,215
Who?

256
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,234
Does Dr. Benton

257
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,401
keep you so busy

258
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,636
running the projector

259
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,432
that you don't have time
to follow up on cases?

260
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,868
Uh, the, uh, film
showed a, uh...

261
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,987
dilated cecum, and
she's at risk of perfing.

262
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,260
She's in 203.

263
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,646
Why don't you two go
down, meet her, answer

264
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,876
her mother's questions and
then bring her on up to the OR?

265
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,978
Oh, you know, uh,
I can do it myself.

266
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:28,086
Hmm. Bring Dr. Carter along.

267
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,755
I guarantee, it'll be a
real learning experience.

268
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,003
Excuse me, ambulance zone. Sir?

269
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,505
Oh, good morning, Dr. Ross.

270
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,884
Would you mind moving
the car, sir, please?

271
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,874
Yeah.

272
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,942
Sir?

273
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,277
Yep.

274
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,592
Thank you.

275
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,898
How's Dr. Ross's friend?

276
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,112
"Friend" may be overstating it.

277
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,738
You know, I don't think
it's any of our business.

278
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,913
Her name is Nadine Wilkes.

279
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:12,914
Doug, Doug...

280
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,448
She's dead.

281
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,203
I thought you'd gone home.

282
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,394
My shift starts in five minutes.

283
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,829
Why would I go home?

284
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,941
I just thought

285
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,525
you wouldn't be up
for working today.

286
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,436
I feel bad for what
happened to her.

287
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,272
But if you are in
some way suggesting

288
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,606
that I am responsible...

289
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,669
No. I just thought
maybe you were upset.

290
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,127
I guess not.

291
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:01,129
I'm confused, Mark.

292
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,131
Does it come as
a big shock to you

293
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,665
that I was intimate with someone

294
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,696
who I've been less
than soul mates with?

295
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,680
Doug, you didn't
even know her name.

296
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,307
Tox screen came back.

297
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:16,210
Did you know she tested
positive for cocaine?

298
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:17,611
No. I mean, do...

299
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,513
You think I would
have withheld that?

300
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,382
I hope not.

301
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,616
That's right. No.

302
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,403
You were together all night.

303
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,404
She tested positive.

304
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,683
You think that I did cocaine?

305
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,373
Is that what you
were really asking me?

306
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,887
Should I ask? You want a sample?

307
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,577
You want me to piss
in that mug right now?

308
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,561
Will that satisfy you?

309
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:34,579
Use a specimen cup.

310
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,580
You want to watch?

311
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,364
Just send it to the lab.

312
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,089
Mark, we've got a three-year-old

313
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,391
went on a bender with a
bottle of dandruff shampoo.

314
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,693
You want me to wait for Doug?

315
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,061
No. I'll handle it.

316
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,397
Mark, Doug lives his own life.

317
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,744
Yeah, that's kind
of the problem.

318
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,268
I-I'm just saying, we
can't live it for him.

319
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,606
Dr. Benton, I think
Dr. Keaton was inviting me

320
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,441
to do the colostomy with you.

321
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,209
Well, that's because
Dr. Keaton doesn't know

322
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,612
how busy you're going to be
at the photo lab this afternoon.

323
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,981
Screw you! You can't make me!

324
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,101
Get out of my way!

325
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,447
Excuse me, I'm Doctor Benton.

326
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:16,353
Just tell her I'm out of here!

327
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,483
I'm afraid that's impossible.

328
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,501
Look, you're scheduled for a
major operation in 15 minutes.

329
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,959
The hell I am! I'm gone!

330
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:21,960
Laura.

331
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,277
Look, hold on. What is this?

332
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,613
Huh? What, do you
want to die, is that it?

333
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:27,598
I'd make a real
good-looking corpse.

334
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:28,916
I'd want to die, too.

335
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,147
Yeah, well, you're gonna if
you don't get out of my way!

336
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,371
I'm just saying that if I
went to Proviso West,

337
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,374
I'd rather be six feet under
before a championship game.

338
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,371
We're semi-finalists
this year, lame-o.

339
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:42,363
Ha! Last time I checked,
you had a semi-backfield.

340
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,243
You should start some
of your cheerleaders.

341
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,600
They look tough enough.

342
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,544
Okay, okay, Mom,
okay, Doc Magoo's, 5:00.

343
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,180
No disrespect, E-Ray, but I
was looking for a welding class.

344
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,550
I can't really see
myself in genie pants.

345
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,597
It's a simple means to
stress reduction and serenity.

346
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,254
Oh, God, whatever
it is, sign me up.

347
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:08,600
What, you couldn't
get her to cancel?

348
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:09,923
Nope. Something's on her mind.

349
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,102
You'd really be interested

350
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:12,938
in my yoga class,
Nurse Hathaway?

351
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,105
Is there a mantra
that will get me

352
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:15,441
through my dinner
with my mom tonight?

353
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:16,942
There is. You'd have to take

354
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,844
my intro class in preparation.

355
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,346
8:00 p.m., Thursday nights,

356
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,947
Malcolm X Community College.

357
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,516
What's my old alma
mater coming to?

358
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,057
You went to Malcolm X?

359
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,236
My first year.

360
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,305
Hey, they've got a very
prestigious premed night school.

361
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,679
Wait a minute.

362
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:34,365
Wait. See there?

363
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,368
Bio one, organic chemistry,
physics, all your basics.

364
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,537
You got a problem with that?

365
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,171
Hey, Jerry.

366
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,408
Hey, Dr. Ross, we got a
12-year-old GSW coming in.

367
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,987
All right. Put
this in Mark's box

368
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,389
and make sure he sees it, okay?

369
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,558
Carol, do you know if
anybody's run a search

370
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,892
for Nadine Wilkes'
medical records?

371
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,216
Well, Connie
tried to pull her up

372
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,395
but she's never
been a patient here.

373
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,730
We ought to try countywide.

374
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,048
See if she's had any
previous admissions.

375
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:58,172
Well, don't you think
the autopsy will reveal

376
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,724
any preexisting conditions?

377
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,970
Probably, but it's worth
a shot. Don't you think?

378
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,479
Sure. If you need any help,
E-Ray can do the search.

379
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:06,625
Dr. Ross, that
gunshot wound is in.

380
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,194
12-Year-old GSW to the chest.

381
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,517
Jerry, clear Trauma one.

382
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,829
Pulse thready and weak.

383
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:11,897
Got any ID?

384
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,466
His street name's Shamrock.

385
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,235
Usually, he's on the
other side of the piece,

386
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,160
but the owner of the place
was a little faster on the draw.

387
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,672
Oh, God, he looks like a baby.

388
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:24,615
Wait till you talk to the cops.

389
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,501
It's either the protease
inhibitor or the AZT

390
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,436
that's making me nauseous.

391
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,872
I'm not sure which.

392
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,473
No, I understand.

393
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,175
I haven't missed any doses.

394
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,810
Thanks, Dr. Angelo.

395
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:38,512
I'd appreciate it.

396
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:39,547
Okay, bye.

397
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:41,849
Hi. What's up?

398
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:44,263
Take the ankle fracture in two.

399
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,364
Okay. I'm buried.

400
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,199
You won't have any trouble

401
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,857
finding a nurse to assist.

402
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,392
You okay?

403
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,711
Short stick gets it.

404
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,191
Who's free to help me
with an ankle splint?

405
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,148
We'll tell you in a second.

406
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,215
Damn.

407
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,895
I thought you were engaged.

408
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,064
Shoot. I might be
engaged, but I ain't dead.

409
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,955
A behind like that could
bring me back from the dead.

410
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,568
Oh, yes! I'll send
you a postcard.

411
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,391
Two out of three?

412
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,593
What's so great about Exam Two?

413
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,263
You take Dennis
Quaid, Robert Redford

414
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,397
and James Dean,

415
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,199
put them in a blender,
you got Exam Two.

416
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,942
Mr. McKenna?

417
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,377
Hi. I'm Jeanie Boulet.

418
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,512
I hear you have
an ankle fracture.

419
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,692
Yeah. I was welding a
girder up on the ninth floor

420
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,428
of that new office
building on Addison.

421
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,418
Wendy? Wendy? Wendy. Splint.

422
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,419
Right.

423
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,565
Lost my footing,

424
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,900
my ankle went snap.

425
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,053
If it hadn't been for
Mickey's fast catch,

426
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:42,287
I'd have been a goner.

427
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,640
You up for one more
good deed, Mickey?

428
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,029
Sure.

429
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,293
Okay, I need you to hold his
foot steady at a 90-degree angle

430
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,895
and we're going
to splint it, okay?

431
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,884
Ahh! Ahh!

432
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,164
How's that?

433
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,521
Perfect.

434
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:58,059
What about the food
poisoning in Three?

435
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,838
Didn't I already see that one?

436
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,095
That was diarrhea.

437
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,441
Take the food poisoning, Two;

438
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:03,775
compazine, clear liquids, etc.

439
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,099
I'm down.

440
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:08,374
Let me know as
soon as he's back.

441
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,605
Mark, could we talk?

442
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,773
Sure.

443
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,809
I heard Nadine
Wilkes' tox screen

444
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,811
was positive for coke.

445
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,012
That's right.

446
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:21,748
And Doug Ross is working today?

447
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,017
It's been taken care of.

448
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,033
I know Doug is your friend,

449
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:31,258
but I'm attending
on this shift, as well.

450
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:32,893
He got a tox screen.

451
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,728
It came back negative.

452
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,975
Yeah, well, how about
his blood alcohol?

453
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,133
He's fine.

454
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,413
Good, 'cause he's
putting a chest tube

455
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:44,338
in a 12-year-old right now.

456
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,840
He may need some help.

457
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,442
Good idea.

458
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,712
Tension pneumo.

459
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:53,858
I'm going to
decompress. 14-gauge.

460
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,160
He's cyanotic.

461
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,483
Any ID?

462
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,663
No, but his prints are on file.

463
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,465
Cops were right behind me.

464
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:01,922
Vitals are improving.

465
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,257
28 French.

466
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,592
Thought you might
need an assist.

467
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,006
Nope. We've got
it under control.

468
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,947
I'll just stay and watch.

469
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,884
Okay.

470
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,591
O-silk. I'm in.

471
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,992
Hook it up.

472
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,542
Hey, Carol, what's
the hourly rate

473
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,932
for baby-sitting

474
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,934
these days?

475
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,238
Well, I am amazed, Peter.

476
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,273
I thought you'd need backup.

477
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,376
Yeah, well, it wasn't easy.

478
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,945
I know. I've gone a
few rounds with Laura.

479
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,614
But you didn't have
to call in the cavalry.

480
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,016
I am impressed.

481
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,195
It was fine.

482
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,719
You know, actually,
Carter was very helpful

483
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,354
in breaking the ice.

484
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,429
She's got a couple of
more questions for you.

485
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,413
Dr. Carter,

486
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,232
how would you like

487
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,733
to scrub in with us?

488
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,903
Unless Dr. Benton
needs you elsewhere.

489
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,373
When I was a kid,

490
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,109
we just boosted a
couple of bags of chips.

491
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,077
Now they want the whole store.

492
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,479
Grab a cup of coffee?

493
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,192
I should probably stay close,

494
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,894
Yeah. keep an eye on his crit.

495
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,518
Pardon me. Are you Dr. Ross?

496
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,531
Yeah. Listen,
that kid... he's out.

497
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,088
He's going to be out
for a couple of hours.

498
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,424
Actually, Doctor,

499
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,693
we want to speak to
you about Nadine Wilkes.

500
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,194
Okay, fine.

501
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,696
Uh...

502
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,164
Let's go back here.

503
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,633
There's a room back here.

504
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,668
Excuse me.

505
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,255
When did her medical
condition first come on?

506
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,658
Uh... she started
seizing around 6:00 a.m.

507
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:46,160
And she died at 7:34?

508
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:47,661
That's about right, 7:34.

509
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,863
Oh, sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

510
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:51,932
Someone said you
wanted to see me.

511
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,934
We'll be out in a minute, Mark.

512
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,781
Are you Mark Greene?
Attending physician?

513
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:56,536
That's right.

514
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:57,883
Pronounced Nadine Wilkes?

515
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:58,872
I did.

516
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,669
Why don't you stick around okay?

517
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,058
We got a couple questions

518
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,288
we'd like to ask you, too.

519
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,979
So no idea at all
about next of kin?

520
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,481
No. I told you, we'd just met.

521
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,499
Last call, Roarke's
bar. I got that.

522
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,001
Hmm.

523
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,253
What?

524
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,421
Roarke's bar.

525
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,839
Kind of a hinky crowd.

526
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,675
But, at this joint, or later on,

527
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,770
when she went
back to your place,

528
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,572
you never saw
her take any drugs?

529
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:21,745
No. We, uh...

530
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,414
she went to the bathroom
a couple of times.

531
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,415
In between?

532
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,400
Mm-hmm.

533
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:29,069
And at no time did she ask you

534
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:30,882
to write her a prescription? No.

535
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:32,701
You didn't give her
just a little something

536
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,435
No. to help her make
it through the night?

537
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,371
You're not that kind of guy?

538
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,261
No.

539
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,596
Okay.

540
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,334
Can we speak to
you outside, please?

541
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,697
As you can see, in a 16-year-old

542
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,900
the organs are identical
to those of an adult.

543
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:00,979
In a neonate, on the other hand,

544
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,903
you've got a liver
as big as Kansas.

545
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:05,639
Needle-holder.

546
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:08,275
Boy,<i> you</i> could do this
with your eyes closed.

547
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,281
So, John, tell me how you
got Laura-Lee into the O.R.

548
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:16,716
without hired
muscle or sedatives.

549
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,569
Uh... gym pass.

550
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,553
Gym pass?

551
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,589
Yeah.

552
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:25,426
Locker rooms can be tough
enough without an ostomy bag.

553
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,194
Kids are vicious.

554
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,062
And I<i> am</i> a doctor.

555
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,931
So you wrote her
a pass out of gym?

556
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,699
Yeah, and told her

557
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:35,319
that she probably wouldn't have
the bag by championship game.

558
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,186
And that's in...?

559
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,437
November. Late November.

560
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:38,455
Mm-hmm.

561
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,856
She's in the...

562
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,475
I hope I didn't, uh, put...

563
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,827
No. With any luck,
she should make it.

564
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:48,249
Hi. Oh, hi.

565
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,095
I'm afraid Ortho's
still backed up.

566
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,963
It could be a couple
of more hours.

567
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:55,122
Mr. Mckenna wanted me to
tell you he's going to take a cab.

568
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:57,224
He doesn't want you
to miss your class.

569
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,160
Thanks, Miss
Boulet, but I can wait.

570
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,327
Anyone hungry?

571
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:01,995
More pudding.

572
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:04,865
They said County's unfriendly.

573
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,034
You look like you're
being taken care of.

574
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,704
So, um, what kind of
class are you taking?

575
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:14,241
Uh... I sort of moonlight
as a dance instructor.

576
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:16,021
Oh, what type of dancing?

577
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:18,179
Well, all types,
but country, mostly.

578
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:19,813
Like line dancing.

579
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:22,049
Oh, there's more
to country than that.

580
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:24,329
Why don't you show us
a few moves, cowboy?

581
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:25,486
Here?

582
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:26,587
Why not?

583
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,355
Um... no music.

584
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:30,391
We can fix that.

585
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,126
So, the good news
is you're not pregnant.

586
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,393
Can you understand me?

587
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,549
Yeah. It's good.

588
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,329
But now we have
to do a pelvic exam

589
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,365
to find out why
you're having pain.

590
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,554
You do the exam?

591
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,858
No. A doctor's going to
come and do the exam,

592
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:48,876
but he's very good.

593
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,244
No, no, no. I don't need.

594
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,562
I'm fine. Not pregnant.

595
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,646
Okay.

596
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,981
All right, Miss Jung Koo Bek.

597
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,301
What seems to be the problem?

598
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,819
No problem. I could go home now.

599
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,331
Doctor, can I talk
to you outside?

600
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,388
Sure.

601
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,267
You just sit tight.
I'll be right back.

602
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,424
We'll be right back.

603
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:07,388
This girl's 15 years old.

604
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,658
One sexual experience,
two months ago.

605
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,359
Abdominal pain, fever's 101.

606
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,495
She complains of
vaginal discharge.

607
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,529
She's not pregnant.

608
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,019
Sounds like PID.

609
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,153
I'll give her a pelvic.

610
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,266
Well, she's a little jumpy.

611
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,634
She's never had a pelvic.

612
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,636
I don't think she's
seen many doctors.

613
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,043
I think I can handle that.

614
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,572
I'm afraid she's going to bolt,

615
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,824
but she'd probably let me

616
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:27,025
take the cultures.

617
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,400
So you're second-guessing
me, too, now, right?

618
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,780
No, Doug. I don't
give a damn about you.

619
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,065
I'm trying to take
care of a patient.

620
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:34,538
Whoa-whoa. What's up?

621
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,440
Nothing. Carol just thinks
that she's better suited

622
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,176
to perform a pelvic without me.

623
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,510
Carol, you know that...

624
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:41,806
I just want to take the swabs.

625
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,175
At least diagnose her for PID.

626
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,342
She's really afraid of men.

627
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:46,216
Doyle, you free?

628
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,400
Almost.

629
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:48,568
Mark, that's my patient.

630
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,688
Come help Carol do a pelvic.

631
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,849
Sure.

632
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,090
Okay?

633
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,128
You're overreacting, Doug.

634
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,846
What is it with you?

635
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:02,483
I got Kerry Weaver
breathing down my neck.

636
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:04,829
I got people parting
like the Red Sea

637
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:06,798
every time I walk
down the hallway.

638
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:09,167
You asked for a tox screen.
It came back negative.

639
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:11,024
You didn't get a
blood alcohol, did you?

640
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:12,237
Oh, for God's sakes, Mark.

641
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,227
You can't work with a
measurable amount...

642
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,040
How many times
have you and I gone out

643
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:17,643
for margaritas
into the wee hours?

644
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,678
You check your blood
alcohol every morning?

645
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:20,729
You check it?

646
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,852
Huh! Unbelievable.

647
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,456
Doug, let me tell you
something, as a friend.

648
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,457
As a friend?

649
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,859
No, see, you can't be
my friend and be my boss.

650
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,461
You chose to be my boss.

651
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,695
Listen, I don't need

652
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,897
your sanctimonious
approval of my life.

653
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,067
Do me a favor. Don't come to
me for tips on women anymore.

654
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,002
If I choose to have a Roman orgy

655
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,971
with farm animals
in my free time,

656
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,173
that is none of your business

657
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,519
That is none of
anybody's business.

658
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,909
I am a doctor here.

659
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,244
I do my job.

660
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,212
Nothing gets in the
way of that. Nothing!

661
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,392
Oh, yeah? Today, it did.

662
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,627
Today, you brought a
dying woman in to this ER,

663
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,563
and you messed up
everybody else's work.

664
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,664
Okay? That's a problem.

665
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,599
If you don't see that,
you don't belong here.

666
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,089
Yeah? I tell you what.

667
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,902
Hello, everybody.
Thought I'd check in

668
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,526
and see how the first day
of your pilot study's going.

669
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,512
Medical-surgical
division, wasn't it?

670
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:08,114
We still have a few
kinks to work out,

671
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,083
but let me, uh...
show you the board.

672
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:11,451
Dr. Greene, um...

673
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,855
there's a single-vehicle
high-speed TC coming in

674
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,923
that looks extremely surgical.

675
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,142
Want me to let Weaver know?

676
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,960
Screw the new
system. I'll take this one.

677
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,411
Call surgical.

678
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,946
Get a consult down here.

679
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:23,947
Mark, we're not

680
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,215
finished yet.

681
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,750
Yes, we are.

682
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,278
Oh, man, I haven't done
one of these in six months.

683
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:39,424
Don't worry.

684
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:41,092
I've assisted a million.

685
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:42,082
Thanks.

686
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:43,083
Mm-hmm.

687
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,018
Okay, just relax.

688
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,253
Good.

689
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:49,439
Now let your knees fall open.

690
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,675
Good.

691
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,776
Okay.

692
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,346
Okay.

693
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,416
Uh, this is going
to feel a little weird.

694
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,739
Okay, Jung Koo,
take a deep breath.

695
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,208
Good. Good.

696
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,594
Dr. Doyle's going to
take a deep breath, too.

697
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,615
Now, angle lower.

698
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,669
Right. All right.

699
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,069
Relax these muscles.

700
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,232
Don't push away.

701
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:23,690
Dr. Doyle isn't
going to push, either.

702
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,525
Nobody's going to push.

703
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,010
It's just going to slide...

704
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,062
right in.

705
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:30,614
There.

706
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,467
Now, rotate and click.

707
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:42,525
KOH and wet mount

708
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,544
and chlamydia.

709
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,998
There you go.

710
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,235
Mrs. Armitage.

711
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,503
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.

712
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:54,838
We met earlier.

713
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,373
Oh, yes.

714
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,159
I-I'm sorry Laura was
so rude to you before.

715
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,838
It was nothing.

716
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:04,764
Frankly, I just don't know
what to do with her anymore.

717
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,635
She's going to be on IV
antibiotics for five days,

718
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,148
and then she's going to be
discharged in seven, okay?

719
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:11,938
Uh... Peter?

720
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:13,690
Mrs. Armitage knows the drill.

721
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,108
Hi, Diane.

722
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:16,320
Hi, Abby. Hi.

723
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:18,344
I think Mrs. Armitage's concerns

724
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,782
are more related to
Laura's overall well-being.

725
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,954
Oh, yeah. Um...

726
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:28,956
Yeah. Yeah, sometimes, uh...

727
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:31,859
they have problems
making the adjustment.

728
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:34,394
We have a psychiatrist on staff.

729
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:36,646
Maybe I could contact them.

730
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,131
Maybe they can help.

731
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:41,852
Diane...

732
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,788
You've got to stop babying her.

733
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,807
She knows how to be a patient.

734
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:48,491
She's done that for years.

735
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,893
Now she's a teenager.

736
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,427
She's going to rebel,

737
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,630
and you've got
to be the bad guy.

738
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,632
Set the limits.

739
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,652
You're right, I know.

740
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:01,454
God willing,

741
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,873
this surgery will be her last.

742
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,039
Dr. Greene...

743
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:21,819
You called for a surgical?

744
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,244
Yeah. Sounds like a spatula job.

745
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,679
How's your day going?

746
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:26,746
Oh, fine.

747
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:28,959
Hey, great card
from Dr. Lewis, huh?

748
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,685
Only she would send
a postcard from O'Hare.

749
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,752
You got a card?

750
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:34,031
Yeah. You didn't?

751
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:36,055
No, I didn't.

752
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,359
Thanks for all
your help in there.

753
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,815
Part of the job.

754
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,185
I want to do a pelvic
ultrasound for her.

755
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,186
You already did.

756
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,420
Just need to sign it.

757
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,889
Jerry, what is going
on over there at Chairs?

758
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,902
Oh, some guy's trying to seduce

759
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,226
the nursing staff.

760
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,528
Ma, you're early.

761
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,529
Ten minutes.

762
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,180
It'll take five to walk over.

763
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,798
I'll get my purse.

764
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:05,768
They don't have a locker
where you can put that?

765
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,037
No, Ma.

766
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,250
And this is how you work?

767
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,007
Excuse me. Excuse me.

768
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,143
I'm looking for Dr. Ross.

769
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,178
Oh...

770
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,813
Uh... he's out in
the ambulance bay.

771
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,548
Come on. We'll show you.

772
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,040
Hey, Doug.

773
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,311
Hey, Helen.

774
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:32,913
Haven't seen you in a long time.

775
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:33,980
How have you been?

776
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:35,293
I have been well.

777
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:36,327
And yourself?

778
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:38,167
Can't complain.

779
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,186
Uh... this lady is
looking for you.

780
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:41,921
Okay. Have a nice dinner.

781
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:42,939
Thanks.

782
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,224
Hi.

783
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,358
Uh...

784
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,197
Do I know you?

785
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:53,266
I'm Claire Wilkes.

786
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:54,446
You worked

787
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,580
on my sister Nadine.

788
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,137
Right. Yeah.

789
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:59,439
Uh... Sorry.

790
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:03,343
I... just wish there was more

791
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:05,278
that we could have done.

792
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:07,998
Nadine died just
like she lived...

793
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,600
Drunk, high and alone.

794
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,152
Actually, uh...

795
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:14,704
a friend... brought her in.

796
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,974
I know what kind of
friends she had at 4:00 a.m.

797
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:22,079
Did she have a...
a medical condition

798
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,580
that we didn't know about?

799
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,410
Wasn't she wearing her bracelet?

800
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,350
Nadine was an epileptic.

801
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,136
She knew she wasn't
supposed to drink

802
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:32,171
but that didn't stop her.

803
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,025
Can I see her?

804
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,977
Sure.

805
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:45,285
The coroner's office
still has to do a...

806
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,586
an autopsy.

807
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:50,223
So that's why the... the
tubes are still in there.

808
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,779
She had so much to give...

809
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,483
a fire in her...

810
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,689
and then, when
the seizures started

811
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:11,361
it just made her lose
her confidence somehow.

812
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:15,816
She could always find the guys

813
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,052
to help her sink
just a little lower...

814
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:22,556
chip away at her self-esteem.

815
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:31,764
Whatever you were
looking for, Nadine...

816
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,535
I hope you found it.

817
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,406
Oh, God.

818
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,280
Come on, how
about some two-step?

819
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,516
That is a quick quick, slow slow

820
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,835
quick quick, slow.

821
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,221
Oh, okay.

822
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,300
And quick quick

823
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,524
slow slow...

824
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,561
Hey, it works.

825
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,430
All right.

826
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,914
Ooh, work it, Lydia.

827
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:27,570
Yeah!

828
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,733
I just got a call from ortho.

829
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,201
Your friend's next
up. They promise.

830
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,241
Great, uh...

831
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,892
How about some two-step?

832
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,694
No, no, no.

833
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:35,695
It's really easy.

834
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,742
It's quick quick, slow slow.

835
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,500
Quick quick, slow slow.

836
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:43,136
All right, girl, come on.

837
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,871
Okay, here.

838
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:46,922
And...

839
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,846
All right, girl.

840
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:57,083
All right.

841
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:00,002
Whoa, hey!

842
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,022
You're going to have
to call ortho again.

843
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:05,509
Yeah!

844
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,860
Ah, let's see here.

845
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,929
How's that?

846
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,648
All right?

847
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,054
Um, I have to, uh...

848
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,260
X rays for trauma two.

849
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,028
Good.

850
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,430
Thank you.

851
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,933
You're quite the dancer.

852
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,603
You're not half-bad yourself.

853
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,221
How's that pie, Ma?

854
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:37,590
Well, at least here,
they don't overcharge.

855
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:39,725
A good thing when
you're on a budget.

856
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:40,893
Uh-huh.

857
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:43,363
A lesson I hope that
you finally learning.

858
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,309
So I got in a little
over my head.

859
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,200
Because you had
to buy a big house.

860
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,201
It's not so big.

861
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:50,002
An apartment
should be big enough

862
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,003
for one woman.

863
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,238
A house is for a family.

864
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:53,239
Okay, Ma.

865
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,507
And you don't want to marry.

866
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:57,510
Dr. Ross wasn't right, I agree.

867
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,445
Dr. Taglieri
wasn't, either. Fine.

868
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:00,813
But then you can't live

869
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,760
like a doctor's wife, that's
all. You know what, Ma?

870
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,616
I really don't need this today.

871
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:04,750
All I'm saying

872
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,586
is a nurse is not a queen.

873
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,665
Believe me, I've noticed.

874
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,088
A nurse has to watch her money.

875
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:10,735
Yeah, while she
teaches all the interns

876
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,319
to make quadruple her salary.

877
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,443
You can't change that.

878
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,112
Maybe not.

879
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:20,950
Anyway, anyone can
get into a little trouble.

880
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:21,817
What's this?

881
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,620
To pay your plumber
and your roofer.

882
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:24,954
And there should be enough there

883
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,105
to finish the plaster.

884
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
I don't want you
to live in a dump.

885
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,860
Oh, Ma, that is so sweet.

886
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,513
But I can't take this from you.

887
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,481
From who then?
It's too generous.

888
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:37,150
I can't even take
that as a loan.

889
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,985
You'd rather owe strangers

890
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:40,386
than your own mother?

891
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:41,437
Yeah.

892
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:45,325
Well, what if it's not a loan?

893
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,261
What if it's more like

894
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,362
a kind of rent?

895
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:53,533
What kind of rent, Ma?

896
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:56,544
Pediatric surgeon of the year?

897
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,439
The Price Award?

898
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,608
Oh, man...

899
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:03,944
That's very prestigious.

900
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:05,890
I wanted to tell you
I was really pleased

901
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,180
with how the
Armitage surgery went.

902
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:11,034
Well, you know, thanks
for the opportunity.

903
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,686
You're a gifted surgeon

904
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,137
and you do really
well in the O.R.

905
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,390
It's outside the operating room

906
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,342
where you need work.

907
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:28,969
Peter, pediatric surgery
focuses on the<i> child</i>

908
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:30,904
not just the illness.

909
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,440
That mother needed
something from you today

910
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:36,592
and you acted as
though your job was over

911
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,239
as soon as you took
the surgical gloves off.

912
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:40,613
You've got<i> great</i> hands.

913
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,316
Now you've got to
show some heart.

914
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:46,753
Well, I'm sorry.

915
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,887
Don't be sorry.

916
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:49,723
Learn.

917
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:56,907
Yeah, I'm looking
at it right now.

918
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,398
One-hour photo guaranteed.

919
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,811
What do you mean that
doesn't apply to slides?!

920
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,846
All slides are are
see-through photos.

921
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,238
Hey, E-ray, can I look at
your catalog of classes?

922
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:06,284
Yeah, help yourself.

923
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,485
Benton's going to kill me.

924
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:08,509
Again.

925
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:09,509
Mm-hmm.

926
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:10,510
So, Carter, was it that bad

927
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,178
living with your parents again?

928
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:13,646
Uh, pretty strange. Why?

929
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,915
Well, you know, my mom,
she moved back to the 'burbs

930
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,418
and now she misses all
her old friends from church.

931
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,620
She wants to stay with
me Saturday nights,

932
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,621
go to early services.

933
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,167
Just one night a week? Uh-huh.

934
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,711
You can always sign
up for work on Saturday.

935
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,429
That's a good idea.

936
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:32,832
We start Qi Gong next week.

937
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,167
Uh, no.

938
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:37,437
Do you mind if I
tear out a page?

939
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,522
Go ahead.

940
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,324
Pre-med?

941
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,642
It's for a friend.

942
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:53,331
He's still not up there?!

943
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,855
Oh, no, no. I took him out
to the car, crutches and all.

944
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,968
Okay good. Well,
tell him to take it easy.

945
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:58,924
I just wanted to say thanks.

946
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,171
You're welcome.

947
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,495
I was wondering if, uh...

948
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:06,633
maybe you wanted to
go<i> out</i> dancing some time.

949
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:09,269
You know, grab a
bite, I don't know.

950
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:10,836
Um, I'm sorry.

951
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,105
I can't date patients.

952
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:14,907
I wasn't the patient, so...

953
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:15,841
No, really, I can't.

954
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,177
I'm a good guy.

955
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,078
We can go out dancing.

956
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,113
I'll buy you a steak.

957
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:23,816
You don't like me, at
least you got the steak.

958
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,086
I can't.

959
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,704
All right. Sorry.

960
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,973
I got you.

961
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,475
See you around.

962
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,999
Table for one?

963
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:03,322
Uh, yeah.

964
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,091
Listen, is Carla
working tonight?

965
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:07,337
Yeah, man, she's
here every night.

966
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:09,896
Okay. Can you tell her
Peter Benton is here?

967
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,932
<i>You're</i> Peter Benton.

968
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:15,702
I can seat you at the counter.

969
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,756
Enjoy.

970
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,559
Thanks.

971
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,906
Hey.

972
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,274
Well, well, well.

973
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,609
Mmm.

974
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,943
Mmm.

975
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,078
Mmm.

976
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,413
Uh, the place looks great.

977
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:44,748
Thank you.

978
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,193
That's right, you
haven't seen my baby

979
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,529
since it was a little
bitty greasy spoon.

980
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,519
Well, okay. Grand tour.

981
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,021
And, come with me, sir.

982
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,824
I would like to show
you the kitchen.

983
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,793
You know Tyrone
Harvard? He cooks here.

984
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,728
This is it.

985
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,531
Yes.

986
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,067
We just got two
Sub-Zero freezers,

987
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,779
which is very, very nice.

988
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,905
Do you remember that
little Italian place, Simeone's,

989
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,774
on Seneca... you remember.

990
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,587
So, they closed, they closed,

991
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,546
and I picked up a bunch of stuff

992
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,991
for almost nothing. It's great.

993
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,626
Yeah, it looks like
you made quite a place

994
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,550
for yourself here.

995
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,319
A lot of hard work.

996
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,662
Well, you must have a taste
in your mouth for something

997
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,231
to come all this way out here.

998
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:58,237
This isn't your line.

999
00:40:58,272 --> 00:41:01,707
That's a buck down the drain.

1000
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:04,043
A girl came in this afternoon...

1001
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:07,714
Nadine Wilkes' sister.

1002
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:09,381
Oh.

1003
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:12,051
She came in

1004
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:14,386
to I.D. her, and...

1005
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:17,590
she just thought I was
another caring doctor.

1006
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:21,210
I let her go right
on thinking that

1007
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:23,679
because...

1008
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,082
that's what I want
everybody to think.

1009
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,025
And, Carol...

1010
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,295
I think I really
did it this time.

1011
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:47,286
You came up here for what?

1012
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:48,988
Cry on my shoulder?

1013
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:51,285
Tell me how
worthless you really are

1014
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,926
deep down inside?

1015
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:55,389
And I'd say, "No,
you're not, Doug.

1016
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,797
You're one hell of a guy."

1017
00:41:57,832 --> 00:41:59,944
And you'd be able
to live with yourself

1018
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:02,018
until the next time?

1019
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:06,472
No. No, thanks.

1020
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:08,023
I'm just not playing.

1021
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,093
You're on your own.

1022
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,572
I didn't know she was sick.

1023
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,374
You didn't know her at all.

1024
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:18,789
Hey, Doug.

1025
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:21,280
It's Lauren. Give me a call.

1026
00:43:21,316 --> 00:43:24,617
Thursday, 4:20 p.m.

1027
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:28,932
Hey, Doug. It's Michelle.

1028
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:31,324
We met at the Stanhope
Pharmaceuticals conference.

1029
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,926
Anyway, I wanted to take
you up on that drink offer.

1030
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:35,395
So give me a call.

1031
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,662
I'm still at Children's.

1032
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,048
Bye.

1033
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,484
Thursday, 5:17 p.m.

1034
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:47,685
Dr. Anspaugh's Office calling.

1035
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,653
Our records indicate
you have not signed up

1036
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:50,776
for the Healthmobile.

1037
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:53,579
Please do so.

1038
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:57,350
Thursday, 5:52 p.m.

1039
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:01,671
Doug, Tina.

1040
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:02,988
Busy tonight?

1041
00:44:03,024 --> 00:44:04,340
Give me a call.

1042
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:10,947
Thursday, 6:48 p.m.

1043
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,850
Your messages have been erased.
