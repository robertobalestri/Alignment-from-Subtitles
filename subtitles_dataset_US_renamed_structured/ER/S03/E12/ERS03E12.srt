1
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,971
<i>What happened?</i>

2
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,229
<i>I guess that's the question.</i>

3
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:09,067
<i>How could this awful,
senseless thing happen?</i>

4
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:12,904
I mean, I've-I've seen traumas

5
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,374
from plenty of accidents
since I started my training.

6
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,410
But this was someone I knew.

7
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,712
But you're convinced
it was an accident?

8
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,779
I guess.

9
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,092
Have the police...?

10
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,818
I don't think they've
come to any conclusions.

11
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,188
Either he lost his balance
and fell onto the tracks...

12
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,623
or he jumped.

13
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:37,729
I understand that you and,
uh, Dr. Gant were friends...

14
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,030
roommates?

15
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,448
Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:44,303
Well, we hadn't seen much
of each other for the last...

17
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,303
month.

18
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,672
Um, I had, um...

19
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,109
I was seeing somebody,
and I was staying...

20
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,094
over at her place a lot.

21
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:58,600
Obviously, the, uh, hospital
is interested in finding out

22
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:03,021
if anything could have been
done to prevent this tragedy.

23
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,333
You mean if it

24
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,840
were a suicide?

25
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:10,145
We're both aware of the
complaint about Dr. Benton

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,448
Dennis lodged on
the day of his death.

27
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:17,836
In your judgment,
was this day unique

28
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,372
in Dr. Gant's experience,
or had he frequently felt

29
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,192
he was treated unfairly?

30
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,410
We both complained

31
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,730
about the hours, the residents.

32
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,977
That's what I thought
it was... venting.

33
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,463
I know Dennis had bad days.

34
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,869
We all do.

35
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,571
But what I'm asking is

36
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:40,225
if anyone or anything
put undue pressure

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,043
on Dr. Gant...

38
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,129
A policy, a teaching method...

39
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,367
Anything that seems,
in retrospect, too harsh?

40
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,242
I'll have to think about that.

41
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:55,473
Dr. Gant's father is
arriving this afternoon

42
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,176
to collect his things and, uh...

43
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,812
bring the body back home to...

44
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,542
Atlanta.

45
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05,567
I hope you'll be able
to accompany Mr. Gant

46
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,403
to the apartment.

47
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,855
Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,911
Oh, my God, John,
I couldn't believe it.

49
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,113
Yeah.

50
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,581
What a shocker.

51
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,783
You think he pulled a Cobain?

52
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:23,118
Dale...

53
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,754
Well, if they do
rule it a suicide

54
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,890
maybe we'll get some
shorter hours around here.

55
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,792
Dennis said
something at Christmas

56
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:31,993
about his girlfriend.

57
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:34,129
But if he were
depressed or whatever

58
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,231
you would have
noticed, wouldn't you?

59
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,267
Yeah, I would've.

60
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,412
That's the ER.

61
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,448
I thought you had
the ER yesterday.

62
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,004
I'm covering Dennis's shift.

63
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,543
I need eight units of
o-neg, the sooner the better.

64
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,711
What's up?

65
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,591
Two GSWs coming
in, both critical.

66
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,092
All sharps and meds
are accounted for.

67
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:54,461
All right, get ready
for the next guest.

68
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,629
Set up the rapid infuser.

69
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:56,785
Benton coming down?

70
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,732
I don't know. I
haven't seen him yet.

71
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:00,656
I was sorry to
hear about Dennis.

72
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,056
Is there any more news?

73
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,169
No, not yet.

74
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:05,193
We'll take the
chest wound in Two.

75
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,663
We'll handle the
extremity wound right here.

76
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:08,830
Got it.

77
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,100
Respiratory's alerted.

78
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,402
I'll set up a vent.

79
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:15,315
I'll spike you up a
couple of liters of saline.

80
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,483
Here's a fresh chest tube tray.

81
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,472
Thank you.

82
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,785
Who's with us, Carol?

83
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,742
I paged Lily. She'll join you.

84
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:21,943
Connie'll scribe.

85
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,679
Me and Malik are with Carter.

86
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:24,891
All right, what do we got?

87
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,080
Two GSWs.

88
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,049
You and Carter can
take the chest wound.

89
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,084
Is the room prepped?

90
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,084
Yeah. O-neg's here.

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,085
Both rooms are ready.

92
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,832
The chest tube tray is set.

93
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,467
Call Radiology; get a portable.

94
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:35,724
We did it.

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,470
Okay, anybody check the
battery on the laryngoscope?

96
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:38,593
Done.

97
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,662
Looks like we're
ready to go, folks.

98
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,041
Well, where the hell are they?

99
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,365
I'll check the ETA.

100
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,733
Hey, I was wondering.

101
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,251
Did you get my message
about the memorial service?

102
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,520
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.

103
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,332
I was wondering if
you would or could say

104
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,717
a few words. Are you talking

105
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,069
about the memorial? Mm-hmm.

106
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,637
It's 5:00 in the chapel, right?

107
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,161
Man, I still can't believe it.

108
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,196
Me, neither.

109
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,032
Here comes the groom.

110
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,018
Zadro's got the
bride right behind me.

111
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,363
Let's put her in one.

112
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,887
GSW to the chest.

113
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:06,888
Intubated in the field.

114
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:07,956
Two liters in.

115
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,092
BP 40 palp, sinus tach at 150.

116
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,027
Two GSWs, left lower extremity.

117
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,312
Arterial bleeding,
no distal pulses.

118
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,696
Why do I see a third gurney?

119
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,999
Best man. Wound to
the abdomen. He's stable.

120
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,267
BP's 120/80, pulse 88.

121
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,269
We only knew about two victims.

122
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:22,603
Hold him right here.

123
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,639
Carter!

124
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,708
One, two, three.

125
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,512
Evaluate the guy in the hall.

126
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:31,746
We got a third victim.

127
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,014
I need to steal Malik.

128
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,315
Be my guest.

129
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,518
H & H, cross and type
for six. Portable chest.

130
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:37,697
Pressure's still 40.

131
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,070
Set up the transfuser.

132
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,071
Large bore IV

133
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,174
with blood tubing.

134
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,009
Let's run it wide open.

135
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,010
Let's go.

136
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,178
Carter, come on.

137
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,512
Coming.

138
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,228
We got to the "Do you take" part

139
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,731
and bam, there's
her ex, blasting away.

140
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:47,022
Hey, Lily? More
blood for the bride!

141
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:49,290
Do we have any exam rooms
open for our best man here?

142
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,625
Not yet.

143
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,626
How are Duke and Katria doing?

144
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,122
I'm going to take you
for an abdominal CT.

145
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,873
Whoa. Pressure's dropping.

146
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:55,975
He's crashing.

147
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,965
Damn it. Take that!

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,010
Two units O-neg on board.

149
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:59,000
My guy just bottomed out.

150
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,179
I need to do a central line.

151
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,236
What do you want me to
do, Carter, hold your hand?

152
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,521
No, there's no room to do him.

153
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,118
Figure it out. Where's
the type specific blood?

154
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,418
It's coming. All
right, let's go.

155
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:07,792
Start pushing, Malik.

156
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,127
Where are we going?

157
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,462
Trauma two.

158
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,930
Oh, man.

159
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,264
Scoot over. Make room.

160
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,599
To the right. Go.

161
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,101
All right, Malik, let's
get a central line kit

162
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,437
and an intubation tray

163
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:19,938
and start pushing the o-neg.

164
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,272
How's that pressure?

165
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,585
40 Palp.

166
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,120
Let's get a central
line kit here now.

167
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,144
Trendelenburg.

168
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,791
Whose monitor is that?

169
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,113
Ours. He's arrested.

170
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,460
All right. Thoracotomy
tray. Let's move, come on!

171
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,128
Want to watch your elbows?

172
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,167
Let's go.

173
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,330
Hey.

174
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,987
I missed you last night.

175
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,233
How's your cold?

176
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,490
It's better. Thanks.

177
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,535
Thanks for the roses.

178
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,559
Oh, you liked them?

179
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,638
I loved them.

180
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,078
For you.

181
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:46,047
Oh, man, you are
spoiling me, you know that?

182
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,448
Something wrong?

183
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,944
Oh, you know,
all this union stuff.

184
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,269
It will be a weird
day for the nurses.

185
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,937
Yeah, so is the sick-out
going to happen?

186
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,139
Yeah, I think so.

187
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,486
Does it bother
you that I told you?

188
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,609
No, no, no. Of course not.

189
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,764
We're still on for
tonight... Movie, dinner?

190
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:00,779
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,280
Okay. It's a date.

192
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,980
Yeah, it's fractured, all right.

193
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:08,547
How's that pressure dressing?

194
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,405
Looks like we
stopped the bleeding.

195
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,773
Four units of A-positive.

196
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,808
Next door.

197
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,442
Let's get that Arteriogram.

198
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,089
Oh, finally,
type-specific's here.

199
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,213
All right. It's a little
late now. Statinsky.

200
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,893
Okay, I'm in. Keep
the O-neg going.

201
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,227
Pressure's coming up.

202
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,566
My guy's stable.

203
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,896
You need some help?

204
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,020
Ah, damn it. There's
nothing to clamp.

205
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:27,404
He's bled out.

206
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,140
Flatline.

207
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,475
All right.

208
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,926
Time of Death... 12:05.

209
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,328
BP's stable, 100/60.

210
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:36,197
Want to take this guy up?

211
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,966
Yeah. Let's go.

212
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,436
You do the body,
I'll do the room?

213
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,770
Sure.

214
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:45,240
Malik, I'm a little
shorthanded this afternoon.

215
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,341
A lot of my nurses
are calling in sick.

216
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:49,293
Is there any way you
can you pull a double?

217
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,712
Sorry.

218
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:55,349
Carol, can you give
us a hand in here?

219
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,919
Go on. I'll get this.

220
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,442
The, uh, memorial service

221
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,029
is going to be in
the hospital chapel.

222
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,499
You wouldn't need to say much.

223
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:12,517
Just...

224
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,629
No, forget it, Carter.

225
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,052
I'm no public speaker.

226
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:21,959
You know, there's
still no official ruling

227
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,394
on the cause of death.

228
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,797
Dr. Anspaugh says the police
are still talking to witnesses,

229
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,533
so maybe they'll
turn up something.

230
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,713
When did you speak to Anspaugh?

231
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,036
This morning.

232
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,305
He called in all the
blue team interns.

233
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,451
Why? Why? To
see how we're doing.

234
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,609
To see what we think
might have happened.

235
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,288
Why? Were there
any blue team interns

236
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,411
on the El platform?

237
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,725
I think he was wondering
about Gant's state of mind

238
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,959
these last couple of weeks

239
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,283
like all of us were.

240
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,230
So did he call you guys in
one at a time or all together?

241
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,286
No. One at a time.

242
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,920
Hasn't Anspaugh
talked to you yet?

243
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,367
Actually I'm supposed
to go talk to him

244
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,669
but I guess he needs
to do a survey first.

245
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,613
GSW to the abdomen.
Who's on call?

246
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:56,794
Dr. Hicks. Room one.

247
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,314
You know, I don't think
anybody's blaming you.

248
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,016
Why would they?

249
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,518
Carter, did you finish
your rounds this morning?

250
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:04,852
Not yet.

251
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,054
All right, well, get to it.

252
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,339
I can finish this up by myself.

253
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,389
She'll stay on a 72-hour hold

254
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,848
while we finish her
psychiatric evaluation.

255
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,360
I suggest you steer clear.

256
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,895
You've gotten too entangled.

257
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,218
I'm her doctor.

258
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,587
<i>And</i> her guardian angel

259
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,355
and the guy who let her down.

260
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,356
She pissed?

261
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,691
At you? Yeah, sure.

262
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,293
You told her you wouldn't
sell her into the system

263
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,628
and you did.

264
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,563
But betrayal isn't
anything new to this girl.

265
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,376
Betrayal? She's a
14-year-old on the streets.

266
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,517
You don't have
to explain it to me

267
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:11,169
And you don't have
to explain it to her.

268
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,622
Another doc could follow
up on her neuro exam.

269
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,724
You knew I'd be back.

270
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,642
She's a kid you went
out of your way to help

271
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,578
who hates your guts.
You want to change that.

272
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,224
Okay, what's
Charlie's prognosis?

273
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,392
Well, she's got a lot of issues,

274
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,194
but I won't recommend
a psychiatric placement.

275
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,551
DCFS will take over from here.

276
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,231
But it wouldn't be a
problem for her if I see her?

277
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,156
Charlie's armor
is in good shape.

278
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,374
How's yours?

279
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,764
So what are you going
to do with the afternoon?

280
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,099
Lydia and I are hitting
the January sales.

281
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,069
Not me, I'm not spending a
penny until our contract is settled.

282
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,404
Oh, it is settled.

283
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,117
Nothing like a
case of the pink flu

284
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,106
to make a point.

285
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,608
I've never been
in a strike before.

286
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,109
I hope you never will be.

287
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,545
This is just a
sick-out. A pink flu.

288
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,979
Close your ears, E. Ray.

289
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,158
Hey, I'm a union man.

290
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,550
One shift without RNs
ought to make them

291
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,796
think twice about
cutting our overtime.

292
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,453
I'm just worried
about the patients.

293
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,521
We all are.

294
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,467
That's why we aren't
going to accept a contract

295
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,069
that compromises patient care.

296
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,392
Or screws us.

297
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,727
That, too.

298
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,096
Chuny, could you help me
with this damn coffee maker?

299
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,243
See. What would they do
without us RNs around here?

300
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,078
Hey, you should be
taking tea and lemon

301
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,229
for that cold of yours.

302
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,087
Oh, boy. I hate to see her fall.

303
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,989
I tried to warn her.

304
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,791
Oh, Dr. Greene's a nice guy.

305
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,960
Dr. Greene's a<i>
doctor</i> on the rebound.

306
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,562
How many nurse/doctor
flings have you known?

307
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,131
Including my own?

308
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,777
And how many of them worked out?

309
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:35,102
The real problem is, she's
got a grand trine in fire

310
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:37,104
and his sun is in Pisces.

311
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,906
Labs are back
from curtain three.

312
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,458
They're mine.

313
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,053
Haleh, can you pull a double?

314
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,545
When?

315
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,792
Today. My entire
PM shift called in sick.

316
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,083
I heard something
was going around.

317
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:50,763
Well, something's
going around, all right.

318
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,086
Can you stay?

319
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,420
I'm sorry, Carol.

320
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,756
I'm coming down with it myself.

321
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,879
Hey, Charlie.

322
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,117
I just want to check
on your concussion.

323
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,131
It will only take a second.

324
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,466
Come here. Sit up.

325
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,789
Come on, let's go.

326
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,102
I need you to sit up.

327
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,421
I want you to
look into the light.

328
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:16,589
Okay?

329
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:17,912
Come here.

330
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,125
I want you to follow this

331
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,117
just with your
eyes, not your head.

332
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:24,429
Hey, look.

333
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:26,215
That swelling went down.

334
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,106
Okay, follow the light

335
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,925
just with your
eyes, not your head.

336
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,277
How's your head?

337
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,455
Any confusion?

338
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,712
Yeah.

339
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,080
What year is it?

340
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,683
December '95, according
to this hot magazine

341
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,018
you gave me.

342
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,520
Did you know Michael and
Lisa-Marie are splitting up?

343
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,100
Charlie, what was
I supposed to do?

344
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,635
Let you go back
out on the street?

345
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,126
Like I haven't been beaten
worse when I lived at home.

346
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,872
You have any trouble seeing?

347
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,264
No. I get these little blobs.

348
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,967
What kind of blobs?

349
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,818
Open your eye.

350
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,071
Dark spots floating around.

351
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,974
Any flashes of light?

352
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,204
Sometimes, when you
get a blow to the head

353
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:07,406
there's a danger of
retinal detachment.

354
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,331
We'll have an
ophthalmologist take a look at it.

355
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:11,994
In the meantime, why don't
you lay back down, okay?

356
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,252
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any more boring.

357
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,905
Yep.

358
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,706
If I go blind

359
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:21,276
can they still send
me to the nut house?

360
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,860
That's not where you're going.

361
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,011
Oh, good.

362
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,380
Then just to jail?

363
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,872
You're going somewhere
so you'll be safe.

364
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,791
I should have lied...

365
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,495
and said I wasn't raped.

366
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,564
That's why you locked me up.

367
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:49,136
You're on a hold
for your own good.

368
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:53,308
Like it was my fault.

369
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:56,410
I should have just
said it was sex.

370
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,680
It's not like there's
much of a difference.

371
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,150
Like any of it matters.

372
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,822
Don't let them put me in a home.

373
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,875
I won't.

374
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:14,946
Nobody's going to hurt you.

375
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,897
Please.

376
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,742
Guess.

377
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:28,743
It's... no more roses.

378
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:29,977
I mean, I love the roses...

379
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,712
They were beautiful
both times, but...

380
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:32,858
It's not roses.

381
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:33,981
It's a beauty.

382
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,017
This thing must have cost you.

383
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:37,062
Try it on.

384
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:38,497
You're going to
need it come Spring.

385
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,899
I thought we'd take a week
and head to the Upper Peninsula.

386
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,339
Mark, it's only January.

387
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,919
What makes you think we can't

388
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,908
plan ahead?

389
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,410
My last ten relationships.

390
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,246
Mark, Nurses Admin
is coming to discuss...

391
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,176
What are you rebelling
against, Chuny?

392
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,300
What have you got?

393
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:53,929
Weaver, without a
chart in curtain three.

394
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,119
Oops. I got distracted.

395
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,154
All his fault.

396
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,718
Does Admin want to discuss

397
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,242
our... situation?

398
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:02,517
You mean the nurses' sick-out?

399
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,555
Chuny.

400
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:04,628
That's what it is.

401
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,958
You wouldn't want to stay
and help me out, would you?

402
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:06,714
Please don't ask.

403
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,144
The nurses have
to stick together.

404
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:08,949
I'm a nurse.

405
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:09,984
And a manager.

406
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,931
Don't ask me to break ranks.

407
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:13,688
It's too hard to say no to you.

408
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,925
She's great.

409
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:19,127
Yeah.

410
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,128
Heard from Susan?

411
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,729
If you think I'm

412
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:25,533
just reacting to Susan leaving,
you're completely wrong.

413
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,584
I'm completely wrong.

414
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:32,790
Picked this guy up

415
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,137
at the airport shuttle
at McCormick Place.

416
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,478
He's diaphoretic,
temp's 103, BP's 70/50.

417
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,930
Vomited three times
en route. Diarrhea, too.

418
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,743
You don't want
to go near my rig.

419
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,367
Find Dr. Greene.

420
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,252
Okay, on my count.

421
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:47,405
One, two, three.

422
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,240
Let's give him

423
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,307
a liter of saline.

424
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,721
Pulse ox is 98% on five liters.

425
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,361
Temp's 103.6.

426
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,696
Okay, five of Compazine

427
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:57,832
and Tylenol, ten
grain suppository.

428
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,099
Let's mix a dopamine drip.

429
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,068
What do you got?

430
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,596
This guy was picked
up at an airport shuttle.

431
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,665
Departing or arriving?

432
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,954
Here, let me check.

433
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,217
Cap refill's poor.

434
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,575
Okay, let's get a
CBC, Chem seven

435
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,792
Urine C and S. Chest film.

436
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,595
According to his ticket,
Mr. Hecht just flew in from Paris.

437
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,580
Hang on. His original

438
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,600
point of departure
was Libreville.

439
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,834
Where's that?

440
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,668
Gabon, West Africa.

441
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,314
All right, everybody
get masks on.

442
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,605
I'll mask the patient.

443
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,906
What are you thinking?

444
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,708
I'd like to get a consult

445
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,604
from Infectious Disease
down here right away.

446
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,229
Isn't Gabon one of the places
they've found the Ebola virus?

447
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:29,563
Let's set up an isolation room.

448
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:31,076
Keep caregivers
down to a minimum.

449
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,467
I'll stay with Mr. Hecht.
I started the case.

450
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:39,284
How'd it go?

451
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,608
Best man pull through?

452
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,242
Yeah. Lost his spleen.

453
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,844
I finished my rounds.

454
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,247
Did you want me to take
Dennis's patients, too?

455
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,516
No. I'll do them.

456
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,707
You know, I bumped into
Dr. Morgenstern, and, uh

457
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,660
he told me the police have
ruled Dennis's death an accident.

458
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,430
Is that what you think it was?

459
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,950
I think it's easier for
everyone, for his family.

460
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,096
Yeah. Easier on everyone

461
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,220
but that doesn't mean it's true.

462
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,656
Carter, why do you
care what I think?

463
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,036
Because you and I knew Dennis.

464
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,387
Better than anybody else here.

465
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,172
Look, I'm not
your friend Keaton.

466
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,479
I know if she was
here, she would

467
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,592
hash over this thing with you,

468
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:20,926
but Carter, you
know, that's not me.

469
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,083
Peter? Ah.

470
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,285
There you are.
When it rains, it pours.

471
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,098
Dissecting aneurysm
coming down from ICU.

472
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,221
Care to join me?

473
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,457
Uh... I'd love to.

474
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,870
Have you finished
your rounds yet?

475
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,044
Yes, I have.

476
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,311
He's covering ER.

477
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,224
Well that shouldn't
stop you from joining us.

478
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,688
If you get paged, you can leave.

479
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,536
Why don't I tell you
how to do your job,

480
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,937
and then we'll see
how you take it?

481
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,573
Is there some way that you can
expedite Charlie's foster placement?

482
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,109
She not going to do well in an
institution. Norm agrees with me.

483
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,799
No, what I said was,
if she gets a chance,

484
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,601
she'll probably ditch
out of a group setting.

485
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,304
That's why my first attempt
is to locate the mother.

486
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,517
Yeah, good luck with that.

487
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,652
She was last seen in
Ohio over a year ago right?

488
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:04,787
You believe that?

489
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,944
I don't believe Charlie
wants us to find her mom,

490
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,779
that's why she's being
so uncooperative.

491
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,058
She's such a great mom.

492
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,249
Well, even a bad mom
can give parental consent

493
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,583
and that's what you need

494
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,552
for the kind of placement
you're suggesting.

495
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,054
If Charlie would cooperate

496
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,633
in helping find
her other relatives

497
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,208
in Cleveland or elsewhere,
she could be placed with them.

498
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,821
And she understands that?

499
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:23,444
Yes.

500
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,661
Yes.

501
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,230
But I'm the enemy.

502
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,195
Okay. All right.
I'll give it a shot

503
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,029
if I'm not stepping
on your toes.

504
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,252
Oh, stomp away.

505
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:33,954
We all want the same thing.

506
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,501
Jeanie, this is Dr. Fischer
from Infectious Disease.

507
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:48,613
Hi. How's the patient?

508
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:50,104
He's defervescing.

509
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:52,506
Lytes, chest x ray,
urinalysis were all normal.

510
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,792
He's been conscious
off and on, but delirious.

511
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,538
He did confirm that he
was working in Gabon.

512
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,840
Some sort of land survey.

513
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,474
I want a Sed rate and an LP.

514
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,280
Right away.

515
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,359
And as far as the airline goes?

516
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:02,449
Keep them on alert

517
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:03,628
but I want to get
some test results

518
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,119
before they contact passengers.

519
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,832
I hear hoofbeats, but I
haven't seen any zebras yet.

520
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:07,788
Can you draw blood cultures?

521
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:09,534
The graft is holding, finally.

522
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,691
Let's close.

523
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:12,504
2-0 Proline on a double-armed.

524
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:13,694
Carter, suction.

525
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,895
Come on, 2-0 proline.

526
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,108
Let's go. Let's wake up.

527
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,976
The whole
department's off today.

528
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,499
Everyone's still in shock.

529
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,835
Bovie.

530
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,772
I'm sorry I didn't get
to know Dr. Gant better.

531
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,185
How was working with him, Peter?

532
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:27,453
I don't know. It's
too soon to say.

533
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,009
More 2-O.

534
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,678
He hadn't distinguished
himself yet.

535
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,457
That's surprising,
given his transcripts.

536
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,876
He came to us with the
highest recommendations.

537
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,045
Yeah, well, maybe he was
having adjustment problems.

538
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,880
So you noticed him struggling?

539
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,538
I don't think Gant was prepared
to handle an urban trauma center.

540
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,542
Then why did you give him
a positive progress report?

541
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,643
Sorry?

542
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,523
You heard me. Why
did you praise him

543
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,347
for his "improved
technical skills and initiative"

544
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,643
in his second review?

545
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,433
Perhaps at another time.

546
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,013
No, actually I gave
that review to Gant

547
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,548
before he had some
recent backsliding.

548
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:58,967
Now, I wasn't even aware
that he received that evaluation.

549
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,224
Oh, he hadn't.

550
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,225
It came today.

551
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,226
You can be sure

552
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,460
that he never received

553
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,862
any encouraging or
supportive word from you.

554
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,208
Candy, take over suctioning.

555
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,910
You're excused, Dr. Carter.

556
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,869
All he got from you
was harping and criticism

557
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,670
and now, he's dead

558
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,640
and you're going
to have to face it.

559
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,777
My apologies, Dr. Hicks.

560
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,654
Whoa! You don't like the roses?

561
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,867
I love the roses.

562
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:32,968
I'm just telling you
you can slow down.

563
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,570
You don't have to impress me.

564
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,038
Yeah, well, I just
passed a florist shop

565
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,360
and I thought about you.

566
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,574
Yeah, but in my family

567
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,943
if a man sends flowers
two times in one week

568
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,533
the only thing left is
conversion to Catholicism

569
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,935
marriage and seven kids.

570
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,882
So should I be looking
over my shoulder

571
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,516
for your father with a shotgun?

572
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,340
No. My brother
Julio... He packs a .45.

573
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,486
Mark, there you are.

574
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,543
Looks like 100% participation.

575
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,080
We have no nurses
in exactly one hour.

576
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,381
Dr. Greene, this is
Roger Drummond

577
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,828
from labor relations,
and you know Mary Kay.

578
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,898
Well, our attorneys are filing
an injunction against the union.

579
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,856
An organized work stoppage
is illegal under their contract.

580
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,703
No one was actually
stupid enough to admit

581
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,855
to an organized sick-out? Nope.

582
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:11,089
Hopefully, only this
one shift will be affected.

583
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,708
We can't stay
open without nurses.

584
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,332
Well, I've rounded
up private duty nurses

585
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,166
off the registry and also
some nurse managers

586
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,034
from other departments
who are going to cover.

587
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,113
Oh, boy.

588
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,616
I can come down
myself if you need me.

589
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,106
The extra bodies will help
with non-emergent cases.

590
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,220
The hospital would prefer
not to cave to this kind of tactic.

591
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,043
Well at least, we should stay

592
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,029
closed to trauma.

593
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,112
I agree with Carol.

594
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,514
Me, too.

595
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,782
All right.

596
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,485
We close to trauma, 3:00 sharp.

597
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,953
I'll call the paramedics.

598
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,471
Let them know to divert.

599
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:41,442
How's she doing?

600
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:43,577
No signs of retinal detachment.

601
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,112
What about the blobs?

602
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:47,681
Most people have
floaters, but you've probably

603
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:50,484
just noticed them more
as you've been recovering.

604
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,531
When's this stuff
going to wear off?

605
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:53,999
Your vision will be normal

606
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:55,200
in an hour or so.

607
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,457
Wear these.

608
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:58,803
Thanks for checking
her out there, Doc.

609
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,994
Any time, Dr. Ross.

610
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,596
You have a very nice daughter.

611
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,231
She's not my daughter.

612
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,999
Who gave you that idea?

613
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:07,234
It was just a joke.

614
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,203
Cool. It's kind of trippy.

615
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:10,348
Everything's a blur.

616
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,872
Why'd you tell the doctor that?

617
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,151
That you're my dad? Yep.

618
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:14,219
You're old enough.

619
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,587
You know, half the
time you clam up

620
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,651
and you don't say anything,
and then the other half,

621
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,324
you're taking back
the lies you just told.

622
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:20,447
So?

623
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,183
So you're making it tough
for people to help you.

624
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,819
If you cooperate, then
Social Services can find

625
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,672
a relative or get consent
for somebody to take you in.

626
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:29,840
Like who?

627
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,487
That's what you've got to
help them figure that out.

628
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:32,843
Stop lying to people.

629
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,145
Like adults don't lie
every chance they get?

630
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,647
Yeah.

631
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:43,437
Why don't you have any kids?

632
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,650
I get my fill of
them on the job.

633
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,575
So this truth thing's
a one-way street.

634
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,827
I get it.

635
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,461
Okay.

636
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,565
Uh... I haven't gotten
it together long enough

637
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,700
to stay with a woman

638
00:23:56,735 --> 00:24:00,387
let alone family and babies
and long-term commitments.

639
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,067
Well, you wouldn't
have to have a baby

640
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,741
if you had, like, a foster kid.

641
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,043
Anybody in particular?

642
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,262
Well, a teenager
wouldn't be that long

643
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:09,780
of a commitment.

644
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,292
They're practically
grown up already.

645
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,149
Charlie, if I were ready

646
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,469
you'd be first on my list.

647
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:21,308
You've used that one
on women, haven't you?

648
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,442
Uh... I have.

649
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:23,577
There you are.

650
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:24,645
Hey.

651
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,779
So how are the eyes?

652
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:26,992
She's doing fine.

653
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:29,149
Good. Well, I'm sure
her mother will be

654
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,467
relieved to hear that.

655
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,185
You found her, in Cleveland?

656
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,804
No. On South Desplaines Avenue,

657
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,238
just ten blocks away

658
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,589
where she and Charlie live.

659
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,091
My God, Charlie.

660
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:40,093
I was freaking, I
was so worried.

661
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,195
Look at you.

662
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,297
What did I tell
you would happen?

663
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,848
You're going to end up

664
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,183
with scars from this, you know.

665
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,118
When are you
going to listen to me?

666
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,986
I can't turn my
back for a second.

667
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,555
You're out the door.

668
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,939
Dr. Pomeranz?

669
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:54,308
Yes.

670
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:57,489
Dr. Anspaugh said that you might
be available today for counseling

671
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:59,291
for those of us who
knew Dennis Gant.

672
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:00,414
That's right.

673
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,816
Um, they've set
up an office for me

674
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,951
on the surgical ward, Room 820,

675
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:07,020
and I will be there till 6:00.

676
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:09,434
Oh, I don't know if
I can make it today.

677
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,036
I meant to stop by earlier,

678
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,971
but I got called into a surgery.

679
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,127
Oh, are you an intern?

680
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:16,163
Yeah. Yeah. John Carter.

681
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,998
Oh, you're John Carter.

682
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,601
Dennis mentioned
you a few times.

683
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:22,069
You were his friend.

684
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,804
You knew Dennis?

685
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,472
He came to me for counseling

686
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:26,790
when he first arrived.

687
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,775
But after a few sessions,
he decided to stop.

688
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,776
I see.

689
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,462
I'm really very sorry.

690
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,664
I know how hard
it is to lose a friend.

691
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,333
I hope you'll come by and talk.

692
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,368
Hey, um...

693
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,872
When Dennis quit therapy,
did you think that it was okay?

694
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,740
I mean, did you...

695
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,643
feel it was all right
for him to stop?

696
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:50,464
I didn't disagree with it,
his stopping at the time.

697
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:51,915
He seemed to be settling in

698
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,851
developing a support system.

699
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,888
There's a survivor's guilt

700
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,973
that comes with any
unexpected death.

701
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,878
Maybe I feel guilty
because I am.

702
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:07,564
You should come and see me.

703
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,067
I'll try.

704
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,243
I'll try to remember
all your names,

705
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,781
but please have your ID
tags where they can be seen.

706
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,315
Bye, Lily. Bye, Haleh.

707
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,316
Good-bye, Carol.

708
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,362
Good luck.

709
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,498
Has anyone worked the ER before?

710
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,221
20 years ago; I hated it.

711
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,367
Well, we're closed to trauma,

712
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,157
so that should
ease the workload.

713
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,059
And please, if you
have any questions,

714
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,238
don't hesitate to ask. Later.

715
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,973
Okay, I'll pick you
up at quarter till.

716
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,041
I can meet you there.

717
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,031
I'll pick you up.

718
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,265
Bye, Chuny.

719
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,401
You know if we win this,
it'll be good for nurses.

720
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,580
Yeah, it's not that simple.

721
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,816
County's got to find
the money somewhere.

722
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,973
Well, they can check
my bank account.

723
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,241
It's not in there.

724
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,771
I'll send these up to the lab,

725
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:54,673
Cell count and
diff, protein, glucose

726
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,508
gram stain, India
ink and culture.

727
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,498
Exactly.

728
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,977
Greg, nice to see
you again. Kerry.

729
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,746
Did we find you
something exotic?

730
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,168
No, we've seen too many movies.

731
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,237
There's no ecchymosis,
bleeding or rash.

732
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:05,572
It doesn't suggest ebola.

733
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:06,608
Meet me in the lab.

734
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,141
We'll make the Geimsa stains.

735
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:10,276
You know we have
techs who will do that.

736
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,829
I'm an old-fashioned lab rat.

737
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,129
I like to do it myself.

738
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,242
Greg's wonderful.

739
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,395
I should have thought of him

740
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:17,629
for you earlier.

741
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:18,969
Kerry...

742
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,048
As your doctor.

743
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,354
There's no reason

744
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,135
for you to drive all the way out

745
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,525
to Highland Park anymore.

746
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,488
Greg's very
respected for his work

747
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,672
with HIV patients.

748
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:28,812
Oh.

749
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,709
He left a successful
private practice

750
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,560
to come to County
after his partner

751
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,529
died of AIDS last summer.

752
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,986
Oh, that's too bad.

753
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:36,820
Think about it.

754
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,238
Yeah, maybe I will.

755
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,219
Turns out she's
not even a runaway.

756
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,842
Her mom lives ten minutes away.

757
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:44,811
She sounds like
quite a case herself.

758
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:46,491
Letting her kid run the streets

759
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:48,126
all hours of the day and night.

760
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,549
So what do you think...

761
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,850
Chop house for Valentine's day?

762
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,353
Mark, I'd love to, but
you're not my type.

763
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,423
It's not very romantic,
but it's Chuny's favorite.

764
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,042
So are they going to send
Charlie home with her mom?

765
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,955
There's a cooling-off period

766
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,023
where the DCFS

767
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,359
tries to figure out
which end is up.

768
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,960
And I'm on my way to the gym.

769
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,218
Well, sounds like she's
in safe hands for now.

770
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,620
Thank God for Social Services.

771
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:15,475
Hey, Carter.

772
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,911
Can I get you anything?

773
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,287
Wow. I could get used
to being closed to trauma.

774
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,623
I was actually hoping
for something to do.

775
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:31,136
Doesn't feel real, does it?

776
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,292
I just keep waiting

777
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:34,428
for Dennis to come
through that door

778
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,780
and tell everybody
it was a big mistake.

779
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,193
You know you couldn't
have done anything

780
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,328
to change it, right?

781
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,885
I know that.

782
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,037
I just don't believe that.

783
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,290
Help! Somebody
help my friend, please.

784
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,892
He's dying.

785
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,227
Okay, on a count...

786
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,211
Don't lift him up.

787
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,679
His leg is barely hanging on.

788
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:53,958
What happened to this guy?

789
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,627
Gil was taking a
nap in the alley.

790
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,183
They dropped a dumpster on him.

791
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,485
I had to drag it off of him.

792
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,770
I kept calling for help
but no cars would stop.

793
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:01,917
I was looking for a
phone. I couldn't find one.

794
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,434
Paramedics wouldn't
have brought you here.

795
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,641
Yeah, we're closed to trauma.

796
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,204
You probably just saved
your friend a ride across town.

797
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:07,339
What can I do?

798
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:09,346
Get the doctors.
Get all the doctors.

799
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,476
Nothing. Let's
try the other slide.

800
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,799
Okay.

801
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,134
Thanks.

802
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,136
Want to take a shot?

803
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,504
Sure.

804
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,973
You know what

805
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,308
you're looking for?

806
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,821
They have hoop-shaped
rings, like Saturn.

807
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,811
Exactly.

808
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,091
You like astronomy.

809
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:28,615
Well, my fifth-grade science
project was on comets,

810
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,283
so I'm pretty much an expert.

811
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,562
You must be excited about

812
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:32,998
the appearance of Hale-Bopp.

813
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,988
It's a comet that
was just discovered.

814
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,890
Just started to
brighten this month.

815
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,536
Do you have your own telescope?

816
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,105
Careful, you're going to be starting
on a whole new set of useless facts.

817
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,497
I thought about getting
my own telescope once,

818
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,665
but can you see much

819
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,894
with the city lights?

820
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,445
You should join me
for a comet watch.

821
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,085
I set up outside the Adler.

822
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,036
Yeah, I'd love to sometime.

823
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:51,338
How about tonight?

824
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,172
It's supposed to
be crystal clear.

825
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,937
But bundle up, at 4:00, there can
be a chilly wind coming off the lake.

826
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,193
4:00 a.m.?

827
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,023
It's only visible in
the predawn sky.

828
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,581
Ah. Hey wait, look.
I think I found some.

829
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:02,760
Take a look.

830
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:04,083
Am I right?

831
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,963
They have rings...
more than one.

832
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:07,003
Yeah, that's it.

833
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,955
The asexual form
of the parasite.

834
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:10,190
It's plain old malaria.

835
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,391
Good news for Mr. Hecht?

836
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:13,188
Chloroquinine...
ten milligram IV

837
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,894
followed by a 15 milligram drip.

838
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,262
Okay.

839
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:20,178
Hey, you know, I'm usually awake

840
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:21,668
at 4:00 a.m. anyway.

841
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:23,336
I'll bring the coffee.

842
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:24,651
Great.

843
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,104
O-neg is here, four units.

844
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,660
Thanks. Call Radiology again.

845
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,429
Ask what's taking them so long.

846
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,092
Get it on the rapid infuser.

847
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:34,931
I got a pumper.

848
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:35,932
Femoral artery.

849
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,028
4 x 4s for Dr. Greene.

850
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,017
Gauze?

851
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:39,519
4 x 4s.

852
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:41,688
Oh, come on, Gil. Come on.

853
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:42,989
Fight, Gil.

854
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:43,990
Come on.

855
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,725
Pulse is thready, pressure's 60,

856
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,044
heart rate's 140, pulse ox 90.

857
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,245
How's that lavage coming?

858
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,180
I need some Betadine.

859
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,898
Coming up. Watch out!

860
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,249
I need some help

861
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:53,917
with this tape.

862
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,752
Okay. I got it.

863
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,420
Who's on the infuser?

864
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,587
I'll get it.

865
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:58,788
Just a sec.

866
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,758
Oh, yeah. Positive lavage.

867
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,427
We got internal bleeding.

868
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,010
I need a thigh cuff.

869
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:05,679
Thigh cuff for Dr. Greene.

870
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,731
Upper right drawer.
Right drawer.

871
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,566
Up...

872
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:10,517
Found it.

873
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:11,217
He's fibrillating.

874
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:12,435
I'll start compression.

875
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,020
Let's shock him.

876
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:15,116
Paddles, Carter. 200.

877
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,339
Everybody off?

878
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,758
No juice.

879
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,861
Uh... uh... Carol?

880
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:23,546
Hit the sync switch.

881
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,532
Turn it off.

882
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:26,382
Am I set?

883
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,901
Yeah. Clear!

884
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,322
Come on, Gil.

885
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,173
300.

886
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:35,558
Clear!

887
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:38,861
Is he dying?! Is he dying?

888
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,663
Is my buddy dying?!

889
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,110
We're doing the
best we can, sir.

890
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,917
Wait outside.

891
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:46,118
360. Clear!

892
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,804
He's my friend! I know, I know.

893
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,538
An amp of epi.

894
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,789
I am sorry.

895
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,791
I tried to get him here
as fast as I could...

896
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:52,853
Shut this guy up!

897
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,594
It's my fault.

898
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,562
I let him down.

899
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,564
Let's shock him
again at 360. Clear.

900
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,332
He's my buddy
and I let him down.

901
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:00,933
Okay, okay. We got it, okay?

902
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:01,935
Carter, get him out of here.

903
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,436
I let him down.

904
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:04,849
No you didn't.
At least, you tried.

905
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:06,256
Kerry, can you

906
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,240
cover for me?

907
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,075
Yeah. Go on.

908
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,076
Come on. Come on.

909
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,911
Let's try him again at 360.

910
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:13,280
Clear.

911
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:47,380
I knew Dennis was
having a hard time.

912
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:53,336
I knew he was in trouble...

913
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,339
but I was too busy...

914
00:32:56,375 --> 00:33:00,643
and I just didn't want
to get dragged down.

915
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,596
I didn't listen.

916
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:04,297
You're in the middle

917
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,900
of your first year of residency.

918
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:09,719
You're working at
an inhuman pace.

919
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,656
Why am I doing it again?

920
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,518
'Cause you are
trying to learn a job

921
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,660
where lives are at stake.

922
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,529
Didn't save Dennis's
life, though, did I?

923
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,616
You don't know
that you could have.

924
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,972
I know that I wasn't
much of a friend.

925
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,550
I'll collect the sharps.

926
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,552
And you can check
off the dispensed meds.

927
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,898
Oh, you don't have to do that.

928
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:44,888
I can get a temp.

929
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,623
I don't mind chipping in.

930
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,957
#11 Lavage blade

931
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,627
Two needles from
the central line.

932
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:51,795
Right.

933
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,608
Three epi, 100 of lidocaine.

934
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,131
You know, I wanted
to compliment you

935
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,166
on how you handled
yourself today.

936
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,913
It isn't easy to be a manager

937
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,415
when it's hitting the fan

938
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,450
and your workers
are your friends.

939
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,807
Two IV needles.

940
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,543
Thanks. It's been pretty
awful around here lately.

941
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,745
I still think of myself as
just a nurse, you know,

942
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,615
and I got to wade through
all this management crap.

943
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,227
Two of O-neg, empty, two unused.

944
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,446
Well, you waded through
it very gracefully today.

945
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,869
Ah, isn't there three of O-neg?

946
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,033
Oh, yeah.

947
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,389
Here it is.

948
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,859
No. This one

949
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,261
is marked "A-pos."

950
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,312
What?

951
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:28,832
Did we order type specific?

952
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,366
It never came down.

953
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,835
Where did this...?

954
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,471
God, this must have
been on the infuser.

955
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,006
There's blood in the Foley bag.

956
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,670
Oh, my God, I gave him

957
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,143
the wrong blood.

958
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,162
This unit of A-positive

959
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,764
must have been
left on the infuser.

960
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:50,949
And when I started it up,

961
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,851
I'm pretty sure there
was a bag on there.

962
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,635
I just, I thought
someone had hung it,

963
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,970
and I didn't check the label.

964
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,861
Have you sent an EDTA-treated
sample to be recross-matched?

965
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,029
Yeah. It showed

966
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,048
massive intravascular hemolysis.

967
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,651
I gave type-A blood
to a type-O patient.

968
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,869
I killed him.

969
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,203
He was bleeding out anyway.

970
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,933
<i>Possibly</i> bleeding out.
We've saved worse.

971
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,000
It was an honest mistake.

972
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,436
You were the only
RN in the trauma.

973
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,671
We were all filling in roles
we weren't accustomed to.

974
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,996
That still doesn't take
away the basic error.

975
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,014
I did not check the label.

976
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,968
Carol, I think we're saying
that if you determined

977
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,020
an incident report
was unnecessary

978
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:26,017
we wouldn't pursue it.

979
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,185
Am I speaking out of turn?

980
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,459
No. If you'd been
alone cleaning up

981
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,589
you could have thrown the
empty bag in the hazardous waste

982
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:32,795
and been done with it.

983
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:33,863
That's true.

984
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,566
But I'd still have
to look at myself

985
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,601
in the mirror every day.

986
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:49,795
Thank you for making the
arrangements, Dr. Carter.

987
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,576
And the sentiments you expressed

988
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,366
set just the right tone.

989
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,368
I want to apologize, Dr. Hicks,

990
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,387
about what happened
earlier in surgery.

991
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,921
You already did.

992
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,175
Did I miss it?

993
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,993
Yeah.

994
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:07,263
Mr. Gant, this is Dr. Benton,
who you were asking about.

995
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,598
Dr. Benton, this
is Dennis Gant, Sr.

996
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,434
He was hoping to meet you.

997
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,203
My sympathies are
with you and your family.

998
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,282
Thank you, doctor.

999
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,840
I'm sorry I missed the service.

1000
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,769
Dennis's e-mail gave me a sense

1001
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,039
of how demanding
your schedules are.

1002
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:23,224
In fact, I had to
admonish my son

1003
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,648
for taking time to
write home at all.

1004
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,751
I didn't want him to
neglect his workload.

1005
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,972
I know that Dennis
greatly respected your work

1006
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,141
and looked up to you.

1007
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:39,228
Well, I'm afraid I was, uh...

1008
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,665
I was a bit tough on your son.

1009
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,868
Maybe Dr. Carter filled you in.

1010
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,353
No, I haven't.

1011
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:49,522
You have to be tough. Life is.

1012
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:52,525
I wasn't entirely
convinced that my boy

1013
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:56,062
should have chosen such
an ambitious specialty.

1014
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:59,466
But I didn't raise a quitter.

1015
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:02,652
I hope he didn't disappoint you.

1016
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,921
No. Your son worked very hard

1017
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,191
and I think he...

1018
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:12,562
would have made
an excellent surgeon.

1019
00:37:15,617 --> 00:37:17,767
Oh, I am so late.

1020
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,302
What a day, huh?

1021
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,305
You know, you and
Dr. Fischer make a good team.

1022
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,751
Well, we're getting
together later.

1023
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,208
He's an astronomy buff.

1024
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,310
You have a date
with Greg Fischer?

1025
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,978
Well, no, not a date.

1026
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,548
In some ways, it's perfect
for me that he's gay.

1027
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,865
Jeanie, what makes you think

1028
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,145
Greg Fischer is gay?

1029
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:34,951
Well, you said...

1030
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,269
He isn't gay.

1031
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:38,404
But you said that his
partner died of AIDS.

1032
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,706
No. His partner in
his medical practice

1033
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:42,057
not his lover.

1034
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,794
Oh, my God, Greg
Fischer is one of the most

1035
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,473
eligible heterosexuals
in Chicago.

1036
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,115
So he thinks this is a date.

1037
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:49,915
It is a date.

1038
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,601
I can't go.

1039
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,103
Oh, don't be silly.

1040
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,738
No. I didn't tell him about
my being HIV-positive.

1041
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,207
Look, it's just a date.

1042
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,419
Get to know him.

1043
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,042
You're entitled to a date.

1044
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,711
Really. Go. Have fun.

1045
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,147
I expect to hear all
about it tomorrow.

1046
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,019
Have you seen E. Ray?

1047
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,355
I think he's helping
one of the temp nurses.

1048
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,390
What?

1049
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,724
Not with a patient.

1050
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,904
He's helping her with
her astrological chart.

1051
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,106
Is Dr. Fischer in?

1052
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,263
I see. Is he on
pager, by chance?

1053
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,598
No? No? Okay, thanks.

1054
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,965
Carol.

1055
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:23,966
Good news.

1056
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,196
The union blinked first.

1057
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,365
The nurses will be back
on the morning shift.

1058
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,255
Well, you saved me
a trip from upstairs.

1059
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,857
I needed to give you this.

1060
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,858
During a trauma
that came in privately

1061
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,360
I inadvertently gave the patient

1062
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,529
the wrong blood, and he died.

1063
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,664
Oh, my God.

1064
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,810
The patient's family
aware of the error?

1065
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,896
He was a transient.
His friend said he had

1066
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,020
no family members.
Well, that's fortunate.

1067
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,588
What?

1068
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,102
I'll look over
the report, Carol,

1069
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,708
but don't beat yourself up here.

1070
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,155
Did the sick-out contribute to

1071
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:52,061
this man's demise?

1072
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,446
No. It was my error.

1073
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,215
I didn't check the label.

1074
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,399
I'm going to have
to write this up

1075
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,579
of course

1076
00:38:58,603 --> 00:38:59,819
but I think

1077
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:02,104
in view of the
circumstances of the day

1078
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,357
we may be able to
forego an investigation.

1079
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:07,343
I don't want any
special favors here.

1080
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:11,814
I stayed on today because,
as a manager, I'm required to.

1081
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,083
I understand.

1082
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,886
<i>So the mom admits</i>

1083
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,899
that there have been
fights in the house.

1084
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,269
She claims she can't
keep Charlie in at night.

1085
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:23,826
Sounds more like the
mom's not in at night herself.

1086
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,094
She confirmed the abuse

1087
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,664
by one if not two of her
boyfriends in the past.

1088
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,165
Why'd you page me?

1089
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,278
Charlie's making some claims.

1090
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:31,267
Against me?

1091
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:32,435
No, not accusations

1092
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,437
but Norm and I
felt it would be best

1093
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,472
if we hash this
thing out together.

1094
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,743
I appreciate you coming.

1095
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:41,911
Mm-hmm.

1096
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,279
What's up?

1097
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,715
Thank you so much for
taking care of her, doctor.

1098
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,894
It's my job.

1099
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,584
Yeah, but there are
so many who don't care

1100
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,386
or just don't take the time.

1101
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,338
I was out of my
mind. When I heard...

1102
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:54,940
I thought she was
baby-sitting at Gloria's.

1103
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,887
I was updating Dr. Ross about
what we've been discussing,

1104
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,778
about the problems at home.

1105
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,631
Yeah. I won't say I
don't have a temper

1106
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,699
and I've made a lot of mistakes

1107
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,635
but I love Charlie like crazy.

1108
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,771
I just want her
to find something.

1109
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:08,571
You know?

1110
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,807
She can't go out
on her own yet, but...

1111
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,753
So I told them what you told me

1112
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,039
about how my mom
could give consent.

1113
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:17,174
Adelle would be the one who
would know more about that.

1114
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:20,216
Charlie means parental
consent for her to live with you.

1115
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,512
She believes you agreed to that.

1116
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:22,719
Like we said

1117
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,053
I'm almost grown up.

1118
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,365
I wouldn't be around
all the time. I mean,

1119
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,106
I'd be in school...
Charlie, I'm...

1120
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,759
And I can see you're a
good man and a doctor

1121
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:32,295
and it's not like I'm
giving up my daughter.

1122
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,929
She needs a good influence.

1123
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,926
Charlie, that isn't
what we talked about.

1124
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,945
In fact, that's just the exact
opposite of what we talked about.

1125
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,201
So Charlie was mistaken.

1126
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:39,953
Yes. We could do it.

1127
00:40:39,988 --> 00:40:40,954
They'd let us.

1128
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:42,372
So, what, you
were flat-out lying?

1129
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:43,690
You see what it's like with her?

1130
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:44,457
You make me nuts.

1131
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:45,325
All right. I can't do this.

1132
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Why not? I'd do
whatever you said.

1133
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:49,006
These people can help
you. Adelle can help you

1134
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,180
Dr. Middleton can help you...

1135
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,793
Screw Adelle and
Dr. Middleton and screw Mom!

1136
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,351
It's all a bunch of crap
and I'll run away for good.

1137
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:57,631
You know it, and it'll be
your fault! Settle down.

1138
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,554
I hate you! I hate you!

1139
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,505
Maybe you should go.

1140
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,423
Yeah, yeah.

1141
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,298
Go! Go on! Get out of my face!

1142
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,434
Oh, God, I'm frozen.

1143
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,749
The snow was supposed to stop.

1144
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:17,606
Sorry, you didn't even
get a glimpse of the comet.

1145
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,777
That's okay, we'll have to
try again like in June or July.

1146
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:21,856
Two hot chocolates.

1147
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,279
You want something to eat?

1148
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,280
Yeah, maybe.

1149
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,282
I'm afraid I'm not hardy
enough for astronomy.

1150
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,461
Or crazy enough.

1151
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,052
Come to think of
it, I've never been

1152
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,020
all that interested in
the stars themselves.

1153
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,855
It's always been the
stories behind them.

1154
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,902
They have some great
myths. Have a favorite?

1155
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,860
I like the gruesome
ones, like Cassiopeia.

1156
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,774
Turned to stone by
the head of Medusa.

1157
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,575
Are you sure she didn't
freeze to death stargazing?

1158
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,410
Actually, she's sitting there

1159
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,713
waiting for the
man of her dreams.

1160
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,848
Remember? She's searching
for a nice, upstanding guy.

1161
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,684
He could even be a bit of a nerd

1162
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,791
as long as he's not completely
lacking in spontaneity.

1163
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,669
I'm sorry.

1164
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:04,904
No, I'm sorry.
No, it's my fault.

1165
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,005
I, uh...

1166
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,473
I just didn't expect that.

1167
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:09,976
But did you like it?

1168
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:11,994
Yes, I did.

1169
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,282
But, Greg...

1170
00:42:23,525 --> 00:42:24,957
Hmm.

1171
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,294
I'm HIV-positive.

1172
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:34,500
Oh.

1173
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,570
I'm sorry. I should've told
you before we got here,

1174
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,371
but I didn't think it
was a date at first.

1175
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,344
That's okay. You didn't need to.

1176
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,346
No, I should've

1177
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:49,148
but I was having fun.

1178
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:50,967
So...

1179
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:54,737
Here you go.

1180
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,978
Did you want to order anything?

1181
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,301
No.

1182
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,504
No, thanks. I'm fine.

1183
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,611
I know I was hard on Gant.

1184
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:55,598
But I thought that
was the best way

1185
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,949
for him to learn.

1186
00:43:56,984 --> 00:43:58,650
And I don't blame you.

1187
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:01,520
No more than I blame myself.

1188
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,257
I just feel like I have
been walking around

1189
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:05,891
with this secret

1190
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:08,711
and you're the only
person who knows it

1191
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,313
and you won't admit to it.

1192
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:16,719
You know, a few years ago

1193
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,154
I went to my high
school reunion.

1194
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,456
North Lawndale.

1195
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,057
Jackie got it in her head.

1196
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,204
Now, there wasn't
much of a turnout

1197
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,540
'cause half the class
had dropped out.

1198
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:28,097
I didn't know the others.

1199
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,934
You know, my parents tried to
keep me away from bad influences.

1200
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,581
But here I am with
them, you know,

1201
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:35,683
and, uh, a third of
the guys are in prison

1202
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:38,273
and I bet another
third are dead.

1203
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,811
You know, you hear about this
one and that one over the years.

1204
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,312
But this night

1205
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,215
I'm just struck by
the sheer numbers.

1206
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:54,957
I don't know what to
think of Gant's death.

1207
00:44:56,828 --> 00:45:01,397
But, Carter, I don't need
you to tell me how I feel.

1208
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,537
You want to go
through this alone?

1209
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:11,040
You want to make this
into something that, um...

1210
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,142
I don't know about.

1211
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,977
I guess you can.

1212
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:19,481
We'll both keep our distance.

1213
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,584
We'll both do our work.

1214
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,153
Pretend like nothing happened.

1215
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,623
We're good at that.

1216
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,827
Look what that
did for Dennis Gant.
