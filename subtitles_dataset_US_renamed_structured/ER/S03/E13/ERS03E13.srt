1
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,461
Doug! Doug! Wait up a minute.

2
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:14,596
Hey.

3
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,698
I got to ask you
something in confidence.

4
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:17,777
Good morning to you.

5
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,468
So, how many people know
about me and Chuny Marquez?

6
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:21,948
Including the cleaning crew?

7
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:22,938
So it's everyone.

8
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:24,617
That would be an understatement.

9
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,752
It's great. It's just that, uh,

10
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,754
we've kind of run out
of things to talk about.

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:28,744
And you want out.

12
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,145
I think that would be best.

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,424
Well, you covered the spread.

14
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,413
Huh? The office pool.

15
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,693
I had you for next week

16
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:36,251
but what's five bucks
for a friend's happiness?

17
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,253
You've had experience at this.

18
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,420
How do I end it?

19
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,857
You know those
Chinese finger puzzles?

20
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,559
You know, the harder you
pull them, the tighter they get.

21
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:45,060
Yeah?

22
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,228
You got to just relax

23
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,541
see, and then, they
just droop and fall off.

24
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:49,998
That sounds ominous.

25
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,011
I tell you what you do. You
explain to her that you're doing this

26
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,313
for her own benefit,
that it's been fun

27
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:56,449
but it's starting to
interfere with work

28
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,718
and you don't want
to ruin your friendship

29
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:00,954
because that's what
you really care about.

30
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,043
You know what?

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,862
You're frightening,
you know that?

32
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,198
Morning.

33
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,533
You're late.

34
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,135
Hey, I was checking
the surgery schedule.

35
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,337
This is it for us
today... a hernia?

36
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:14,906
Is that what it says?

37
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,241
Wow.

38
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,743
Problem, Carter?

39
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,712
No. It's just that our
schedule has been pretty...

40
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,946
lightweight lately.

41
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,548
Hernias and Hickman lines...

42
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,634
You can do this
stuff in your sleep.

43
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,813
No Hibiclens?

44
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,936
No, we're out.

45
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:30,171
At least this gives
us a little more time

46
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:32,106
to prepare for the
firm conference.

47
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:33,107
You ready?

48
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:34,442
Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:36,477
Uh-uh. 3:00 sharp, right?

50
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,747
I'm doing the first half,
you're doing the second.

51
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:42,300
We'll brush each
other up over lunch.

52
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,413
Carter, if I need your help

53
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,332
I'll ask for it, okay?

54
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,623
Happiness is a
full nursing staff.

55
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,758
I hope everyone
is feeling healthy.

56
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:52,060
Peachy.

57
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,428
I'd hate to see us get hit

58
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,796
by the one-day flu again.

59
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,476
Oh, I think it's run its course.

60
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,466
I hope so. I can't
afford to get fired.

61
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:00,246
Oh, honey, that was
just management

62
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,747
rattling its tired old saber.

63
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,550
What if they decide
to replace us?

64
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,408
They won't; after our sick-out,
management got religion.

65
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:08,643
The contract negotiations
are going great.

66
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,955
So are we going to
get what we want?

67
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,824
Yep. County
commissioners are nervous.

68
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,626
They know the
public's on our side.

69
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,450
They won't be
after they read this.

70
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,451
Right there.

71
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,452
Oh, no.

72
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:18,531
What?

73
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,383
"Patient dies after nurses walk.

74
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,823
"An unidentified nurse

75
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:23,570
"at County General Hospital

76
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:26,662
"allegedly transfused a
patient with the wrong type blood

77
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:27,829
"leading to his death

78
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,676
in the hospital's
emergency room."

79
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,777
Somebody died?!

80
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,951
That's what they
get for hiring temps.

81
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,353
"Hospital sources say

82
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:37,322
"the nurse's error was a
direct result of understaffing

83
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,192
caused by an illegal, one-day
sick-out by ER nurses."

84
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,193
Oh, man!

85
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,194
Where's Carol?

86
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,462
She's on at 9:00.

87
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,524
Did this guy die because of us?

88
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:48,500
First name Gil.

89
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,136
Last name unknown.

90
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,106
Section Y-37.

91
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,775
No headstones?

92
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,777
They just get a number.

93
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,763
Of course, between
the wind and the snow...

94
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,283
There's nothing.

95
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,785
Friend of yours?

96
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,787
No.

97
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:12,774
Well, uh... he might
be one of these in here.

98
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,310
I think we buried them last.

99
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,146
Ah, Mark, I was
just reminding Kerry

100
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,214
that today...

101
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,716
Is prospective intern day.

102
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:28,983
How could I forget?

103
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,319
There are six fourth-year
medical students

104
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,499
interviewing upstairs.

105
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,488
Six?

106
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,701
These are top prospects

107
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:36,235
being hotly recruited
by other programs,

108
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,970
so I expect you two to show them

109
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:39,628
what a real ER is all about.

110
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:40,896
We'll do our best.

111
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,230
I'm sure<i> you</i> will.

112
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:46,312
Carol, can we talk
to you for a minute?

113
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:47,301
Sure. What's up?

114
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:48,380
This.

115
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:50,016
We're not going to
take the fall for this.

116
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,840
The negotiations
are going our way.

117
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,509
If some temp made a
mistake, that is not our fault.

118
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,576
What temp?

119
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,356
The one who gave the
patient the wrong blood.

120
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,825
It wasn't a temp. It was me.

121
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,048
God, they lied to me.

122
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,549
I filed an incident report

123
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,685
and they said that
was the end of it.

124
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,331
Need a hand back here!

125
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,655
15-year-old male.

126
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,534
Multiple GSWs to the chest.

127
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,369
Massive blood loss on scene.

128
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,526
He shot my partner!

129
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,872
BP's 50 palp, pulse 130.

130
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,857
Two liters saline in transit.

131
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,025
O2, 15 liters.

132
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:16,998
He got a name?

133
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:17,999
Hernandez.

134
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,400
Who's bringing up the rear?

135
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,014
58-year-old male, single GSW

136
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,782
through and
through to the thigh.

137
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,751
BP 130/90, Pulse 108, resps 26.

138
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:25,740
Help the boy!

139
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,042
Don't listen to him, Doc.

140
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,843
Look, we're going
to help both of you.

141
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,057
No, no. Officer, officer, we
need you to wait outside, okay?

142
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,747
We got to work on your partner.

143
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:34,694
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Just give us some room.

144
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:36,562
On two... hut one, hut two!

145
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,352
Need suction.

146
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:41,022
Decreased breath
sounds on the right side.

147
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:42,691
I need to intubate.

148
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,693
Pressure's down to 40 palp.

149
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,144
Pulse 160.

150
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,730
Lydia, draw up the blood gas.

151
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,743
Maybe this will teach
him not to shoot cops.

152
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,278
CBC, type and cross for six.

153
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,147
Get the O-neg
going, chest tube tray.

154
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,614
You got that thoraseal ready?

155
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:56,604
In a sec.

156
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,588
Alright, I'm in.

157
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,741
Will you tape it
up for me, please?

158
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,820
Mm-hmm.

159
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,911
I'll call Radiology
for a portable.

160
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,757
And respiratory for a vent.

161
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,926
I'm going to go check on Doyle.

162
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,549
CBC and a crit.

163
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:09,550
Update tetanus

164
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,463
and give him one gram of Ancef.

165
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,453
How is he?

166
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:13,955
Missed the femoral artery.

167
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,956
No neuro deficit.

168
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,957
Excellent.

169
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,326
Sergeant...

170
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,660
Mattimore...

171
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:21,974
Welcome to the
Purple Heart's Club.

172
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,076
Thanks. How's the kid?

173
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,133
We're working on him next door.

174
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:29,570
Hi. I'm Jeanie Boulet.

175
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,571
Hi.

176
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,906
Mike and Cindy Patterson.

177
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,086
Hi, Mike. Have a seat.

178
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,887
I understand you've
got a headache.

179
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,044
Oh, nothing serious.

180
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,707
Do you have a
history of migraines?

181
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,808
I used to get a few in college.

182
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:39,781
These are different.

183
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,082
They come on for no reason.

184
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:42,294
What caused them before?

185
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,346
Tubas.

186
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,819
We were in the marching band.

187
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:45,970
Okay.

188
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,967
You're also suffering from
insomnia and dizziness.

189
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,390
Anything else?

190
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,242
He just hasn't been himself.

191
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,243
How so?

192
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,545
Well, uh, last night

193
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,029
in his sleep, he bit me

194
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:58,383
and when he woke up, he
didn't know where he was.

195
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,938
Okay. Let's take a look.

196
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,422
Hi.

197
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,757
Hi.

198
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,604
How's that kid who got shot?

199
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,093
Oh, he made surgery.

200
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,595
Oh, thank you.

201
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,342
Mm-hmm. My mother
was disappointed

202
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,644
you couldn't make it
for dinner last night.

203
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,000
Work, you know.

204
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,988
My brothers are starting
to doubt your intentions.

205
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,489
All five of them?

206
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,187
Chuny... Mark...

207
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,511
You first.

208
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,847
Mark... I'm not
sorry we did this.

209
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,444
It's been fun, but, um...

210
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,951
It's starting to
interfere with my work

211
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,437
and I really want to
preserve our friendship.

212
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:39,257
I know that's as important
to you as it is to me.

213
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,625
Yeah.

214
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,127
No hard feelings, right?

215
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,680
No, no. Of course not.

216
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,800
Okay.

217
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,914
Oh, what did you want to say?

218
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,755
Um...

219
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,190
Nothing.

220
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,298
You hung me out to dry.

221
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,410
No, I didn't.

222
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:05,467
Then who did?

223
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:06,512
Sit down, Carol.

224
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:08,314
Let me get you a cup of coffee.

225
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:09,682
I don't want a cup of coffee

226
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,117
and I don't want to sit down.

227
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,190
It<i> wasn't</i> me.

228
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,469
Who then?

229
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,909
Drummond?

230
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:17,311
Somebody who wanted
to influence negotiations

231
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:20,314
and somebody who had
access to your incident report.

232
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,235
Look, Carol, we have got a
threatened work stoppage here.

233
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,770
Emotions are running
high, the budget is shrinking,

234
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,338
and you have got a nursing staff

235
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,973
that seems to refuse
to acknowledge

236
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,508
the realities of '90s medicine.

237
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,622
This has nothing to
do with the sick-out.

238
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,006
<i>I</i> gave him the wrong blood.

239
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,663
Which I believe would
not have happened

240
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:36,831
if<i> your</i> friends had honored

241
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,350
their contract and
shown up for work.

242
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,085
This isn't labor politics, Mary.

243
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,403
A man died.

244
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,973
I'm sorry, Carol.

245
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,974
I killed a man

246
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:49,894
and nobody around here
seems to give a damn!

247
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,986
Tie.

248
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,521
Peter?

249
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:01,823
Tie.

250
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,493
I think you're wise
to slow it down

251
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:06,528
after pediatrics.

252
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,596
Nothing like a simple hernia

253
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,666
to put you back in
touch with the basics.

254
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:15,453
Hand, blade, clamp, suture.

255
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,454
Peanut, please.

256
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,889
Carter...

257
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,259
What's the difference between
a prostate and a garden hose?

258
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,243
I don't know.

259
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:23,261
Let me tell you.

260
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,562
There's a vas deferens.

261
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,015
Oh.

262
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,929
Corky Butterfield told me
that one back in the day.

263
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:32,069
Good old Corky.

264
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,872
Blew a gasket in the latrine

265
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,523
at Soldier's Field.

266
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,009
Met his maker
with his pants down.

267
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,728
Metz.

268
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:43,547
And sometimes, you have
to step back to reassess.

269
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,684
Hell of a lot
easier to take stock

270
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,836
from a nice, puffy
blimp than an F-16.

271
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:52,223
Right?

272
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,042
It's the first mature breakup

273
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:55,209
of my entire life.

274
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,544
Oh, congratulations.

275
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:57,979
No histrionics, no yelling.

276
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,848
We just saw the
situation, we addressed it.

277
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:01,928
Right. Now, how'd she take it?

278
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:03,184
Well, she's hurting, you know,

279
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:04,936
but she's going to
get over it in time.

280
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,251
Mm-hmm. What time you got?

281
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:11,976
Mark?

282
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,323
I'd like you to meet Jay Musoff

283
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,325
Whit Haskell, Monica Campbell

284
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,483
Alex Ghandar, Matt
Collins and Leslie Wu.

285
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,763
Hello. Hi.

286
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,088
I've prepared an
introductory packet

287
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,201
to our emergency
medicine program.

288
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,958
You can refer to it
throughout the day.

289
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,495
The ER may appear chaotic,
but if you watch closely

290
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,164
you'll see a carefully
organized system at work.

291
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,900
I thought that I would
take Jay, Whit and Monica.

292
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,967
Fine.

293
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,064
We'll start with the
admissions desk

294
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,121
and go from there.

295
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,422
If you want to follow

296
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,424
at a ten-minute
stagger, feel free.

297
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,425
Right.

298
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,094
The heart of any emergency room

299
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,361
is the admit desk.

300
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,131
Information is the blood
that courses through it

301
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,867
and the desk clerk is
like the tricuspid valve,

302
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,968
if you will.

303
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,037
So, you guys want
to play doctor?

304
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,839
Let's go.

305
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,577
I chase number one,
lose him down an alley

306
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:06,281
I come back just in
time to catch number two

307
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,883
bleeding my partner
here with a cheap .22.

308
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,919
He doesn't even have his gun out

309
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,520
so I capped the punk, twice.

310
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,022
You were lucky your partner

311
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:16,440
came back when he did.

312
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,558
Two rounds, two hits.

313
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,793
I couldn't believe it.

314
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,728
You should have
seen his face, Pete.

315
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,907
He was so surprised.

316
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,265
Like, what do you
think I was going to do,

317
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,266
give him a hug?

318
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,578
And then when
he saw the blood...

319
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,635
You have to go now.

320
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:28,703
He needs his rest.

321
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,315
Oh, I'll wait outside, Sarge.

322
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,673
No, no. Go on home.

323
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,252
No, no. I'll wait outside.

324
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,258
Peno!

325
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,259
Home.

326
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,127
Bring me a chocolate frosted

327
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,128
in the morning.

328
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,513
He can do that, right?

329
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:41,627
If he gets a dozen for us.

330
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,729
All right, take care.

331
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:46,421
Yeah.

332
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,506
Talkative.

333
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,519
Ten months out of the academy

334
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,354
he thinks he's Dirty Harry.

335
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,029
Why didn't you shoot back?

336
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:56,981
32 years on the force.

337
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,382
I've fired twice

338
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,250
outside the practice range.

339
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,886
A cop who won't use his gun.

340
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:02,949
That's a first.

341
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,422
Your arm okay?

342
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,910
Yeah, yeah. It's
just a little sore.

343
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,195
Carol, can I speak
to you a minute?

344
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,381
Be right back.

345
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:17,551
We got a situation here.

346
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:18,998
Well, I spoke to Mary Cain

347
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,666
and she says she doesn't know

348
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,655
who leaked it.

349
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:22,991
And you believed her?

350
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:23,992
Yeah, I did.

351
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,860
We had an agreement on the table

352
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,795
to protect current
staffing levels

353
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,430
and management just pulled it.

354
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:30,798
They're going to use this

355
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,600
to renege on the whole contract.

356
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,253
I'm sorry to hear that.

357
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,237
You had no idea

358
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:38,134
they were going to use
this incident against us?

359
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,657
No, I didn't.

360
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,877
What? You think
I'm lying to you?

361
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:45,112
I don't know anymore, Carol.

362
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,331
You and management
can fight and scream

363
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,934
and tear each other's
hair out, for all I care.

364
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:50,969
I've got a patient.

365
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,362
Most interns send their samples
to the lab without knowing

366
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,409
what happens once they're there.

367
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,834
Let's pretend that we're a
urine sample and find out.

368
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,168
Okay. Let's see.

369
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,737
Scalded foot in curtain two.

370
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,506
That looks promising. This way.

371
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,073
Mark, I've got a
25-year-old male...

372
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,776
Headaches, insomnia,
behavioral tics.

373
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:15,910
His wife brought him in.

374
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,344
He's pretty young for a stroke.

375
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,679
What do you think?

376
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,515
Encephalitis or a mass lesion.

377
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,160
Could be. Let's do a CT first.

378
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:23,996
Who's on for Infectious Disease?

379
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,152
Greg Fischer.

380
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:26,331
Get him down. Okay.

381
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,822
Oh, hello, Dr. Greene.

382
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,735
Sasha, what a pleasant surprise.

383
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,787
Sasha's one of our five-star
chefs in the cafeteria.

384
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,739
So what's today's special?

385
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:34,728
Bratwurst.

386
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:35,896
Idiot busboy

387
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,216
carries out bin of hot water.

388
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,533
Shoom!

389
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,868
Right down my boot.

390
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,120
Pretty nasty.

391
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,788
Normally, I'd amputate

392
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,951
but I'm afraid you'd
put it on the menu.

393
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:47,620
All right, Alex. First step.

394
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:48,776
Assess the burn.

395
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,389
Leslie, what do you think?

396
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,712
Partial thickness

397
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,292
and there's a small blister

398
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:54,727
below the medial malleolus.

399
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,395
Good. Matt, what's next?

400
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,385
Uh, 100 of Demerol for the pain.

401
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,455
Then debride any broken blisters

402
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,973
Thermazine dressing.

403
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,958
Correct.

404
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:06,394
You snip, you dress

405
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,679
and you give the Demerol.

406
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,748
I thought we were taking a tour.

407
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,750
Consider it interactive.

408
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,787
I'll check in on you later.

409
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,923
Let me know if
you need anything.

410
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,091
Thanks.

411
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,259
Hey...

412
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,228
Regards to Kenny.

413
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,595
Will do.

414
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,531
You two know each other?

415
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,711
Yeah. I picked up
her cousin for B&E.

416
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,535
She doesn't seem to mind.

417
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,015
No. Best thing that
ever happened to him.

418
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,506
He's just like this
kid who got shot...

419
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,476
Young and scared and
gangs putting the heat on him.

420
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,960
What happened to him?

421
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:41,829
I got him into a work program.

422
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:43,430
You know what he is now?

423
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,648
A locksmith.

424
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,505
They used to have these dances
here called blue and whites.

425
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,557
You know, cops and nurses.

426
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,725
Lot of marriages
came out of that.

427
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,905
Yeah?

428
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,022
Yours, too?

429
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,179
No.

430
00:14:58,214 --> 00:14:59,947
For me, it was always the job.

431
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,127
You were probably
just a lousy dancer.

432
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,352
Hey, if I didn't have
this hole in my leg

433
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,354
I could show you a turn or two.

434
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,322
Thanks. I'll take a rain check.

435
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,219
Do you know why so many nurses

436
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,708
end up with cops?

437
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,529
Similar schedule?

438
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:17,732
Shared appreciation
for life's vicissitudes.

439
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,867
That's beautiful.

440
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,386
Thanks.

441
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,237
I stole it myself.

442
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,358
Too much coffee.

443
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,894
Has that happened before today?

444
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,762
Hey, give me a break. I'm 58.

445
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,197
I can't have the shakes

446
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,266
after I get shot?

447
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,602
I thought only the
scheduling nurse

448
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,721
was allowed to change the board.

449
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:42,150
I like to erase my own
surgery when I'm done.

450
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,086
Gives me a sense
of accomplishment.

451
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,576
What are you up to?

452
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,061
I'm presenting

453
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,996
at firm conference with Benton.

454
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,448
There's a name I haven't
seen up here in a while.

455
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,934
Been a little slow lately.

456
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,813
There's a
splenectomy that's open

457
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:55,948
5:00 with Crosby.

458
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,249
Why don't you
sign him up for it?

459
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:00,441
Oh, he usually signs
up for his own surgery.

460
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,827
Just because Peter's
stuck in neutral

461
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,424
doesn't mean you have to be.

462
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,548
I'm doing a
Portacaval shunt later.

463
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:08,727
Care to join me?

464
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:09,751
I'd love to...

465
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,938
But I don't know what
Benton has planned.

466
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,024
Judging by this, not much.

467
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,441
Hi. I'm Dr. Ross.

468
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,442
Uh, Lisa Sayler.

469
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:35,887
This is my son, Benny.

470
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,378
You work at the hospital?

471
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,524
Yeah, upstairs in ICU.

472
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:40,659
I usually bring
him to the clinic

473
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,217
but I really didn't
want to wait this time.

474
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,552
Okay, what happened?

475
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,886
I'm not sure.

476
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,556
He was in the backyard,
and he hurt his elbow.

477
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,618
Benny, can you do this?

478
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,242
Can you straighten out
your arm like that for me?

479
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,078
You have to use
his special name.

480
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,546
Which is?

481
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,382
Right now, it's Clark Kent.

482
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,150
Hello. Hi, Clark.

483
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,130
Hey. All right. Let me straighten
your arm out just here a little bit.

484
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,671
Does that hurt?

485
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,038
It's okay. All right.

486
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,119
All right, we're going to
have to get some x rays.

487
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:09,020
Anybody here have x-ray vision?

488
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,189
Uh, no? Okay.

489
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,890
Well, we'll get Radiology

490
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,380
to take a look at it.

491
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,316
No idea how this happened?

492
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:18,202
No. I wasn't there, but I
think he was trying to fly.

493
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,834
Ghandar, <i>Jeopardy</i> time.

494
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:24,269
Tenderness in the
anatomic snuff box

495
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,422
indicates this common fracture.

496
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,079
What is first metacarpal?

497
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,742
Navicular.

498
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,566
I should try that
on<i> my</i> students.

499
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:33,901
I teach third grade.

500
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,080
Really? Nice.

501
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,737
Ow.

502
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:39,523
Heather, you have a
medial collateral ligament tear

503
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,242
otherwise known as
Gamekeeper's Thumb.

504
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,729
Playing goalie is
hell on a manicure.

505
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,946
Hockey?

506
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,214
Water polo.

507
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:48,182
Coed.

508
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,750
Sounds rough.

509
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,353
Last year, I took a
point-blank shot to the face.

510
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:55,122
Fractured my left orbit.

511
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,291
It's a Singles League...

512
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,642
Swim and mingle.

513
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,645
The guys I've met there

514
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,964
they're tough on the outside,
but emotionally, they're wimps.

515
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,383
I guess my type is more...

516
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,353
the reverse.

517
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:18,880
Need some help?

518
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,047
No, thanks.

519
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,894
But I did want to talk to you

520
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:23,495
about that cop, Mattimore.

521
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,385
Oh, isn't he great?

522
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,287
My dad says he's a
real legend on the force.

523
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:27,566
His right hand has a twitch.

524
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,556
No head trauma, no
focal deficits, right?

525
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:30,736
Right.

526
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,226
It's probably nerves.

527
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:34,173
I'd like a head CT to be sure.

528
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,092
The way his hand moves...
something about it bothers me.

529
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,684
I can't order a $1,000
test without indications.

530
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,563
I think it's recurring,
he's trying to hide it.

531
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,703
I'll do a neuro exam.

532
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,538
If something shows
up, we'll scan him.

533
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,624
Thanks.

534
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,812
Accommodation without
direct response to light.

535
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,281
Argyll Robertson.

536
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:54,459
Mrs. Patterson...

537
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:55,616
Cindy.

538
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,062
Cindy, how long
ago did did you notice

539
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,814
the change in Mike's behavior?

540
00:18:58,838 --> 00:18:59,970
About a month ago

541
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,706
I found him down in the kitchen

542
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,507
at 3:00 am talking to himself.

543
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,754
There's a possibility
you have a low-grade

544
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,956
infection in your
central nervous system.

545
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,658
I'd like to do a spinal tap.

546
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,482
Uh... that sounds painful.

547
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,762
We give you plenty
of local anesthetic.

548
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,431
Takes about five minutes.

549
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,015
Jeanie, can you get
an LP tray, please?

550
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,175
Jeanie. I'm sorry.

551
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,843
I've been meaning to call you.

552
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,160
That's okay. I
didn't expect you to.

553
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:28,199
Hey, Dr. Benton.

554
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,167
3:00 conference.
Thank you, Carter.

555
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,847
Which leaves us plenty of time

556
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,515
for a splenectomy at 5:00.

557
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,184
We'll be in and out by 6:30.

558
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,842
You signed me up for
surgery without my permission?

559
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,688
Crosby needs someone to assist.

560
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,191
He does great work and
I know he respects yours.

561
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,692
Take it off. What?

562
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,849
My name, take it off the board.

563
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,646
It's too late. There's
not enough time.

564
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,110
Someone's going
to have to cancel.

565
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,535
The only sign of
fracture is the fat pad.

566
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,157
Very slight.

567
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,493
Will he need a cast?

568
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,172
I think the splint
is going to be fine.

569
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,174
It should be healed
in three or four weeks.

570
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,831
Can I talk to you outside?

571
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,165
Yeah.

572
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,001
We're gonna be right back, okay?

573
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,369
You just hang here.

574
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,524
Has he always been
this uncommunicative?

575
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,479
My, uh... my husband
died five months ago

576
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,214
in a car accident.

577
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,535
He was taking Benny
to get an ice cream cone.

578
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,970
Was Benny hurt?

579
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,166
No...

580
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,151
But it took about ten minutes

581
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,370
for the ambulance to get there.

582
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,874
Benny watched his father die.

583
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,747
I'm sorry.

584
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:36,333
Um... so when he
started to pretend

585
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,268
that he was Superman

586
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,804
I just... I thought
it was healthy

587
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,306
a way of coping.

588
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,891
I got him that
costume for Halloween.

589
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,477
Now he wears it every
day under his clothes.

590
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,929
Do you know Lyle Baker?

591
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,731
He's a child psychiatrist;
one of the best.

592
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,599
I want to have him
come down for a consult

593
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:53,934
see what he thinks.

594
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,119
Okay.

595
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,453
Yeah? Okay.

596
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,855
Benny?

597
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,858
Benny?

598
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,181
Benny, come out, please.

599
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:10,784
How long will it take to heal?

600
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,830
About six weeks.

601
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,587
There go the playoffs.

602
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:17,441
I don't know what I'm
going to do with myself.

603
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,876
Would you like to
go out sometime?

604
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:26,500
Uh... that brings up
an interesting issue.

605
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,352
Wu, are doctors

606
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,021
supposed to date patients?

607
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,939
Uh, definitely not.

608
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,791
For my protection, right?

609
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,127
Right.

610
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,646
I mean, what if you
weren't my doctor?

611
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,064
Then it's hypothetical.

612
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,017
When do you get off?

613
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,303
6:00.

614
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,855
So, hypothetically

615
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,759
if I were at Finch's bar
on Dearborn tonight at 6:30

616
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:55,212
and you just happened to
come in and have a drink,

617
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,014
that would be legal, right?

618
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,235
Hypothetically... if I
weren't your doctor.

619
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,920
Hmm...

620
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:06,707
You know, this thumb
is starting to hurt again.

621
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,159
I think I'd like to
see a specialist.

622
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:14,093
Sorry.

623
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:16,383
Have you ever seen
an abscess this big?

624
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,745
Never. It's extraordinary.

625
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,715
Mr. Cliff, how did this happen?

626
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,706
I'm building a cabin up north.

627
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,741
No plumbing yet;
just an outhouse.

628
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,693
I sat down on the seat
without noticing the ice.

629
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,528
Ooh, when I stood up...

630
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:31,531
That would account
for the wide extension.

631
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,551
We need to drain.

632
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,152
11 blade.

633
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,784
Not to worry, Mr. Cliff.

634
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:41,041
Relief is on the way.

635
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,879
Hey, my two favorite ladies.

636
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,493
Still trying to charm us?

637
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:49,517
And they said man
would never fly.

638
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:50,768
Now they have

639
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,702
Air Jordan on a mission to Mars.

640
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,171
Nurse Hathaway told me

641
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,773
about the problem you're
having with your hand.

642
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,142
She did, did she?

643
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,477
I'm sure it's nothing serious,

644
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,729
but I'd like to do a
simple neurological exam.

645
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:03,931
So what I want you to do

646
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,744
is squeeze my
fingers when I say so.

647
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:08,352
I got shot in the leg.

648
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,121
The rest of me is fine.

649
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,190
We just want to make sure.

650
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,174
No, thanks.

651
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,486
It'll only take a minute.

652
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,576
I don't want it.

653
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:17,828
It's for your own good.

654
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,263
I said I don't want it.

655
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:26,653
The man doesn't want it.

656
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:36,697
Carla?

657
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:39,200
Hey.

658
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,202
What are you doing here?

659
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:42,886
Waiting.

660
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,221
What's wrong?

661
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,889
Are you sick? What's wrong?

662
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,859
No. We should
probably talk later, Peter.

663
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,193
Carla Reese.

664
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,372
That's me.

665
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,530
Dr. Coburn will see you now.

666
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,365
Coburn? OB?

667
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,713
Peter, I will call you later.

668
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,036
No, no, no.

669
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,537
Whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa.

670
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,872
What's up?

671
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,373
Are you pregnant?

672
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,909
Later, all right?

673
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,196
When Kerry asked
me to talk to you

674
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,887
about our program, I thought,

675
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,990
"What's a grizzled old
mucketymuck such as yours truly

676
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:22,760
have to say to the next
generation of sawbones?"

677
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,294
And then I realized, nope.

678
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,830
Everyone has a tale
to tell, and mine begins

679
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,376
in a cold, little farmhouse

680
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,711
in Hoobane, North Dakota.

681
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,014
Pa Morgenstern worked
at the local tannery

682
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:33,548
and Ma was a taxidermist...

683
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,039
How are they holding up?

684
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,440
Stick a fork in 'em...
They've been Weavered.

685
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,842
Still no sign of Superman, Doc.

686
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,443
Thanks, Malik, keep looking.

687
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,845
What is that smell?

688
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,358
Bratwurst on the house.

689
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,150
Compliments of
Sasha, the cafeteria guy.

690
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,363
Yeah, remind me
not to cure him again.

691
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,531
So, what do you think?

692
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,954
About you dating a patient?

693
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,690
Do the words Exxon<i>
Valdez</i> ring a bell?

694
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,024
Yeah. I'm still holding.

695
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,170
You should talk.

696
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,827
This is new territory for you.

697
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,628
It takes time to learn
how to read the signs.

698
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,143
I know the difference between
dependence and mutual attraction.

699
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,666
So, what are you
going to do about it?

700
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,046
Doyle. Gamekeeper's
thumb in four.

701
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,414
Check the splint, if it's
set, you discharge her.

702
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,738
Roger that.

703
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,073
Lisa? Yeah, not yet.

704
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,919
I know he didn't
get past security

705
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,609
so he's still in the building.

706
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,944
No. No, you stay put.

707
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,612
He knows where you're working.

708
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,848
He'll probably be
heading your way, okay?

709
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,416
Great. Bye.

710
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,285
When I held that dying
mole rat in my hand

711
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,199
when I felt its little heart

712
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,250
pitter-pattering in my hands...

713
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,424
Do you see it?

714
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,426
It's glowing...
Looks like syphilis.

715
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,661
Wow. Neurosyphilis.

716
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,997
I'm surprised.

717
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,799
Imagine how surprised
Mrs. Patterson's going to be.

718
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,467
How are we going to tell them?

719
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,103
We don't tell them.

720
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,282
We tell<i> him.</i>

721
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,438
And not her?

722
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,617
It's his disease.

723
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,853
We can't violate
his right to privacy.

724
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,045
Oh, and she has no rights
except the right to be infected?

725
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,391
Why don't I talk to him?

726
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,547
He's my patient.

727
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,516
I just asked you
down on a consult.

728
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,045
I appreciate that, but
this is a tricky situation

729
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:55,831
and I have more
experience in these matters.

730
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,833
It's my field. I've dealt with
these situations hundreds of times.

731
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,652
This kind of thing
can kill a marriage.

732
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:02,092
So can silence.

733
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,183
Dr. Carter?

734
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,362
Are you aware of the time?

735
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,885
Yes. I was waiting
for Dr. Benton

736
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,387
to go over some of these notes.

737
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,367
The entire surgical
staff is already here.

738
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,223
Right.

739
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,242
Any time now, doctor.

740
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,016
So, uh...

741
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,986
When were you going to tell me?

742
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,999
When I knew I had
something to tell.

743
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,357
You know, both my
sisters had miscarriages

744
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,859
during the first trimesters.

745
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:53,193
What did Coburn say?

746
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:55,707
Well, she said that it
was just some spotting

747
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:57,008
and that, you know

748
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,810
there was nothing
to worry about.

749
00:26:58,834 --> 00:26:59,978
All systems go.

750
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:01,534
Carla, I don't understand.

751
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,936
I mean, we were careful.

752
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:06,117
Well, it's like they say,
nothing is 100% effective.

753
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:09,409
And you're sure it's mine?

754
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,289
I'm going to forget
you said that.

755
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:12,858
I'm just going to lay it all

756
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,926
on the stress and
the surprise, okay?

757
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,083
Carla, I'm sorry.

758
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:17,417
Look, honey, I don't...

759
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:19,219
What am I supposed to say?

760
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:20,554
Look.

761
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,939
We're two very
different people, Peter

762
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,274
and Lord knows

763
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,878
we both have enough
going on in our lives.

764
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,264
Look...

765
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:35,468
I've made the choice, Peter...

766
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:38,372
to have this baby.

767
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,375
All right, uh...

768
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,012
What do you expect
from me, Carla?

769
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,191
The truth.

770
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:49,283
You've always been
really honest with me.

771
00:27:49,318 --> 00:27:51,878
It's one of your
finer qualities.

772
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:55,755
I got to get back to work.

773
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:59,959
I'll... I'll... call
you, all right?

774
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:02,846
Sure.

775
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,819
<i>You can adjust these</i>

776
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,036
if they're too short.

777
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:12,205
We'll probably
discharge you today.

778
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,207
Thought you could
use the practice.

779
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:15,709
Stop being so nice.

780
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,839
Makes me feel even more foolish

781
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,741
for speaking the way I did.

782
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,976
You know, when
I was in the alley

783
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,178
with the kid, Hernandez...

784
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,738
I've had guns pulled
on me a dozen times.

785
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,773
This wasn't a hard guy.

786
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,059
This was a kid
caught in the deep end.

787
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:35,106
30 more seconds,
he drops that piece

788
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,491
we both walk out of there.

789
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,465
What happened?

790
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,601
My hand jerked.

791
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,922
He thought I was
going for my gun.

792
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,540
In a second, he had to decide

793
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:48,558
whether he
wanted to live or die.

794
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,261
Does anyone else
know about your hand?

795
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,441
You mean, like the department?

796
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,294
They'd put me in the mail room.

797
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,562
Then who deals with
the next stupid kid

798
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,682
who panics and pulls a piece?

799
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,506
Some hotshot like Peno?

800
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,741
You need to get it checked out.

801
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,176
What is it?

802
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,147
Is it Parkinson's, is
it a brain tumor, or...?

803
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,131
I don't know

804
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,283
but those are
treatable disorders.

805
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,652
You could have years
to teach the Penos

806
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,970
to be better cops.

807
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,321
Or I could be here

808
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,074
lying flat on my back,
stuck full of tubes.

809
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,770
Well, at least, let
me do a CAT scan...

810
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,143
Find out what's going on.

811
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,046
I'll tell you what, angel.

812
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,981
I'll think about it, okay?

813
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,849
Good.

814
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,103
The Aortagram confirms

815
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,605
the unilateral renal
artery stenosis

816
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,042
and treatment was via
an aortorenal bypass graft

817
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,744
using a segment of
the saphenous vein.

818
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,949
Now, discussing the
causes and evaluation

819
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:50,821
of surgical hypertension
will be my colleague...

820
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,839
Dr. Peter Benton.

821
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,232
Except that he was detained

822
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:07,771
which is why he asked me
to s-s... uh, stand in for him.

823
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,792
The surgically correctable
causes of hypertension

824
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:14,327
include coarctation
of the aorta,

825
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:17,897
Cushing's syndrome and,
uh, pheochromocytoma.

826
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,761
What about Conn's syndrome?

827
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,484
And Conn's syndrome, of course.

828
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,020
And Hyperaldosteronism?

829
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,022
That, too.

830
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,192
Wasn't a trial of a
drug therapy warranted

831
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,561
before surgical intervention
was undertaken?

832
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,197
The surgery carries a
one percent mortality rate.

833
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,531
I see your point.

834
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,118
What were the results
of the renal renin assays?

835
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:39,230
They were high.
They were very high.

836
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,481
Of course, but
what was the ratio

837
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,056
of the affected to
the unaffected side?

838
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,645
That I don't know.

839
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,920
Obviously not.

840
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:56,652
So... uh...

841
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,955
Hey, anyone know
the difference between

842
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,574
a prostate and a garden hose?

843
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,892
Leave her alone!

844
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,407
Shut up! I ought to slap
some manners into you.

845
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,730
Hey, you got no...

846
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,109
Hey! What are you
doing? Let go of him!

847
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,033
I am trying to talk
to my lady, here.

848
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,202
This kid starts
kicking me in the leg.

849
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,537
You were being mean to her!

850
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,217
Sit down! Sit down and relax!

851
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,807
Call ICU, tell Lisa
Sayler we found her son

852
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,443
and get security down here.

853
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,155
What is that? <i>What is that!?</i>

854
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,479
What are you doing?

855
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,880
He was being mean to her.

856
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,927
Yeah, well, he could have
been mean to you, too.

857
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,262
No, he couldn't.
Yes, he could have.

858
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:28,963
No, he couldn't because
I have super powers.

859
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,099
Benny, you don't
have super powers.

860
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,456
You are a six-year-old boy.

861
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,752
You live with your
mother in Hyde Park.

862
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:38,345
Benny... you cannot fly

863
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,158
and you cannot attack grown men

864
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:42,427
who are arguing
with their girlfriend.

865
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:43,594
You understand?

866
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,085
Hey, are you listening to me?

867
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,841
How's it going?

868
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,543
Hey, somebody
who will talk to me.

869
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,678
You must not have
gotten the memo.

870
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,013
I read the paper.

871
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,348
You hanging in there?

872
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,682
By a thread.

873
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,818
The nurses think
I'm Benedict Arnold.

874
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:05,088
Management's using my
mistake to make the RNs look bad.

875
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,340
You're in a tough spot.

876
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,941
Yeah.

877
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:11,061
You know, I should
probably just go

878
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,112
to the<i> Sun Times</i>
myself, tell them

879
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:15,731
the death had nothing
to do with the sick-out.

880
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,900
Then what happens?

881
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,019
I don't know.

882
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:21,738
Lose my job, maybe?

883
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,373
You ready for that?

884
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,515
Good news?

885
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,861
Mrs. Patterson, I'm going to need
to speak to your husband alone.

886
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,652
Why? What's wrong?

887
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,700
Jeanie, will you show Mrs.
Patterson to the waiting room?

888
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:39,950
No. I want to stay
with you, Mike.

889
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:41,958
Does she have to go?

890
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,659
Only if that's what you want.

891
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:44,661
Mike I want to stay.

892
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,762
No, I want her to stay.

893
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:49,683
Mr. Patterson, this is
sensitive information.

894
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,234
It can be very
difficult to hear.

895
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,869
I want my wife
here with me, okay?

896
00:32:54,756 --> 00:32:57,140
All right... if that's
your decision.

897
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:02,061
Our tests show that
you have neurosyphilis.

898
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:05,114
It's a disease that can cause
mild personality disorders

899
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,078
like the ones you've
been suffering.

900
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:08,251
Syphilis?

901
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,469
Neurosyphilis.

902
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,099
It's sexually transmitted.

903
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,284
But that doesn't mean it
was contracted recently.

904
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:15,486
It takes an average of seven
years for symptoms to arise

905
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,110
after the initial infection.

906
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:18,561
Seven years?

907
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,830
But we've been together
since high school.

908
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,699
We've always been
committed to each other

909
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,736
from the day we met, to the
day we got married, to now.

910
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,148
We can treat you
with IV antibiotics

911
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,316
and check Cindy for exposure.

912
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,867
In two weeks, you'll
be as good as new.

913
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,035
This is impossible.

914
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:32,808
We've only been with each other.

915
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,328
Cindy...?

916
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,516
Cindy?

917
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,719
I'm s... I'm sorry.

918
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:00,253
We've got a
35-year-old male, MVA.

919
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:02,133
Car skidded into a light pole.

920
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:04,635
ALOC, multiple lacs,
GCS 8 at the scene.

921
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,905
BP's 90/60, pulse
110 and irregular.

922
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:08,628
Passenger space intrusion.

923
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:11,031
We had to use the
jaws to get him out.

924
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,365
Extrication time?

925
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,611
Approximately 20 minutes.

926
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,645
No witnesses, no ID.

927
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:15,936
Clear, people... stay back.

928
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,270
Dr. Greene?

929
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,616
Yeah. Yeah. Come with me.

930
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,242
15 Liters O2, two IVs
normal saline, one liter in.

931
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,555
All right, everybody,
on my count...

932
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:25,712
One, two, three.

933
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:27,047
Go.

934
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:29,082
Ghandar, cardiac monitor.

935
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:30,416
What do you see?

936
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:31,562
Looks like PVCs.

937
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,019
Pupils are sluggish.

938
00:34:33,055 --> 00:34:34,304
Good bilateral

939
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,483
breath sounds.

940
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,340
Lidocaine, 100, IV push.

941
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,909
Start a drip at two migs.

942
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,321
Should they be in here?

943
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,778
My students, my call.

944
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:45,582
Get a CBC, chem 20, enzymes,
type and cross for four units.

945
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,750
Pulse ox 95.

946
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:47,967
OD in curtain four.

947
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,281
We got a gusher...
pressure dressing.

948
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:51,771
Piggyback a gram of Ancef.

949
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:52,789
He's in fib.

950
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,985
Charge 200.

951
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,186
Wu, put gloves on.

952
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,838
You ever bring
somebody back to life?

953
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:57,827
No.

954
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,263
All right. Get over here.

955
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,316
Clear.

956
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,717
There you go.

957
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:06,952
Okay, charge to 300.

958
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:08,287
Clear.

959
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:11,641
Charging 360.

960
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:12,992
Clear.

961
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:15,295
Excellent.

962
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,563
Got a pulse.

963
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,531
All right, Collins.

964
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,217
Put in a foley.

965
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,497
Don't be shy, it's not yours.

966
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,987
Ghandar, glove up.

967
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:26,823
You're going to help me
with a peritoneal lavage.

968
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,708
Doug, how's that leg?

969
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:31,911
Nasty. He got the
popliteal artery.

970
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:36,249
Dr. Ross?

971
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:37,683
Yep?

972
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,102
Benny, what are
you doing in here?

973
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,258
Benny! Benny!

974
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:47,009
Haleh, get him out of
here, will you, please?

975
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,839
Come on, baby, Come on.

976
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:50,663
That's it, Come on.

977
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:52,565
Yeah, Come on.

978
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,952
More 4 x 4s, grab a five-inch...

979
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:07,714
Where were you?

980
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:09,683
Uh... firm conference.

981
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:10,895
Yeah, the firm conference.

982
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,097
I got crucified in
there covering for you.

983
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:14,788
Yeah, well, you
shouldn't have tried.

984
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:16,422
I didn't have a choice.

985
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,469
We were supposed
to do it together

986
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,521
and you left me
twisting in the wind.

987
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,189
Not to mention
trashing my reputation

988
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,925
in front of every
surgeon in this hospital.

989
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,027
Carter, I'm sorry, all
right? Something came up.

990
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,845
You're sorry. Something came up.

991
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,269
That's your excuse?

992
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:31,104
Yeah. Right.

993
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:32,750
I've got a shunt with Hicks.

994
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,168
Would you do me a favor?

995
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,320
The next time that
you feel the urge

996
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,621
to ruin my career

997
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,885
I would appreciate a warning.

998
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,095
Tom Clayton?

999
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,374
Carol Hathaway?

1000
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:57,630
Yeah.

1001
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,510
You want something
to eat, coffee?

1002
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:00,967
No. No, thank you.

1003
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,803
So, you're the nurse
manager in the ER.

1004
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:05,116
Is that right?

1005
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,984
Do you mind if I take notes?

1006
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:08,657
No.

1007
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,194
Is this going to
be on the record?

1008
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,280
Yes, it is.

1009
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,613
Here you go.

1010
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,705
Is that man going to die?

1011
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,307
Maybe. He was hurt pretty badly.

1012
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,778
Just like your dad, right?

1013
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:37,070
I was thinking about
what I said to you earlier

1014
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:38,471
and I was wrong.

1015
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,110
Okay, sometimes, when
you try to help somebody

1016
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,845
and you can't

1017
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,615
and it gets inside
you and it, and it twists

1018
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,817
and you... wonder why.

1019
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:54,754
You should do...

1020
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,789
what you think is right.

1021
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:58,424
And you don't let me

1022
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:00,638
or anybody else stop you.

1023
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:02,561
Okay?

1024
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,469
It's...

1025
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,204
been a long time.

1026
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:14,673
I can't remember if, uh,
Superman had a dad or not.

1027
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,227
But if he did, I
know that he was

1028
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,647
very, very proud of his son.

1029
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,723
Okay?

1030
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,426
Come here. Come here.

1031
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,915
Hey.

1032
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,004
I've never done this before.

1033
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,889
Really?

1034
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,836
This is exactly
the kind of thing

1035
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,327
you should be doing.

1036
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,730
So, should I be
worried about Peter?

1037
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,031
What do you mean?

1038
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,361
Don't play dumb,
Carter. It doesn't suit you.

1039
00:38:57,385 --> 00:39:01,571
Is his emotional state
impairing his surgical ability?

1040
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,191
No. Not that I've seen.

1041
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,857
I appreciate your loyalty.

1042
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,859
But I want you to know...

1043
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,350
If Peter can't use your talents

1044
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,885
my team can.

1045
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,073
Really? Are you serious?

1046
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,492
I'm almost always serious.

1047
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:26,312
I need Mr. Patterson's chart.

1048
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:28,181
Why's that?

1049
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:30,328
I couldn't convince him to stay.

1050
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:31,817
Tricky situation.

1051
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:33,253
Are you going to notify

1052
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,820
the Department of Health?

1053
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:35,821
It's the law.

1054
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:36,789
Well, why don't you wait

1055
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:38,358
a couple of days,
let them talk it out.

1056
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:39,959
I'll give him a call
and he'll probably

1057
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:41,161
come back in.

1058
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:42,907
Are you refusing
to give me his chart?

1059
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:46,415
It's my job to be an
advocate for my patients.

1060
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,010
It's your job to assist me.

1061
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,453
That's why it's called
"Physician Assistant."

1062
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:55,191
Are you always this
arrogant, or is it just me?

1063
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,612
It's just you.

1064
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:03,443
Look, I owe you an apology

1065
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,051
for the other night.

1066
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:07,487
Greg, you don't want to date
a woman who's HIV-positive.

1067
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,071
You don't owe me anything.

1068
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,673
Did you see me zap that guy?

1069
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,508
I had my hands inside his chest.

1070
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,043
Unbelievable.

1071
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,490
Thanks a lot.

1072
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,247
Thank you. Bye-bye.

1073
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,028
Well, I want to thank you two

1074
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,985
for taking care of our charges.

1075
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,653
What did you think?

1076
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,667
Well, frankly, I
was disappointed.

1077
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,836
I found a general
lack of enthusiasm

1078
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,159
inattention to detail.

1079
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,493
If I were you, Donald

1080
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,996
I would seriously
reevaluate their applications.

1081
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,598
Well, don't worry, Kerry

1082
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,166
because none of your students

1083
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,001
decided to apply
for the program.

1084
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,938
On the other hand, Mark,
all three of<i> your</i> candidates

1085
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,751
rank us as their top choice.

1086
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,153
You really reached
those kids today.

1087
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,427
You ever thought about
an academic appointment?

1088
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:50,179
There is a tenured
spot available.

1089
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,931
I never really thought about it.

1090
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,043
I think it's clear

1091
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,667
your place is on the faculty.

1092
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,868
Really?

1093
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:57,203
Absolutely.

1094
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:08,147
Carol...

1095
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:10,717
I just got a call from
a<i> Sun Times</i> reporter.

1096
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:13,669
He wanted me to confirm
some statements you made.

1097
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:14,832
I hope you did.

1098
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:16,133
They're all true.

1099
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:17,790
<i>Why</i> did you do it?

1100
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:20,793
If you have to ask, you
don't know me very well.

1101
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,461
I thought we were friends.

1102
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:24,330
No, Mary, you're my boss.

1103
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:25,698
I lost a patient.

1104
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,067
I can't hide that,
and I can't forget it.

1105
00:41:28,102 --> 00:41:29,468
Neither should you.

1106
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:31,148
Drummond wants to see you

1107
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:32,504
right away.

1108
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,199
Hicks offered me a
position on her team.

1109
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,172
I'm taking it.

1110
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,707
Effective Monday.

1111
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,327
Okay.

1112
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,147
You know, a month ago

1113
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,516
you would have
ripped my lungs out

1114
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,786
for going behind your
back to another surgeon.

1115
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:07,006
Now you just stand there?

1116
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:11,060
Since when did I start caring
about what you do, Carter?

1117
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:12,996
Never.

1118
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,271
But now, you don't
care about yourself.

1119
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,566
You don't care
about your reputation.

1120
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,611
I need an evaluation
before I can transfer

1121
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,529
to Hicks' team.

1122
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:33,832
You'll get it.

1123
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:44,109
You know, in that
surgery today...

1124
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,678
everything I did, you taught me.

1125
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,306
Saul, I'll try your winter ale.

1126
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,607
Yeah.

1127
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,682
Mark Greene.

1128
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:07,850
Heather Morgan.

1129
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,329
What happened to your thumb?

1130
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,686
Oh, it's a long story.

1131
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:12,788
I had to go to
the hospital for it.

1132
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,223
Saw this great doctor.

1133
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,136
I hope he took good care of you.

1134
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,127
<i>She,</i> actually.

1135
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,831
Can I ask you a
hypothetical question?

1136
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,178
I think we can dispense
with the hypotheticals.

1137
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,467
Absolutely.

1138
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,002
Did you order those?

1139
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,303
No, they're from

1140
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,490
table 14 in the back.

1141
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,261
You bring them everywhere?

1142
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,500
Haleh?

1143
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,569
These are the
shifts for next week.

1144
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:45,905
There's still a problem
with Wednesday.

1145
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,840
We only have six RNs scheduled,

1146
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,009
so you may need
to bring in a float.

1147
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:52,411
There's supply reqs, a
memo from Mary Cain

1148
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:54,513
and a note from
Buildings and Grounds

1149
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,516
that two of our parking
spaces have been reassigned.

1150
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,329
Don't go to the parking
firm. Go straight to Weber.

1151
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:01,348
We won on this last year

1152
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,550
but I think now,
they're getting serious.

1153
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,391
That's not my job.

1154
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:06,993
It is now.

1155
00:44:07,028 --> 00:44:08,861
I've been suspended.
