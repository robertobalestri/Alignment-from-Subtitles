1
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,367
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,567
What are you doing?

3
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,258
I didn't know you were in here.

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,437
Do you mind?

5
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,094
I thought you were at rounds.

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,207
What time is it?

7
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,530
6:35.

8
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,198
Oh... oh, God!

9
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,334
Anspaugh's going to kill me.

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,835
Where's my, uh...?

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,603
Give me my stethoscope.

12
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,839
Uh, here, take mine.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,833
Did you brush your teeth?

14
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,001
Yes, Dad.

15
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,336
Did you floss?

16
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:55,670
Yes, Dad!

17
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,672
All right, I was just checking.

18
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:00,242
See, I told you I could
make a good breakfast.

19
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,522
You're wearing your
Brownie uniform.

20
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:03,862
It's Thursday.

21
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:07,782
Was I supposed to
talk to your troop today?

22
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,584
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

23
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,869
I... I forgot to
change my shift.

24
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,921
You promised.

25
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:14,973
I have to work today.

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,703
Can I do it next week?

27
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,460
I knew you'd forget.

28
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,146
Listen, I don't have
to work Saturday.

29
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,950
How about we go to Six Flags...

30
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,225
Ride the roller coasters?

31
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,984
<i>Dr. Edson, present the case.</i>

32
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,654
The patient is fluid overloaded.

33
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,556
I gave her a Lasix sandwich

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,158
to reduce the ascites.

35
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,715
Dr. Carter,

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,683
how nice of you to join us.

37
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,902
What would you do
with Mrs. Pritzker?

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,303
What's her problem?

39
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,405
As Dr. Edson has
just finished saying,

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,407
she's fluid overloaded.

41
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,462
Well, I, uh, wouldn't
give her anything to drink.

42
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,130
Let's continue our discussion

43
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,425
of diuresis, shall we?

44
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,017
Carter, what electrolyte
imbalance can result

45
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,385
from giving Lasix?

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,653
Hypokalemia.

47
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,699
Where does Lasix
affect the kidney?

48
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,173
At the loop of Henle.

49
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,674
Ascending or descending limb?

50
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,442
Ascending.

51
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:08,560
Where does Lasix

52
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,596
get its name?

53
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,433
I don't know.

54
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,467
It lasts six hours.

55
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,869
Ah.

56
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,322
Dr. Ryke, present the next

57
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,207
patient, please.

58
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,886
It looks like we've got...

59
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,122
Man, what did he
have for breakfast?

60
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,479
Me.

61
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,043
Hey, Carol... hey! Good morning.

62
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,601
Says who?

63
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:35,582
Oh, guess I'm not going to
ask how your day's going.

64
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,071
I got my MCAT results.

65
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,240
And?

66
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,941
I never should
have taken the test.

67
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,076
I don't know what I
was thinking, you know.

68
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:43,889
That you wanted to be a doctor?

69
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,880
Why didn't you
talk me out of it?

70
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,382
How bad did you do?

71
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,983
I don't know,
haven't opened it yet.

72
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:50,963
Are you nuts? You got
to open the envelope.

73
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,020
No, I'm just not in the
mood for any bad news.

74
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,888
Okay, I know, yeah.

75
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,801
I tell you what... I'll
open that envelope.

76
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:56,808
Doug! Give it back!

77
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,528
Hey, does anybody
have a letter opener here?

78
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:01,508
Come on, Doug...
Doug, don't you dare.

79
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:02,464
Doug...

80
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,543
Good morning, Dr. Einstein.

81
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,466
Einstein?

82
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,400
Excuse me?

83
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,068
I guess we'll have to move fast

84
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,970
to beat out the
other med schools.

85
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:10,305
What?

86
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,574
Your MCATs... I'm on
the Admissions Committee.

87
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,075
They sent us your scores.

88
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,944
Now, look, don't
consider the Ivy League

89
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,146
until you've taken a
good look at our program.

90
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,881
We'll talk later...
Maybe lunch, huh?

91
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:22,083
Oh, my God.

92
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,585
85th percentile.

93
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,253
Oh, my God.

94
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,267
Looks like Carol Hathaway
is going to medical school.

95
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:24,423
So you disappointed
the Brownies.

96
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,914
I blew it... I forgot
I had to work.

97
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,593
Tough being a
doctor and a daddy.

98
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,084
That's what Jen used to say.

99
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,585
I rest my case.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,221
Mark, I put you on the schedule
for Saturday 7:00 to 7:00.

101
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:34,734
I can't... I've got
plans with Rachel.

102
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:35,891
There's no one else.

103
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:37,737
Walters and Foster
are on vacation.

104
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:38,905
At the same time?

105
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,395
Mark approved the schedule.

106
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,396
Can't you cover for me?

107
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:42,764
I've got the graveyard.

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,080
You blew it again.

109
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,847
Put the lancet in the pen.

110
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,516
Put your finger on this end
and then push the trigger.

111
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,073
Okay, is this
absolutely necessary?

112
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:54,220
Yeah, when you have
gestational diabetes,

113
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:56,677
you need to test your
blood four times a day.

114
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,179
Just get it over with.

115
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,381
Ow.

116
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,044
Okay, now, after you
calibrate the machine,

117
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,111
then you put in a strip

118
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,295
and apply a drop of blood

119
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,464
and wait for a reading.

120
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:05,786
Slow down.

121
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,367
Now, a blood glucose of 120

122
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,373
is where you want to be.

123
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,708
160 is too much.

124
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,211
Anything under 80
means you need to eat.

125
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,891
You want me to write that down?

126
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,281
No, no, no, no... I got it.

127
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,499
Okay... 210.

128
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,178
All right, you need
a shot of insulin.

129
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,352
Where is it?

130
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,986
The nurse is bringing it.

131
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,923
She'll be here in an hour?

132
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,491
No, she's going
to be here at 10:00.

133
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,177
Okay.

134
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,711
You'll be fine.

135
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,731
All right.

136
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,133
I got to go.

137
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,802
Already?

138
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,037
Yeah, I'm late for work.

139
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,309
Just go.

140
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,285
Hey, Carol, they need
a puke cleanup in 3.

141
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,430
Why, thank you, Jerry.

142
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,188
Your puke-cleaning
days are nearly over.

143
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,900
Reason enough to
go to medical school.

144
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,235
Who's going to medical school?

145
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,570
Carol.

146
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,893
She hit a home run on her MCATs.

147
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,239
No kidding... congratulations.

148
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,330
Don't forget us when
you're in the big house.

149
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,798
I haven't even applied yet.

150
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,193
Jerry, what are you doing?

151
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,784
I saw a mouse by the elevator...

152
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,952
soon to be deceased.

153
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:12,286
Sounds like Heidi.

154
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:14,162
Dr. Russell in the genetics lab

155
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,357
lost one of his
gene-knockout founders.

156
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:17,592
His what?

157
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,393
A genetically-engineered mouse.

158
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,441
He said it's worth
half a million bucks.

159
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,597
You're kidding.

160
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,943
No, there's a $5,000 reward.

161
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,199
Dead or alive?

162
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,648
Alive... Jerry, it's
worthless if it's dead.

163
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:31,372
Carol, can you watch the phones?

164
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,307
It's not my job, Jerry.

165
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:34,676
Well, I'm on break.

166
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:38,591
Uh, no, no... doctors
don't do phones.

167
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,201
How were rounds?

168
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,514
I got massacred.

169
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,670
Anspaugh?

170
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,171
Exiled me down here.

171
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,319
Ever since I second-guessed him,

172
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,108
he's been out to get me.

173
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,477
What are you doing?

174
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,646
I'm practicing
laparoscopic maneuvers,

175
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,080
in case I ever get

176
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,748
back into surgery.

177
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,417
Cool... can I try?

178
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,597
Yeah.

179
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,920
Here.

180
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,567
Just put your hands
through those graspers,

181
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,124
and you're just
trying to stack the dice

182
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,637
one on top of the other.

183
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,794
This is tricky.

184
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,307
Wait till you try tying knots.

185
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,998
Carter... Benton
needs you in Trauma 2.

186
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,200
Mind if I tag along?

187
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,569
No, be my guest.

188
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,755
Hold still, Mrs. Meeks.

189
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,023
Looks like you've got

190
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,758
a small fishbone down there.

191
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:25,360
Jerry, turn off the light.

192
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:27,239
I can't... I'm
looking for Heidi.

193
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,230
We're the only ones in here.

194
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,565
Heidi's a mouse.

195
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,761
A mouse?

196
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,151
Yeah, a mutant mouse.

197
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,519
Jerry, we're in the
middle of an exam.

198
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,655
There it is.

199
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,285
Ah, Heidi.

200
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:40,659
Don't be afraid.

201
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,839
Uncle Jerry won't hurt you.

202
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,329
Hey!

203
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,780
What'd you do that for?

204
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:47,816
There you go.

205
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,151
Open wide.

206
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:53,265
Hey, Doug, how much did you
have to borrow for med school?

207
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,422
110 grand.

208
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,757
Oh, my God.

209
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,804
Well, how long did it
take you to pay it off?

210
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:00,161
Are you kidding? I'll be
paying it off for 15 years.

211
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:01,774
I've got a sick kid here.

212
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,275
He was asleep in his crib.

213
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,344
I couldn't wake him up.

214
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,333
How long was he down?

215
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:06,835
Two minutes.

216
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,181
Couldn't get an I.V...
Gave epi down the tube.

217
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,282
Excuse me.

218
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:11,784
Joel has a
hypoplastic left heart.

219
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,519
They put a Blalock
shunt in last month.

220
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:14,587
He was doing fine.

221
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:15,577
What's your name, ma'am?

222
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:16,577
Andrea Thompson.

223
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:17,662
One, two, three.

224
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,898
I'm Carol Hathaway;
this is Dr. Ross.

225
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,032
Give me an armboard

226
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,349
and a 22-gauge Angiocath.

227
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,418
I'll start an I.V.

228
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,164
His surgeon's name is Dr. Luce;

229
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,365
his cardiologist is Ferris;

230
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,800
and his pediatrician is Vargas.

231
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:30,408
Hook up a 12-lead
and get an echo.

232
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,071
He's on dig, Lasix
and potassium.

233
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,763
Chuny, would you escort
Mrs. Thompson out of here?

234
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,264
No, please, I want to stay.

235
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,431
Carol?

236
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,111
All right, but you
stay back there.

237
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,101
We need to work.

238
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:41,769
I'm in.

239
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:42,904
Bolus 100 of saline.

240
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,706
Did he clot off his shunt?

241
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:46,841
He may have.

242
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,092
Blood gas kit.

243
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,210
What's that for?

244
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,495
Ma'am, I don't have time

245
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,191
to explain everything
to you right now.

246
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,248
She shouldn't be in here.

247
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,295
It's her child.

248
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,535
Chuny, get this up to the lab.

249
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,540
<i>Bullet missed the spine.</i>

250
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:03,786
Renal artery is intact.

251
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,910
More four by fours...
He's still bleeding.

252
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,707
Let's hang another
unit of O-neg.

253
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,680
Dr. Benton, Carla
Reese on the phone.

254
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,316
She says it's an emergency.

255
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,461
When I'm done.

256
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,130
Damn, this isn't working.

257
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,281
Where's the source?

258
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,604
Soft tissue arterials.

259
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,800
Lost the BP.

260
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:18,940
Third unit's in.

261
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,141
He's bleeding out.

262
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:22,288
Maggie, get me a
Foley and some saline.

263
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,622
What are you going to do?

264
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,114
If I insert the Foley
and inflate the balloon,

265
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,483
the pressure might
stop the bleeding.

266
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:30,101
All right, do it.

267
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,886
Foley going in.

268
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:33,120
Inject the saline.

269
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,233
Coming right up.

270
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,207
Where did you learn
this one, Carter...

271
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,041
<i>Journal of Trauma?</i>

272
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,375
<i>People</i> magazine.

273
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,455
Story about a little girl
who got stuck in a well

274
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,740
trying to rescue her puppy.

275
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,108
Paramedic thought this up.

276
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,432
What happened to the puppy?

277
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:45,611
Don't ask.

278
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,101
He's coming around.

279
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:49,137
All right, let's get
him back over.

280
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,404
I got a pulse.

281
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,990
All right, people, let's
get him up to the OR.

282
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,626
Good work, Carter.

283
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,793
This the gunshot?

284
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,905
Yeah. We'll take it.

285
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,507
Can I scrub in? We've got it.

286
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,175
Actually, Carter
figured out a way

287
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,644
to tamponade the
bleed with a Foley.

288
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,945
He saved the guy's life.

289
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:03,934
Is that so?

290
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,069
Hold that elevator.

291
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,216
Edson, take his history
and get him prepped.

292
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,539
Let's go.

293
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,741
Can't win them all, Carter.

294
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,911
Man, are you in the doghouse.

295
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,981
Got the blood gas.

296
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,616
7.23, pO2 is 90.

297
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,984
Can't get a BP.

298
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,352
Lost his pulse.

299
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,121
What's wrong?

300
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,433
Chest tube, trays,
tension pneumo.

301
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,073
What are you doing?

302
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,859
Carol, what's happening?

303
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:28,943
His lung collapsed.

304
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,778
Well, what is he doing?

305
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,012
He's putting in a chest tube.

306
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,198
Why are you cutting him?

307
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,311
Carol, poke a Kelly
in here, will you?

308
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,455
I.V.'s infiltrated.

309
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,621
Have to do a femoral cutdown.

310
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,484
Will somebody tell me what
the hell is going on here?

311
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,601
Cutdown tray, please.

312
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,292
Carol...?

313
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,160
Come with me, Mrs. Thompson.

314
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,339
I'll explain it.

315
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,997
No, I want to stay with my baby.

316
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:50,977
Not now... the
doctor needs to work.

317
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,166
Come on.

318
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,774
We put a chest tube
in to re-expand his lung,

319
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,821
and now Dr. Ross
is giving Joel fluids

320
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,890
through a catheter in his leg.

321
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,447
When the doctor's
done, can I come back?

322
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,328
Yes, but right now, it's best
if you wait in here, okay?

323
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:14,355
If he gets sicker, come get me.

324
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,474
I don't want my
baby to die alone.

325
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,660
I will.

326
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,206
Jerry, what are those things?

327
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,541
They're humane traps.

328
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,053
I borrowed them from the lab.

329
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:36,255
We're trying to trap a mouse.

330
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,645
Can you move
them off the counter?

331
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,746
There's no place to work.

332
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,793
Why don't you just
call an exterminator?

333
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,551
Because the mouse in question
is worth a half a million bucks.

334
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,586
I got a hot one.

335
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,586
Uh, Brenda Smythe.

336
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,766
What's the problem?

337
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,867
Voilà.

338
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:49,390
My wife and I
were out camping...

339
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:52,376
I needed to urinate and
I found this old bucket.

340
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,289
Well, let's get Mrs.
Smythe to a room.

341
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,908
Why didn't you go in the bushes?

342
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:57,065
That's irrelevant.

343
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,333
And you are?

344
00:11:58,368 --> 00:11:59,667
Her husband, John Smythe.

345
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:00,846
And you are?

346
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,036
Mark Greene.

347
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,823
Is Joel all right?

348
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,337
His blood pressure's up
and his vitals are good.

349
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,560
Is he conscious?

350
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,895
No, not yet.

351
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,563
I want to talk to the doctor.

352
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,243
He's doing an
echocardiogram right now,

353
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,612
but he told me to tell you
that he's given Joel fluids

354
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,082
and he expects him to regain
consciousness anytime soon.

355
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,938
I want to be there
when he wakes up.

356
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,707
He gets scared
when I'm not there.

357
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,108
I'll come and get you

358
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,922
as soon as Dr. Ross
finishes the test.

359
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,495
Okay?

360
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:33,445
Is there anything I can get you?

361
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:35,119
A cup of coffee,

362
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,454
something to eat maybe?

363
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,022
No.

364
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,509
Thank you, Carol.

365
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:42,827
Okay.

366
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,286
Why'd you let Edson
steal your thunder?

367
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:53,132
It's not like I had a choice.

368
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,455
You made the save.

369
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,169
When Anspaugh gives an order,

370
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,870
you smile and nod your head.

371
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:00,395
Man, you couldn't pay me
enough to be a surgeon.

372
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,007
Ah, it's not that bad.

373
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,097
Too cutthroat.

374
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,465
Besides, they're all jerks.

375
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,000
No offense intended.

376
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,180
None taken.

377
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,036
Could you get me some crutches?

378
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,971
I think I saw some in the hall.

379
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,273
Sure.

380
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,646
Carla, I can't just take off.

381
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:19,980
Can't you call another nurse?

382
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,316
Yeah...

383
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,084
Okay, okay, look,
just calm down.

384
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,985
All right, all
right, I'll be there.

385
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,354
I'll pick up some insulin.

386
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,655
I'm on my way... damn it!

387
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:28,834
Everything all right?

388
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:29,824
Listen, I got to go.

389
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:30,825
Go?

390
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,260
Yeah, if you have any problems,

391
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:33,528
check with Greene or Weaver.

392
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,930
And do me a favor... go upstairs
and check on my post-ops.

393
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:37,098
I'll be back in an hour.

394
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,099
Ow!

395
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:39,395
I'm sorry, Mrs. Smythe.

396
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,546
It seems to be really stuck.

397
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,964
Must have created a vacuum.

398
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,754
What do you
intend to do about it?

399
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,917
I'm thinking, thinking.

400
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,374
Maybe we could
grease up a Foley,

401
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,875
slide it in to
break the suction?

402
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:48,971
I need a church key.

403
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,673
What? A can opener.

404
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,575
Maybe the kitchen has one.

405
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,848
Um, Miss Wilkerson
has a Swiss army knife.

406
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:58,353
I thought you said
her name was Smythe.

407
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,355
Pet name.

408
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,807
Ah.

409
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,365
Ah!

410
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,435
Here's your bucket, Mr. Smythe.

411
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,122
Thank you, Doctor.

412
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,363
Carter? What?

413
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,942
It's Gunderson, the gunshot.

414
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,944
You admitted him
through ER, right?

415
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,267
Yep.

416
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,281
He's tachycardic,
BP's down to 60 palp.

417
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,704
Any surgical complications?

418
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:34,883
No, he was doing fine,

419
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,452
and then he started gasping.

420
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,774
What's he on?

421
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,143
Morphine and Ancef.

422
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,962
His tongue is swollen.

423
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:42,129
What's going on?

424
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,131
Looks like an allergic reaction.

425
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,365
Where's Edson?

426
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,468
In surgery with Anspaugh.

427
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,020
Okay, let's give epi... Three
mils of one in 10,000 I.V.

428
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,573
Give me a trach kit...
he's in respiratory arrest!

429
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,640
Betadine!

430
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:57,328
Needle.

431
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,532
Introducer.

432
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,420
Sat's falling.

433
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,523
I'm in... hook him up.

434
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:11,358
Pull Edson out of surgery.

435
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,260
I want to talk to him now.

436
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,296
BP's up to 80.

437
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,499
Hey, look, the little
guy's waking up.

438
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:19,867
Hi, Joel.

439
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:23,371
Don't be afraid, your
mommy's right outside.

440
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:24,638
He's still got a few PVCs.

441
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,740
Let's give him another
ten of procainamide.

442
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:27,759
Can we bring the mother back in?

443
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,821
I told her I'd get her.

444
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,923
Wait a few minutes till
the procainamide kicks in.

445
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:32,563
Carol, I got a
great case for you.

446
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,048
Pseudocyst with
acute pancreatitis.

447
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,061
I can't... I've got to
push some meds.

448
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,385
Let the nurses do that.

449
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,930
Yeah, let us lifers push meds.

450
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,204
You go play doctor.

451
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,001
It's okay... Go
ahead, he's doing fine.

452
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,803
All right, as soon
as he's stable,

453
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,004
bring the mom in.

454
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,161
You got it.

455
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,013
Wait till you see this.

456
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,714
She has the biggest pseudocyst

457
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,616
I've ever appreciated.

458
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,696
Now, they told me
they were going to send

459
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,931
another nurse at 4:00,

460
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,400
but I didn't think that I
should wait that long.

461
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,324
No, no, you did the
right thing by calling me.

462
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,337
Okay, and I'm sorry that
you had to leave work.

463
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,494
It's okay... come on.

464
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,062
Okay, now, pull your robe back.

465
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,831
I have to inject
this in your thigh.

466
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:07,832
Okay.

467
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,511
How often do I have to do this?

468
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,668
Twice a day.

469
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,403
Okay, now, are you watching?

470
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,737
Mm-hmm.

471
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,507
All right, now, just stick
the needle in... and push.

472
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,492
There you go.

473
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:19,738
I hate that push part.

474
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:20,794
Now, do you think

475
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,641
you can do this by
yourself next time?

476
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:23,665
Why?

477
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,533
Are you going
back to the hospital?

478
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,313
Yeah, I got to get back to work.

479
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,848
Make sure you eat
something in a couple of hours.

480
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,351
You don't want your
blood sugar getting too low.

481
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,841
Oh, gosh.

482
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,743
I'm going to have to
go to the grocery store.

483
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:36,888
No, no, what are you doing?

484
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,557
You're not supposed
to be on your feet.

485
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,980
What else am I supposed to do?

486
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,482
What about your sister?

487
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,584
Her little one has got strep.

488
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,586
It doesn't matter,
it doesn't matter.

489
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:47,988
I can be down there
and back in 15 minutes.

490
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:50,991
No, um...

491
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,326
I'll do it.

492
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:54,562
Peter, no... You go
back to work, please.

493
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,730
Go back to work.

494
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,465
Carla, I said I'll do it.

495
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,534
Never mind if you're
going to get snippy about it.

496
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,657
Who you calling?

497
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,837
Uh... yeah,

498
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,526
this is Dr. Benton.

499
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,696
Listen, uh, tell Anspaugh
that I had a family emergency.

500
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,509
I'm taking a personal day.

501
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,578
No, no, no, I don't
need to speak to him.

502
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,814
Just, uh, just give him
the message, please.

503
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,137
Thank you.

504
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,079
What happened?

505
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,248
Anaphylaxis.

506
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,426
He almost died.

507
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,295
What did you give him post-op?

508
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,651
Uh, Ancef.

509
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,153
He's allergic to it.

510
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,654
What?

511
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,870
He's allergic to the
antibiotic you gave him.

512
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,005
Didn't you take a history?

513
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,962
I thought you took one.

514
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,042
Don't give me that crap.

515
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,011
Anspaugh told you to do it.

516
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,668
Oh, I took a full history.

517
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,505
Patient never
mentioned any allergies.

518
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,474
Then why is this space
under "allergies" blank?

519
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,013
You better think up
an answer, Dr. Edson.

520
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,081
Anspaugh's going to want one.

521
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,648
Ow!

522
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,372
Just a little bit further.

523
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,640
There we go.

524
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,152
Oh, ah.

525
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,943
All right.

526
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,721
We have an excellent
faculty, Carol...

527
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:33,889
Two Nobel laureates,

528
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,258
and I'd say you can't
beat our attendings.

529
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,083
What are the primary
causes of acute pancreatitis?

530
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,150
Oh, Kerry, I... uh...

531
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,719
you're putting me
on the spot here.

532
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,015
Well, if you're going
to be a med student,

533
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,684
you better get used to it.

534
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,508
Um... alcohol and gallstones?

535
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,876
Excellent.

536
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,328
Now, you try.

537
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,662
Go on.

538
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,333
You feel the pseudocyst?

539
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,483
I'm not sure.

540
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:57,935
Sorry. Ow!

541
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,770
Use both hands and press hard.

542
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,883
Ow!

543
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,006
Sorry, sorry.

544
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,074
No, like this.

545
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,074
Ow!

546
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,149
Sorry.

547
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,277
You feel the cyst?

548
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,356
Yeah, I think so.

549
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,890
Order two more units

550
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,765
of blood for the
kid in Trauma 1!

551
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,099
Excuse me, Kerry.

552
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,979
But wait... I want to teach you

553
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,814
how to do an ultrasound.

554
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,905
<i>Sats are falling.</i>

555
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:18,839
Oh, my God.

556
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,185
He thrombosed his shunt.

557
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,603
I'm trying to repair the graft.

558
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,677
Lost the rhythm.

559
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,344
How long has he been down?

560
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,924
About ten minutes.

561
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:27,359
Why didn't you get his mother?

562
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:28,427
Doc said not to.
I'm getting her.

563
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:29,216
No, I don't want her here.

564
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,384
Doug, I promised.

565
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,769
Carol, I've got this
boy's heart in my hands.

566
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,234
I cannot have her in
here over my shoulder.

567
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,857
I'm getting her.

568
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:40,327
Is Joel awake?

569
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:41,495
Come quick.

570
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,674
What happened?

571
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,598
Joel had a blood
clot in his shunt.

572
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,367
It sent him into cardiac arrest.

573
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:48,435
The doctor had to
cut open his chest.

574
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,836
Oh, my God!

575
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:52,006
Andrea, it's really
bloody in there.

576
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,141
Are you sure you
want to see this?

577
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,675
Okay, come on.

578
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,601
Time of death?

579
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,870
11:52.

580
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,538
Oh! Oh, my God!

581
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:14,745
Oh, my God!

582
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,782
Oh, my God!

583
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:24,572
I thought he was
going to make it.

584
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:25,617
Oh, I feel awful.

585
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,953
I promised the mother I
wouldn't let him die alone.

586
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,010
There was no way of
knowing he'd go so fast.

587
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,824
Yeah, but I should
have been there.

588
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,426
Instead, I was off with
Kerry appreciating a cyst.

589
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,050
Dr. Ross, a kid
with a fever in 5.

590
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,487
All right, you want to do this?

591
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,622
Um... no, I'm not done yet.

592
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,031
Andrea, I'm so sorry.

593
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,667
I called the mortuary.

594
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,235
They're on their way.

595
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,722
What am I going to
do with all his clothes?

596
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,141
I can give them to my sister.

597
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,645
Would you like to see him?

598
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,631
Hold him one last time?

599
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,066
The doctor closed his wound.

600
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,067
I have to make a call.

601
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,185
The call can wait.

602
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:18,125
Andrea, I know this is hard,

603
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,430
but I've learned that parents
need to say good-bye.

604
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,756
Come on.

605
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,339
Don't worry, Mr. McCollum,

606
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,374
I'll have you
stitched up in no time.

607
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,764
Leg hurts like hell.

608
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,516
I'll get you some lidocaine.

609
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,886
Hey, what kind of dump is this?

610
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:46,982
There's a rat.

611
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,088
That's Jerry's mouse.

612
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:49,835
Tomorrow, I'm
bringing in my cat.

613
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:52,426
Board of Health ought
to close this place down.

614
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,073
I sure could use the time off.

615
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:56,408
What's wrong? My foot.

616
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:57,732
Are you all right?

617
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,277
Damn it, it's one of Jerry's

618
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,400
stupid traps!

619
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:01,568
Wendy, grab hold.

620
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:04,771
On my count... one, two, three.

621
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:06,707
It... it's not coming.

622
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,225
Where are the wire cutters?

623
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,471
In the suture room.

624
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,895
Tell Jerry to get
these things out of here

625
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,058
before I kill him.

626
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,231
Where's Benton?

627
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,233
He was supposed
to be back hours ago.

628
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,912
I heard he took a personal day.

629
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,069
Dr. Benton?

630
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,237
Carter...

631
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:21,572
Dale alerted me

632
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,241
that Mr. Gunderson
had a crisis earlier.

633
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,587
I'm glad he told you.

634
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,910
Anyone have his chart?

635
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,612
Yeah, right here.

636
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,082
Hmm...

637
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,383
A nasty little

638
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,897
anaphylactic reaction.

639
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,286
That's right.

640
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,388
You think it was caused by...?

641
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,385
The antibiotic given
post-operatively... Ancef.

642
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:41,658
Doesn't look like

643
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,293
there's anything

644
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,711
we could have done.

645
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,024
Excuse me?

646
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,648
Patient states

647
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,066
"No known drug allergies."

648
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,568
That your handwriting, Edson?

649
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,702
Uh, yes, sir.

650
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,120
Can I take a look at the chart?

651
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:54,121
Certainly.

652
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:56,156
A proper, thorough history...

653
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:57,724
Best defense

654
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,893
against malpractice.

655
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:00,427
Good work.

656
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,223
I thought this would
be more comfortable.

657
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,758
Thank you.

658
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,096
Do you want to hold him?

659
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,953
You take all the time you need.

660
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,413
You're back.

661
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,749
Um, he... he got a... a
button stuck up his nose.

662
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,496
Well, that's pretty unusual.

663
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,886
How'd it get there?

664
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,255
I was, you know, just
wiping my nose on my cuff,

665
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,068
and I felt an urge to sneeze,

666
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,759
and I inhaled the button.

667
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,839
The button is still on his cuff.

668
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,595
He changed his shirt.

669
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,625
Perhaps an ear, nose and
throat specialist is in order?

670
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:29,083
Perhaps not.

671
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:31,168
Why don't you lie
back, Mr. Smythe.

672
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,502
W... what are you doing, Doctor?

673
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,820
I want you to hold

674
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:35,389
the unblocked nostril closed

675
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:37,557
while I put this mask
over your mouth.

676
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:38,937
Don't worry... It's
not going to hurt.

677
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,260
Haleh, can you hold

678
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:41,611
the basin under his chin?

679
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,930
All right, just relax.

680
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,499
Oh.

681
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:49,053
Very impressive.

682
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,388
Uh... may I... may
I keep the button?

683
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,723
Sure.

684
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,026
You sit tight while I get
your discharge papers.

685
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,028
Can you get a Psych
consult down here

686
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,563
before they hurt themselves?

687
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,765
Amen.

688
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,248
I'd go with the
turkey tetrazzini.

689
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,706
Hey, Jackie, how you doing?

690
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,018
What are you doing here?

691
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,275
I'm shopping... What
does it look like?

692
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,989
In the middle of the afternoon?

693
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,178
I took today off.

694
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,179
In your scrubs?

695
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,593
Peter, you never take a day off.

696
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:18,949
Well, actually, I had to leave.

697
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,000
Carla needed me.

698
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,235
Is she all right?

699
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,570
Yeah, yeah, she just
needs to stay off her feet.

700
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,584
Ooh, boy, are you in trouble.

701
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,174
What? It's just for today.

702
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:28,925
Her sister couldn't make it.

703
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,928
Yeah, you may
think it's just for today,

704
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,963
but a pregnant woman
needs a lot of help.

705
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,565
When I was pregnant with Steven,

706
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,734
I had Walt cooking
<i>and</i> doing the laundry.

707
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,446
Jackie, it's crazy,
I'm telling you.

708
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,215
I mean, it's like she's
a different woman.

709
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,521
It's just the hormones, honey.

710
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,523
You know, one time...

711
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:46,193
Walt switched the channel
in the middle of<i> Oprah.</i>

712
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:48,495
I chased him out of the house

713
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:49,846
with a croquet mallet.

714
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,448
Yeah, well, I'm losing it.

715
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,150
I'm so proud of you, Peter,

716
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,086
taking the day off to
help her out like this.

717
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,421
Will you be able

718
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,657
to take off more time
from the hospital?

719
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:00,769
I don't know.

720
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,337
I hadn't thought about that.

721
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,527
Well, start thinking.

722
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,228
Who's Carla going to depend on

723
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,731
if you're not around?

724
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,334
Yeah.

725
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,503
Come on.

726
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,405
Let's go down to
the baby section.

727
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,774
You've got a lot to learn.

728
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,212
Looks like he got
it with an ice pick.

729
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,491
I'll get him undressed.

730
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,814
Carol, let Chuny do that.

731
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,994
No, I got it.

732
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,467
No, I want you

733
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,735
to assess the patient.

734
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,438
Start with the
ABCs, Dr. Hathaway.

735
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:35,308
His airway is patent.

736
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,944
His breathing shallow,
appearance dusky.

737
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:39,891
I'll get the intubation tray.

738
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,164
Chuny can do it.

739
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,166
You're going to intubate.

740
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,537
Okay, Carol, take a
deep breath and hold it.

741
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:50,240
If you run out of breath,
you're taking too long.

742
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,408
Enter laterally,

743
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,343
sweeping the
tongue out of the way.

744
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,562
Don't rock back,
you'll break his teeth.

745
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,080
Can you see the epiglottis?

746
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,248
Mm-hmm.

747
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,415
Good.

748
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,635
Okay, now visualize the cords.

749
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,303
Can you see them?

750
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,616
Pulse ox is falling... 89.

751
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,657
You're doing great, Carol.

752
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,959
Make sure you lift the scope

753
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,527
45 degrees.

754
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,515
Good job.

755
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,602
Let's get him to X ray.

756
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,224
Wow, looks like
Kerry got a new pet.

757
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,059
Stop it, Chuny.

758
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:28,495
You actually saw her

759
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,963
jam the button up his nose?

760
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,744
And before that, she had
a bucket stuck on her butt.

761
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,679
What do you think's
wrong with them?

762
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:36,069
Sounds like they're nuts.

763
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:38,372
Button extraction response time?

764
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,640
Um, 7.5 minutes.

765
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:42,888
Mr. and Mrs. Smythe,
this is Dr. Pomerantz.

766
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,511
Psychiatric consult, I presume?

767
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,812
Yes.

768
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,314
Well, we've been expecting you.

769
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,816
As you no doubt
have ascertained,

770
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:52,619
uh, Brenda and I are
not what we appear to be.

771
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:54,571
What are you?

772
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,439
John Smythe and
Brenda Wilkerson...

773
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,775
Um, clinical researchers.

774
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,211
We're conducting a study
on creative problem-solving

775
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,462
in emergency departments,

776
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,692
and we found that
foreign body extractions

777
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,878
elicited the greatest
range of responses.

778
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,802
Yes, and I must say, Dr. Greene,

779
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:11,705
you came up with the
most innovative solutions

780
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,056
we've ever seen.

781
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,107
Over at Mercy,

782
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:15,759
the button in the
nose took five hours

783
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,871
and two consults.

784
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,862
Wait a minute... They
wanted to operate.

785
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,748
Just who is
sponsoring this study?

786
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:27,688
Uh, an independent consortium
of health care professionals

787
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:30,056
and, uh... those in government.

788
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:32,359
The highest levels
of government.

789
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,029
No promises,

790
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,949
but, uh, you might be
contacted by... HRC.

791
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,419
Hillary.

792
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:43,570
Oh...

793
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:45,434
Oh, well... if she ever gets

794
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,224
her ass stuck in a bucket,
she'll know who to call.

795
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,712
Well, I'll tell her you said so.

796
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,098
Okay.

797
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,088
What are you doing down here?

798
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,244
Hiding.

799
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,578
Me, too.

800
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,680
You're a smoker!

801
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:11,927
A secret smoker.

802
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:14,417
Don't tell anyone.

803
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,919
So who died?

804
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,070
What?

805
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:19,272
Why the long face?

806
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:24,544
Edson falsified a
chart to cover his ass.

807
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,729
You're kidding.

808
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,464
Forgot to take
a patient history.

809
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,633
Patient almost died
from an allergic reaction.

810
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,796
Anspaugh must have
roasted his butt for that.

811
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,804
I didn't tell him.

812
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,406
You didn't?

813
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,408
Would you have?

814
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,743
Hell, yeah.

815
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,211
I mean, changing
a chart is unethical,

816
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,567
not to mention illegal.

817
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,383
Surgeons don't
rat on each other.

818
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,485
You know, it's
like the marines...

819
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,487
"All for one, and one for all."

820
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,389
That's the Three Musketeers.

821
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,759
You know what I mean.

822
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,797
No, you got to be... you
got to be a team player.

823
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:04,267
Anspaugh gave me
that lecture last week.

824
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,536
I think you're scared.

825
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,910
Well, we'll be in touch.

826
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,256
Bye, Super Doc.

827
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,490
Bye. Bye.

828
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,792
What a couple of kooks.

829
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,082
They can make you famous.

830
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,350
Please.

831
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,719
What... you could be
known at "the highest levels"

832
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,921
as the most innovative
doctor in the country.

833
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,267
Tell that to my daughter.

834
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,423
What'd you do now?

835
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,970
I stood up her Brownie troop.

836
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,193
Yikes.

837
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,428
I just can't seem
to get it together.

838
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,763
You mean to tell me

839
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,399
that "super doc"
can't figure out a way

840
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,634
to keep his Brownie commitments?

841
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,676
Carol, we've got an
intoxicated gentleman

842
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,077
who needs an NG tube.

843
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,278
You interested?

844
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,457
Wait, wait.

845
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,914
You can't go in there.

846
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,148
Why not? There's a free bed.

847
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,461
This woman needs to be alone.

848
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,951
Her child died today.

849
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:59,639
Your compassion is
admirable, Carol, but we've got

850
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:01,775
a board full of
patients we can save.

851
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,426
We need to put them somewhere.

852
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,605
Treat the drunk in the hall.

853
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,196
The drunk is a patient, too.

854
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,542
You've done it before, Kerry.

855
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,183
When there were
no beds available.

856
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:12,686
Well, there aren't any beds now.

857
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:16,023
Carol, if you're going
to be a med student,

858
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:18,708
you've got to stop
thinking like a nurse.

859
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,104
Well, I'm not a med student yet.

860
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:34,574
CBC chem seven.

861
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:35,575
Type and cross for four.

862
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,576
Hey, Maggie.

863
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:37,705
Is this the surgical belly?

864
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,229
Yeah, but I already
called upstairs.

865
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:40,781
I didn't know you
were down here.

866
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,026
Might as well get started.

867
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,461
What's the story?

868
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,051
Painter fell off his scaffold,

869
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:46,352
did a 20-foot belly flop

870
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:47,587
onto a Volvo.

871
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:49,655
They say Volvos
are the safest cars.

872
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:52,359
All right, Edson,
start a central line.

873
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:54,127
Carter, do a peritoneal lavage.

874
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,529
I'll get the DPL kit.

875
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:58,510
Carter...

876
00:31:58,534 --> 00:31:59,716
what are the criteria

877
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,119
for a positive diagnostic
peritoneal lavage?

878
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,399
Red blood cell count
greater than 100,000,

879
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,584
white blood cell
count greater than 500.

880
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,108
And if you can read a newspaper

881
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,587
through the
fluid, it's negative.

882
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:12,295
I love those little pearls.

883
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,033
So, Dale, weren't you
going to give Dr. Anspaugh

884
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,168
some new information
about Mr. Gunderson?

885
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,470
John filled me in.

886
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,939
What? The patient with
the allergic reaction?

887
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,085
Is there more to it?

888
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,741
Uh, as a matter of fact,

889
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,838
I called Mr. Gunderson's mother

890
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,895
and briefed her
on the situation,

891
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:31,481
and she'll be flying
in from Louisville.

892
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,616
Good... looking
after the patient's

893
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,968
emotional state.

894
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:36,402
Is that it?

895
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,439
That's it.

896
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,691
Really? John said
there was more.

897
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,629
Something I should know about?

898
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,480
Um...

899
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,468
No.

900
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,598
DPL is positive.

901
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,071
I'm in.

902
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,552
All right, let's get
him up to surgery.

903
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,120
Edson, we'll start
with an ex-lap.

904
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,326
If he needs a splenectomy,

905
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:01,345
you'll do it.

906
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,660
Let's move him.

907
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,902
Well, you sure told him.

908
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,628
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

909
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,762
Save it.

910
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,166
So they teach
forgery at Harvard?

911
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,467
Go to hell.

912
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,202
What'd you say?

913
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,499
Look, John, all I did was
make an adjustment to a chart.

914
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:29,655
Is that such a big deal?

915
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:30,802
I don't know, why don't you

916
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:32,303
run it by Anspaugh,
see what he thinks?

917
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:34,127
I can't do that.

918
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,379
Sure you can.

919
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,015
Look, if this goes on my record,

920
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,518
my chances for a
fellowship are zilch.

921
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,181
You going to make me tell him?

922
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:45,071
John...

923
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,506
please.

924
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,077
I'll do anything you want.

925
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,613
I'll put in a good
word with Anspaugh,

926
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:54,781
anything.

927
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,783
Look, I'll make it up to you.

928
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,919
I don't want to have
anything to do with you.

929
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:04,524
If you ever try
anything like this again,

930
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,376
I'll bury you.

931
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,513
That's a promise.

932
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,430
These are resuscitation paddles.

933
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,900
If someone's heart
stops beating normally

934
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:15,201
or has a strange rhythm,

935
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,470
we zap them with
a surge of electricity

936
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:20,006
to get it going, like...

937
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,741
It's kind of like Frankenstein.

938
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:23,393
Mark, got an MVA coming in.

939
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,378
Kerry's got it, but
we need the room.

940
00:34:25,414 --> 00:34:27,847
All right, who wants
to go look at blood cells

941
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:29,015
under the microscope?

942
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:30,194
I do!

943
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:32,318
All right, let's go to the lab.

944
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:37,157
Thanks, Dad.

945
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:42,395
Very creative.

946
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:43,441
So I've been told.

947
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:44,975
How would you like to go out

948
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,500
with the most innovative
doctor in the world?

949
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:48,601
I would be honored.

950
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:49,713
You like bowling?

951
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,438
"Like" may be too strong a word.

952
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:52,550
I got to take Rachel.

953
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:53,951
Maybe Emma could come, too.

954
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,341
Oh, it's that kind of date.

955
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:56,654
Well, that's the best I can do.

956
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,710
Guess I'll just have

957
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,223
to dust off my bowling shoes.

958
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:00,413
You own bowling shoes?

959
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,959
There's all sorts of things

960
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:03,794
you don't know about me, Doctor.

961
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,387
Thank you, Carol, for letting me

962
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,439
have this time with my baby.

963
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:28,453
Is there someone I can call?

964
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:30,910
My sister's on her way.

965
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:39,085
I used to say this prayer
with Joel every night:

966
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:41,621
"Now I lay me down to sleep,

967
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:46,293
"I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

968
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:49,629
"If I should die before I wake,

969
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:52,582
I pray the Lord
my soul to take."

970
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,474
Oh...

971
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,310
You think I'm a coward?

972
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,311
Who am I to say?

973
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,679
I'm not a surgeon.

974
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,082
You guys got your own rules.

975
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:30,686
Maybe that's just a load of
crap and I'm hiding behind it.

976
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,558
I don't know what to do.

977
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,794
Maybe you should
talk to another surgeon.

978
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,895
Yeah, right.

979
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,263
They're all so empathetic.

980
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,366
There's got to be somebody
whose judgment you trust.

981
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,569
You think I should
talk to Benton?

982
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,670
I would.

983
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,341
How about a Heinie?

984
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,710
Beer?

985
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,779
I keep a couple in the
back for when I get off work.

986
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:01,050
You know... you're great.

987
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,685
So are you.

988
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,620
Seriously.

989
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,189
I mean, you're honest...

990
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,924
you're funny...

991
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,627
you're beautiful.

992
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,464
I don't suppose that you...

993
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,601
Not a chance.

994
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,438
Cheers.

995
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,174
Cheers.

996
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,678
These things cost
60 bucks apiece.

997
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,557
Who's going to pay for this?

998
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,314
Take it out of your reward.

999
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,194
No trap, no mouse, no reward.

1000
00:37:38,273 --> 00:37:40,773
He's under there.

1001
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:42,325
<i>She's</i> under there?

1002
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,130
Oh, no!

1003
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,815
You killed her.

1004
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,945
I didn't mean to.

1005
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,369
She's still breathing.

1006
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,470
She is?

1007
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,837
How much is that reward?

1008
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:55,922
Five grand.

1009
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:57,674
Wendy, get a
pediatric O2 mask...

1010
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,142
The smallest you can find...

1011
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,593
And five cc's of Dopram.

1012
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:01,493
And hurry!

1013
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,346
Jerry, start mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

1014
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:04,382
You're kidding.

1015
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,049
I worked for a
vet in high school.

1016
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,516
I saw a resuscitated guinea pig.

1017
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,296
I'm not breathing
in a rat's mouth.

1018
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,821
All right, I will, but
we're splitting the reward.

1019
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,572
Hook the mask
up to five liters O2.

1020
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,571
She moved!

1021
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,740
I think she's going
to be all right.

1022
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,404
I'll just take her
back up to the lab.

1023
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:34,276
Nothing doing.

1024
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,027
Give me the rat.

1025
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,273
I'm taking her back

1026
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:37,641
and collecting our reward.

1027
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:38,665
Well, 50-50, right?

1028
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,344
Wrong, I'll give you ten percent

1029
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:41,412
for being in the room

1030
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:42,768
while we resuscitated her.

1031
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:43,902
Take it or leave it.

1032
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:47,123
Damn it!

1033
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,224
I'm heading out.

1034
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,193
Is Dr. Benton
coming in tomorrow?

1035
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,461
Yes, he asked for
his surgery schedule

1036
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,563
and copies of his
patients' charts.

1037
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,799
We're sending them
over by messenger.

1038
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,967
Is this them?

1039
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,146
Yep.

1040
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,302
Hmm, must have moved.

1041
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,515
Tell you what...
Cancel your messenger.

1042
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,139
I'll take these to him myself.

1043
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,807
I have to talk to him anyway.

1044
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,178
Lily, are you up for
Crockett's after work?

1045
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,213
It's nurses' night.

1046
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,425
Sure, I'm in. Me, too.

1047
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,582
Chuny, how about you?

1048
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,294
Be there or be square.

1049
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,731
Hey, I hear you intubated
a guy like a pro today.

1050
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,054
Oh, yeah.

1051
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,990
Kerry's been trying to
show me things all day long.

1052
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,946
Made me feel
just like a beginner.

1053
00:39:22,977 --> 00:39:24,894
You know, the truth is

1054
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm really, really
good at my job.

1055
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:30,616
So why do I want to change that?

1056
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,595
Watch me, Mom.

1057
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,829
Yes.

1058
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,256
Good try, honey.

1059
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,490
What's the score?

1060
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,070
That would be 2-1 still.

1061
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,794
Oh, we could be here all night.

1062
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,940
Did you get all your
paperwork done?

1063
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,131
Uh, I am going to
be up late tonight,

1064
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,168
but I can access my
patient reports on-line, so...

1065
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,804
figured it's worth it.

1066
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,039
Easy, easy, honey.

1067
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,778
Yikes.

1068
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,880
So, think they're
getting along okay?

1069
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,942
Uh-huh.

1070
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:21,133
I think there's something there.

1071
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,186
Yeah?

1072
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,691
I thought maybe we
should do this more often.

1073
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,294
Next time without kids.

1074
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:32,779
You read my mind.

1075
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:34,914
That's my job.

1076
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,021
Dad!

1077
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,339
I got one!

1078
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,141
That is great.

1079
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:46,476
That is really great.

1080
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,726
There we go... it's 2-2.

1081
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:54,166
One plate of spaghetti
marinara al dente.

1082
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,468
Yes.

1083
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:56,903
Just one plate?

1084
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:59,383
Yeah... hospital is
sending over some charts,

1085
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:00,851
so I got to, uh... go home

1086
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,887
and prepare for
tomorrow's cases.

1087
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:04,410
Why don't you do it here?

1088
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:05,978
I don't have my books.

1089
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:08,280
Well, I'm going to need
another shot in an hour.

1090
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:11,016
Yeah, that's why I
taught you how to do it.

1091
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:15,288
Fine.

1092
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:16,922
Just go home.

1093
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,412
Look, Carla...

1094
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,015
um...

1095
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,229
Honey, I can't be
here all the time.

1096
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,386
You said you
wanted to be involved.

1097
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,371
I<i> am.</i>

1098
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,388
Sure.

1099
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:34,023
On your terms, as always.

1100
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,224
You ever think

1101
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,926
about what I need, what I want?

1102
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,322
You never asked me what<i> I</i> want.

1103
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,878
What is that supposed to mean?

1104
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,030
Nothing, baby.

1105
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:42,143
Look, just drop it.

1106
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,199
Uh-uh.

1107
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:44,734
You never wanted this baby.

1108
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,096
What are you talking
about? I didn't say that.

1109
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,203
That's what you meant.

1110
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,656
Just go home, because
I don't need you here

1111
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,091
doing me no damn favors.

1112
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,877
What?

1113
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,512
Hey, Carla.

1114
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:58,548
It's for you.

1115
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:04,470
Carter, what are you doing here?

1116
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:07,584
I just came to drop these by.

1117
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,907
Oh, thank you.

1118
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,810
Good night, Carter.

1119
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:21,404
Three in the corner.

1120
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:22,739
All right.

1121
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,623
Hey, girl, didn't
expect to see you here.

1122
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:30,229
It's nurses' night out, right?

1123
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:32,743
I thought Weaver
was already fitting you

1124
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:34,283
for a lab coat.

1125
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,829
Yeah, well, white
adds ten pounds.

1126
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,102
I think I'll stick to pink.

1127
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,648
You having second
thoughts about med school?

1128
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:41,274
Well, let's just say I
really like what I do.

1129
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,292
Another round?

1130
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:43,293
You bet.

1131
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:44,328
I'll get it.

1132
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:45,806
All right!

1133
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,630
You want to play?

1134
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,964
Sure.

1135
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,099
Come on, girl.

1136
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,696
It's a quarter a ball.

1137
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,186
I think I can handle that.

1138
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,320
Go for it.

1139
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:56,389
All right.

1140
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:57,590
What am I, stripes?

1141
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:58,736
Solid.

1142
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,827
Two in the corner.

1143
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:02,039
All right.

1144
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:03,796
Hey, all right!

1145
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,114
