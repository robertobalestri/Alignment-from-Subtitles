1
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:18,850
Oh.

2
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,530
We were here first.

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,915
Shut up, Beanie.

4
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,988
You shut up.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,006
Move it, Butthead.

6
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:26,224
It's my turn, Brian.

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,337
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,294
I'll knock.

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,197
Al?

10
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,310
Al, you there?

11
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:36,868
I got you.

12
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,953
Trick or treat!

13
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,004
Okay. All right.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,039
Here's some for you and for you

15
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,401
and for you. Thank you.

16
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,992
Happy Halloween.

17
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:45,088
Thank you. Happy Halloween!

18
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:48,013
Treat?

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,949
Chocolate bars, chocolate
mints, chocolate kisses.

20
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,650
We'll be seeing half these kids

21
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,419
in the ER by tomorrow morning.

22
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,955
Well, it beats all the
apples and boxed raisins

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,674
we got when we were kids.

24
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:00,442
You can take that off now.

25
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,477
Take what off?

26
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,046
Did you find last year's 1040s?

27
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,193
Yeah, they're around
here somewhere

28
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:10,218
but here are the loan papers.

29
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:14,122
You know, I thought taking
out a second mortgage

30
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,769
would be easier than this.

31
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:17,754
Only if you've
already got the money.

32
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,512
I couldn't finish some of it.

33
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,014
I think you need

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,682
an accounting degree
to figure out our net worth.

35
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:25,800
I'll go over it.

36
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,119
I, uh, I've got to get it

37
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,722
to the bank tomorrow by 10:00.

38
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,461
I'll work on them tonight.

39
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,896
I've got a break at 10:30.

40
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,130
Meet me at Doc McGoo's.

41
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,515
You can pick them up then.

42
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,684
Okay.

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,269
Benton hates my guts.

44
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,937
No, I think he likes you.

45
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,340
He just has
difficulty showing it.

46
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,508
Yeah, right.

47
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,210
He bagged me on my evaluation.

48
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,978
"Technical skills... fair.

49
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,814
"Diagnostic skills... fair.

50
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,716
Attitude... needs improvement"?

51
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,529
"Intern shows
lack of discipline.

52
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,152
"Judgment is often suspect.

53
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,932
Fails to complete work
in a timely fashion."

54
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,638
Shall I continue?

55
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:04,834
Wait, wait, wait. You saw this?

56
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,570
He wrote the same
exact thing on mine.

57
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,626
Does he Xerox them?

58
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,306
I think it's a rubber stamp.

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,974
Jerry! What are you, a rat?

60
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,631
It's a kangaroo suit.

61
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,449
The head's too hot and itchy.

62
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:15,367
Kangaroo?

63
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,480
You're kidding right?

64
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,903
Abdominal pain in three.

65
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,522
Gangrenous toe in two.

66
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,208
Hey, Jerry, can you send
these back to medical records?

67
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,409
I'm running late.

68
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,955
Carol, I've got the
schedule changes.

69
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,379
Okay I'll check it
when I get back.

70
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,580
I'm late for an appointment.

71
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,893
Don't forget you're riding
on the healthmobile tonight.

72
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,417
Yeah, I know. I'll
be back in time.

73
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,552
What is going on?

74
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,198
Maintenance is doing repairs.

75
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,622
It's probably that
ghost from the fifth floor.

76
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,569
Oh, please. Don't
even talk about him.

77
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,559
Talk about who?

78
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,793
The ghost up on five.

79
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,873
Yeah, took a bite out
of that lab technician.

80
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,775
Ghosts don't bite. He just
knocked the wind out of him.

81
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,700
No, he sent a rush of cold air
straight through him, that's all.

82
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,746
Help! My friend's been
shot. He's outside in the car.

83
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,037
Jerry, alert the OR

84
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,249
and clear Trauma One.

85
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,672
Lydia, let's go!

86
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,742
Susan get back
from Hawaii today?

87
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,777
Yeah. Tonight around 6:00.

88
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,880
Orange carnations?

89
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,615
Yeah. You know... Halloween.

90
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,885
Orange carnations.

91
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,220
Yeah.

92
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,366
Doug, got a pumpkin
carver in five.

93
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,634
He ate too many seeds.

94
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,536
Chuny, what are
you supposed to be?

95
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,093
Myself, getting ready for work.

96
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,262
Jerry's trying to get
a count for tonight.

97
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,564
Are you going to the
party at the Jazz Note?

98
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,665
Haleh's singing.

99
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,834
I'm a definite "I don't know."

100
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,203
Yeah, I'm going if I can.

101
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,739
Chuny, is there anything
wrong with orange carnations?

102
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,608
No. I gave them to one
of my teachers once...

103
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,761
Second grade.

104
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,824
Lydia, get that 12
lead out of here.

105
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,615
Take this clown with you, okay?

106
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,877
On my count...

107
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:38,979
One, two, three

108
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,454
Cyanotic. Intubate. BP's 40.

109
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,504
Pulse thready at 180.

110
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,240
Pulse ox is 80.

111
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,987
Someone call maintenance
about these lights, please?

112
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,510
What do you think?

113
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,311
Increased breath
sounds on the left.

114
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:51,347
Possible hemopneumo.

115
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,180
What do you do?

116
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,014
Chest tube.

117
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,182
Right again.

118
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,567
Chest tube tray

119
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,702
36 French.

120
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,920
I'm in. Bag him.

121
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,249
I got the O-neg. Pump in two.

122
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,906
He's flatline.

123
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,219
Give me an amp of
epi, two of atropine,

124
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,471
start the external compressions.

125
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,423
Two more of O-neg. Come on,
let's hurry up. We're losing him.

126
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,912
All right, who's got the bullet?

127
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,497
GSW, Left chest.
Carter Intubated

128
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,999
Put in a chest
tube. He flatlined.

129
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,434
Gave him an amp of
epi and two of atropine.

130
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,852
Okay. So what now?

131
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,105
Uh... we should crack him?

132
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,635
Yes, we should crack
him before he ends up

133
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,035
more dead than he
already is, Dr. Gant.

134
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,244
Okay, thoracotomy tray.

135
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,128
Scalpel.

136
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,562
Fifth intercostal space, right?

137
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,513
That's right.

138
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,749
And the left anterolateral
incision, right?

139
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:28,812
Do you know what
you're doing or not?

140
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,012
Yeah, I'm just confirming...

141
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,985
If you have to

142
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,582
keep confirming, you don't
know what you're doing.

143
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,322
Carter, get in here.

144
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,091
Carter, move. Now!

145
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,328
Rib spreader.

146
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,462
Suction.

147
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,064
Looks like the upper lobe.

148
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,067
All right, cross
clamp the Hilum.

149
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,303
Paralyze him!

150
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,087
Pavulon now!

151
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,340
All right, hold him down!

152
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:54,059
Come on!

153
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,126
Get him down!

154
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,695
Get it in.

155
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,197
Right there.

156
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,734
Whoa!

157
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,360
Happy Halloween, everybody.

158
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,655
<i>The first thing you do</i>

159
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,940
is calibrate your apparatus.

160
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,842
Collect your data properly

161
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,312
and use the root
mean square to...

162
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,313
Excuse me.

163
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,359
Is this pre-med Physics 101?

164
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,032
For the past 15 minutes.

165
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,083
Sorry.

166
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,153
Do you have a lab assignment?

167
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,170
Uh-uh.

168
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:32,607
Okay, who's working solo?

169
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,686
There's your lab partner.

170
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,212
The relationship
we're looking at here

171
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:40,632
is conservation of momentum
in an elastic collision.

172
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,768
The first thing you do is
calibrate your apparatus.

173
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,047
Hi. I'm William.

174
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,270
Carol Hathaway.

175
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,318
I was kind of worried
I'd be the only one

176
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:49,485
without a lab partner.

177
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,454
Did you bring your
graphing calculator?

178
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,777
Graphing calculator...

179
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,279
That's okay, we
can both use mine.

180
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,881
Neat costume.

181
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,944
That illustrate the
principles of momentum.

182
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:01,036
Pacemaker's acting up.

183
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:04,172
Okay, a nurse will
be right with you.

184
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,207
I thought maintenance was done.

185
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:07,854
Well, some people are saying

186
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:10,378
it's that g-h-o-s-t
up on the fifth floor.

187
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,346
Jerry, I hate to break it to you

188
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,382
but there's no such
thing as ghosts.

189
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,918
Jerry, who put me in
that damn healthmobile?

190
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:18,164
Our very own Anspaugh.

191
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,231
It's Halloween.

192
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,867
Every freak in the city
is going to be out there.

193
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,368
Not true, half of
them are here already.

194
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:23,469
Healthmobile is not so bad.

195
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,793
I was on it last Monday.

196
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,427
Although, we did get shot at.

197
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,445
Oh, man.

198
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,446
It was no big deal.

199
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,614
They missed.

200
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,584
Carol's on, she's not
going to want to go with me.

201
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,696
Doug, it's Anspaugh's baby.

202
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Community access.

203
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,804
It's out of my hands.

204
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,316
We got a little old lady

205
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,307
coming in unconscious, a DNR.

206
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:40,342
I'll take it.

207
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,155
Actually, you were
due in Anspaugh's office

208
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,544
about ten minutes ago.

209
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:44,712
Okay, fine.

210
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:47,315
Uh, get Jeanie ask
her to take the LOL,

211
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,449
and get Doyle to assist.

212
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,617
Oh, uh, Jer...

213
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:50,702
Any word from Susan?

214
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,799
She's not due in
till 6:00, remember?

215
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,955
Thank you, Jer.

216
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:58,309
You are getting to
be a big boy, Reggie.

217
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,945
Okay, developmental milestones.

218
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,262
Dr. Benton...

219
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,448
When do we first
see a social smile?

220
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,951
Oh, uh, three weeks.

221
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,169
Dr. Carter?

222
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,638
Mm, it's more like three months.

223
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:14,592
Right. Using a spoon and fork?

224
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,845
Seven months.

225
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,262
Is that correct, Dr. Carter?

226
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,448
Average is more like 13.

227
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,551
Don't worry, Dr. Benton.

228
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,118
Dr. Carter's just a lot closer

229
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:26,087
to his pedes
rotation than you are.

230
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:27,656
You'll just need
to study up a bit,

231
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:28,923
won't you?

232
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,341
Here.

233
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,809
Why don't you hold Reggie?

234
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,501
Okay, Dr. Carter,

235
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:41,753
what's the problem here?

236
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,737
Stranger anxiety?

237
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,238
And what would you do?

238
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,341
Reggie was clearly
responding to you

239
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,577
so...

240
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,344
Hi.

241
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,280
Oh.

242
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,916
Being able to keep a
baby calm for examination

243
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,000
is half the battle.

244
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,869
Some doctors have
an instinct for it...

245
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,038
a natural affinity for children.

246
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:05,910
Uh, you, Dr. Benton, might
want to get some props.

247
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,382
She the "Do not resuscitate"?

248
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,383
Yeah.

249
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,884
Husband's name is Mitchell.

250
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,597
Sweet old guy,
seems really upset.

251
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,899
Is he on his way in?

252
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,656
Yeah. Okay.

253
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,460
Found her in bed, comatose,
end stage of Lou Gehrig's.

254
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,431
Ready... go.

255
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,498
See ya.

256
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,167
PA's run these cases? Yeah.

257
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,301
Not at Southside.

258
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,719
Dr. Greene asked me to.

259
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:33,321
Pressure's falling, 50 palp.

260
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:34,639
Her lungs are wet.

261
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,657
She's in respiratory distress.

262
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:36,819
I don't want to intubate.

263
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,120
She's a no-coder.
Could be pneumonia.

264
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,643
We can treat her
with antibiotics.

265
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,457
Treat her? She's a veggie.

266
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,875
Pressure's crashing...
What do you want to do?

267
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,348
Ten mikes of dopamine

268
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,934
Titrate to a BP of 100

269
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,768
Put her on bi-pap ten over five

270
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,604
and a gram of Ceftriaxone.

271
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,471
Why are you doing this?

272
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,506
Do not resuscitate

273
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,940
doesn't mean do not treat.

274
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,025
You're the PA.

275
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:59,080
Shouldn't it have
epaulets on the shoulders?

276
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:00,882
No, those are the
dress uniforms.

277
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:01,883
Oh, of course.

278
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,251
Mark, come on in.

279
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,585
Cup of tea?

280
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,920
No, thank you.

281
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,789
Kerry and I were
just celebrating

282
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,824
the final stamp of approval

283
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,087
on her research study.

284
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,638
It's quite simple, really.

285
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,974
Free-radical scavengers
prevent celluloid damage,

286
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,499
so why not study
their effect on asthma?

287
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,745
It just occurred to me

288
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,980
while treating a
patient in the ER.

289
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:23,171
Nothing like research
from the trenches.

290
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,707
NIH Grant shouldn't
take long at all.

291
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:27,375
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

292
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:29,577
Oh, that's me. Gotta go.

293
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,491
I'll see you all at
the party tonight?

294
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:32,792
Wouldn't miss it.

295
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,943
Good decision bringing Kerry in

296
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,178
as an attending.

297
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,347
Her research ideas are inspired.

298
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,782
I don't need to tell you
that this free-radical study

299
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,039
is going to give
her quite a leg up

300
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,208
on that tenure track.

301
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,221
Not that you
necessarily want to teach

302
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,506
or even stay here at County.

303
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,495
No, I do.

304
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:49,497
Of course, I'm
interested in tenure.

305
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,366
As for research, I was thinking

306
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,335
fluid resuscitation in
penetrating trauma.

307
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,903
Yes, well, a lot of attendings

308
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,183
are pursuing that one.

309
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:58,940
There's one that Kerry discarded

310
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,274
that's quite interesting.

311
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,776
Have you thought about

312
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:03,411
the microbiology
of abscess flora?

313
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:04,612
Pus?

314
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:06,815
Well, you don't have
to commit to it right now.

315
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,127
Just explore it. Get back to me.

316
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,652
End of the week should be fine.

317
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,431
Check your data.

318
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:13,554
It's not working.

319
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,834
Your variable air
source is not on.

320
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:17,424
My air source.

321
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,127
You've never taken
physics before, have you?

322
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:21,462
You have?

323
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:22,997
Just introductory.

324
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:26,000
We don't have AP
Physics at Jefferson.

325
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,251
Jefferson High School?

326
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,038
Yeah. I want to be a doctor

327
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:31,772
or mechanical engineer.

328
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:32,773
What about you?

329
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,075
Um...

330
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,744
I'm not sure what I want to
be when I grow up, William.

331
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,580
My mom got her real
estate license at 40.

332
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,877
I helped her with her homework.

333
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,036
I can help you with
yours, if you want.

334
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,771
Sure. Thanks.

335
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,937
Tina Hargrove, eight
years old. Hit and run.

336
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,105
Out trick-or-treating with Dad.

337
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,624
Loss of consciousness
for ten minutes.

338
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:55,808
GSC 13, B.P. 130/80.

339
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,164
Multiple facial lacs

340
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,650
blunt trauma to the abdomen.

341
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,785
My stomach hurts.

342
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,020
Dad's on his way.
He got hit too.

343
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,623
Double trauma coming
in! We need the room, clear!

344
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:06,624
Suture room.

345
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,703
Gant, call radiology.

346
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,871
Get a head CT. And a C-spine.

347
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,239
All right everybody,
on my count.

348
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,507
Nice and gentle, here we go...

349
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,496
One, two, three.

350
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,148
CBC type and cross-match

351
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,166
five units.

352
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,400
Radiology's coming down.

353
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,397
All right, her abdomen is rigid.

354
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,948
Gant, what's the best
incision for an ex-lap?

355
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:20,921
Midline.

356
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,139
Ow! Please, it hurts.

357
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,485
BP's holding steady. 130/80.

358
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,542
Toes downgoing.

359
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,343
Which organs are injured most

360
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,796
in blunt abdominal trauma, Gant?

361
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,662
Spleen and liver.

362
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,898
My stomach still hurts. Please!

363
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,033
Where's my daddy?

364
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,183
Clear breath sounds.

365
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,347
Carter, get up here
and hold her hand.

366
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:35,219
What?

367
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,220
Hold her hand.

368
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,300
Stranger anxiety. Remember?

369
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,723
Calm her down.

370
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,358
Gant, check her reflexes.

371
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,637
Hi, Tina, I'm Dr. Carter.
Don't be scared, okay?

372
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,306
Don't be scared, cause we're
going to take such good care of you.

373
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,574
Tendon reflexes
two plus and equal.

374
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,730
Thank you, Dr. Gant.

375
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,366
Now, where the
hell is radiology?

376
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,633
High dose epi.

377
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,669
No pulse, no resps.

378
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,069
How long has he been down?

379
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,248
Paramedics said
almost a half hour.

380
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,039
That his daughter next door?

381
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,841
Yeah. Tina, eight years old.

382
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,693
Abdomen's distended,
probably bled out.

383
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:00,272
Let's give him a
few more minutes.

384
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:03,298
All right, I'm going
to check on the girl.

385
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,845
What causes left shoulder pain

386
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,469
in blunt abdominal trauma?

387
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,216
Blood irritating the diaphragm.

388
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,222
How's she doing?

389
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,223
She's stabilizing.

390
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,224
We need to hang

391
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,626
500 of Ancef and
get her up to CT.

392
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,923
Such enthusiasm, Gant, why don't you
run upstairs and tell them what she needs?

393
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,014
Now?

394
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,533
Well, if you're confident
you know what she needs.

395
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,844
Labs are back on Mrs.
Jennings. Not good.

396
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,089
What do you mean?

397
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,780
She tested positive
for Tricyclics.

398
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,781
What's her level?

399
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,782
800.

400
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,783
She's a suicide.

401
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,496
She must have
taken the whole bottle.

402
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,653
Is her husband here?

403
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,654
Not yet.

404
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,799
Give me an NG and 50
grams of activated charcoal.

405
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,489
Why? She's a no-code.

406
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,191
She tried to kill herself.

407
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,320
She has a fatal disease.

408
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:49,677
We resuscitate suicides.

409
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:50,823
She wanted to die.

410
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:51,813
All suicides.

411
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:53,681
Add an amp of Bicarb to her IV.

412
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,397
So you dressed
up like a cat, huh?

413
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,854
My dad made the costume.

414
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:00,855
Is he okay?

415
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,201
I'll check for you. Okay?

416
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,253
So, did you get a lot of good

417
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,727
trick-or-treating stuff?

418
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,728
My dad's got it

419
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,446
so I won't eat it all at once.

420
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,447
Uh-huh.

421
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,448
Ruptured spleen.

422
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,111
Could've injured her
kidney and bladder, too.

423
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,451
We'll get a CT and
explore her up in the ER.

424
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,987
Mark.

425
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,340
Carter, got a minute?

426
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:22,510
Uh, yeah.

427
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,161
Can't you stay with me?

428
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,658
Oh, they're going
to take some pictures

429
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:26,742
of your head and your tummy

430
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,210
and then I'll be
right there, okay?

431
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,067
Tell my dad where I am, okay?

432
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,383
Okay.

433
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:37,024
Is this the father?

434
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,070
You ever pronounce anyone?

435
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:40,427
No. I've called time of death.

436
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,031
The monitor shows
no electrical activity.

437
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,100
Check the pupils.

438
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:49,837
Fixed and dilated.

439
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:51,405
Feel for a pulse.

440
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,576
No palpable pulse.

441
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,477
Listen for a heartbeat.

442
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:59,213
Give it a minute.

443
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,881
That's it?

444
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,516
That's it.

445
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,277
Can I help you?

446
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:31,846
Oh, yeah. I'm Carol Hathaway.

447
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:32,947
I'm on tonight.

448
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:34,226
Gus Jackson, your pilot.

449
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,583
Did you bring the cookies?

450
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:36,584
Was I supposed to?

451
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,419
The patients kind
of expect them.

452
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,654
You got any valuables?

453
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,788
No.

454
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,590
Good. Make yourself at home.

455
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,025
Hey, hey, hey!

456
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:46,694
You're late.

457
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:47,740
Yeah, I know. Uh...

458
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:48,930
You bring the cookies?

459
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:49,931
What? The cookies?

460
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:50,998
Get in.

461
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,110
Yup. Yup.

462
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,134
Hey, Doug.

463
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,235
Hey, Carol.

464
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,949
I didn't know you
were on tonight.

465
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,383
Yeah, well, God
knows I tried not to be.

466
00:15:58,407 --> 00:15:59,373
Okay, listen up.

467
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,086
A few things you should know.

468
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,320
If we come under fire

469
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:03,611
that back window pops out.

470
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:06,480
And if anyone tries to steal
anything, let them take it.

471
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,982
Remember to stay clear of...

472
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,628
Wait, wait. Bulletproof vest...

473
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,129
I'm supposed to wear this?

474
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,520
Remember to stay clear of
the cabinets while we're moving

475
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,522
and sit down.

476
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,458
Ah, this is great.

477
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,003
Mr. Jennings.

478
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,071
Yes?

479
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:31,116
I'm Jeanie Boulet.

480
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,106
This is Dr. Doyle.

481
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,141
Hello.

482
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,274
How is Sophie?

483
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,375
Is she all right?

484
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,971
She's in extremely
serious condition.

485
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:45,230
Has your wife been
depressed lately?

486
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,687
The past few months

487
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:51,726
Sophie's gotten so weak,
she can barely sit up now.

488
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,545
She won't talk to her friends.

489
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,047
I, uh, have to beg her to eat.

490
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,749
Does she take antidepressants?

491
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,784
They don't help anymore.

492
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,238
We found a significant
level in her blood and urine.

493
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,908
We think she attempted suicide.

494
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,961
I've been praying...

495
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:15,466
What to do, how
to help her... but...

496
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:19,070
She's been praying to die.

497
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,040
Oh!

498
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,454
Hey, Susan, welcome back.

499
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,756
Whoa. Dr. Lewis, how you doing?

500
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,046
Good.

501
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,547
Hi, Dr. Lewis.

502
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,694
Welcome back.

503
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,783
Thank you.

504
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,851
How are you?

505
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,952
<i>What</i> are you?

506
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,932
A kangaroo without
the head part.

507
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:37,956
Nice.

508
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:38,991
Susan, hi.

509
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,025
Oh, Mark.

510
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,059
Welcome back.

511
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,126
You look, uh...

512
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,006
Oh... I look wet,
but I feel great.

513
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,841
Susan, it's good
to have you back.

514
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,042
Thank you.

515
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,277
Mark, you signed up for
that asthma patient in four?

516
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,312
Do you mind if I...?

517
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,336
Your research study?

518
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,569
I'd really appreciate it.

519
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,638
Uh-huh.

520
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,972
Good week?

521
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,189
Ha-ha-ha.

522
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,325
Fractured her spleen.

523
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,238
Yeah, and ruptured
her left kidney.

524
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,339
Did you find my dad?

525
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:01,606
Is he coming to see me?

526
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,909
Shh-shh. Try not to
talk right now, okay?

527
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,099
Where am I going?

528
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,379
We're going to take
you in for an operation

529
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:08,647
to make you all better.

530
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,871
Please. I want my dad.

531
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:11,272
Is he okay?

532
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,484
Yeah, he's okay.

533
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,854
We'll talk about it
later though, all right?

534
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:16,010
Will you come see me?

535
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,489
Yeah, I will, but right now

536
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,330
try and relax and
get some sleep.

537
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,948
You're going to be fine.

538
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,202
I didn't know what to say.

539
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,505
I didn't want to upset
her before the surgery.

540
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,284
Patient should have
been told the truth.

541
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,241
Which could have
upset her to the extent

542
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,110
that we may have
had to delay surgery.

543
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,277
Good instincts, Carter.

544
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,613
Why don't you go on in

545
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,414
and look after her
till we're ready?

546
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,415
Okay.

547
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,650
Dr. Benton, I've got

548
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,986
a diaphragmatic hernia
scheduled in two hours.

549
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,487
Are you free?

550
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,555
Yeah.

551
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,201
Good, 'cause I have a conflict.

552
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,537
I promised some of
the children on the ward

553
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,105
I'd take them trick-or-treating.

554
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,573
Could you handle that for me?

555
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,830
Yeah. Yeah.

556
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,198
Great.

557
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,266
I can't believe

558
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,135
you never made it to Hawaii.

559
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,371
Turns out the fear of
flying cannot be conquered.

560
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,407
Man, when we landed in Phoenix

561
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,443
the attendants had to
carry me off the plane.

562
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,690
The thought of getting
on another plane

563
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,080
was unbearable.

564
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,382
Thanks. Anyway,
Phoenix was great.

565
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,317
Chloe's still sober

566
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,087
still working as a
claims adjuster...

567
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,724
Six months now... And
little Susie was fabulous.

568
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,826
You know, she just...

569
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,029
She made me laugh.

570
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,666
Anyway, how are you?

571
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,902
Ah, I don't want
to talk about it.

572
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,921
Pretty bad, actually.

573
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,034
Kerry's got Anspaugh
wrapped around her finger.

574
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:38,358
He went gaga over
her research project.

575
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:39,927
He wants me to do one on pus.

576
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:40,962
Pus?

577
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,007
Not to mention

578
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,297
the fact that he's
practically given her

579
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,899
the one and only tenure slot

580
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,912
so I have no career, no future.

581
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,669
You know...

582
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:52,739
Really, I... I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

583
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,992
Sure, Mark. Whatever.

584
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,294
So, you hungry?

585
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,140
You want to get
something to eat?

586
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,730
We can go over to Doc's.

587
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,882
Oh, gosh, I ate the
whole way home

588
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:04,101
on the train.

589
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,571
So, there's a Halloween
party tonight at the Jazz Note.

590
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:08,672
Thinking maybe

591
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,069
if you're not too tired...?

592
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:11,776
Oh.

593
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:12,843
Well...

594
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,329
Hey, the whole staff's going.

595
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,747
That sounds great.

596
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,965
Great.

597
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,516
Yikes.

598
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,334
Where did these come from?

599
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,090
Some drug rep was
giving them away.

600
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,909
Whoa.

601
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:31,044
Here you go.

602
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,763
This is helpful, right here.

603
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,281
Look at this.

604
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,268
You got your gauze,
you got your penicillin.

605
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,869
When was this stuff stocked?

606
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,920
Look at this.

607
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,371
1989?

608
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,108
Yeah, well, this healthmobile's
from Southside, remember?

609
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,543
Their budget's even
tighter than ours.

610
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,413
Whoa!

611
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,449
Do you get the feeling

612
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,051
he doesn't care about us?

613
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,638
Hey, Carol...

614
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,850
What are you doing

615
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:01,308
with a physics book
in your backpack?

616
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,387
It's not mine.

617
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:03,455
It's a friend's.

618
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,578
Yeah, you just borrowed it

619
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:05,946
for a little late night reading?

620
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,025
Very funny. Give it back.

621
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:07,998
Oh, man, look at this.

622
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,211
Doug! This is truly hateful.

623
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,235
I'm getting flashbacks.

624
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:10,968
You two ready?

625
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,714
Yes, thank you, we're ready.

626
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,604
Yeah.

627
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,739
Welcome to Gonorrhea land.

628
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,380
Ah, this is... truly depressing.

629
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,084
Yup. It's like county
on a slow night.

630
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,163
Here's your first customer.

631
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,488
Uh...

632
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,667
Come on in.

633
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,971
All right.

634
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,571
What seems to be the problem?

635
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,672
Where are the cookies?

636
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,496
Sir, if you could
just tell us...?

637
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,630
Where are the cookies?!

638
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,988
Is she in pain?

639
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:51,358
I don't think so.

640
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,212
First time in two years.

641
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:59,333
I love you, Sophie.

642
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,101
I love you.

643
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:12,480
This morning, she was different.

644
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:15,399
Smiling like she used to.

645
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,685
She wanted me

646
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,221
to comb her hair, help
her with some lipstick.

647
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,626
Then she looked
at me and said...

648
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,812
"I'm ready."

649
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,372
She begged me.

650
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,077
I counted them out,
crushed them up

651
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,478
put them in some milk.

652
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,497
I held the glass to her mouth.

653
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,518
She said, "I love you"

654
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:55,689
and the next thing you know...

655
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:57,607
She was asleep

656
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,410
and I got scared

657
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,764
called the ambulance.

658
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,833
Her whole life, she helped me.

659
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,903
I wasn't strong
enough to help her.

660
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,513
I can't lose her.

661
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:21,498
I can't.

662
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,573
Can I help you?

663
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,541
Uh, yeah, do you have
those, uh, animal things

664
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,843
that pediatricians use?

665
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,861
Oh. Pocket peek-a-boos.

666
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:36,230
Oh. Uh...

667
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,887
Well, maybe the beanbag bunnies.

668
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:44,405
Uh, we also have
dinosaur pencils.

669
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,407
Those are my favorites.

670
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:49,943
Brontosaurus,
Stegosaurus, Dimetrodon.

671
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,711
Just the paper.

672
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,698
So, Dr. Keaton got you
down here buying props, eh?

673
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,750
No, no, no. I'm just
down here looking around.

674
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:57,846
She sends down

675
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,203
all the residents who
don't much like kids.

676
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,439
I like kids.

677
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,569
Sure, you do.

678
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:04,674
We all like kids.

679
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,978
Bears are playing
Tampa Bay this weekend.

680
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:10,430
Hardly need to watch that one.

681
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:14,117
Tyrannosaurus Rex?

682
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,803
Debby, your lungs are clear.

683
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,038
Thank heavens.

684
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,241
I'm always so
worried about germs.

685
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,009
Don't I know you?

686
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,779
No, you don't.

687
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:27,414
You sure we haven't met?

688
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:28,782
Yep, I'm sure.

689
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:29,883
I know.

690
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,218
It was at the club 99, right?

691
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:34,238
Debby, you're done.

692
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,772
Got it?

693
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,909
I was just kidding around.

694
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,644
Anybody else out there?

695
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,531
Only about 20 or 30 more.

696
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,067
Ah! Oh, my god!

697
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,336
Oh, my God!

698
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:50,937
Please, help me!

699
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,105
Hang on! Hang on!

700
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,007
We're not equipped
for a stabbing.

701
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,275
Gus, call an ambulance!

702
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,543
Help me!

703
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,645
Oh, it hurts!

704
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:59,713
Give me some gauze.

705
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,980
Larger. Give me larger.

706
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:04,868
Trick or treat.

707
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:08,956
That's not funny.

708
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,871
Where's my treat?

709
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:14,495
You know, we're all out.

710
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,374
Can I get a couple condoms?

711
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:17,531
How old are you?

712
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:20,084
Eighteen.

713
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,053
18. Why don't you come
back when you're 15?

714
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,589
Screw it, my dates
don't like them anyway.

715
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,957
Hey, wait a minute.

716
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,236
What's your name?

717
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,659
Charlie.

718
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,606
Charlie, you
working the streets?

719
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,730
What do you think?

720
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,831
I think that you're
at risk for AIDS.

721
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,128
Charlie, where are you living?

722
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:39,453
In a penthouse on
Lake Shore Drive.

723
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,459
Hey.

724
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:47,927
Hey! Hey.

725
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,175
Here. You be careful
out there, all right?

726
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,332
Thanks, old man.

727
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,336
Little Susie was so cute.

728
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:58,472
She thinks the word
for cactus is "ouch"

729
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:01,375
so we'd go on a walk,
and she'd point everywhere

730
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,609
going, "Ouch, ouch, ouch!"

731
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,663
Jerry.

732
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,676
I've called
maintenance four times.

733
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,943
They're working on it.

734
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,568
Oh, maybe it's the
ghost up on the fifth floor.

735
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,604
Not you too.

736
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,070
It's a true story, Mark.

737
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,189
He's up there.

738
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:16,690
Poor guy... still pining away

739
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:17,957
for the woman he loved.

740
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,094
I thought he broke her heart.

741
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:21,189
Broke his own
heart is more like it.

742
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,691
And how do you know this?

743
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:26,116
Because that's the story.

744
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,486
It was Halloween night,
the 1930s, or something

745
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,988
up on the fifth floor.

746
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,001
There was rain and thunder

747
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,124
and lightning.

748
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,391
He was a doctor

749
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,488
she was an intern.

750
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,156
She loved him, didn't she?

751
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,997
But a really wealthy,
handsome patient

752
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,065
had fallen in love with her,

753
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,034
and asked her to marry him.

754
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:44,951
What did she say?

755
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:45,952
She didn't know what

756
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:48,788
to say, so she told the doctor.

757
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:50,040
What did he say?

758
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,076
He said nothing.

759
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,510
I thought he loved her.

760
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,385
He did love her but
he just stood there.

761
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,830
He couldn't get the words out.

762
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,382
And then, after she
walked across the room

763
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,135
she turned back
and looked at him.

764
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,516
She put her hand to her lips

765
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,723
and blew him what
would be their first

766
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,885
and only kiss.

767
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,793
They say it blew through him

768
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,511
like a rush of cold wind.

769
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,913
That is so sad.

770
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,592
Well, what happened?

771
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:16,450
Unfortunately, the doc

772
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:18,134
fell out the fifth floor window

773
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,470
so that's kind of it.

774
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:23,006
I'm sure they worked on
him in the OR for a while.

775
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,838
Hey, John, you seen Benton?

776
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,762
No, not for a couple of hours.

777
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:31,431
He's got me pulling
journal articles

778
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:32,677
on Dieulafuoy's lesions.

779
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,767
Dieula... what?

780
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:34,802
Never heard of it.

781
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:35,947
Here's your chance.

782
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:37,237
No, thanks.

783
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,742
Dr. Keaton?

784
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:43,610
Hi.

785
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:44,922
How's she doing?

786
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:46,045
Pretty well.

787
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,649
Pressure's 100/75.

788
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,817
Kidney is still working.

789
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:54,187
I'll stay with her until
she comes out of it.

790
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:56,272
I thought you had
a lot of discharges.

791
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,257
Oh, they're done.

792
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,709
Mostly.

793
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,378
Call me when she wakes up.

794
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,631
I need to tell her
about her father.

795
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,934
Dr. Keaton...

796
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,272
I think I need to tell
her about her father.

797
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,425
<i>I'm saying it's none
of your business.</i>

798
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,559
I'm just curious

799
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,644
you know, if you're thinking
about medical school.

800
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,846
You're done. It's just
a physics class, Doug,

801
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,803
which I doubt I'll
even make it through

802
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,304
much less go to medical school

803
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,207
which I'm not even
thinking about yet.

804
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,385
Hey Doc! We got a guy

805
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,575
staggering out here.

806
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,827
Help!

807
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,530
Help me!

808
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,265
Move, move, move!

809
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,566
Look out.

810
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,401
Hey, what is it?

811
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,550
Call 911. He's been stabbed.

812
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:46,801
Set up an IV.

813
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,253
Anybody see what happened here?

814
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:52,346
Did anybody see what happened?

815
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:54,414
Look out, Look out!

816
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,584
I couldn't find an angiocath,
but I got an 18-gauge needle.

817
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,798
Jab it into his antecubital vein

818
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,466
and tape his arm down.

819
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,022
Come on, buddy.

820
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,441
Okay, I'm in.

821
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,544
Tape this down.

822
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,112
What's going on?

823
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,314
We got company.

824
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,296
Okay, we're losing him.

825
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,131
I'll do a cutdown. Out here?

826
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,800
We got to get
more fluids in him.

827
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,135
You got a scalpel...
Anything sharp in there?

828
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,292
Uh, no.

829
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,927
Here. Use these.

830
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:26,129
All right.

831
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,130
Hey, doc.

832
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,816
Ambulance'll be
here in 15 minutes.

833
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,196
He's not going to
make it that long.

834
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,719
How fast will that thing go?

835
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:33,831
Faster than waiting
for the ambulance.

836
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,787
Let's do it. Come on.

837
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:35,833
Let's go.

838
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,137
Pick him up.

839
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:40,694
Mr. Jennings.

840
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:44,564
Mr. Jennings, I need to
turn off the monitor now.

841
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,539
Time of Death: 8:53.

842
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,544
Would you like to stay
with her for a while?

843
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:59,596
Thank you.

844
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,836
What I did...

845
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:10,189
I don't know if it
was right or wrong.

846
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,010
She was in a lot of pain.

847
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,512
Our whole marriage,
it-it was never

848
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,010
about giving up on life.

849
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,234
This is not who we were.

850
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,639
You stayed with her.

851
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,926
You helped her
when she needed you.

852
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:32,262
I think that's who you were.

853
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,984
I've got an ET tube, but I
can't find a laryngoscope.

854
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,135
All right, I'm going
to have to go in blind.

855
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,603
All right, Gus, you
made your point.

856
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:46,837
You want to get there

857
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:47,994
don't you?

858
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:49,039
All right. He's tubed.

859
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:50,797
Give me the ambu bag.

860
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:51,832
It's right here.

861
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,051
Hit it.

862
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,786
All right, we're in.

863
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:57,854
What are you doing?

864
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,034
I'm going to put
him in trendelenburg.

865
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,358
I'm having trouble.

866
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,536
What?

867
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,727
My ambu bag's got a leak.

868
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,596
I need some tape.

869
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,831
Thanks. Yeah.

870
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,814
Dr. Keaton asked me to tell you

871
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,273
the trick-or-treaters
are waiting.

872
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,540
All right. Thanks.

873
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,187
And I have the journal articles

874
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,255
when you want them.

875
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,245
Mm-hmm. You write
the post-op notes?

876
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,679
Yes.

877
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,681
Good. If you can, uh...

878
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,386
pull the drains on
the pyloroplasty.

879
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,189
Why are you riding me?

880
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,490
You're an intern.

881
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:35,669
I bust my ass

882
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,461
and you give me a
mediocre evaluation.

883
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,198
Well, most interns
do mediocre work.

884
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,599
I don't.

885
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,234
Well, you could do better.

886
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,430
So can Carter.

887
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,647
So can everyone.

888
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,549
Yeah, well, you
have to do better.

889
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,672
I have to do better.

890
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,174
Is that because I'm black?

891
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,675
Is that your message here?

892
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,330
Let me ask you something.

893
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:59,349
When you applied
to medical school,

894
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:00,650
did you check the box?

895
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,936
Did you check
"African-American"?

896
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:05,016
I worked as hard as
everyone else to get in here.

897
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,007
Well, that's not what
most people think.

898
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:09,926
They assume you checked the
box to get preferential treatment.

899
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,245
They assume you
exist to fill a quota.

900
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,725
Now, if you want
to prove them wrong

901
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:16,149
you have to work twice
as hard, stay twice as late

902
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,150
to be twice as good.

903
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,546
You think I need
you to tell me that?

904
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,803
Ah, well, so we understand

905
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,033
each other, so we don't
have a problem, now, do we?

906
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:24,590
Did you check the box?

907
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,043
No.

908
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,323
Maybe you should
just tell people.

909
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,380
That way, you won't
have to go around

910
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,295
and keep proving
it all the time.

911
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,652
Hi, there.

912
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,155
You stayed.

913
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,006
You did really well.

914
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,242
You're going to be fine.

915
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,679
I wanted to talk to you.

916
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,683
I have something
I need to tell you.

917
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,652
About my dad?

918
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:13,239
Yes.

919
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,176
He died, didn't he?

920
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,280
Is that it?

921
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,170
Yes.

922
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,585
What do we got?

923
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,553
Knife wound to the abdomen.

924
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,632
He's stabilized. Needs a lap.

925
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,123
Okay, let's get
him up to the OR.

926
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,469
Hey, how is it out there?
I'm going next week.

927
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,636
Oh, no big deal.

928
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,959
Real smooth, Malik.

929
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,461
Bring cookies.

930
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,463
Well, that's it.

931
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,299
All right. Have a
good night, Gus.

932
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,702
But, I'm not going
to say anything

933
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:00,970
about that physics book.

934
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,306
Oh, God, it was
probably a stupid idea.

935
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,742
Hey, if it's what
you want to do.

936
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,311
Look, if I can make
it, anybody can.

937
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,746
Thanks.

938
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:18,967
You going to the
Halloween party?

939
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:20,290
No. Can't make it.

940
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,970
I hear Haleh's really good.

941
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,459
Yeah, she is.

942
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,428
I heard her sing last Christmas.

943
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,966
That case with
Mr. Jennings today?

944
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,220
When I saw him watching her...

945
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,200
and holding her hand...

946
00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:39,676
Kind of saw what their
whole life had been...

947
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:43,163
made me wish that
we could save her

948
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:45,477
just so that we could save him.

949
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,083
What do you mean?

950
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,236
He's alone, left
with all the pain.

951
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:54,473
She fell asleep in
her husband's arms.

952
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,321
I'll see you.

953
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,646
Dr. Greene, I'm going to
remind you one more time.

954
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,148
I'm on my way.

955
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,817
I'm going to take Susan
with me for protection.

956
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,986
Protection from what?

957
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:26,088
The ghost on the fifth floor.

958
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,302
Why do we have to go up there?

959
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,626
A guy corked off.

960
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,127
I have to pronounce him.

961
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,662
You're not scared, are you?

962
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,824
Of course not.

963
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:37,951
Mark?

964
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,285
Susan.

965
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,298
Oh, good. You're still there.

966
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:42,822
Where would I go?

967
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:44,685
Hey, hey, hey! Slow
down, Slow down.

968
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,621
All right. That's it.
That's it. Come on.

969
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,755
Come on. We're going back.

970
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,524
It's past your bedtimes,
anyway. Let's go.

971
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,025
Please can we go
to one more floor?

972
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,181
Yeah, one more floor.

973
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,360
Be a sport, Peter.

974
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,717
Yeah. Be a sport, Peter.

975
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,836
Nurse B'jerk would let us.

976
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:58,755
<i>Bjerke.</i> And yes, I would.

977
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,167
All right, all right.
Look. Let's...

978
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,059
We'll go to the ER,
but that's it, all right?

979
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,427
Mister, Mister!

980
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,473
What, what?

981
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,263
I have to pee bad.

982
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,448
Oh, man. All right.

983
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:09,560
The rest of you just hold hands

984
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,828
until I get back and
don't move okay?

985
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,653
What do you think
we are, babies?

986
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:15,032
Just-just don't move.

987
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,066
Come on.

988
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,167
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah!

989
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,459
We really have to do this now?

990
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,406
I guess we could
wait till daylight.

991
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,095
He'll only have been dead

992
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,464
about ten hours.

993
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:31,971
Oh, my!

994
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:33,639
Next bed, doctor.

995
00:36:33,674 --> 00:36:35,474
Sorry.

996
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,990
You're not scared, huh?

997
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:49,633
Oh! Did you just feel that?

998
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:51,291
What?

999
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:53,804
You're going to think I'm crazy.

1000
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:55,295
Feel what?

1001
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,358
I swear to you, it was just like

1002
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,661
a rush of wind went through me.

1003
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,985
You are crazy.

1004
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,969
Oh, boy!

1005
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:04,053
Did you feel it?

1006
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,738
No, I didn't feel anything.

1007
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:08,140
Oh, boy!

1008
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:10,660
You felt it, didn't you?

1009
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,446
Dr. Carter...

1010
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,515
Did you tell her?

1011
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,662
She knew. She
said that her father

1012
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:19,930
had been with her
during the surgery

1013
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:21,716
and had kissed her good-bye.

1014
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,189
Kids know.

1015
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:26,158
It's as though their
parents' spirit joins them

1016
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:28,194
and they just seem to know.

1017
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:29,696
Yeah. I knew.

1018
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:31,959
My brother died
of leukemia, and...

1019
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,061
I was riding my bike
home from school one day

1020
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,046
and I just knew
that he had died.

1021
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,682
It was like he was with me.

1022
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:39,005
I could feel him.

1023
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,390
Maybe that's why
you're good with kids.

1024
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,912
See you in the morning.

1025
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,361
Hey! Where are those kids at?

1026
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,117
What?

1027
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:53,319
The kids!

1028
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,920
I-I don't know where they went.

1029
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:58,391
Hey! Come here! Come on!

1030
00:37:58,426 --> 00:37:59,770
How could you just let
them walk away like that?

1031
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:00,904
I was doing some paper work.

1032
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:01,972
I looked up and they
were gone, okay?

1033
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,880

What's the problem?

1050
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:03,367
She's making
everything so competitive.

1051
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,358
You're a doctor;
you love competition.

1052
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:07,093
You're just getting
a little obsessed.

1053

myopic, then.

What?

1056
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:14,900
Your wife divorced you.

1057
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,102

00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,840
was stabbing anyone in the back.

1061
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,276
I could just drop everything,

1062
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:25,010
take a nice little
walk with Susie.

1063
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:28,147
Big decision of the day was,
like, what to have for lunch.

1064

Didn't you ever
go trick-or-treating?

Yes, I've gone
trick-or-treating.

What did you go as?

1078
00:39:58,413 --> 00:39:59,662
I don't know.

1079
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,131
One time, I went as a scientist.

1080
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,950
Bet no one gave<i> you</i> any candy.

1081
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,062
Let me tell you something.

1082
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:06,285
See, when I was your age

1083
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,704
we used to have to
do tricks to get treats.

1084
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,934
Bet you can't do one now.

1085
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,258
Yeah! Do a trick! Do a trick!

1086
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:14,255
Do a trick! Do a trick!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1088
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,099
Just one.

1089
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,100
How was that?

1090
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,616
That was it?

1091
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,655
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

1092
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,092
They say those trains
run every ten minutes

1093
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,827

1095
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,581
What?

1096
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:10,983
One unbelievable
excuse after another.

1097
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:12,652
Look, I said I'm sorry.

1098
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:13,997
Of course, I never
changed, either.

1099
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,171
"Just hang in there, Jeanie.

1100
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,939
"Carry this
marriage by yourself.

1101
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,991
"Don't think about
where he is tonight

1102
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:20,376
who he's with tonight."

1103
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:21,878
Jeanie, what's wrong?

1104
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,897
Hmm...

1105
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:30,319
A man came in today

1106
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,322
and sat there and
watched his wife die...

1107
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,742
and he helped her to die

1108
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:40,179
because she was in so
much pain, and he loved her.

1109
00:41:45,954 --> 00:41:48,371
But we didn't have
that kind of marriage,

1110
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:49,339
did we, Al?

1111
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:50,623
We didn't love,

1112
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,740
we didn't cherish

1113
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,042
we didn't respect

1114
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,877
and now, you've killed me.

1115
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,040
This drink is strong.

1116
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:10,643
I think I should've
eaten something, maybe.

1117
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:12,990
Yeah, we should've grabbed
something before this.

1118
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:14,647
Yeah.

1119
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:16,160
You want to...?

1120
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:19,318
Go ahead.

1121
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:23,156
You're probably too tired
after your trip to dance.

1122
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:24,991
Well, kind of, but...

1123
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,492
So maybe later.

1124
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:29,262
I guess I'm up for it.
