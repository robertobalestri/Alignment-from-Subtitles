1
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,695
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:15,041
The flight rotation was, like

3
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:16,809
the highlight of my residency.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,799
You'll be fine.

5
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,301
I'll be thousands
of feet in the air

6
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:21,236
in something shaped
like a baked potato

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,871
with a frat beanie on it.

8
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,973
Actually, it's only
hundreds of feet.

9
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:32,281
Oh, God!

10
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:37,018
Don't they have
ambulances in the sticks?

11
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:38,365
They don't have a trauma center

12
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:39,532
in Boone County.

13
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,189
So if it's bad, we go.

14
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,257
How far?

15
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,858
50, 60 Miles.

16
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:46,027
Oh, no. Didn't you know

17
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:48,330
this was a requirement
for your residency?

18
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:49,798
What was I thinking?

19
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,834
All right, deep breath.

20
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:55,470
Let it out slowly.

21
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:57,639
Okay.

22
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:59,274
My knees won't move!

23
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,409
Come on. Stay low.

24
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:14,990
Dee McManus, Susan Lewis.

25
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,291
Hi.

26
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,559
First flight?

27
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:27,669
The sum of the angles

28
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:30,255
in a triangle equals
180 degrees, right?

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,256
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,257
Hey, Carol.

31
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,908
Hi, uh, Doug.

32
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:34,944
Hi.

33
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,096
Doug Ross, this
is William Litman.

34
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,959
William is my lab partner.

35
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:40,999
No kidding.

36
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:43,852
How's it going?

37
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,721
You know, I have an

38
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:47,233
intuitive 19th-century
Euclidean mind.

39
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:48,368
Congratulations.

40
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:49,758
It's actually crippling

41
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,221
to the understanding
of the geometric

42
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,694
projection of the universe.

43
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,756
I'm flunking out.

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,696
So, what are you working on?

45
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:56,009
I used to be pretty
good at physics.

46
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,033
String theory. It explains

47
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,308
the multi-dimensional
curvature of time and space.

48
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:00,869
Oh.

49
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,321
"Oh" is right.

50
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:06,057
So, the Riemannian manifold
is N-dimensional space

51
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,309
that locally looks like
M-dimensional space

52
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:10,662
when M is less than N.

53
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,785
Situation, one five Yankee.

54
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,732
We're at contact
point five miles...

55
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,388
Susan, take a look.

56
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,058
It's beautiful.

57
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,760
W-what are you doing?

58
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,161
I'm hyperventilating.

59
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:27,373
Leave me alone.

60
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,529
Oh, God.

61
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,498
You should really

62
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,245
check out the view, okay?

63
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,786
'Cause it helps you
set your gyroscope.

64
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,456
What was that?

65
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,523
It was the pilot.

66
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,507
He was just

67
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:41,171
adjusting the rotor pitch.

68
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,578
Absolutely normal.

69
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:45,146
Right. Normal.

70
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,193
I got a visual on you, Air-Vac.

71
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:48,233
Do you read?

72
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,600
There it is.

73
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,172
Oh, man.

74
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,024
We're first on scene.

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,426
We're going to need

76
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,139
the o-neg and blood y's.

77
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,896
There's a field to your 5:00.

78
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,483
Oh... God.

79
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,050
Oh, God.

80
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,518
Oh, oh, God.

81
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:25,069
Oh, God.

82
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,680
Stay low and
watch the tail rotor.

83
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,814
We got five victims.

84
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,949
A truck and a van hit head-on.

85
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,685
Two ejected, three are trapped.

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,520
Where's fire response?

87
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,022
Two engines and an
ambulance are en route.

88
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,290
ETA?

89
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,626
30 Minutes. They're
all volunteer out here.

90
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,894
We'll triage first. Susan,
you check the car.

91
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,719
It's all right, sweetie.

92
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:00,122
Oh, my God!

93
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,157
It's okay.

94
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,959
Please get us out of this car!

95
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,060
Okay.

96
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,613
Yes, I'm still holding
for authorization.

97
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,282
Hello?

98
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:01,961
So, Dallas by three, you think?

99
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:03,451
ER, Hold on.

100
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:04,719
I don't think, Bubba. I know.

101
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:06,922
ICU's got no beds until 1999.

102
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:08,423
And they're sending
us two vents.

103
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,424
Terrific.

104
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,459
Way to go, Mr. Gomez. Good job.

105
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:13,594
Chuny, we need
more ivacs in three.

106
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,031
Patrick Brazil, Metastatic
prostate cancer.

107
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,733
Cough, fever, two months
progressive weakness.

108
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,902
BP 150/70.

109
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:23,504
Gave 300cc's of saline.

110
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,806
He's a no-code.

111
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:25,941
Inn's full. Exam four.

112
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:29,043
I've been Mr. B's
caretaker for 22 years.

113
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,245
He wants to be
cryogenically preserved

114
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:32,714
when he deanimates.

115
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,448
He wants to what?

116
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,350
Be put on ice when he croaks.

117
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,997
Frozen? Like a popsicle.

118
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,387
He's been waiting eight years

119
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,889
to join Mrs. B.

120
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,568
In their suspension capsule.

121
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,659
Easy, now. One, two, three.

122
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:46,489
His wife's been
frozen for eight years?

123
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,697
Yes, it was their
50th-anniversary present

124
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,332
to each other.

125
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,862
Faint pulse, poor
respiratory effort.

126
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,664
They want to be preserved
together so that they

127
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,321
can come back in the future

128
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,524
just like those
dinosaurs in that movie.

129
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,660
Isn't it romantic?

130
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,447
Let's hang a Dobutamine drip,

131
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,015
start at ten mikes per kilo

132
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,028
and titrate to a
systolic of 100.

133
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,430
Settle down, Mr. Sotcheck.

134
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,288
Rescue 116's bringing
in a rule-out MI.

135
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:14,623
We're swamped.

136
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,335
Who's covering
Haleh's vacation shift?

137
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,937
Got a float coming at 9:00.

138
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,506
The last nurse who floated down

139
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,040
here hid in the
bathroom all day.

140
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,030
Who is it?

141
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:23,676
Sterling, from Med-surg West.

142
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,666
Rhonda Sterling?

143
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,212
Yeah. What's wrong with her?

144
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,368
She's a floor nurse.

145
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:29,549
Oh, come on, guys.
Give her a chance.

146
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:30,939
I'm not baby-sitting her.

147
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,340
Me, neither.

148
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,777
Fire's out!

149
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,822
What's your name?

150
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:39,080
Gail. She's only ten days old.

151
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,648
Is she all right?

152
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:41,995
She's moving and crying.

153
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,363
Those are good signs.

154
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:44,430
I'm Dr. Lewis.

155
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:45,753
What's your name?

156
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:46,421
Zach.

157
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:47,289
Uh-huh.

158
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,834
Gail, does your neck hurt?

159
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:49,824
Is he all right? Gail?

160
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:50,825
Please help him.

161
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,860
Get a c-collar on her.

162
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,513
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

163
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,014
That's brain matter.

164
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,550
Guy's a goner.

165
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,728
Let's get him on oxygen.

166
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,940
Where, Zach? Your neck?

167
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,843
No. No!

168
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:25,878
Does this hurt?

169
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,514
David? David!

170
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,849
Where's my husband?

171
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,618
Gail, where are you hurt?

172
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,789
My... my right leg and my side.

173
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,490
David, please!

174
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,192
Dr. Greene's working on him.

175
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,643
My husband's a doctor.

176
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,195
He has to check on the children.

177
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,213
Susan!

178
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:46,548
He's a pediatrician.

179
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,883
Susan!

180
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,217
Go. I'll stand by.

181
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,120
Okay. I'm going to go
check on your husband.

182
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,805
I'll be right back.

183
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,412
The trucker's gone.

184
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,813
I need you over here.

185
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,514
He's still moving.

186
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,917
He's pulseless, with
massive head trauma.

187
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,337
I've got a tension
hemo-pneumo that we can save.

188
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:13,608
Needle him, left side.

189
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,215
He's decompressing.

190
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:28,823
32 French.

191
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,305
This guy's a pediatrician.

192
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:33,627
Really?

193
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,629
Yep. His family's in the van...

194
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,498
Wife and newborn baby girl.

195
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,900
Both stable.

196
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,236
There's a boy about
eight years old...

197
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,932
Leforte two facial fracture.

198
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,089
I'm worried about his airway.

199
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,159
I'm in. Hook it up
to the Foley bag.

200
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,493
He's hemorrhaging.

201
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,162
Grab two units o-neg

202
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,541
out of the cooler. Okay.

203
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,416
I'll start a line.

204
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,751
Please! What about my baby?

205
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,431
Gail, we're getting you out.

206
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,754
Hang in there.

207
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,289
Yeah, I'm still holding.

208
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:06,695
Hey, you like Green Bay,
minus seven, over Washington?

209
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,375
I thought the World Series
was over. Excuse me.

210
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,699
Hang on one second.

211
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,200
Please don't tell!

212
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,422
Please don't tell! Mommy!

213
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,601
Where do you want him?

214
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,458
Don't tell my mom, please!

215
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,970
Curtain area three,
end of the hall.

216
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,295
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

217
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,731
Don't tell her, please!

218
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,001
No! Don't tell her!

219
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,335
Uh...

220
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,704
Carol Hathaway.

221
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,055
Carol...

222
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,392
Hi.

223
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,728
I was pulled off my ward
and assigned down here.

224
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,062
Rhonda, right?

225
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,731
What patient do
you want me to take?

226
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,065
Well, actually

227
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,734
we share patients here.

228
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,569
Let me show you.

229
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:51,172
Over here are the patients
that are waiting to be seen.

230
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,742
Nursing orders are
flagged and put over here.

231
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:54,954
So, when you're
going to have a...

232
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,522
I'll take Mr. Washington.

233
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,090
Where is Curtain Area Three?

234
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,748
There.

235
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:01,416
Thank you.

236
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,554
Secure his head.

237
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,890
All right, we need
to start a second line.

238
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,002
Got it right here.

239
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,271
Dr. Lewis, the boy
stopped breathing.

240
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:13,361
Oh, my God!

241
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:15,397
Go, go, go.

242
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:16,712
Watch his c-spine.

243
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:22,870
Keep in-line traction.

244
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,776
You're in the way.

245
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,778
Uh... there's too much blood.

246
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,279
I need suction.

247
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,014
6.0 Tube.

248
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,150
Another 6.0.

249
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,353
That was it.

250
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,354
Damn it.

251
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,824
Okay... 5.5.

252
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,475
Mark, I need your help!

253
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,977
Get him on the chopper.

254
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,157
David!

255
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,714
We're taking care of him, Gail.

256
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,310
Please don't let him die!

257
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,156
I can't see. Turn it up.

258
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,157
It is up.

259
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,502
There's better
control in the chopper.

260
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,286
Let's bag him and move him.

261
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,815
Ready?

262
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,617
One, two, three.

263
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,987
Doctor, I need
you to start this I.V.

264
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,322
Okay.

265
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:19,127
Go on. I'll check
it out. Thanks.

266
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,162
What's up?

267
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:21,891
She needs an I.V.
I tried and missed.

268
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,348
Oh, usually we try a few times

269
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,567
before we call a doc...
Especially an intern.

270
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,402
Up in Med-Surg,
we call the doctor

271
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,854
when we miss.

272
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,972
All right, I'll do it.

273
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,554
Mrs. Fesmire needs 20
of KCL in her I.V. in Three.

274
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,093
Why don't you go do that?

275
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,306
Where's the potassium?

276
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,764
It's in the med room under "P."

277
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,637
I can see the vocal cords.

278
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,005
I'm in.

279
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,496
I'll be right back.

280
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,230
Susan!

281
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:58,199
All right, Fred. Fire it up.

282
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,084
Susan!

283
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,956
How much longer?

284
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,557
20, 30 Minutes.

285
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,129
Gail, we're taking your
son and your husband

286
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,765
to County General
Hospital by helicopter.

287
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,067
Are they all right?

288
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,413
They're stable now, but they
need to go to a trauma center.

289
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,637
How will I know what's
happening to them?

290
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,984
I will get word to you, Gail.

291
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,448
Oh, please! Oh please!
I promise. I promise.

292
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,862
Oh, God! Oh, God!

293
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,803
Are you okay?

294
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,338
Uh... yeah.

295
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,264
It's Dr. Greene calling
from the whirlybird.

296
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,210
Why hasn't Mrs. Fesmire
gotten her potassium?

297
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,802
I'm on break.
I'm getting to her.

298
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:10,472
This is County General
on Beta Two. Go ahead.

299
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:13,052
We're incoming on Air-Vac
One with two major traumas.

300
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:15,677
Seven-year-old boy and
his dad, both multiple trauma.

301
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,744
Never mind that.

302
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,912
Grab Lydia and Chuny

303
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,358
and tell them to clear
the trauma rooms.

304
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,448
Go ahead, Air-Vac One.

305
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:21,599
I'm going to need a vent.

306
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,736
Good-bye, Mr. B.

307
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,429
You<i> will</i> keep him cold until
they come for him, won't you?

308
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,551
So that he could
be with his wife?

309
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,570
Mm. Okay.

310
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,999
Please. Sure.

311
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,139
Thank you.

312
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,310
Should I clean out the fridge?

313
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,894
What have you got?

314
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,564
Dad's got a hemo-pneumo
and a head trauma.

315
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,534
Seven-year-old had
an obstructed airway.

316
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,602
He's getting shocky.

317
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,573
Good job, Susan.

318
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,574
What?

319
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,411
I said good job.

320
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,412
Draw up meds.

321
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,925
Go.

322
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,760
Watch that I.V.
fluids wide open.

323
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,762
Let's get a cross-table, CBC.

324
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,331
Type and cross for four units

325
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,321
and dip a cath urine.

326
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:34,322
Move that.

327
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:36,157
Draw up a saline
flush, crash cart.

328
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,993
Where is the saline?

329
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,696
BP's only 65 palp.
Pulse 160. Thready

330
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,731
Whoa. He's waking up.

331
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,845
Hey, Zach. Hi. I'm Carol.

332
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:48,385
That tube in your throat
is helping you breathe.

333
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,487
Set up for a lavage.

334
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,033
Want a gas? Yep.

335
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,417
Blood gas kit, top drawer.

336
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:55,801
Got it. You do that.

337
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,098
All right.

338
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,183
See if you can

339
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,467
give me a hand.

340
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,239
Okay.

341
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,807
We got a bloody tap.

342
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,141
Page Benton.

343
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,593
See if the Dad'll sign

344
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,540
a consent form for an ex-lap.

345
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,797
Put that o-neg on
the rapid infuser.

346
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,815
He conscious?

347
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,184
He's responding to pain.

348
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,269
Dr. Herlihy

349
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:22,703
open your eyes.

350
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,817
Somebody needs to sign

351
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,001
his son's surgical consent

352
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,041
if he can't.

353
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:27,825
We'll do it.

354
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,970
BP's low, 70 palp.

355
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,138
Pulse ox is only 85.

356
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,424
Lydia, ask Jerry

357
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,475
to track down the
number of the hospital

358
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,577
in Boone County where they're
taking the mother and the baby.

359
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,379
I promised I'd let her
know how they are doing.

360
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,714
Did the heart sound
seem distant to you?

361
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,720
What are you thinking?

362
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:41,138
Tamponade?

363
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,524
Hang in there, Zach.

364
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,793
Will you hold him still?

365
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,306
He's scared to death.

366
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,495
He's got to be sedated.

367
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,542
Get him versed,
one milligram I.V.

368
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:51,843
Where is it? Top drawer.

369
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,078
It's clotted.

370
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,936
I need that saline. Let's go.

371
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,471
Zach, we're going to
to give you something

372
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:58,806
to help you sleep, okay?

373
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,391
It will help you sleep.

374
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,159
All right, here we go.

375
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,628
Hold him.

376
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,962
Whoa!

377
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,291
What was that? Does that hurt?

378
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,581
It hurts.

379
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:08,716
Are you sure

380
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,031
that's saline?

381
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,353
Oh, my God!

382
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,021
That's potassium.

383
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,150
How much went in?

384
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,308
Uh... about a quarter cc.

385
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,354
Insulin and glucose?

386
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,327
Where is it?!

387
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:20,027
Second drawer.

388
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,863
Okay, hold on.

389
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,798
It's probably not
enough to stop his heart.

390
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,553
I think we're going to be okay.

391
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,704
What do you got?

392
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,950
Got a seven-year-old

393
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,519
TC, Passenger, space intrusion

394
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:37,811
airway compromise
at the scene, intubated.

395
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,858
Peritoneal lavage was positive.

396
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,233
BP's crashing, 60 palp.

397
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,313
Pericardiocentesis tray.

398
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,636
Go ahead.

399
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,616
I'll draw up a central line.

400
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,784
Okay.

401
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,275
Hook an alligator
clip to an EKG lead.

402
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,311
Use V-1.

403
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,612
Not mine.

404
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,081
Uh, it's the patient's.

405
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,615
He's a doctor.

406
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,351
It might be his office.

407
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,353
Why don't you try
dialing the number?

408
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,933
Susan, Jerry called
Dwight Hospital.

409
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,001
The wife and baby
haven't arrived yet.

410
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,224
Are they on their way?

411
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,225
I don't know.

412
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,226
Well, find out.

413
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,505
What do we have?

414
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,063
Blunt abdominal trauma

415
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,697
Hypotensive
Intraperitoneal Hemorrhage

416
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,066
confirmed by lavage.

417
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,300
Probably his spleen.

418
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,003
Facial trauma, intubated
in the field with an RSI.

419
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,987
H and H is 11, 32.

420
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,939
Type and cross four.

421
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,373
650cc's of saline.

422
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,642
Versed on board.

423
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,888
Way to go, Carter.

424
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,989
All right, let's take him up.

425
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:28,979
Can I tie?

426
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,498
Where are his parents?

427
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:31,877
Second unit's in.

428
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:34,463
You've got his
partner to take call?

429
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,653
Right. Okay.

430
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,689
Okay, we'll let you know.

431
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,326
40cc's non-clotting blood...

432
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,562
Out.

433
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,498
Dr. Herlihy, you've
been in an accident.

434
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,333
You're in the ER.

435
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,180
BP's back up...

436
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,714
120/80. What do you got?

437
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,805
I'm worried about
an intracranial bleed.

438
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,718
Is he stable enough
for a head CT?

439
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,142
Nurse goes with him.

440
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,177
Am I on call?

441
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,456
No. You're a patient.

442
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,895
You were involved in

443
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:03,731
a serious traffic accident.

444
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,077
An accident?

445
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,318
Your son, Zach, has
just been taken up

446
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,353
to surgery.

447
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,353
Surgery?

448
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,565
He was injured

449
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,751
in the accident.

450
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:14,191
Accident? What accident?

451
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,787
Get a rush on that head CT.

452
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:19,466
Zach, everything's
going to be okay.

453
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:30,369
We could have killed that boy.

454
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:31,358
I got confused.

455
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:32,359
You have no business

456
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:33,710
working the ER.

457
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,446
You think I don't know that?

458
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,026
I want you to restock supplies

459
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,293
for the rest of the day.

460
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,584
I don't want you
anywhere near my patients.

461
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,764
Yes, this is Carol
Hathaway in the ER.

462
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,228
Clear a CT room, please.

463
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,917
Where's the number
for chopper dispatch?

464
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,017
Mark, can I run
something past you?

465
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,119
Sure.

466
00:18:58,154 --> 00:18:59,398
I've just got a sweet
old guy who died

467
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:00,699
and I don't know what to do

468
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,134
about his cryogenics request.

469
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:03,124
His what?

470
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,003
He and his wife
bought a tank for two

471
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:07,138
so they could be frozen
side-by-side when they died.

472
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,746
Where's his wife now?

473
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:09,763
In the tank.

474
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:10,781
Oh.

475
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,077
I have an 800 number

476
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,962
for a cryogenics
company in California.

477
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,586
Call it.

478
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,589
Yeah. Still holding.

479
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,330
What?

480
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,598
Nothing.

481
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,070
Yeah. Yeah, page me
as soon as you know.

482
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,505
Helicopter's standing by.

483
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,800
We may have to go back

484
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,659
and get the wife and the baby.

485
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:41,673
Okay. De Bakey.

486
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,775
5-0 Prolene on a castro viejo.

487
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,809
Retract caudally.

488
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,844
Retractor.

489
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,312
Splenic vein's repaired.

490
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,780
What about this pancreas?

491
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:51,438
The tail has most of
the devitalized tissue.

492
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:54,642
I'd resect rather than do a
subtotal pancreatectomy.

493
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:55,787
Good. I agree. Metz.

494
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:59,346
How would you
repair after resection?

495
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:00,459
Interrupted
horizontal mattresses

496
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,499
and a figure eight in
the pancreatic duct.

497
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,778
Go ahead. Do it. De Bakey.

498
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,202
3-0 Silk on a needle driver.

499
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,887
Anything else to do?

500
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,823
Irrigate, run the
bowel under control

501
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,325
insert a Jackson-Pratt drain

502
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,961
through a separate stab wound

503
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:16,213
and, uh, use cautery
instead of a scalpel

504
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,214
to minimize bleeding.

505
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,215
And after that?

506
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,594
Close. Keep it simple.

507
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,763
Do exactly what
you just described...

508
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,752
No more, no less.

509
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,054
Okay. All right,

510
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,990
cut the suture,
three millimeters

511
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:26,991
no longer.

512
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,409
Irrigate, normal saline.

513
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,211
Make sure it's warm.

514
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,415
Park her in the hall

515
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,095
until we can clear an exam room.

516
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,329
Jerry, you seen Susan?

517
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:38,563
Yeah, she got paged
to chopper duty.

518
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,054
You're kidding.

519
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,293
What's up?

520
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,961
I need ice, lots of ice.

521
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,129
Huh?

522
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,731
California cryonics
said to put him on ice

523
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,645
till their local rep arrives.

524
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,769
They'd better hurry.

525
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:00,754
McMANUS: Dr. Lewis.

526
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,944
Susan!

527
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,690
Are you sure you're all right?

528
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:07,548
Yeah. I want to bring them in.

529
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,882
I'll go.

530
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,951
No. No, I'm fine.

531
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:12,830
Really? You can
stay here with Herlihy.

532
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,854
No, really. I'm okay.

533
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,224
Dr. Lewis! We've got to go!

534
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:43,684
May I?

535
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,685
Hmm?

536
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,786
See your orders.

537
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,524
Okay.

538
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,171
John, will you take these to ICU

539
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,472
and make sure
they're carried out

540
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,107
as meticulously as written?

541
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:56,097
Sure.

542
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:58,332
Peter, care to join me
in a sarcoma resection?

543
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,779
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'd love to.

544
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,204
Good. Gant can
cover in trauma call.

545
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,005
Scrub in in 45 minutes.

546
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,708
Don't you just love her?

547
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,440
Where's Zach?

548
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,664
Where's my husband?

549
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,310
Your husband was
unconscious for quite a while.

550
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,450
He woke up confused
and disoriented.

551
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,186
He has a head injury?

552
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:20,721
What about my son?

553
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,106
He's in surgery.

554
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,291
Don't worry, Gail. Your
family's in good hands.

555
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:26,160
Move. Move.

556
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:27,594
Does this hurt?

557
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,595
Ah!

558
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:29,631
Yeah.

559
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,900
BP's okay. 115/65.

560
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,436
Get a c-spine, H and
H, type and cross for four

561
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:37,938
and dip a cath urine.

562
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:41,108
Got a good set of lungs on her.

563
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:43,321
Respiratory rate's kind of high.

564
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,079
Who knows with all that crying?

565
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,513
It's 60. Pulse 160.

566
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:47,848
Abdomen's distended

567
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:49,128
but she's been
taking in a lot of air.

568
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:50,362
Do you want a pedes
surgery consult?

569
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:55,389
Yeah. Get a baby-gram,
CBC, and a gas.

570
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:56,824
Hey, darling, are you hurt

571
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,126
or are you just
mad at the world?

572
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,366
What'll it be?

573
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,978
Do you believe in reincarnation?

574
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,301
Sure. Why not?

575
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:09,569
Next life, I'm coming back

576
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:11,071
as Cindy Crawford.

577
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:12,473
Could you do us a favor?

578
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,988
A deceased patient of mine
wants to be cryogenically preserved.

579
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,307
We got to freeze a dead guy.

580
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,630
You got any ice?

581
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,775
Neck looks okay.

582
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,933
CT was normal,
but dad's still altered

583
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,818
so they're doing an MRI.

584
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:26,620
Why did they take Megan away?

585
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,072
She's next door.
It's crowded in here.

586
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,069
We called upstairs.
Zach's out of surgery.

587
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,559
He's going to be all right?

588
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:33,661
He's in ICU.

589
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:35,573
I'll check on him
as soon as I can.

590
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:37,264
Oh, God. Oh, God.

591
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,116
I need my husband.

592
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,451
Please. Where...?

593
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,336
David. Please, where's David?

594
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:43,670
Please.

595
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:45,389
Her abdomen's kind of firm.

596
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,269
She swallowed a lot of air.

597
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,271
It's a tough call
with a newborn.

598
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,627
What should we do?

599
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,962
All right, what is it, Gant?

600
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,909
Well, I'm not sure. Abdomen's
persistently distended

601
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,066
she keeps crying and the
resps are high, in the 60s

602
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,402
but the BP, pulse
and color are okay.

603
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,215
Why didn't you drop an NG?

604
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,705
We considered it...

605
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,873
Stool guaiac.

606
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,386
In such a small baby?

607
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,944
Do it off the rectal
thermometer.

608
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,257
You didn't do a full
surgical evaluation

609
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,125
of the patient, Dr. Gant.

610
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,284
Shh, shh.

611
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,935
It's positive for blood.

612
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,003
All right, prep a cutdown
tray, type and cross

613
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,839
for two units and page Keaton.

614
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,040
Where's her mother?

615
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,319
Trauma one.

616
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:23,510
Dr. Ross and I thought it
was an equivocal exam.

617
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,878
Ross is a pediatrician.

618
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:28,354
If you don't know what you're
doing call someone who does.

619
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:29,850
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.

620
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,296
Your daughter
has internal injuries

621
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,855
that's going to
require an operation.

622
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,535
She-she's only ten days old.

623
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,524
It's okay.

624
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,538
Dr. Keaton will be with her.

625
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,094
And, look, she's the best

626
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:43,174
pediatric surgeon in Chicago.

627
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,497
Now, we need your consent

628
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,700
for what's called an
exploratory laparotomy.

629
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,797
Where's my husband?
I want him to sign for it.

630
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,871
Her husband's a pediatrician.

631
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,106
He can't do it right now.

632
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,292
He handles all the
family medical decisions.

633
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,139
I don't know
anything about this.

634
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,828
You can do this, Gail.

635
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,713
I don't know.

636
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:00,959
I don't know.

637
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,851
Your baby needs it.

638
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:08,851
Okay.

639
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,134
Okay.

640
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,492
Okay.

641
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:15,662
Cutdown tray.

642
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:16,808
Use a Volutrol.

643
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,465
We may have to transfuse.

644
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,799
Gant was on track.

645
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,813
I just talked him out of it.

646
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:23,403
Hang D5, quarter normal.

647
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,904
What do you think, Peter?

648
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,851
She has an acute abdomen.

649
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,186
Hi, pretty girl.

650
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:30,555
Vitals?

651
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:33,480
BP's 80/40, pulse 160

652
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:36,450
resps 65, temp's 101.4.

653
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:37,784
Pulse ox?

654
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,619
Oh, what blue, blue eyes.

655
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:41,288
92 room air.

656
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,601
Oh, Teacup, that's too low.

657
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,861
Let's get her on O2,
four liters by mask.

658
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:52,532
Did you appreciate the
periumbilical redness?

659
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,567
The abdomen's a little tense.

660
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,036
No, no, I missed it.

661
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,770
Well, it's easy to miss.

662
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,816
Why a cutdown?

663
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,772
No veins.

664
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,074
22 Angio.

665
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,627
This was a nice pickup, Peter.

666
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,762
Thank you.

667
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,531
Ah, yes.

668
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,300
There we go.

669
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,720
Wow. I couldn't
see or feel a vein.

670
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:16,123
Well, it's just a matter
of knowing where it is.

671
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,125
Let's get her a
cross-table lateral

672
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,537
and check for free air.
She may be perved.

673
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,239
Any thoughts on antibiotics?

674
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:24,464
Well, since you don't need
anaerobic coverage on newborns

675
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,099
I'd go with amp and gent.

676
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:27,500
You've been reading.

677
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:30,337
Dennis, since you did the trauma
assessment why don't you scrub in

678
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:31,972
and follow the case through.

679
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,407
Uh, Peter, let's talk to mom.

680
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,114
Good girl.

681
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,984
There you go, Mr. Brazil.

682
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,674
Shrimp cocktail time.

683
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,576
Hubert Skinner,
California Cryonics.

684
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,912
Mr. Brazil.

685
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,746
Do you have some kind of I.D.?

686
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,415
It's all there.

687
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,619
Give him 10,000
units of heparin, stat.

688
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,237
I'll pack him up

689
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:05,934
and we'll be on our way.

690
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,035
Is he a doctor?

691
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,125
I don't think so.

692
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,392
What do we do?

693
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,829
Well, the heparin can't
hurt, him being dead and all.

694
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:12,996
In the newborn

695
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,532
I use a transverse
abdominal incision.

696
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,535
The rectus is thin, so
there's less pain post-op.

697
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,937
Adson,

698
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,473
we're using a respirator,
so atelectasis isn't an issue.

699
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,687
Exactly. Zap
that little bleeder.

700
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:26,677
Cautery.

701
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,694
15 Blade.

702
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,096
If there's a perforation

703
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:32,165
we should get a gush of air
when I nick the peritoneum.

704
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:33,299
Yep, there it is.

705
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:34,645
She's easier to ventilate.

706
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:35,969
Very little bleeding.

707
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:38,772
Dennis, why do we want to
keep bleeding to a minimum?

708
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:39,951
Transfusions are dangerous.

709
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,087
You can't type and cross match

710
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:43,076
the blood as quickly

711
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,139
because of the baby's
fetal hemoglobin.

712
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,247
There it is... perfed jejunum.

713
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,115
You're teaching
your interns well.

714
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,672
He's in and out.

715
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,141
MRI was normal.

716
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,577
Dr. Herlihy, do you
remember my name?

717
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,812
Where's my wife and kids?

718
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,031
I'm Mark Greene.

719
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,816
Your family was involved
in a traffic accident.

720
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:10,137
Your wife's in the ER
with a tib-fib fracture.

721
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:12,522
Zach had facial trauma
and hemoperitoneum.

722
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:15,008
He's out of surgery, in ICU.

723
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:16,092
Was it his spleen?

724
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,694
No. Pancreatic injury.

725
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,312
What about Megan?

726
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:20,625
Megan just went up

727
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:23,133
to rule out
intestinal perforation.

728
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,235
Why? What happened to her?

729
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,271
She was in the
accident with you.

730
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,041
What accident?

731
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,627
Dr. Herlihy, do you
know my name?

732
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,212
No.

733
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,880
Should I?

734
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:44,020
It's okay. It's okay.

735
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,355
Gently.

736
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,792
To repair, we use a 4-0
silk interrupted. Hufnagel.

737
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,227
The field looks dry.

738
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,996
You don't need a
two-layer anastomosis.

739
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,499
Cautery alone gives
you hemostasis.

740
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,134
Let's irrigate.

741
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,685
Warm saline, please.

742
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,804
Dr. Keaton, Zach's
abdomen is distending.

743
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,817
Any change in his
vitals or pulse ox?

744
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,685
No, but he might
be bleeding again.

745
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,009
Damn.

746
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,523
Peter, you think you're
ready to finish alone?

747
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,513
Yeah.

748
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,326
Nothing fancy. Just close.

749
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,582
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

750
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,835
All right, people, let's go.

751
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,538
Thank you.

752
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:18,916
One more. Thank you.

753
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,008
His abdomen is more
distended than before the surgery.

754
00:29:22,044 --> 00:29:23,721
Has he regained consciousness?

755
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:24,844
No. No.

756
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,846
Four by eight.

757
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:28,815
Okay. Thank you.

758
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,985
All right. Completely dry.

759
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,387
What's that?

760
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:34,854
Oh.

761
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,726
Oh, looks like a little fibrin
debris on the liver surface.

762
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:40,972
Should I call Dr. Keaton?

763
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:42,812
No, no, no. I'll clean it up.

764
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,514
Come on.

765
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,849
Come on.

766
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,083
Okay, got it.

767
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,687
All right, let's close
the peritoneum first.

768
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,956
3-0 Vicryl.

769
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,059
Mm-hmm.

770
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,311
Now...

771
00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:58,995
Retract medially.

772
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,196
Cut.

773
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Mm-hmm.

774
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,200
Good.

775
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,702
There's a little blood.

776
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,737
Where?

777
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,138
Oozing from the liver

778
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:09,940
where you just touched it.

779
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,542
Alright, Uh... I'll put
a little pressure on it.

780
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,877
You suction.

781
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,312
Gently, okay?

782
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,186
Damn it!

783
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:26,823
It's still oozing.

784
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,209
All right, I don't want to
close while it's bleeding.

785
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,421
I'll put a stitch in
for hemostasis.

786
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:31,555
4-0 Chromic on
an s-h. Now, move.

787
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,545
Thank you.

788
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,047
Come on. Here we go.

789
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,264
All right.

790
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,399
Retract caudally.

791
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,836
Come on, Gant, retractor.

792
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,236
Is anesthesia standing by?

793
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,326
I called them.

794
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,543
You're right.

795
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:53,577
He is distended.

796
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,567
Vitals?

797
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,303
Stable. BP's 90/60.

798
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:58,604
Pulse is 96, pulse ox is 99%.

799
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,141
Should I clear an OR?

800
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:02,208
Hang on.

801
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:04,811
Disconnect the NG from the wall.

802
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:08,081
Yep.

803
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,352
Sometimes, you get
an erosive gastritis.

804
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:13,920
Hook it back up.

805
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:20,059
Clots can block the NG,
Causing acute dilatation.

806
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:22,455
Irrigate it out and
crisis resolved.

807
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:28,101
It's just experience, Doctor.

808
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,138
She's still bleeding.

809
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:33,539
I can see that.

810
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,176
I'll put a gelfoam
on the bleeding site

811
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,678
and you apply pressure.

812
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:39,179
Come on.

813
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:41,526
Do you want me
to get Dr. Keaton?

814
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,849
No.

815
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:44,184
Suction.

816
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:46,252
All right, I'm going to oversew.

817
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:47,754
2-0 Chromic on an S-H.

818
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,057
Heart rate's
starting to fluctuate.

819
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:52,692
Give me a bolus of
normal saline, 40cc's.

820
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:53,710
Damn it!

821
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,673
The liver's so fragile my
stitch cut right through.

822
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:57,208
I should be getting Keaton.
I'm going to take a bigger bite.

823
00:31:57,232 --> 00:31:58,982
Gant, retract this
way. I can't see.

824
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,711
Pulse ox is falling.
You need to get

825
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:01,885
this baby off the table.

826
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,302
Bag her faster, damn it!

827
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,524
I'm getting Keaton.

828
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,891
No.

829
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,377
Go! Go!

830
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,329
You really think it'll help her

831
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,387
to see her husband like this?

832
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,824
Megan's still in
surgery, Zach's in ICU.

833
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,159
And your husband
just got out of X-ray.

834
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,227
He's okay?

835
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:29,829
His tests are normal

836
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,264
but there's still

837
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:32,532
memory loss.

838
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,966
Could it be permanent?

839
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,167
Probably not.

840
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,281
You can see these
things in a concussion.

841
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:39,973
But... but it might be.

842
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:41,888
We'll just have to wait and see.

843
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,727
Blood loss?

844
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,062
100cc's.

845
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,697
That's a third of her volume.

846
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,477
Damn it. What the hell
did you do to her liver?

847
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,745
I just tried to peel
away some fibrin debris.

848
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,736
Cut me a one centimeter
square of gelfoam.

849
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,371
Move.

850
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,572
2-0 chromic on an S-H.

851
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,974
It started to ooze. Clear!

852
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,388
You ripped away
the liver capsule.

853
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,422
No way to control the bleeding.

854
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,590
I'll have to resec
the left lobe.

855
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,364
Peter, handle the suction.

856
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,099
Dennis, retract distally.

857
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:08,435
Cautery. Crank it up to 18.

858
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,937
Pulse and BP. Are destabilizing.

859
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:13,390
We'll have to transfuse
with unwashed o-neg.

860
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,919
80cc's. 2-0 Chromic.
Keep them coming.

861
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:16,876
She's bradying down. Rate's 80.

862
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,061
You've got to get out.

863
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,024
3-0 Vicryl for the
peritoneum and muscle

864
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,314
and staples for the skin.

865
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,175
David?

866
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,043
Oh, my God. David.

867
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,878
What happened to you?

868
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,647
Didn't you tell him?

869
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,466
We did, many times.

870
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,561
Zach's condition has stabilized.

871
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,268
He should wake up soon.

872
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:43,086
Zach?

873
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,070
It's okay. It's okay.

874
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,739
What about Megan?

875
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,257
Dr. Benton's closing right now.

876
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,861
That's wonderful news.

877
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,730
Was... was there a truck?

878
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:57,483
Yeah.

879
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:00,904
Yeah, there was a truck.

880
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:07,761
What on earth were you thinking?

881
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,906
I told you, there was debris.

882
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,364
And I told you not to
do anything but close.

883
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,543
Look, in my
judgment... I felt that...

884
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,267
I didn't ask for your judgment.

885
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,902
Perry, Dennis, set up a vent.

886
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,204
Call up respiratory and
get a blood gas right away.

887
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,227
Does that say "chicken belt"?

888
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:43,196
Conjunctivitis.

889
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:45,765
I hate chart QA.

890
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:53,740
What?

891
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,810
Nothing.

892
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,912
Thanks for helping
me in the chopper.

893
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,549
No problem.

894
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,681
Things can get really
pressured in here.

895
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,182
It just isn't a place

896
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,658
for someone who
isn't experienced.

897
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,481
I can't have you
work here again.

898
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,580
Zach?

899
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:52,999
Oh, God.

900
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:55,568
Can I touch him?

901
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:57,186
Sure.

902
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:11,317
Zach, honey, it's Mommy.

903
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:16,189
I'm going to stay right here

904
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:19,058
until you wake up.

905
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:26,766
What about Megan?

906
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:28,946
No one from
surgery's talked to you?

907
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,637
No.

908
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:33,150
Okay, I'll go find
out what's going on.

909
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,240
Thank you.

910
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,341
Carter...

911
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,826
Why hasn't anyone
been down to talk to her?

912
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,882
I don't know.

913
00:36:42,918 --> 00:36:45,067
Benton was closing
her an hour ago.

914
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,437
Blood gas is improved.

915
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:49,583
Not by much.

916
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,753
Um, could you
excuse us, Kit, Dennis?

917
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,057
Thank you.

918
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,078
I'm sorry.

919
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,913
I should never have
left you unsupervised.

920
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,382
There are nuances
in neonatal surgery.

921
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,417
The liver's more
friable in newborns.

922
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,852
I wanted a clean field

923
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:03,915
before I closed.

924
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:05,005
Yeah, you said that.

925
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,250
It seemed appropriate.

926
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:08,374
What's at issue here
is that you ignored

927
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,775
my specific instructions.

928
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,405
No, I didn't ignore anything.

929
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,691
I followed standard
operative procedures.

930
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,726
Look, I've done it at
least a dozen times

931
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,994
in other patients.

932
00:37:17,018 --> 00:37:18,584
This is not<i> another</i> patient.

933
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,652
This is an infant.

934
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:21,187
Outside. Now.

935
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:28,105
You don't know anything
about pediatric surgery.

936
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:29,829
Look, I felt it was necessary...

937
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:32,348
Are you unwilling to
learn from your mistakes?

938
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,011
It doesn't say in the
text not to stitch a liver!

939
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:35,017
It isn't in the text!

940
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,164
You didn't know what
the hell you were doing.

941
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,749
The second you
realized you screwed up

942
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,083
you should have called me.

943
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,352
Why did I find three
stitches in there?

944
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:42,753
Because I was trying
to... I'll tell you why!

945
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,673
Because you arrogantly and
blindly think you have all the answers.

946
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,937
If that baby dies, it'll
be my responsibility

947
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,332
but it will be your fault.

948
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,601
Dr. Keaton, she's crashing.

949
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,747
Pulse ox is 86, heart
rate's down to 45.

950
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,738
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

951
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,739
Atropine, .04.

952
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,386
Sounds like a pneumothorax.

953
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,088
Chest x ray.

954
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,611
Don't need it.

955
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,197
Increased transillumination
on the right side.

956
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:05,198
It's a pneumo.

957
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:06,366
Chest tube tray.

958
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:07,567
This is no longer

959
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:08,968
a teaching case. 12 French.

960
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,537
She's going to
need a repeat ABG.

961
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:12,905
Pulse is up to 72
but it's thready.

962
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:14,619
Dynamap's not registering a BP.

963
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:16,258
Get ready with that thoraseal.

964
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,105
She's arresting! Heart
rate's down to 20.

965
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,495
Damn.

966
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,064
Start CPR.

967
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,116
Epi, 1 to 10,000.4

968
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:26,052
Atropine, .08 milligrams.

969
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,904
How's the blood gas?

970
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,522
Ph 7.3, PO2 45

971
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,024
PCO2 30 and 100% oxygen.

972
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,860
We're going to have to
put her on an Ecmo bypass.

973
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:34,938
Kit, call the tech. Get two
units O-neg to prime the system.

974
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:36,829
I'll cut down to
the internal jugular.

975
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:38,842
So do we bring her
back up to the OR?

976
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:42,418
No, we're going to
bring the OR to her.

977
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,089
Dr. Greene?

978
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,324
Dr. Herlihy.

979
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,859
What time is it?

980
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,794
8:00.

981
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,763
PM?

982
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,198
Where's my family?

983
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:56,516
Your wife's upstairs

984
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,818
and both the kids
had laparotomies.

985
00:38:58,854 --> 00:39:01,098
A bed opened up for you in ICU.

986
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:02,355
How'd they do?

987
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,557
Well, your son's out of surgery

988
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,508
in ICU.

989
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,321
I don't know about
your daughter.

990
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,245
How do I find out
about my daughter?

991
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:11,013
Well, I'll check for you.

992
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,615
Thank you, Dr. Greene.

993
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:13,849
Mark.

994
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,045
Mark.

995
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,867
Pedes OR called.

996
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,325
His daughter
decompensated in surgery.

997
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,093
She's crashing in NICU.

998
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,211
She's still flatline.

999
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,346
Repeat .4 Of epi.

1000
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,196
Go ahead, Kit. How
long has she been down?

1001
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,720
22 Minutes.

1002
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,408
Is the ecmo circuit primed?

1003
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:57,042
Yes.

1004
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:58,377
Good. I'm ready.

1005
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:00,379
Venous connection first.

1006
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:03,082
Arterial.

1007
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,118
Turn it on.

1008
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,550
We've got a heartbeat.

1009
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,951
And a pulse.

1010
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,352
Faint.

1011
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:24,687
She's pinking up.

1012
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:25,888
Okay, let's get a repeat gas.

1013
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,856
We need to anticoagulate her.

1014
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,592
Kit, heparin, 150 units IV

1015
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,027
Start a drip at
ten units an hour.

1016
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,330
How can we anticoagulate her?

1017
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,577
We have to or
her blood will clot

1018
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,611
in the ecmo circuit.

1019
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,968
Yeah, but won't she bleed out?

1020
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,981
We have to hope
that she doesn't.

1021
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,149
I'll dictate an
operative report.

1022
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,707
Meet me in pedes
ICU In five minutes.

1023
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,275
ICU?

1024
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:48,077
Yeah, we've got
to tell the parents.

1025
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,084
Peter, how'd it go?

1026
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,020
How's the baby?

1027
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,555
Not good.

1028
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,877
Dr. Benton.

1029
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,050
You didn't sign the code sheet.

1030
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,357
Hey, we're all human.

1031
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,570
You know, we all make mistakes.

1032
00:41:19,594 --> 00:41:21,894
Any other words of wisdom, Gant?

1033
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,366
You're a real prick,
you know that?

1034
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,489
Mrs. Herlihy,
this is Dr. Keaton.

1035
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:36,258
She's the doctor who operated
on both Zach and Megan.

1036
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,762
Mrs. Herlihy, uh, Megan
had a perforated intestine

1037
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,230
from the accident.

1038
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,566
When we operated to repair it

1039
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,668
there were complications.

1040
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,374
Wh-what are you saying?

1041
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:55,094
Well, she's in the
NICU now on a device

1042
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:57,325
that helps her heart and lungs

1043
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,848
oxygenate her blood.

1044
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,784
There was bleeding
during the operation

1045
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,630
and she went into shock.

1046
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,398
Then her lung collapsed

1047
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,618
and finally, her heart stopped

1048
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:09,537
but we got it started again

1049
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:12,061
by putting her on
a bypass machine.

1050
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,713
Is she going to die?

1051
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,517
She's in extremely
critical condition.

1052
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,518
It's...

1053
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,387
it is a possibility.

1054
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,890
The Lord is my shepherd.

1055
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:52,411
I shall not want.

1056
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:56,532
He makes me lie down
in green pastures...

1057
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,551
He...

1058
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,356
The Lord is my
shepherd, I shall not want.

1059
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,625
He makes me to lie
down in green pastures.

1060
00:44:06,661 --> 00:44:07,627
He's...

1061
00:44:07,662 --> 00:44:09,678
Dr. Benton?

1062
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,536
I can't remember the words.
