1
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,348
Whoo!

2
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,401
Still raining, I see.

3
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,238
It's Bangladesh
out there, Jerry.

4
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,317
Hi.

5
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,373
Hey. How are you?

6
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,452
Go for a swim?

7
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,376
Yeah... something like that.

8
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,977
You're in early.

9
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,112
I couldn't sleep.

10
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,925
The couple next
door at the motel

11
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,915
were working on
some kind of record.

12
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,117
Motel?

13
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,519
Yeah. I haven't had
time to find a place.

14
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,055
I heard the West Side's
nice, not too pricey.

15
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,935
Internship still
at poverty wage?

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,125
27 grand.

17
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,638
Yeah, but see, second year,

18
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,607
it jumps all the
way to 30 grand.

19
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,763
Uh-uh... 28.

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,643
Carol grew up on the West Side.

21
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,677
Talk to her.

22
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,501
She'll tell you where to look.

23
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,502
Thanks.

24
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,503
Okay.

25
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,588
Dr. Benton? Dr. Benton?

26
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,790
Oh.

27
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:22,791
What time is it?

28
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,037
It's 5:00.

29
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,938
How long since you've been home?

30
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:28,230
Has, uh, Tabash been down yet?

31
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:29,931
He rounds at 7:00.

32
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,401
Why don't you go home
and take a shower?

33
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:34,214
I have to scrub
in in 30 minutes.

34
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,072
Do me a favor... if
there are any changes,

35
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,973
page me, okay?

36
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,788
Hey.

37
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,941
Hey.

38
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:16,294
What are you doing?

39
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,797
Watching you sleep.

40
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,618
For how long?

41
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,937
I don't know.

42
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,543
It's raining.

43
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,930
You're beautiful.

44
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,491
Good morning, Doctor.

45
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,171
Early bird catches
the worm, huh?

46
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,229
I was actually waiting
for Mrs. Ginsburg.

47
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:53,164
I was hoping to catch a couple
of minutes with you today.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,044
Well, Marla doesn't
get in until 7:00.

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,785
What's on your mind, Doctor?

50
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,120
Uh, now?

51
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,239
I was sort of hoping for an
appointment this afternoon.

52
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,458
Well, there's no
time like the present.

53
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,128
Uh... you know, I'd
prefer to come back later,

54
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,629
if that's okay with you.

55
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,704
Are you intentionally trying

56
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,728
to irritate me, Dr. Carter?

57
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,251
No, sir.

58
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,086
Then speak up.

59
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,294
Um...

60
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,883
I've been contemplating
leaving the surgical program.

61
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,835
I've been considering
it for quite some time,

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,705
and I feel that, um...
I've made an error

63
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,175
in selecting surgery
as my specialty.

64
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,963
Uh... f-for the-the most part,
the training has been excellent,

65
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,966
but I just feel that, um...

66
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:48,887
ultimately, uh... I
don't belong in surgery.

67
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,640
And... and I would suspect
that you would agree with me.

68
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,643
I certainly do not!

69
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,679
You don't?

70
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,216
You entered into
a contract, Doctor...

71
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,518
A contract with
this institution.

72
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,520
We agreed to give you
the finest surgical training

73
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,754
available in the nation

74
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,274
in exchange for six
years of your best effort.

75
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,275
I understand that.

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,622
I understand that,
but I just think...

77
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,312
I do not give a
damn what you think!

78
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,280
This is not summer camp.

79
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,017
You cannot just
run home to Mommy.

80
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,836
You're going to suck
it up and stick to it.

81
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:21,937
That's what men do.

82
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:22,938
But I...

83
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,084
Are we communicating here?

84
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,807
Yeah.

85
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,309
Good! And if I ever hear

86
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,944
this kind of crap coming
out of your mouth again,

87
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:32,480
the only kind of medicine
you'll be practicing

88
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:35,083
is picking out a cough
suppressant for yourself

89
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,418
down at the Jewel!

90
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:43,819
Hey, Dr. Greene,

91
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:46,054
Dr. Weaver's looking for you.

92
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,296
Dr. Greene, you okay?

93
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,631
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm fine, Jerry. Thanks.

95
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:00,918
Well, West Town's great.

96
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,720
You know, a lot of
it's been bought up...

97
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,021
Lawyers, investment bankers.

98
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,456
You can still find a nice place.

99
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,824
How much do you want to spend?

100
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,393
Uh... $600 tops.

101
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,594
Wow.

102
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,596
Have you ever thought
of finding a roommate?

103
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,797
You'd get a lot more space.

104
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,644
I'm looking forward
to living by myself.

105
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,744
Four years of undergrad,

106
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,380
four of med school,
three years of pedes...

107
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,914
Shared a bathroom
the entire time.

108
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,605
I grew up with two
sisters, one sink.

109
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,706
It was a nightmare.

110
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,707
Seven brothers.

111
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,708
Seven?

112
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,787
Yeah.

113
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,344
Where are you in the lineup?

114
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,990
Oldest. I wrap a mean diaper.

115
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:28,979
You?

116
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:29,980
Youngest.

117
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,216
Wow, eight kids.

118
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,783
Was your dad
independently wealthy?

119
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,252
Mailman.

120
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,920
So, uh, Mrs. Martinez...

121
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,289
Chuck has some
pain in his right hip?

122
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,758
Yes. He's been home
from school all week.

123
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,605
He's just getting over a cold.

124
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,928
Okay, Chuckie boy,

125
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,465
let's take a look at this, okay?

126
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,200
You like sports?

127
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,301
Yeah?

128
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,903
You, uh, slide into home

129
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,606
trying to beat the
throw from center field?

130
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,007
No.

131
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,792
His temp's 99.8.

132
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,010
Ow!

133
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,056
Did you fall off your
skateboard or your bike...

134
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,959
Anything that might
have hurt your hip?

135
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,933
I don't have a
skateboard anymore.

136
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,201
He wouldn't wear his
elbow and wrist pads,

137
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,336
so I took it away.

138
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,438
Uh-oh. Your mom's
right about that.

139
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:11,606
Licorice? Mom?

140
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,041
Yeah.

141
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,509
Has he had any kind

142
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,923
of penetrating wound or injury?

143
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:17,913
No.

144
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,058
Been in the woods camping?

145
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,527
Nature hikes at
school... anything?

146
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:21,516
No.

147
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:24,502
Um... CBC with a diff.

148
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,803
Chem seven, sed rate,

149
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,349
ultrasound, blood cultures,

150
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,268
and let's get an arthrocentesis.

151
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,509
I'm going to have
to call down Ortho.

152
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,704
Okay.

153
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,941
I don't think it's
any big deal, Chuck,

154
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,659
but we just got to make sure.

155
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,899
Hey, Dr. Greene.

156
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,235
I talked to Dr. Weaver
a couple of days ago.

157
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,603
Did she tell you about it?

158
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:42,682
Talked to her about what?

159
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,573
I'm hoping to leave
my surgical residency.

160
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,574
You're what?

161
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,708
I'd like to be considered

162
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,543
for a spot in
emergency medicine.

163
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:49,827
What did Anspaugh say?

164
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,246
He was less than enthusiastic.

165
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,375
Mark, Doyle has a
chest pain in curtain two.

166
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,327
You've already missed
this year's match.

167
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,717
I was hoping for a spot

168
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,736
outside the match
and that you'd put in

169
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,437
a good word for
me with Anspaugh.

170
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,917
Was Dr. Weaver
supportive? Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,001
You know, Weaver has

172
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,604
a better relationship
with Anspaugh than I do.

173
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:05,721
She could probably be

174
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,922
more persuasive.

175
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:07,912
Mark?

176
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,013
Okay. Thanks.

177
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,665
Tell me how it goes.

178
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,867
Sure.

179
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:14,686
Retract the liver inferiorly

180
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,554
and rotate it medially.

181
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,424
Peter, the coronary ligament.

182
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,793
Right.

183
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:26,063
Immobilize the right lobe,
exposing the vena cava.

184
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,398
You all right?

185
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,900
The vascular clamp.

186
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,935
Yeah.

187
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:31,903
Yours?

188
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,616
Shirley, can you
check that pager

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,017
over there on the table, please?

190
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,642
I'll suture, you retract.

191
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,010
6237.

192
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,246
Problem, Peter?

193
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,248
Uh... uh, Dr. Hicks,

194
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,351
uh... look, I'm sorry,
but I've got to go.

195
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,352
What?

196
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,154
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,355
Shirley...

198
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,290
Call Dr. Pittard to assist.

199
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,226
I think he's in Recovery.

200
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,462
39-year-old male
working out at the gym

201
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,997
when he experienced
the onset of chest pain.

202
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,978
Mr. Munder has a family
history of coronary disease.

203
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,201
My dad died at 36.

204
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,314
Vitals are normal.

205
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,316
BP's 100/50, pulse is 48.

206
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,305
Pulse ox 99.

207
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,074
So, you were at the
gym, Mr. Munder?

208
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,308
Yeah, weight circuit.

209
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,339
I was on the bench
press when it started.

210
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,762
What happened when you stopped?

211
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:16,214
It went away.

212
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,282
Do you smoke?

213
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,099
Hell, no.

214
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,245
His BP and pulse are low.

215
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,818
Yeah, but he's an athlete.

216
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,065
Oh, God, am I
having a heart attack?

217
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,040
It's probably just muscle
strain, Mr. Munder,

218
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:25,974
but with your family history,

219
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,153
we're not going
to take any risks.

220
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,159
Dr. Doyle?

221
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,426
Hep lock, CBC,

222
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,724
chem seven, cardiac enzymes,

223
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:33,593
portable chest and an EKG.

224
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,684
Don't forget the
low-tech approach:

225
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,185
Give him an aspirin.

226
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:41,523
Your husband looks a
little thin, Mrs. Curwane.

227
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,957
Has he been eating?

228
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,727
Whatever he
wants, I give to him.

229
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,796
Abdomen's distended.

230
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,909
See if there's a surgeon around.

231
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,511
No guarding or rebound.

232
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,546
No palpable organomegaly.

233
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,804
I can't find a vein.

234
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,708
Is your husband
on any medications?

235
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,443
Uh, yeah. Here.

236
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:05,146
CBC, lytes, LFTs, amylase...

237
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,981
and an abdominal series.

238
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:10,735
Tenormin, hydrochlorothiazide,
Altace, thorazine...

239
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,153
Burt... Burt, honey...

240
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,671
you be strong now.

241
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,222
You be strong...

242
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,458
Mommy's here...

243
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:20,612
Mommy's here.

244
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,279
Hey, Carol, somebody
may call you.

245
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,281
I put you down as a
character reference.

246
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,394
You're kidding, right?

247
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,084
No, it's this...
Big Brother thing.

248
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,297
The thing with the kids?

249
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,286
<i>One</i> kid.

250
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,800
You don't see enough here?

251
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,657
You know, a couple
of hours a week...

252
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,769
Good for you, Doug.

253
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,859
Eh, well.

254
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,594
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

255
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,530
You want to get
some oyster shooters

256
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,898
at Shaw's Crab House?

257
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,365
Sorry, I have a date.

258
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,366
Oh, yeah?

259
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,201
Who's the lucky guy?

260
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,770
Toby Minz up in Hem-Onc.

261
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,138
Yeah, Toby. Good.

262
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,339
He's a great guy.

263
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,252
A little lacking in
the hair department.

264
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,242
Except for his arms.

265
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,443
You ever seen his arms?

266
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,178
Carol, Ortho called.

267
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,014
They're going to
be at least an hour

268
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,949
before they can do
the arthrocentesis.

269
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:58,950
Thanks.

270
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,117
Arthrocentesis?

271
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,764
Oh, eight-year-old
kid with hip pain.

272
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,221
Del Amico is worried that
it might be septic arthritis.

273
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,523
That's an awful lot of tests

274
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,159
for a kid just getting over
an upper respiratory infection.

275
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,105
I think she was just
being overly cautious.

276
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,462
I tell you what, you know what?

277
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,397
Hold everything except
for the CBC and diff

278
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,465
and I'll check him out.

279
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,466
Okay.

280
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,467
All right.

281
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,835
Toby Minz?

282
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,329
Hey.

283
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,309
You get any sleep last night?

284
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,832
Mmm. On and off.

285
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,679
He's off the oscillating vent.

286
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:34,668
Mm-hmm.

287
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:35,970
The nitric oxide works.

288
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,439
We were able to move
him onto the respirator.

289
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:39,607
And?

290
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,709
The ultrasound
showed no hemorrhage

291
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,410
or dilatation of ventricles,

292
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:47,415
and the CT revealed no evidence
of periventricular leukomalacia.

293
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,582
What's he saying?

294
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:50,698
The structures of
the brain are okay.

295
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,386
Thank God.

296
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,632
So, most likely

297
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:55,701
there'll be no
developmental problems

298
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,158
or disabilities, right?

299
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,262
Well, there can be problems
associated with anoxia...

300
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:02,997
What's anoxia?

301
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,383
Your baby was deprived
of oxygen in the womb,

302
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,151
so there's always
the possibility

303
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,537
that there could
be brain damage.

304
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:10,738
Oh...

305
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,057
Will he be able to
play with other kids

306
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,458
and learn to read?

307
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,761
If you're asking me will
he be a doctor or a lawyer,

308
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,963
I can't say.

309
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,793
Chances are, your
baby will be fine,

310
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:23,734
but a certain percentage do
have neurodevelopmental problems

311
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,870
and/or learning disabilities.

312
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,406
What... percentage?

313
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,709
Infants delivered at 32
weeks with no complications

314
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,695
have a better-than-98%
chance of being normal.

315
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,697
Well...

316
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,800
what about the ones
born<i> with</i> complications?

317
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,301
Your child... had

318
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,455
several serious
complications at birth,

319
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,426
and no one can give you
an accurate percentage.

320
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,742
It's not an exact science.

321
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,192
Babies are resilient.

322
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:56,500
We'll just have to wait and see.

323
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,511
You're buying a gun?

324
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,856
Yeah, I think I'll feel safer.

325
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,013
What are you getting?

326
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,226
Sig Sauer nine-millimeter.

327
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,129
The guy at the pawnshop's
trying to sell me a Colt .45.

328
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,685
Lot of weapon for a beginner.

329
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,686
Stick to the Sig.

330
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,333
I'm going to check
on our chest pain.

331
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,422
Hey, how's the hand?

332
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,635
It itches like hell.

333
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,892
Thought you weren't
going to let anybody sign it.

334
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,167
Rachel's Brownie troop.

335
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,141
Hey, Dr. Greene, a detective
from Chicago PD called.

336
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,675
He said he's going
to come by later

337
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,777
with some pictures
for you to look at.

338
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,446
Thought the circus was over.

339
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,969
Maybe they caught somebody.

340
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,337
Hey, how's Rachel doing?

341
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,451
Jennifer's back, so
Rachel's with her.

342
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,975
Listen, uh, Doug, could
you write me a script

343
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,010
for some Percodan?

344
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,210
Your ribs still sore?

345
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,774
Yeah, the pain's
keeping me up at night.

346
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,409
When are you seeing
that hand guy again?

347
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,298
Monday.

348
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,427
I could write you

349
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,662
for five or six to
tide you over...

350
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,414
Mark, we need you over here.

351
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:51,438
I could use a few
more than that.

352
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:56,210
ST elevation in
two, three and AVF.

353
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:59,680
Malik, 1/150 nitro sublingually.

354
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:00,698
What's happening?

355
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,166
Is he having a heart attack?

356
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,184
It really hurts!

357
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,203
How's his BP?

358
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,304
BP's 125/80.

359
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,251
All right, five migs of morphine

360
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,501
I.V. push every 15.

361
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,275
Start a nitroglycerin drip.

362
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,276
O2 to 15.

363
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,712
Is he having a heart attack?!

364
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,646
Mrs. Munder...

365
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,332
I'm afraid so.

366
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,511
Oh, God! I knew it.

367
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,184
Heart rate's down to 45.

368
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,185
Looks like a block.

369
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,854
Second-degree Mobitz type two.

370
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,590
Atropine, .5 migs.

371
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,991
Please don't let me die!

372
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:27,908
I'm hearing rales.

373
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,760
Lasix, 40 milligrams I.V. push.

374
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,228
He's going into failure.

375
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,898
Let's set up for a
transcutaneous pacemaker.

376
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,567
What's up?

377
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,902
92-year-old man,

378
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,904
history of vomiting
and dehydration.

379
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,983
He's agitated,

380
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,318
abdomen's distended,
no bowel sounds.

381
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,576
Could be a small
bowel obstruction.

382
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,911
Meds?

383
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,081
Hydrochlorothiazide,
thorazine, Altace and Tenormin.

384
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,583
Kerry...

385
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,818
Bedsores.

386
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,152
Sacral area, too.

387
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,688
He's coming in from
a nursing home?

388
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,469
No, his wife's been
taking care of him at home.

389
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,558
Not very well.

390
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,227
Abdominal series back yet?

391
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,907
Should be any minute.

392
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,732
Dr. Weaver, can I talk
to you for a minute?

393
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,366
Uh, sure.

394
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,236
I, uh... I talked to
Dr. Anspaugh this morning.

395
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,916
Is he going to let you out?

396
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,589
I think a few words from you

397
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,841
would be helpful.

398
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,221
You're still interested in
pursuing emergency medicine?

399
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,961
Mm-hmm, yeah, I asked
Dr. Greene about it.

400
00:16:20,997 --> 00:16:22,580
He seemed supportive, but...

401
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,680
with the match over,

402
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,782
he thought it might be
difficult to find a spot.

403
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,186
Kerry, I've got an LOL in
six, weak and dizzy all over.

404
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,520
I'll be right there.

405
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,723
Dr. Greene's probably
right about finding a slot.

406
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,093
We only have so much
salary budgeted for next year.

407
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,556
I'm sure it's already
been committed.

408
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,630
That's okay. You
don't have to pay me.

409
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,466
You... you don't need a salary?

410
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,101
No. No, I'm fine.

411
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,487
So you'll put in a good word
with Dr. Anspaugh for me?

412
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,005
Sure.

413
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,041
Thanks.

414
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,423
Hey, did the kid with
the hip get moved?

415
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,747
I don't know.

416
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,448
Check the desk.

417
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,554
Carol, do you know
where Chuck Martinez

418
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,267
and his mom got moved to?

419
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,590
Doug Ross released him.

420
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,759
He didn't talk to
you about it first?

421
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:09,760
Uh, no.

422
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,774
Do you have any
idea where he is?

423
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,430
I think he's in the lounge.

424
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,667
<i>I tell the guy, "You've got
to put your head down,"</i>

425
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,469
so he looks me in the eye
and he pukes everywhere.

426
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,683
Pukes on the floor...

427
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,739
He was my patient.

428
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,518
You had no right to release him

429
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,125
without consulting me first.

430
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,711
What are we talking about here?

431
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,057
Chuck Martinez, my
eight-year-old with the sore hip.

432
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,375
You ordered
$4,000 worth of tests

433
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,810
for a child with
toxic synovitis...

434
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:32,800
He was my patient.

435
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,513
I sent him home with two Advils.

436
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,081
You are working
under my supervision.

437
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:38,406
How do you know it
wasn't septic arthritis?

438
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,236
Because I looked at the CBC, I
looked at the diff; it was synovitis.

439
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,370
What if it's early-stage?

440
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,355
Dr. Del Amico, you want
to put an eight-year-old boy

441
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,595
through a painful

442
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,842
orthopedic procedure
on the remote possibility

443
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,832
that he's suffering

444
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,101
from a rare diagnosis
that your tests

445
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,280
do not even indicate.

446
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,536
You know what?

447
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,989
If you want to gamble
with your patients' lives,

448
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:56,957
that's fine, but
don't do it with mine.

449
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,571
He's in complete heart block.

450
00:17:58,595 --> 00:17:59,838
Eighty-eight. Pulse ox?

451
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:00,828
Is he dying?

452
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:01,996
He's dying, isn't he?

453
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,675
We need you to stand
over here, Mrs. Munder.

454
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:05,043
It's not capturing.

455
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,045
Connie, get the
transvenous pacemaker

456
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,481
and the portable
fluoroscope down here now.

457
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,470
E. Ray, what's open?

458
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:10,471
Trauma one.

459
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,572
All right, let's go.

460
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:13,007
You want me to call Cardiology?

461
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,074
Tell them we can't wait.

462
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,088
If they want the
procedure, they'd better run.

463
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:19,096
Abdominal series
doesn't show obstruction.

464
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,530
So it's not surgical.

465
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,531
Uh-uh.

466
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,867
Probably an ileus.

467
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,868
Crit's 51.

468
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,102
Potassium's 2.1.

469
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,238
Okay, let's get some
potassium going.

470
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,874
Put 40 milli-equivalents
in a liter of saline,

471
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,108
run it over two hours.

472
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,387
What about the bedsores,

473
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,756
malnutrition, dehydration?

474
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,746
Yeah. Does she have
any help at home?

475
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,825
No.

476
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,016
She doesn't even
look strong enough

477
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,651
to take care of herself.

478
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,889
Mrs. Curwane...

479
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,759
I don't think your husband's
going to require surgery.

480
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,760
Oh.

481
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,995
He has an ileus...

482
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,298
A section of his intestinal
tract is paralyzed,

483
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,284
and that's making him sick.

484
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,301
Paralyzed?

485
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,697
It could have been caused

486
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,165
by one of his medications.

487
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:01,172
So...

488
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,302
we're going to work on that.

489
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:06,893
Does your husband
get enough to eat?

490
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,764
I-I cook for him every day.

491
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,449
All his favorites.

492
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,118
We're sure that you
do, but does he eat it?

493
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,422
He's fine.

494
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,057
We're just getting
older, that's all.

495
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,243
We're also concerned

496
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,495
that he might not be
getting enough exercise.

497
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,830
Does he have a
walker so he can get out

498
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,949
of bed and move around a little?

499
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,334
He's been sick.

500
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,569
When he's feeling better,

501
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,506
he's out in the
yard all day long

502
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,542
with his roses
and his vegetables.

503
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,061
We had the most lovely beets

504
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,225
and beans last season.

505
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,529
Just lovely.

506
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:48,402
Mrs. Curwane...

507
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,905
I think...

508
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,651
maybe it's time to consider

509
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:55,087
placing your husband
in a nursing home

510
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:59,246
or a rehabilitation facility.

511
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,782
I take good care of him.

512
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:03,784
You've done a wonderful job,

513
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:06,787
but now he needs
more than you can give.

514
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:11,125
We've lived in our
house for 48 years.

515
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,446
Burt loves that house.

516
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,452
You just fix him up...

517
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:25,105
and I'll take him home.

518
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,158
That's where he belongs.

519
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,371
Found her in Grant Park

520
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,607
face down in the mud
in the pouring rain.

521
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:32,641
14, maybe 15.

522
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,476
BP's 90/50, pulse
56, temp's 101,

523
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,345
skin clammy,
cool, slightly dusky.

524
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,347
We got two I.V.s
going... Glucose 120.

525
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,686
She's had two of Narcan.

526
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,572
Vomited all over
herself. Track marks.

527
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,685
Any ID?

528
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,019
No way was I sticking my hands

529
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,120
into this kid's pockets.

530
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,410
Jerry, what do we got open?

531
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,646
They're just clearing
somebody out of trauma two.

532
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,215
Lot of kids squatting over
there by the baseball fields.

533
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,394
Carol, better take a look.

534
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,862
Oh, damn it! Lily, get Dr. Ross.

535
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,886
Tell him to come to trauma
two as soon as he can.

536
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,887
I can handle an OD.

537
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,701
We're coming through!
Get out of the way!

538
00:20:58,725 --> 00:20:59,851
O2, ten liters by mask,

539
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,654
and two more
milligrams Narcan I.V.

540
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,954
Prep for gastric lavage.

541
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:04,923
I've run hundreds
of adolescent ODs.

542
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,230
I don't need Ross down
here holding my hand.

543
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,877
I didn't call him
down here to baby-sit.

544
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,200
She's a patient of his.

545
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,515
Her name is Charlie.

546
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,137
Sorry to keep you waiting.

547
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,951
We picked up a
guy over at Mercy.

548
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,953
He mugged a doctor
in the parking lot,

549
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,054
knocked him around.

550
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,789
We thought it might be your guy.

551
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,012
I don't remember much.

552
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,091
Just look them over

553
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,798
and tell us what you can.

554
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,316
He was black, then?

555
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,563
Just tell us if you recognize

556
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,937
any of these men.

557
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,840
Take your time.

558
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:43,517
I don't know...

559
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,369
Uh...

560
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:48,105
I think maybe this guy.

561
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,143
I've seen him before.

562
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,147
He could have been
a patient or something.

563
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,927
Okay, Doc, thanks for your help.

564
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,151
Is that the right guy?

565
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,964
You know, I remember the pants.

566
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:02,953
I saw the pants.

567
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,455
They were dark blue,
and the shoes were black.

568
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,224
Yeah, we got that in the report.

569
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,227
You know, that might
be... might be the right guy.

570
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:11,907
I just... I didn't see much.

571
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,164
It happened so fast.

572
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,165
Is there, uh...

573
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,816
a pop machine around
here somewhere?

574
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:19,169
Yeah. That's across
the hall by the chairs.

575
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,154
Thanks.

576
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:21,505
You want anything, Ford?

577
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,623
No, thanks. I'm okay.

578
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,832
You know, this guy... he
knocked you around pretty good.

579
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,851
I can give you a
couple of names...

580
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:39,840
Some victim's groups,

581
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:41,536
people that handle
this sort of thing.

582
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,761
I'm fine, thanks.

583
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,664
Sure.

584
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:09,419
Son of a bitch!

585
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:38,599
Aw, damn it.

586
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,211
Paramedics found her

587
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,746
face down in the mud, OD'd.

588
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,204
She's got track marks,
skin pops, cellulitis.

589
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,249
We're lavaging her.

590
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,740
CBC, chem 20, tox screen?

591
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:47,853
And a blood alcohol.

592
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:49,493
Foley's in.

593
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,095
Get the antibiotics going.

594
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,546
Be my guest.

595
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,215
All right, Ancef, one gram,

596
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,429
gentamicin, 50 milligrams I.V.

597
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:58,652
How old?

598
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,454
Fourteen.

599
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:01,855
Going on 40.

600
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,392
I'll call her mother.

601
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:06,894
A miracle, huh?

602
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:11,264
Have you held him yet?

603
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,566
Uh...

604
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:13,868
no.

605
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,805
He's small, but strong.

606
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,842
You name him?

607
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,811
You know, actually, we
haven't even had time

608
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:24,812
to talk about it.

609
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:25,847
I think we both thought

610
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:26,780
it would be bad luck.

611
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:27,798
I think it's safe now.

612
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,127
I've got to get back.

613
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,784
You coming?

614
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,086
In a bit, in a bit.

615
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,387
Okay.

616
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,395
Someone going to get the phone?

617
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,452
I got it last time.

618
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,531
You did not.

619
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,687
Did, too.

620
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,100
You never answer the phone.

621
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,190
I always answer.

622
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,558
ER.

623
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,803
Carter, it's Gerontology.

624
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,506
How's it coming
with Mr. Curwane?

625
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,729
I got somebody from
Social Work coming down

626
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,598
and somebody from
PT and Nutrition.

627
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:02,634
This is Dr. Carter.

628
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,878
Yeah, I'm still holding.

629
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,102
I hate talking with caseworkers.

630
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,916
So, Mark busted a
chair in the lounge?

631
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,474
Yeah... smashed the coffeepot,

632
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,309
bunch of mugs...
It was a real mess.

633
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,388
Where is he?

634
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,645
Said he had to run an errand.

635
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,890
Hey, I need to talk to you.

636
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,582
Anybody want to
help me out over here?

637
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,583
What's up, sport?

638
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,995
Yeah, I'm looking for somebody.

639
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,564
The ambulance brought
her in from Grant Park.

640
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:23,888
Does she have a name?

641
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:24,955
Yeah... Charlie.

642
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,790
I don't know her last name.

643
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,891
Who are you?

644
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,159
A friend... a close friend.

645
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,528
A close friend and you
don't know her last name?

646
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,864
I'm not that kind of friend.

647
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,333
So, look, you going
to tell me where she is?

648
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,534
No, her mom's coming.

649
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,635
You can ask her.

650
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,086
Oh, her mom.

651
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,455
She ain't coming.

652
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,173
She's in jail... possession.

653
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,692
Well, then Charlie goes to DCFS.

654
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:46,994
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

655
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,930
Look, just tell her Tommy
stopped by, will you?

656
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,065
I'll be on the
corner after 10:00.

657
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,701
I'll make sure she gets

658
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,016
the message.

659
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,304
Doug, Charlie's coming around.

660
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,307
Oh, uh, okay, Jerry, I'm
on the line with DCFS.

661
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,121
Will you page me in trauma two

662
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,911
if they ever pick up?

663
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:06,825
Jeanie?

664
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:08,915
Gerontology's all backed up.

665
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:10,283
I'm going to go up there

666
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,097
and see if I can grab somebody.

667
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:13,404
Dr. Weaver?

668
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,889
You should've warned
me about Dr. Anspaugh.

669
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:16,890
What happened?

670
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,725
He wouldn't even discuss it.

671
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,771
I'm sorry... I thought

672
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,422
maybe you could turn him around.

673
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,640
Personally, I would love

674
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,376
to have you in
emergency medicine,

675
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,045
but whatever your difficulties
with Dr. Anspaugh are,

676
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:29,389
you'll have to
solve them yourself.

677
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,924
Tox screen came back.

678
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,894
Uh, positive for
cocaine, benzos, opiates.

679
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,328
Blood alcohol's .23.

680
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,798
CBC shows a white count of 15.5.

681
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,644
Hemoglobin's 9.8, crit 28.

682
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,780
Elevated AST and bilirubin.

683
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,114
Hepatitis? Mmm.

684
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,237
Restraints?

685
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,438
I don't want her to bolt.

686
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,118
Would you take them
off for me, please?

687
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,274
Hey, she's still my patient.

688
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,221
I understand that, but
I need to talk to her.

689
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,556
She's not going to want to talk

690
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,757
if she's wearing restraints.

691
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,215
Just don't leave her in the
room alone without restraints.

692
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,216
Okay, you know what?

693
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,491
I'll do it.

694
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,654
Hey, you.

695
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,824
So, your bellybutton
ring is infected.

696
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,459
What did you do, do it yourself

697
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,961
with a rusty nail?

698
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,395
I don't feel so good.

699
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,565
Yeah, well, we
pumped your stomach.

700
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,534
Found more chemicals in there

701
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,169
than a toxic waste dump.

702
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,983
I was just partying
with some friends.

703
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,072
Mm-hmm.

704
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,824
So you graduated to
smack now, did you?

705
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,543
When can I go home?

706
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,710
Where's that?

707
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:30,274
With my mom.

708
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,565
We hear your mom's in jail.

709
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,164
I won't go back to foster care.

710
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,355
Is that where you were?

711
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,318
The guy was trying
to do me all the time

712
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:41,386
and his wife was a drunk.

713
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,392
Sounds rough.

714
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,810
You going to let me go?

715
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:45,128
Where?

716
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,346
I've got friends.

717
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,815
I know... friends you can
share a dime bag with,

718
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,767
if you want.

719
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,202
Who's the cheerleader?

720
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,517
Hmm?

721
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:55,855
That's Dr. Del Amico.

722
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,819
She took care of you
when you first came in.

723
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,326
She the one who ruined my high?

724
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,362
Mm-hmm.

725
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:03,613
You like her.

726
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,028
Okay, I'm going to get
ahold of your caseworker,

727
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,536
and we'll try and get you
into rehab, get you dried out.

728
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,772
Or you can keep
screwing up your life

729
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,434
and you can end up
dead in some alley.

730
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,791
It's going to be your choice.

731
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,312
I'm pretty tired.

732
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,797
Mm-hmm.

733
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:23,167
Jeanie.

734
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,701
Hey, hi!

735
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,102
What are you doing here?

736
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,039
That new job site's just
on the other side of Wells.

737
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,374
I thought I'd find out

738
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,942
what time you were going
to be home for dinner.

739
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,356
Jeanie, an MVA pulling up.

740
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,563
Guy got T-boned by a
semi on the Kennedy.

741
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:37,726
Uh, Kerry, this is

742
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,016
Al Boulet.

743
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,367
We met last year. Hi.

744
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,087
Here they come.

745
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:44,399
Okay, uh, I got to go.

746
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,901
I'll be home around 8:00.

747
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,468
You're not cooking, right?

748
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,794
I've got all sorts of surprises
lined up for you tonight.

749
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,373
No frozen dinners, please.

750
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,630
Home by 8:00, huh?

751
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,266
Guess we've got
some catching up to do.

752
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,953
When did you start smoking?

753
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,522
Bummed one from Doyle.

754
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,992
So, I hear you had
a meltdown today.

755
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,394
You picked a fight
with the lounge.

756
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,562
Yeah.

757
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:11,147
Feel better?

758
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,282
Not really.

759
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,097
Mark, I'm not going to write you

760
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,765
that prescription
for the Percodan.

761
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,367
I think you got
to get some help.

762
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,757
I'm fine.

763
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,704
Taking a chair to
the lounge isn't fine.

764
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,361
It's never happened
to you, Doug.

765
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,929
You don't know.

766
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,734
I'll get someone else to
write me the Percodan.

767
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,536
Okay... all right.

768
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,682
If you ever want to talk,

769
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,946
you know where
to find me, right?

770
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,020
<i>Dr. Carter!</i>

771
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,143
Dr. Anspaugh.

772
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,890
Dr. Weaver just
dragged me down here

773
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,092
for a surgical consult
on a traffic accident.

774
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,961
It seems<i> you</i> were
nowhere to be found.

775
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,662
I came down as
soon as I was paged.

776
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,064
Would you like me to take it?

777
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,186
No, thank you, Doctor.

778
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,888
I'll see you
upstairs for rounds.

779
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,335
Hey, Carter.

780
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,104
You got a bunch of
people waiting on you

781
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,094
in curtain three.

782
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,873
Said you called them
down for a consult.

783
00:29:58,897 --> 00:29:59,863
Right.

784
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:00,898
Right, thank you.

785
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,367
Sorry to keep you waiting.

786
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,468
John Carter.

787
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,082
Carla Kramer, Social Work.

788
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,382
Daniel Shaw, Dietary.

789
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,340
Anne Ferguson, Physical Therapy.

790
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,420
Hello. So, you've
all had a chance

791
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,822
to, uh, see Mr. Curwane,

792
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:14,923
review the chart?

793
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,180
Why don't we take
a step outside, then?

794
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,072
Hey, Peter.

795
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:27,841
Move over.

796
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:30,344
How'd you find me?

797
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:31,644
It wasn't hard.

798
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,214
It's what you used to
do when you were little.

799
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,827
Whenever you'd get in trouble,

800
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:37,395
you'd go down to the church.

801
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,264
You knew if Daddy
found you there,

802
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:41,382
he'd figure you were
already repenting

803
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,118
and he wouldn't have the heart

804
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,474
to take the belt to you.

805
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,744
You're saying I was
that calculating as a kid?

806
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,212
Mommy thought so.

807
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,608
Me, I think Daddy was right.

808
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,928
You were harder on yourself

809
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,120
than any of us could
have ever been.

810
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,469
Carla says she hasn't seen you

811
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,653
since first thing this morning.

812
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:09,132
I didn't know it was
going to be this hard.

813
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,550
What?

814
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,236
The baby.

815
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,103
He may have brain damage,

816
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,440
developmental problems, autism,

817
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,875
mental retardation...
They can't even say.

818
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,777
Or he might be fine, right?

819
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,633
Either way, you're
going to love him

820
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,970
more than you can even imagine.

821
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,890
I can't handle it.

822
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,208
Sure you can.

823
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:36,926
You'll have to.

824
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,263
That's your son up there, Peter.

825
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,609
The world is hard sometimes.

826
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,067
It can't always go the
way you want it to go.

827
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,257
I miss Dad.

828
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,713
By the way, is there any chance

829
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,482
that there might be some
place that could take both of them

830
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:00,728
and let them live together?

831
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,019
Does she need nursing care?

832
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,564
She may have a little dementia.

833
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,333
She seems a bit out of it to me.

834
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,868
Dr. Carter, time for rounds.

835
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,158
Alden Lakeland has rooms

836
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:09,809
that will accommodate couples.

837
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,111
Oh, great, great!

838
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,046
Dr. Carter?!

839
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,108
Um... I'm sorry.

840
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,276
I have to go.

841
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,433
What?

842
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,079
Rounds... I'll be
back in an hour.

843
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,236
Doctor, you're the one

844
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,837
with the relationship
with the wife.

845
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,134
We're not likely to get very
far without your involvement.

846
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,290
This is ridiculous.

847
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:26,426
Dr. Carter!

848
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,811
Uh... I'm not coming.

849
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:29,679
You're what?

850
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,476
I have a patient who
needs my attention.

851
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,650
Rounds are a requisite
for this program, Doctor.

852
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,017
So is patient care.

853
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,670
You come to rounds today, or
don't ever come to rounds again.

854
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,106
I'll be there if and when I can!

855
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,101
All right, Doctor.

856
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,013
Anyone thinking cocktails?

857
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,216
I got to pick the
kids up at my sister's.

858
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,217
I'm in.

859
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,218
Me, too.

860
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,296
You got any money?

861
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,221
Better than
money, girl... Credit.

862
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,857
Hey, Charlie's caseworker
finally showed up.

863
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,524
She's waiting out in chairs.

864
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,004
Oh, this ought to be fun.

865
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,461
Whoo-ee!

866
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,630
Girl, you look great!

867
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,765
Thank you.

868
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,199
Hey, E. Ray, if Dr. Minz calls,

869
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,600
let him know I'm on my way up.

870
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:25,679
Okey-dokey.

871
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,669
Good night.

872
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:27,670
Good night.

873
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,172
Uh, Dr. Ross?

874
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,573
Yeah?

875
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:31,440
Yeah?

876
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,187
You know Ms. Newman
from DCFS, right?

877
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,177
Yes, I do.

878
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,178
Hey, hi, how are you?

879
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,891
Charlie's resurfaced again, huh?

880
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,059
Yeah, polydrug OD...

881
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,700
Cocaine, meth, heroin.

882
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:42,446
She ran away from the foster
home about a month ago.

883
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,448
Yeah, she said that
she was molested.

884
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:46,250
Well, Charlie
says a lot of things.

885
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,373
Yes, she does.

886
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:51,511
Oh, damn it.

887
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,367
I'm out of here, E. Ray.

888
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,502
If anybody asks,
I left hours ago

889
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,137
and you haven't seen me.

890
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,405
Dr. Greene!

891
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,507
Pacer's capturing,
vitals are normal,

892
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,976
tapered off the dopamine.

893
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,677
Mr. Munder is headed upstairs

894
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,946
to get a permanent
pacemaker tomorrow.

895
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:11,426
Feeling better, Mr. Munder?

896
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,083
Much... thanks.

897
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,750
Great... Take care.

898
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,085
Doctor?

899
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,353
I'm sorry... I'm off duty.

900
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,522
If you need a physician,
I'm sure someone...

901
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,507
No, Doctor, I'm Judy Munder.

902
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,569
I just wanted

903
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,737
to thank you

904
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,841
for saving my husband's life.

905
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,398
Must be incredible...
Making a difference

906
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,733
in people's lives.

907
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,735
Good night, E. Ray.

908
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,010
Good night.

909
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,571
I hate this.

910
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,907
She's going to need
money to get high.

911
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,476
This is the fastest way.

912
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:43,079
That pimp guy said
he'd be on a corner?

913
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,192
Yeah.

914
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,759
He didn't say what corner,

915
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,761
and how do you know he's a pimp?

916
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,085
Dealer, whatever.

917
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,221
He's out here
somewhere if she is.

918
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,223
Pull over.

919
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,491
What?

920
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,758
Pull over... we'll ask around.

921
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,727
Someone's going to know
a dealer named Tommy,

922
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,329
hangs out with a
kid named Charlie.

923
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,244
What?

924
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,179
Someone wants to steal your car,

925
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,415
that alarm ain't
going to stop them.

926
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,094
What are we doing out here?

927
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,584
She reminds me of somebody.

928
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,796
Who's that?

929
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,654
Me.

930
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,892
So, you headed home
for a special dinner

931
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,227
and some surprises?

932
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,730
Probably just a
pot pie and a video.

933
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,299
Al's not much of a romantic.

934
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,134
So you guys are back together?

935
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:40,936
You don't approve.

936
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,106
I don't know.

937
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,841
Does it matter if I approve?

938
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,077
It does to me.

939
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,780
It would help if I understood.

940
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:54,718
I don't know if I do.

941
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:58,254
You know, it's funny, Kerry...

942
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,423
I'm happy.

943
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,376
I'm happier than I've ever been.

944
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,994
How can that be?

945
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,662
And that's because of Al?

946
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,716
No, it's because of me.

947
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,484
I'm not afraid anymore.

948
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,503
Of death?

949
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,923
Of living my life.

950
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,627
I see things now I
didn't see before.

951
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:23,713
I know what's important.

952
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,881
I know what isn't.

953
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,095
I've been in love with Al Boulet

954
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,248
since the first time I saw him.

955
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,288
I was 16 years old.

956
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:36,301
I know he's been
in love with me.

957
00:36:42,918 --> 00:36:44,033
Jeanie...

958
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:47,721
Good night.

959
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,940
Good night.

960
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:10,043
Hey, what's up, girl?

961
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:12,156
Can I have your name?

962
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,614
This party's going
to be booming.

963
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,129
Hey, what's up with that party?

964
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,187
Why don't you
want to look at him?

965
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:23,122
Hey, let's go, man.

966
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,124
She's cold.

967
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,359
Let's go, man.

968
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,284
Hey, hey...

969
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,285
Yo, wassup, man?

970
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,504
Yo, look who's up.

971
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,174
You're not sleeping.

972
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,009
I seen you.

973
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:45,060
Wakey, wakey.

974
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,174
Wake up!

975
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:47,397
He's awake now.

976
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,731
Yo, bro, lend me

977
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,699
20 bucks.

978
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,567
I don't have any money.

979
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,652
Sure you do, man.

980
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,020
I don't have any money.

981
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,766
Come on, man, we got
to get us something to eat.

982
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,401
Yo, man, let's go.

983
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,224
Shut up,<i> ese!</i>

984
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,510
I'm talking to my friend here.

985
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,479
Glasses man, we're hungry.

986
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,525
You don't want
us hungry, do you?

987
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:05,882
This is my stop.

988
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,717
You don't want to give me

989
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:13,873
some money, man?

990
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:17,543
Yo, we're getting off.

991
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:18,628
What?

992
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,762
This is our stop.

993
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,063
We're getting off.

994
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,150
Back off!

995
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,451
Back off!

996
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,452
Hey, hey, hey!

997
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,419
Be cool, man!

998
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,654
Get on the train!

999
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,272
Yo, be cool, man!

1000
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:47,384
Get back on the train!

1001
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,241
Be cool, man!

1002
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:50,276
Shut up! Shut up!

1003
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:51,828
Be cool, glasses man!

1004
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:52,728
Shut up!

1005
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,180
Chill out, glasses man.

1006
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:55,216
Be cool!

1007
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,316
Chill out!

1008
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,432
Hey!

1009
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:13,433
Later.

1010
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:14,434
Uh, anything?

1011
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:15,668
No. You?

1012
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,470
Yeah... that kid
with the wild hair

1013
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:18,771
saw Charlie yesterday.

1014
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,639
Said this guy Tommy's
usually around,

1015
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:22,241
but she hasn't seen him tonight.

1016
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,977
Heard he and Charlie scored
some hash and a good squat.

1017
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:26,212
Anything else?

1018
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,214
Yeah, that 15-year-old
with leather pants

1019
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:29,715
said she'd do you for nothing.

1020
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,117
Ah, that's something.

1021
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:32,229
So, what now?

1022
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:33,286
Come back tomorrow night.

1023
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,487
If they got a decent squat,

1024
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:36,055
they're not going
to come out again

1025
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:37,123
until they need to score.

1026
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:39,392
All right, well, you want
to get something to eat?

1027
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,761
Uh... as in something to eat

1028
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,531
or as in maybe something to
eat will lead to something else?

1029
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:50,002
Something to eat.

1030
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,917
How long ago did
you and that nurse

1031
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:54,707
Carol Hathaway break up?

1032
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:56,709
A long time ago.

1033
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:58,194
How about this:

1034
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,798
How about you drop
me back at my motel,

1035
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,000
and we hit some takeout
drive-through on the way?

1036
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,636
Sounds romantic.

1037
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,047
Dr. Anspaugh?

1038
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,049
I'm late for dinner, Dr. Carter.

1039
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,184
Good night.

1040
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,130
Please? It will
only take a minute.

1041
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,555
This is not the
time or the place.

1042
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,824
It's not that I dislike surgery.

1043
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,759
It's been incredibly
challenging,

1044
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,395
and the training
has been excellent.

1045
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,614
You are a wonderful
surgeon and a fine teacher.

1046
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,276
Get to the point, Doctor.

1047
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,150
I admire surgeons and surgery,

1048
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,469
but it's not the
type of medicine

1049
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,887
I want to practice.

1050
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,710
I can be a competent surgeon.

1051
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,814
I can learn the techniques,
the mechanics...

1052
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,283
but I'll never be
a great surgeon.

1053
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:59,489
Dr. Anspaugh, I can
be a great doctor,

1054
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,441
a doctor who spends
time with his patients,

1055
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:04,177
who's there for them.

1056
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:08,514
I'm good at it.

1057
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,166
Really good.

1058
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,602
I can make a difference
in people's lives.

1059
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,439
Don't make me give that up.

1060
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,843
Please don't make me waste it.

1061
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:28,985
I've often wondered
over the years

1062
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,005
if I made the right decision...

1063
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,124
in becoming a surgeon.

1064
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,227
But you seem

1065
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,979
so... certain.

1066
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:42,765
What are you?

1067
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,011
Twenty-six?

1068
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,018
Twenty-five.

1069
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:46,669
Twenty-five.

1070
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,723
What happened to your patient?

1071
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,092
The one you missed rounds for?

1072
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:54,276
Mr. Curwane.

1073
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,245
I got him and his wife

1074
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,048
into a nursing home... together.

1075
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,333
It's supposed to be very nice.

1076
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:03,385
I'm sure it is.

1077
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,040
You find me in the morning.

1078
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:10,059
We'll see

1079
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,677
if we can work something out.

1080
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:35,506
So, Toby doesn't
get to come inside?

1081
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,831
Doug! God, you scared me.

1082
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,218
I was hiding over
there under the El track.

1083
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,565
You're lucky one of the
neighbors didn't see you.

1084
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:45,933
They would've called the cops.

1085
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,477
What are you doing here?

1086
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:51,637
So, Toby doesn't
get to come inside?

1087
00:43:52,514 --> 00:43:53,979
It was only the third date.

1088
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:56,582
Toby definitely does
not get to come inside.

1089
00:43:58,085 --> 00:44:00,045
What?

1090
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,404
What?

1091
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,917
Sit in the rocker.

1092
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,421
All you have to do is hold him.

1093
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,724
Support his head.

1094
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,326
There you go.

1095
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,221
Now just rock.
