1
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:16,365
Hi, Mark.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,532
Hi, Susan.

3
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:18,700
Excuse me?

4
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:19,868
What?

5
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,570
You just called me Susan.

6
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,749
No, I didn't.

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,905
Yeah, you did.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,074
I guess she's on your mind, huh?

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,576
Not necessarily.

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,412
I wish you guys would just
hurry up and get married.

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,747
What?!

12
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,548
You're perfect for each other.

13
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:35,584
I mean, you almost
went on vacation together

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,829
You knew about that?

15
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,353
Mark, everybody knew about that.

16
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,656
What I don't get is
why you backed out.

17
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:43,158
She didn't want me to go.

18
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,394
Mark, she wanted you to go.

19
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,895
She did?

20
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,062
Oh, yeah.

21
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,564
Nobody told me.

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,167
Look, just do us all
a favor; ask her out.

23
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,169
We need some fresh
gossip around here.

24
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:56,187
Oh, man, do I need some sleep.

25
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,501
You? At least you
get off in 11 hours.

26
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,824
I've got 18 to go.

27
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,993
Where's Benton?
He still in the E.R.?

28
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,763
No. He's where he's been
most of the last six days.

29
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,265
Still with that baby, huh?

30
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,411
I'm telling you, the
man is obsessed.

31
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,247
Damn it, Epson, I told
you to keep an eye on him.

32
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,914
That's what I told the nurses.

33
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,082
We must find him.

34
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,406
I'll find him.

35
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,224
He's probably in the cafeteria.

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,737
Well, he better not have eaten.

37
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,072
Oh, hey, you guys, listen...
Have you seen a male patient

38
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:22,241
about, uh, this tall;
kind of peculiar?

39
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:23,565
Sorry. Lost one, huh?

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,345
Yeah, great case. Guy's
got a tumor in his throat

41
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,746
the size of a golf ball.

42
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,247
He needs an esophagectomy.

43
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,617
Anspaugh brought in
some hotshot from Japan.

44
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:32,919
We're all set to go;
the patient goes AWOL.

45
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:34,142
Tough break.

46
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,038
Listen, you guys help
me find him, I'll get you in

47
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,173
on the surgery.

48
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,508
Well, we'll keep our eyes open.

49
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,542
Great, thanks, dudes.

50
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,277
Listen, he's got a sweet tooth

51
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,034
so check the vending machines.

52
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,369
Yeah, right.

53
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,870
You know, last shift

54
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,717
he left me three
lines to change.

55
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,374
I had to pick up his labs.

56
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,354
Did you have breakfast yet?

57
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,877
I'm starving.

58
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,520
You paged me?

59
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,293
Yeah. Her abdomen's distended.

60
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,307
Crit's down to 30.
She's hemorrhaging.

61
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:11,613
We need to take her

62
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,742
off the anticoagulants...

63
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,478
That means taking
her off the machine.

64
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,516
Can she live off it?

65
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,919
I doubt she'll last a day

66
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,520
but there's no other choice.

67
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,950
Well, then maybe we should
get her back up to the O.R.

68
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,117
Her platelets are too low.

69
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,858
Then we've got to
transfuse her. We just did.

70
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,937
Look, Dr. Keaton, I mean,
we've got to try something.

71
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:25,327
We can't just...

72
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:26,573
At this point

73
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,313
the best thing to do is nothing.

74
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,616
I also think, that
for the time being

75
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,549
you should be more of an
observer than an active participant.

76
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,205
You mean on this case?

77
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,521
On all the cases.

78
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,612
You know, Dr. Keaton...

79
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,114
I'd do anything
to undo what I did

80
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:47,632
but I can't.

81
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,635
This isn't a punishment, Peter

82
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,648
but you have a tendency
to act without thinking.

83
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,982
If you want to grow as a surgeon

84
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,926
you've got to learn
more patience.

85
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,563
Hear ye, hear ye,
who wants taffy?

86
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,842
Ah, homemade, perchance?

87
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,633
Saltwater. Pulled it myself.

88
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,301
Don't mind if I do.

89
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,802
Excuse me.

90
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,405
Do you have change
for the candy machine?

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,307
Um... let me see...

92
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,475
Yeah.

93
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,809
Quarters okay?

94
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,977
Yes.

95
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,712
Uh, excuse me, Cuz.

96
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,214
You owe me a buck.

97
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,600
I-I don't have one.

98
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,217
Then you're SOL.

99
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,873
Jerry, Connie's sick.
We gotta call in a float.

100
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:18,918
Yeah, I already did.

101
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:19,942
Well, call them back.

102
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,187
I want to approve
whoever they send.

103
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,177
Why?

104
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,223
Could someone call security?!

105
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,712
There is a man urinating

106
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:25,892
in the phone booth.

107
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,882
That's why.

108
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,049
Did anyone hear me?

109
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,717
Yes, Rhonda, we heard you.

110
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:30,930
You don't need
security, you need a mop

111
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:31,820
and the mop is in the corner.

112
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:32,855
I don't mop.

113
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,741
Way to go, Jer.

114
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,326
How was I supposed to know?

115
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,440
I wonder how long
we can sit here

116
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,764
before anyone
notices we're missing.

117
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,032
We'll never know.

118
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:45,467
You just jinxed it.

119
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,801
What do you mean?

120
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,804
Oh...

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,340
That's what I mean.

122
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,907
It's Benton.

123
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:55,243
It couldn't happen to a nicer...

124
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,391
What's that?

125
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,714
It's the E.R..

126
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,216
You want to trade?

127
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,651
No. No way.

128
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,420
Oh. John, hi.

129
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:06,755
Hi, Dr. Keaton.

130
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,668
I got that review article
you dropped off for me

131
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:09,891
on congenital hernias.

132
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,326
Yeah, I, I heard
you were doing one

133
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,022
and I didn't know whether
or not you read it, or...

134
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,946
Well, actually,
I helped edit it.

135
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,482
Oh. Well, then...

136
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,168
but it was very sweet of you.

137
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,787
See you.

138
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,912
Something going on
I should know about?

139
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,464
Please...

140
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,097
And when was your
last bowel movement?

141
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,188
Uh, well, technically...

142
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,808
That would have been
Monday afternoon.

143
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,659
Monday afternoon...

144
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:46,255
Which is a little
unusual for me.

145
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,863
I'm generally a morning person.

146
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,976
Morning person...

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,300
And then, uh,
sometimes in the evening

148
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,869
I pass a little gas.

149
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,404
Gas in the evening...

150
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,551
We don't take lengthy
histories in the E.R.

151
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,386
I believe in being thorough.

152
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,311
Well, when your patient is in
for an extended stay on the ward

153
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:04,979
that may be appropriate

154
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,382
but down here, we keep
our notes short and sweet.

155
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,278
That's not the way I do things.

156
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,602
The longer it takes

157
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,637
the longer the patient
waits in distress.

158
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,071
Well, that's all right.

159
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,507
We were having

160
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,008
a nice little chat.

161
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,543
Anything else?

162
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,798
Now, where were we?

163
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,332
Gas in the evenings.

164
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,518
Oh... yes.

165
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,330
We'll need some
saline, four-oh nylon

166
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,754
and a suture setup.

167
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,122
Coming up.

168
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,759
I know the squirrels
look cute, Arthur

169
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,279
but, uh, I wouldn't
try petting one again.

170
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,513
He was trying to eat it.

171
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,582
Oh.

172
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,572
You all right,
Wendy? It's not me.

173
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:52,577
Oh, he's choking!

174
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,261
His airway's blocked.

175
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,297
Oh, my God.

176
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,397
It's my taffy!

177
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:56,164
We'll Heimlich him.

178
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,777
It was meant for the staff!

179
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,345
He's dying, Wendy! You
want to give me a hand?

180
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:00,951
One, two, three!

181
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,054
Oh! God!

182
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,767
Jesus, there's still a
lot more down there.

183
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,090
How much taffy did you make?

184
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,425
Two pounds.

185
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,294
Get a Magill and
hook up the suction.

186
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,157
Arthur, go back to
the waiting room.

187
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,383
What's a patient in a
surgical gown doing

188
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:16,735
down here, anyway?

189
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,069
Call upstairs.

190
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,572
I think we might've just
found Dale's AWOL patient.

191
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,073
Just lay back, sir.

192
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,152
Where do you want him?

193
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,576
All right. What's this?

194
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,888
13-year-old. Full arrest.

195
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,190
Took two bullets

196
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,046
to chest and belly.

197
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:29,681
How long has he been down?

198
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,881
Been working on him for 15.

199
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,245
Any signs of life? Negative.

200
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,752
Let's transfer him over.

201
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,220
Give me four units O-negative.

202
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,056
On my count. One, two, three.

203
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,392
Here's one entry.

204
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,071
I got the other one.

205
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,439
What happened?

206
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,662
Some gang thing.

207
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,509
He's a banger. Look at the tats.

208
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,832
Flatline.

209
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,012
How long was he down
before you got there?

210
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,168
About five, ten minutes.

211
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,771
Anybody give him CPR?

212
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,572
No, they were just
standing around.

213
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,108
So he was down
for... 20 minutes?

214
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,443
At least.

215
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,189
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

216
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,014
This kid is dead, very dead.

217
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,832
You calling it?

218
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,168
Yeah.

219
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,770
Time of Death: 8:26.

220
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,042
This the GSW?

221
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,561
He's been down for 20
minutes. He's not coming back.

222
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,696
You giving up on him?

223
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,548
He had no sign
of life in the field.

224
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,617
Lydia, start bagging him.

225
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,252
Thoracotomy tray.

226
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:25,253
Peter, I called it.

227
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,499
Gant, let's get a
cutdown on the ankles.

228
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:27,222
Hold on. Hold on.

229
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,984
Let's get some
blood into him now.

230
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,303
This kid's been
down for 20 minutes.

231
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:31,709
We can bring him back.

232
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:32,789
His brain is mush.
All right, ten blade...

233
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,045
His parents don't

234
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,263
want him ripped open.

235
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,059
I'm sure they want us
to do the most we can.

236
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,617
Lydia, go get Mark. Go get Mark!

237
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,330
Get the O-neg on
the rapid infuser.

238
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,154
Rib spreader. Let's go, Chuny.

239
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,789
God... it's like rubber.

240
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,724
It's all in the cornstarch.

241
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,159
Scissors.

242
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,283
Yeah.

243
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,952
I think it is coming loose.

244
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:00,905
Carter, what are you
doing to my patient?

245
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,718
He swallowed
two pounds of taffy.

246
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,875
Saltwater.

247
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,822
There it is.

248
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,796
Shame on you, Mr. Percy.

249
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,382
You know better than
to eat before surgery.

250
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,084
I'm sorry.

251
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,452
No harm done. Nothing
can get past that tumor.

252
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,788
We need to move.

253
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,105
All right, let's take him up.

254
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,975
Hey, Dale, remember me?

255
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,465
Oh, yeah. John.

256
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,279
I'd ask you to join us,
but we're a little crowded.

257
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,569
Well, I think we can make room.

258
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,304
After all, Carter
saved your keister.

259
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,873
Did you consent Mr. Percy?

260
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,307
I did.

261
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,320
All that's left to do is an
art line and he's ready to go.

262
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,978
Carter, you do the line

263
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,791
and Edson, you prep the OR.

264
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,693
Dr. Okida likes the temperature

265
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,516
to be precisely 67 degrees.

266
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,018
Precisely.

267
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,002
Have you got the O-neg running?

268
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:49,337
Two lines, wide open.

269
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:50,838
What's the story?

270
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,318
The kid was down
20 minutes. I called it.

271
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,240
Peter is now playing God.

272
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,425
The kid was out in the cold.

273
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,560
Peter already started,
might as well let him finish.

274
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,729
He's dead, Mark.

275
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,563
Maybe.

276
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,714
This was my patient.

277
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,650
I assessed him as unsalvageable.

278
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,462
And you should
support my assessment.

279
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,547
He's not just your
patient, Doug.

280
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,799
Gant, get over here.

281
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,116
Put your finger in the hole.

282
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,373
High dose epi.

283
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,709
Behind you.

284
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,689
All right, start
internal massage.

285
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,345
Like this?

286
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,780
Just keep squeezing.

287
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,547
Anything?

288
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,932
Still flatline.

289
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,206
Whoa, it jumped.

290
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,686
He's got a rhythm.

291
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,943
That's the epi, not his heart.

292
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,397
That's more than the epi.

293
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,099
All right. You brought him back.

294
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,135
Great. His heart's
back. His head's dead.

295
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,470
You don't know that.

296
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,972
All right. Call the O.R.

297
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,518
Tell them we're on our way up.

298
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,108
Okay. Here we go, people.

299
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,354
Let's move.

300
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,522
Thanks, Haleh.

301
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,879
Here we go.

302
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,892
Hello, Dr. Lewis.

303
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,454
What's the matter, E-Ray?

304
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:04,111
I just don't feel like myself.

305
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:05,780
You have a fever?

306
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,416
No, but I had an MRI
yesterday on my shoulder...

307
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:09,951
An old Conga injury...

308
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,853
And ever since, I just feel off.

309
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,621
Could it be radiation sickness?

310
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:15,267
MRI's aren't radioactive.

311
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,586
They just scramble
your electrons a bit.

312
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,905
Forever?

313
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,573
No, just for a few seconds.

314
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,757
That's odd.

315
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,064
What?

316
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,566
My watch stopped.

317
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,934
Oh, my God.

318
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,268
What?

319
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,737
My watch stopped last night

320
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,839
right after the MRI.

321
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,407
And the toaster.

322
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,042
What toaster?

323
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:36,461
My toaster.

324
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,345
It shorted out this morning.

325
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,748
I've had that
toaster for ten years.

326
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,266
So?

327
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,802
Could the MRI have
rearranged my molecules

328
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,403
causing me to radiate

329
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,857
some sort of bizarre
electronic interference?

330
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:50,191
No.

331
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,747
Follow the light with your eyes.

332
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,612
What light?

333
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:58,432
That's funny.

334
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,771
What have we got, Peter?

335
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,940
13-year-old, GSW to the
abdomen and pulmonary artery.

336
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,542
We clamped him in the
E.R. and got his heart back.

337
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:09,710
Downtime?

338
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:10,911
15 minutes.

339
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,797
Well, actually closer to 20,

340
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,399
but he was out in the cold

341
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,313
so we may be able
to save his brain.

342
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,469
You giving odds?

343
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,854
Dr. Greene and I both felt

344
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,388
we should keep trying.

345
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,202
This could take all day but,
in for a penny, in for a pound.

346
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:24,653
He's bleeding from
the belly wound.

347
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,527
I'd go for a midline incision.

348
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,130
I thought I was just
supposed to observe.

349
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,043
In this case, I'll
make an exception.

350
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,050
It's all yours.

351
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,570
All right... all right.

352
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,856
Mark a 9:35 start time.

353
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,993
Oh, Mark. Got a ten-foot fall.

354
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,495
Yeah? Where from?

355
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,331
A tree, taking
pictures in Grant Park.

356
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,833
Dizzy? Nauseous?

357
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,469
Dizzy, yes. Nauseous, no.

358
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,449
What were you taking
pictures of? The birds.

359
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,101
Turn. Haven't most
of them gone south?

360
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,845
Ah, not the ones
I'm interested in.

361
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,906
Well, seems okay to me.

362
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,140
Why don't you take
her to curtain area two

363
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,524
and I'll be there in a minute.

364
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,941
Susan.

365
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,442
Hi.

366
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:18,079
You want to go out tonight?

367
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:23,134
Yeah, sure. I'd love to

368
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,380
but, um, I can't.

369
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,954
I have something planned.

370
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,307
So you can't.

371
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,462
I guess not.

372
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,629
Maybe some other time.

373
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,831
Sure.

374
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,201
Uh...

375
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,619
We need to talk.

376
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,770
Dr. Lewis?

377
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,723
Dr. Morgenstern's on the line.

378
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,258
I'll call you tonight.

379
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,065
Okay, Mr. Percy.

380
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,402
We need...

381
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,537
Mr. Percy?

382
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,515
Mr. Percy?

383
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,017
Who's there?

384
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,535
It's Dr. Carter.

385
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:20,124
I take it you have some
reservations about the surgery.

386
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,294
Do you have change
for the candy machine?

387
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,230
You can't eat with that
tumor in your throat.

388
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,843
Eloise put a Hershey bar

389
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,896
in the blender and I drank it.

390
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,737
Do you know you're about to
have a very serious operation?

391
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,206
There's no blender
here. I asked.

392
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,294
Has someone come in to
go over the risks with you?

393
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,896
Another time...

394
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,715
she blended up a Snickers.

395
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,151
Mm-hmm.

396
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,254
The trouble was...

397
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,290
the nougat got
caught in the straw.

398
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,403
You ever have a Zagnut?

399
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,672
I love Zagnut.

400
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,757
They're my favorite.

401
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,792
Mine, too.

402
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,746
Mr. Percy?

403
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,132
Do you want to
have this operation?

404
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,822
Can I just have change
for the candy machine?

405
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,867
Is it ready?

406
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,486
Not quite.

407
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,764
What are you doing?

408
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:41,105
Mixing an enema.

409
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,756
White and brown, I call it.

410
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,091
Milk and molasses.

411
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:44,925
Did a doctor order this?

412
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,143
After 22 years, I know

413
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,778
when somebody needs an enema.

414
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,857
When somebody needs an enema,

415
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,526
we give them one in a
box and send them home.

416
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,277
We don't spend half an
hour mixing up a recipe.

417
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:53,201
I do.

418
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:54,316
Not anymore you don't.

419
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,404
I'll take over from here.

420
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,084
Go change the beds in Exam Four.

421
00:15:58,108 --> 00:15:59,251
You can't do that.

422
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:00,552
Sure I can. I'm
the charge nurse,

423
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:01,620
which means I'm in charge.

424
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:03,060
But I don't want a new nurse.

425
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,378
Well, you're in luck

426
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,747
'cause the chart here
says you can go home.

427
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,182
Where are your clothes?

428
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,217
Well, uh...

429
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,212
Hello.

430
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,899
Your CT is fine.

431
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,901
I don't see any birds in here.

432
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,580
I'll let you in on a secret.

433
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,416
I'm more than
just a bird watcher.

434
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,906
Really?

435
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,919
I'm a comparative anthropologist

436
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:35,410
doing a field study

437
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,623
on the mating rituals
of man and bird.

438
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,213
Oh, sounds like
interesting work.

439
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,714
It is.

440
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,317
For instance, you take
those two over there.

441
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,919
Notice the occasional
lateral body contact

442
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:48,839
initiated by her, then
reciprocated by him.

443
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,341
Yeah?

444
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:54,829
Identical to the courtship
dance of the sharp-tailed grouse.

445
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:55,829
Really?

446
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:58,165
Oh, yeah... oh, yeah.

447
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,334
Check out those two at the desk.

448
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,203
Do you see how
he puffs his chest

449
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:03,887
and strokes his goatee? Yeah.

450
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,940
Same as the
slender-billed shearwater.

451
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,375
Oh, look... at... that.

452
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:09,543
What?

453
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,646
Her frontal neck presentation.

454
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:12,496
What's that mean?

455
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,714
In the nuthatch,

456
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,349
it's an invitation to love.

457
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,184
Oh, she is shameless.

458
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,602
Why?

459
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,465
You see how she strokes
her throat with her finger?

460
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:21,633
Yeah, what does that mean?

461
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:24,641
The corresponding behavior
in the spoonbill would be

462
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,744
to bend over and
shake her tail feathers

463
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,012
in his face.

464
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,877
I need some moist lap
pads to pack off the liver.

465
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:32,866
Thank you.

466
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,112
Bad news for the gallbladder.

467
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,781
The bullet tore through
the common duct.

468
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,505
2-0 Prolene.

469
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,817
What's your plan, Peter?

470
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,274
Pack and stitch off the liver,

471
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,487
put in three or
four Jackson Pratts

472
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:42,943
and move on to the gallbladder.

473
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,122
Sounds good.

474
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,223
I'd love to stay and watch,

475
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,492
but I've got a cystic hygroma.

476
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:49,350
Shirley, is Dr. Maxwell
available to supervise?

477
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,518
He's resecting a valve,

478
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:51,963
but Dr. Breedlove is around.

479
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,187
Breedlove? I thought he died.

480
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,416
I just saw him in the hall.

481
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,673
Breedlove would be perfect.

482
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,185
Track him down,
would you, Shirley?

483
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,143
3-0 on a needle. Let's move!

484
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,975
Jerry, did my blood
test come back?

485
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,498
Not yet.

486
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,000
Damn.

487
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,434
What?

488
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,136
The computer just went down.

489
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:16,477
Why don't you have
a seat right there.

490
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,245
Here's your aftercare

491
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,492
your prescription
and your enema.

492
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,394
The instructions are inside.

493
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:23,917
I know all about them.

494
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:26,420
Someone from the home's
going to be picking you up.

495
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:28,467
They should be
here in a few minutes.

496
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:30,458
I'll believe that when I see it.

497
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,443
Mark, what are you doing?

498
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,934
You see what I see?

499
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:43,620
Susan's talking to
Morgenstern. So what?

500
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,089
He's stroking himself,
puffing out his chest

501
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,626
just like a slender-billed
something or other.

502
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,427
She's giving him
full-frontal neck.

503
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,096
I pulled a couple of
strings and they're

504
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,298
on their way.

505
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,777
What are you talking about?

506
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,701
You'd know if you
were a nuthatch.

507
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,036
Mark, are you okay?

508
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,905
She turned me down.

509
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,374
Susan?

510
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,875
Now I know why.

511
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,377
Oh God, she's stroking her neck.

512
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,745
So?

513
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,496
So why doesn't
she just bend over

514
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:12,082
and shake her tail
feathers right in his face?

515
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:16,504
Did you consent Mr. Percy?

516
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:17,716
Yeah. Why?

517
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,818
He couldn't reiterate
the risks to me.

518
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:22,254
All he wants to do is
talk about chocolate.

519
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:23,444
He's just in denial.

520
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,012
Candy's his way of coping.

521
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,458
No, no. We're talking about
doing a high-risk procedure

522
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,694
on a guy that can't
carry a conversation.

523
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:30,050
He signed the consent.

524
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,963
He's not qualified to
make treatment decisions.

525
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,120
I disagree.

526
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,700
Let's get a shrink down
here and see what he says.

527
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:36,357
You want to delay
Anspaugh's surgery

528
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,043
with Dr. Okida because
you aren't comfortable

529
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,811
with a patient's mental status?

530
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,625
I'll get a Stat Psych consult.

531
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,382
If he agrees with me,
then I'll tell Anspaugh.

532
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,387
What happened?

533
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,400
Doug was trying
to explain things

534
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,169
and the guy just went postal.

535
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,037
It's a damn scratch on his
finger, for crying out loud!

536
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,026
It's a serious infection.

537
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,155
Look, who are
you to tell me what

538
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,023
to do with my son?! I am
his doctor and he's going

539
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,525
to be treated or I'll
have to call the cops.

540
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:01,932
Doug, what's this about?

541
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,212
The young man. He has an
infected human bite on his finger.

542
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,804
His father won't let me
put him on IV antibiotics.

543
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,317
It's a free country and
we want to go home.

544
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,222
Come on.

545
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,141
Hold on a second.

546
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,457
Can I see the x-ray?

547
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:16,397
The infection
could be in the joint.

548
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:19,366
Uh, let me see you guys outside.

549
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:20,934
We'll be right with you.

550
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,057
He could lose his finger.

551
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,925
There's no sign
of osteomyelitis.

552
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,022
It could develop if he
doesn't get it treated.

553
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:31,240
It took his dad two
days to bring him in.

554
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,357
I doubt he's going
to bring him back.

555
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,765
I agree, an IV course
is the best way to go

556
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,168
but I don't think we
should call the police

557
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,685
if he can be treated

558
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,953
with oral antibiotics.

559
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,689
Fine. You do what you want.

560
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,037
Your psych consult come down?

561
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:47,561
Still waiting.

562
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,229
Well, time's up.

563
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,366
Mr. Percy, do you
want to go through

564
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,279
with this surgery or not?

565
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,537
Can I have change
for the candy machine?

566
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,523
Art line in?

567
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,569
It's in.

568
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,093
Let's take him, Oki.

569
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,427
Okey-dokey.

570
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,774
Dr. Anspaugh, I
think you should know

571
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,692
Mr. Percy seems more interested

572
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,277
in talking about candy
than having surgery.

573
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,768
Don't you worry, Mr. Percy.

574
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,947
You can have all
the candy you want

575
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,049
just as soon as we get
that tumor out of the way.

576
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,707
You coming, John?

577
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,630
I'm due for my break.

578
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:24,532
Oh, we don't take
scheduled breaks.

579
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,334
When it gets slow, we
rotate out for ten minutes.

580
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,852
It's in the contract.

581
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,822
Is a little flexibility
too much to ask?

582
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,423
Nurse!

583
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,358
Whose patient is she?

584
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,510
Oh, she's not.

585
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,390
She was discharged
to a nursing home.

586
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,058
Her nursing home
ain't going to take her.

587
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,260
She just had an accident.

588
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:42,611
What kind of an accident?

589
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,301
The loose, runny kind

590
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,004
that makes a
puddle on the floor.

591
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,039
Nurse. Oh, nurse.

592
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,675
I believe the mop is over there.

593
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,041
More oh-chromic
on a liver needle.

594
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,697
Cut.

595
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,066
Box!

596
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,122
You Benton?

597
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:06,974
Uh-huh.

598
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,809
Stan Breedlove. Where are we?

599
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:11,345
Just finished the pneumonectomy.

600
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,880
Almost done with the liver.

601
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,364
Got a gallbladder to go.

602
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,216
Take wider bites

603
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,829
and don't tie so tight.

604
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,054
Okay.

605
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,572
More three-oh Vicryl.

606
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,801
Good stuff, Vicryl.

607
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,325
Closest thing to catgut.

608
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,109
Surgeons still use that?

609
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,394
Not these days.

610
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,763
It's a shame.

611
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,814
Nothing ties like catgut.

612
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,282
Ah! We got a bleeder.

613
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,328
Is it new?

614
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,551
Sure is.

615
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,930
Where is it coming from?

616
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,087
Aorta.

617
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,255
Okay, more suction.

618
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,456
Whoa!

619
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,635
Got a pumper!

620
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,803
Damn. Blew a clot.

621
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,171
Put your finger on it.

622
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,144
Statinsky!

623
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:45,274
Okay. Come on.

624
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:46,308
I got it.

625
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,532
Clamps here. Clamp?

626
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,417
Still falling.

627
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,303
Debride the hole and sew it
with some three-oh Prolene.

628
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,604
Vascular needle<i> now.</i>

629
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,856
Damn it!

630
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:56,924
Internal paddles.

631
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,492
Let's move. All right...

632
00:22:58,527 --> 00:22:59,893
Charging. 20.

633
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:01,428
Clear.

634
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,347
Still in fib.

635
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,015
Charging 30. Clear.

636
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,128
No change.

637
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,052
Charging 40. Clear.

638
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,788
Got him back.

639
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,024
Still at it, huh?

640
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,360
Yeah. A lot of work to
save an organ donor.

641
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,029
Wait. Lost it.

642
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,698
Charging 40. Clear.

643
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,868
Charging. Clear.

644
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,870
Fifty!

645
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,804
Susan and Morgenstern?
I don't believe it.

646
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,829
The more I think about it,
the more sense it makes.

647
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:38,832
She's been preoccupied
lately; distracted, avoiding me.

648
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:40,211
You know, now
that I think about it

649
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,880
I did see Morgenstern and her

650
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:43,381
having lunch the other day.

651
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:44,939
See? I waited too long, huh?

652
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,373
Missed my chance. Blew it.

653
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:49,677
I can't believe that
we got him back.

654
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,657
Yeah. Kid's got good protoplasm.

655
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,814
Set him up for an apnea test

656
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,816
see if he's got any brain left.

657
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,887
Think he's got a chance?

658
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:02,022
Well, he's made it this far.

659
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:04,558
Dr. Benton, the boy's mother.

660
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:09,029
Do you want to talk to her?

661
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:11,598
Not yet.

662
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,168
I want to assess his
brain function first.

663
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,103
I'll go talk to her.

664
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,104
All right.

665
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,118
Uh... don't get her hopes up.

666
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,875
How's the Herlihy baby?

667
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,944
Still alive last time I checked.

668
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,636
Ow! My foot!

669
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,603
Sal Urbanski.

670
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,250
Playing football in the street

671
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,818
went man-for-man with a Buick.

672
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,653
Right foot ripped
off at the ankle.

673
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,744
He's shocky; lost
a liter at the scene.

674
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,745
Where's the foot?

675
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,258
Wrapped up between his legs.

676
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,726
Why's he holding a football?

677
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,294
Says it's his lucky ball.

678
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,551
How lucky can it be?

679
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,064
At least he didn't fumble.

680
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,188
All right. Let's
get six units O-neg

681
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,190
CBC, type and cross.

682
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,658
All right. On my count.

683
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,992
One, two, three.

684
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,142
Let's get this foot on ice.

685
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,965
I got it.

686
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,300
Someone call vascular

687
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,180
and page the
reimplantation team.

688
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,204
Aye, aye.

689
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,973
All right. Stand by with
morphine, four migs.

690
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,975
This pressure
dressing isn't working.

691
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,977
I need a thigh cuff.

692
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,412
Oh, thank you.

693
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:23,269
You see that Oki's freeing
up the esophagus posteriorly

694
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:24,638
with his fingers.

695
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:28,509
Dale, you're in a position
to displace it laterally.

696
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:30,878
I can free it up
anteriorly from here.

697
00:25:30,913 --> 00:25:32,513
You stick to suction, Carter.

698
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:34,192
I can feel it coming loose.

699
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,293
Suction.

700
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:36,566
<i>Suction.</i>

701
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:37,584
You falling asleep.

702
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,952
As Oki cuts along

703
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:42,022
the sternocleidomastoid
down towards the carotid sheath

704
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:44,391
what's he got to
watch out for, Carter?

705
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:47,227
Not to nick any arteries?

706
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:48,545
Dale?

707
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,447
The, uh, Vagus nerve

708
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,332
which runs through the sheath.

709
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:53,684
Very good.

710
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,218
Dale is smart.

711
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:01,825
Are those little bubbles
on the lung normal?

712
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:02,861
Bubbles?

713
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,944
What bubbles?

714
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,112
Those ones right there

715
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,381
where Dale just
moved the esophagus.

716
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,676
Oh...

717
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,099
You poke hole in pleura.

718
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,168
I didn't feel it tear.

719
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,486
Congratulations, Edson.

720
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:15,756
You've just given
Mr. Percy a pneumothorax.

721
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,752
I'm in a good position
to put in a chest tube.

722
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:18,892
Yes, put tube in now.

723
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:21,261
Dale, want to hold
that for me, please?

724
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,532
Scalpel.

725
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,648
Chest tube, 32-French.

726
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,172
Scissors.

727
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,361
Got it.

728
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,412
That was a nice catch, Carter.

729
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,816
Hey! Where's my suction?

730
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,184
Oh, I'm sorry.

731
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:50,357
All right. Give me
the football, sir.

732
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,358
Don't lose it.

733
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:52,692
It's signed by Ditka.

734
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,389
Don't worry I'm going to
put it in with your clothes.

735
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,379
BP's down to 60.

736
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,248
Let's get another line going.

737
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,616
Start the rapid infuser.

738
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:00,951
Hey, there, sports fans.

739
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,986
Someone call for a
vascular surgeon?

740
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:04,788
Ah, it's about time.

741
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,290
Don't get fresh
with me, little lassie.

742
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,725
BP's down to 40.

743
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,960
Ice is here.

744
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,678
Put it on the foot.

745
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,948
Uh-oh.

746
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:16,617
I'm in trouble here.

747
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:18,296
What? You can't find a vein?

748
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,420
No. Itchy in my mouche.

749
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:21,955
Your moustache?

750
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:23,289
Would you be so kind?

751
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:24,636
Left side, near my nose.

752
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,937
Yeah. Ah, that's it.

753
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,205
That's my spot.

754
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,595
Ah...

755
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,875
That's my spot.

756
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,331
You want me to help you?

757
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:32,999
No, no, no. Susan's got it.

758
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:34,713
Uh! Here we go. I'm in.

759
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,119
Okay. Hook it up.

760
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,854
Okay. Let's get him upstairs.

761
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,523
The reimplantation team awaits.

762
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,057
Have we got the foot?

763
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,093
Right here.

764
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,331
I'll see you later? Yeah.

765
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,370
Dr. Benton.

766
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,705
The boy's mother wanted to watch

767
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,275
and said I'd have
to come ask you.

768
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,793
All right.

769
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:02,329
Tell her to come in.

770
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,653
This is Mrs. Dorsett.

771
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,822
I'm Dr. Benton.

772
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,136
I took your son
off the ventilator

773
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,961
a minute ago
to test if his brain

774
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,807
will trigger him to breathe.

775
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,197
I don't understand.

776
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,900
Well, if we see your
son take a breath

777
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,030
then that means

778
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:26,797
his brain function is intact.

779
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:29,355
If there's no attempt
to breathe, then...

780
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,458
well, that's a sign
of brain death.

781
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:34,177
PCO2 is 60.

782
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,442
That's high enough
to make him breathe.

783
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,666
How long will it take?

784
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,952
We'll know in ten seconds.

785
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:58,452
Come on.

786
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:08,195
I'm sorry.

787
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:29,883
You wanted to see me?

788
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:32,685
Yes, I did.

789
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:34,988
How many shifts you
work a week, Mark?

790
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:35,989
Four?

791
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,324
Usually.

792
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,226
As long as we don't
work the same four,

793
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:40,460
we'll get along great.

794
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,946
Is this about that kid's finger?

795
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,982
It's about your inability
to respect my decisions.

796
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,662
Professional differences
happen, Doug.

797
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:48,985
You can't take it personally.

798
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,753
It's entirely personal,<i> Mark.</i>

799
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,522
You've been on
a moral high horse

800
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,507
ever since I came
in with that OD.

801
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,821
Yeah, well, what do you
expect when you drag

802
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:58,773
your dirty laundry
through the door?

803
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,831
But it's not personal, right?

804
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,200
Who are you kidding?

805
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,761
Mrs. Urbanski, your
husband's up in surgery.

806
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:17,697
The surgeons are going
to try and reattach his foot.

807
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,815
But is he all right?

808
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,595
Well, he lost some
blood. We transfused him.

809
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,796
I think he's going to be fine.

810
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,769
Here's his stuff.

811
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:23,903
Thank you.

812
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:24,904
You're welcome.

813
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,217
He seemed very concerned

814
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,885
about his Mike Ditka football.

815
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,059
He loves the Bears.

816
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,572
Yeah, well, I'm going
to try and find someone

817
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:31,873
to bring you up to
the surgical floor.

818
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,040
Okay?

819
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,325
Wendy.

820
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:37,028
Can you bring Mrs.
Urbanski up to surgery for me?

821
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,185
Sure.

822
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,553
Thank you.

823
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,357
How we doing?

824
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:45,858
Ready when you are.

825
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:51,347
Let's bring on the foot.

826
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,534
What the hell..?

827
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,772
Mrs. Urbanski, what is it?!

828
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:00,940
Oh, God!

829
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:01,941
Oh, my God!

830
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:02,942
Oh, I'm so...

831
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:03,978
Oh, my God.

832
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:11,117
In and out, under two hours.

833
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,352
Oki's amazing.

834
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,298
I really appreciate
you inviting me along.

835
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:15,622
I'm glad we did.

836
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,425
Otherwise we might not
have seen that pneumothorax.

837
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,293
I have two hours
until my flight.

838
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:21,294
Want to eat?

839
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:22,440
If you're buying.

840
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:25,064
Why don't you join us, Carter?

841
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,227
Edson,

842
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,201
monitor Mr. Percy in recovery.

843
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,574
It was an honest
mistake, a mix-up.

844
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,143
It was the most incompetent,
horrifying thing I've ever seen.

845
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,790
And because you
didn't ice the foot

846
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,113
they can't reattach it.

847
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,359
Please, don't write me up.

848
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:42,516
Are you kidding?

849
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,995
If anyone deserves to
be written up, it's you.

850
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:45,151
All right. Go ahead.

851
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:46,853
Do their dirty work for them.

852
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,354
That's just what they want.

853
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,670
Whose dirty work?

854
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:52,158
Hospital Administration.

855
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:54,528
I'm nine months away from
getting my maximum pension

856
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:56,374
and they're trying
to force me out.

857
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,142
That's why they keep
floating me down here

858
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,027
where I don't know
what I'm doing.

859
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,796
You're right. You don't
know what you're doing.

860
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,097
They want to get
rid of people like me

861
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,082
and replace them with
cheaper, less experienced aides.

862
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:07,758
If they know the difference
between a football and a foot

863
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:08,775
I'll take them.

864
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:10,444
I am not going to let you

865
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,278
put me through the humiliation

866
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:14,614
of a review board,
not after 22 years.

867
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,582
Watch me.

868
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:17,951
Don't bother.

869
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,652
I quit.

870
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:51,362
Dr. Keaton said
her oxygen level's

871
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,686
as low as it can go.

872
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,121
It's only a matter of time.

873
00:32:57,826 --> 00:33:00,794
Thank you for everything
you've done for Megan.

874
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,839
So, what happened to that float?

875
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,495
She quit, thank God.

876
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:22,999
She told me the Hospital
Admin was trying to make her quit

877
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,935
before her pension maxed out.

878
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,337
That's why they were
floating her down here.

879
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,250
Yeah. She gave me the same line.

880
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,751
It's a bunch of bull.

881
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,509
They're floating me to Neuro.

882
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,845
What?

883
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,246
Starting tomorrow

884
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:39,415
the hospital's floating me
to Neuro three times a week.

885
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,885
When's your pension max out?

886
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,519
In a year.

887
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:58,001
So, maybe it was personal.

888
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,369
Go ahead. Say it.

889
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:02,305
I'm a sanctimonious,
judgmental, self-righteous

890
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,335
sexually frustrated little man.

891
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:07,110
Well, you're not little.

892
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,828
Thank you.

893
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,866
I'd hate to think that
my personal pique

894
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,302
could color my
professional decisions

895
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:18,271
but it happens and it
probably happened today.

896
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,959
Now look, you don't
need to beat me up

897
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,629
about making a
mess out of my life.

898
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,547
I like to do that myself.

899
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:30,233
Well, it may not be
the healthiest approach.

900
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,768
Yeah.

901
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,237
Hey, you know,
I'm seeing a shrink.

902
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,905
Oh, well that's a good step.

903
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,240
Yeah.

904
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,726
Man or a woman?

905
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:40,894
A woman.

906
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,578
Don't worry.

907
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,963
She's 62 years old.

908
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,915
Oh. Freudian?

909
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,016
Yeah.

910
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,768
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

911
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,121
I hate you, you know that.

912
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,241
I know.

You knew it would
be, didn't you?

936
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,801
I had an idea.

what you said... you know.

Rushed ahead; didn't think.

you could save that boy?

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,986
I never worked so hard

941
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:16,556
or performed more
surgery than I did today.

942
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,778
I took that vent off...

I, uh...

947
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:43,266
I can't face those parents.

I'm telling you, Wendy,
the guy walks in the room

950
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:58,542
and every vending

Nope. Nothing left to do
but turn him and water him.

00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,670
Shame you backed off
on that psych consult.

971

is going on here?

976
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,999
John and I were just discussing

977
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,012
the finer points of
informed consent.

She and Morgenstern
are going out.

981
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,927
I can live with that.

982
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,875
But what bothers me is
that she didn't tell me about it.

983
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:06,199
Well, if I was going
out with Morgenstern

984
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,533
I wouldn't tell anybody.

985
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:10,469
Susan and I are supposed
to be friends, right?

986
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,383
I mean, how did this happen?

987
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:13,550
How serious is it?

988
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:14,974
Why don't you ask her?

989
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,621
What, oh, you want me to just go
to her apartment, knock on the door

990
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,590
and say, "So, what's up
with you and Morgenstern?"

991
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:21,080
That'd be one way.

992
00:38:21,116 --> 00:38:22,916
That's not my style.

993
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:26,619
Mark, you might want to
think about changing your style.

994
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:41,767
Okay, E. Ray, what's
that key sequence?

995
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:44,754
Control A-Q-R, and
then push the pound key.

996
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,255
Okay.

997
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,108
Hurry up! I hear someone coming!

998
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:50,810
Well, close the door.

999
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:59,502
Okay. Here goes.

1000
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,175
Control... A... Q... R... pound.

1001
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,479
Good job, Jerry.

1002
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,799
Don't leave me in too long.

1003
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:16,219
15 Seconds should be
enough to reverse my polarity.

1004
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:19,288
This radiology tech
stuff isn't so hard.

1005
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,057
I can feel the difference.

1006
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,709
I'm me again.

1007
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,244
Turn it off.

1008
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,380
Uh, okay. What's
the sequence for that?

1009
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,482
Isn't there a switch?

1010
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:31,084
Which one?

1011
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,596
There should be
like a kill switch.

1012
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,037
A big red button?

1013
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:36,072
Uh, what about this?

1014
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,793
Oh, my God!

1015
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:42,328
Jerry, what are you doing?

1016
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:43,680
Uh, I don't know.

1017
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,064
What are you doing, Jerry?

1018
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,449
I don't know, I don't know.

1019
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,566
Pull the plug.

1020
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:48,835

1021
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,147
Oh, my God!

1022
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:51,854
Pull the plug!

1023
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,258
Medicine is supposed
to be a noble profession

1024
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,293
not a motorcycle club.

1025
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,963

1026
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,467
I was... it was
stupid, Dr. Keaton.

1027
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,536
Abby. I'm listening.

1028
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,672
There was a patient

1029
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,919
scheduled for a
high-risk surgery

1030
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,976
clearly<i> non compos mentis...</i>

1031
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,378
Mm-hmm.

1032
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,653
And I knew I should have called

1033
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,382
a psych consult
down to clear him

1034
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,984
but... I didn't.

1035
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,186
I was too afraid
of... I don't know

1036
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,500
pissing off the
surgeons to speak up.

1037
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,990
What happened?

1038
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,325
He stroked out.

1039
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:30,660
He stroked out.

1040
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,790
He should never
have had the surgery

1041
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:34,147
and I knew it.

1042
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,283
Well, at least you care
about your patients.

1043
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:39,218
A lot of surgeons don't.

1044
00:40:41,156 --> 00:40:42,621
They don't?

1045
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:43,657
Mm-mm.

1046
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:46,358
Dr. Keaton...

1047
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:47,593
Abby.

1048
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,580

1050
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:01,674
It's Mark.

1051
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:05,077
I just called you.

1052
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:06,446
Are you alone?

1053
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:08,114
Yeah, yeah.

1054
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:12,252
So, uh...

1055
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:14,721
I'll make this easy.

1056
00:41:14,756 --> 00:41:17,123
I know about you
and Morgenstern.

1057
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:19,959
You do?

1058
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:22,161
Yeah.

1059
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:24,564
So, how long you
been seeing each other?

1060
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,984
You mean as...?

1061
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,902
In going out?

1062
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:31,938
Yeah.

1063
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,375
Mark, we're not.

1064
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,277
You're not?

1065
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:38,577
No.

1066
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:40,013
Are you sure?

1067
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:42,248
Yes.

1068
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:44,444
So, are you seeing anybody?

1069
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,305
Maybe we should sit down.

1070
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:06,356
Morgenstern has been helping
me get my transcripts together.

1071
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,740
Transcripts?

1072
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,425
I'm leaving my residency.

1073
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,587
You're quitting?

1074

1076
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,032
Phoenix.

1077
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:22,288
When I was there
visiting Chloe and Suzy

1078
00:42:22,324 --> 00:42:24,023
I just got this feeling

1079
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:27,493
like this is where I'm
supposed to be right now

1080
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:29,111
and...

1081
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:33,649
I don't have anything here
in Chicago really, and...

1082
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,653
I mean...

1083
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,305
I-I know what you mean.

1084
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:43,676
And after I've decided,

1085
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,644
I just feel happy

1086
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,766
for the first time
in a long time.

1087
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:53,803
Like I'm finally
moving on with my life.

1088
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:55,821
That's great.

1089
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,992
God...

1090
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,513
So, you're sure?

1091
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:06,465
Yeah. I am.

1092
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,538
I don't... I don't
know what to say.

1093
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,018
I know.

1094
00:43:25,053 --> 00:43:27,686
I'm going to miss you.

1095
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,926
I am going to miss you, too.

1096
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,198
Kit...

1097
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,000
is the pulse ox monitor right?

1098
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:58,468
Yes, it is.

1099
00:43:58,503 --> 00:43:59,802
What did you do?

1100
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,115
Nothing.

1101
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,779
About an hour ago, she
just started getting better.

1102
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:18,137
It's a miracle.
