1
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:12,961
Okay, if you don't have

2
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:15,029
your child's card
with you, let me know.

3
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,198
<i>Si no tienes su tarjeta
de imunizacion hoy</i>

4
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,567
<i>por favor, digame ahora.</i>

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,614
Chuny, can I get a
hand in here, please?

6
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,372
<i>A tengan pacience, por favor...</i>

7
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:25,607
Okay, listen, I'll be with
all of you in just a second.

8
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:27,776
Everybody get a cookie?
Get a cookie? Excuse me, pal.

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,978
Listen, I need you to
explain to her about the lead.

10
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,480
<i>O tenemos un examen de...</i>

11
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:32,914
<i>ieu nu-sint spaniola.</i>

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,950
<i>Intelet mai bine
engiezeste de cit spaniola.</i>

13
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,019
Sorry. That ain't Spanish.

14
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,738
Uh, we need to take some blood

15
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,225
to see if the baby's
been exposed to lead.

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,726
Lead is very bad for children.

17
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,843
Okay.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,590
And then if there's a
problem, we'll call you.

19
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,696
Okay.

20
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,849
You know what, if
you just... you sign this,

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,584
and then the nurse
will take some blood.

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,619
Okay.

23
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,020
Next, please.

24
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,589
Think that was an
informed consent?

25
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,907
Close enough.

26
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:00,576
Hey, old man. Hey.

27
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,743
You again?

28
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,345
Yeah. I know you.

29
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,913
Uh... Halloween.

30
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:06,181
Uh, Charlie, right?

31
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,077
Yeah, you gave me some condoms.

32
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,535
Guess you were
a couple years late.

33
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,048
Uh-huh. You're
telling me that's yours?

34
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,037
Why not?

35
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,639
His dad's a Pakistani dude.

36
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,408
And his name is
"Lopez" because...?

37
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:19,894
Okay. His mom
Gloria's a friend of mine.

38
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,297
She's got a job today,
so I'm baby-sitting.

39
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,000
She heard they were
giving out free shots.

40
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:28,236
And Ahmed hasn't been seen
since he was four months old?

41
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,304
Yeah, I guess.

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,905
Let me see. Ahmed, come here.

43
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:33,075
What's he now...
About a year and a half?

44
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,909
All right, well, we're
going to need to have

45
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,611
his mother's address
for a follow-up.

46
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,291
They live at Sisters
over on Grand.

47
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:39,281
The shelter?

48
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,450
Dr. Ross, don't we
need parental consent?

49
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,596
That's why I told
you <i>I'm</i> the mom.

50
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,769
All right,<i> Ms.</i> Lopez

51
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,571
Why don't you sign right there?

52
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,455
I don't know about this.

53
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,923
Want me to send him home?

54
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,809
Okay, next.

55
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:51,876
Hey, Charlie.

56
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,378
Shouldn't you be in school?

57
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,462
We're off.

58
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,164
It's Career day.

59
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,586
BP's 200/140.

60
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,454
Try to relax,
Mr. Reynolds. Okay?

61
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,822
Ultrasound's ready.

62
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,674
All right, take a look,
tell me what you see.

63
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,910
You want me to get him
started on beta blockers?

64
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:10,662
You read my mind.
Osmolal, five grams in 500 mil.

65
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,964
And four of morphine.

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,134
It's a triple-A, I'd say
about four centimeters.

67
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,335
Dr. Lewis, great.

68
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,264
I was afraid I was going
to miss you. I'm on till 2:00.

69
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,049
You know it's not going to be
the same around here without you.

70
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,456
Oh, stop it. It's hard enough.

71
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,642
Okay, Dr. Doyle, give
Dr. Carter the bullet.

72
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,894
72-year-old male,
history of hypertension

73
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:28,263
and hypercholesterolemia,
one previous MI.

74
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,443
Pain began in left lower
quadrant a week ago.

75
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:31,550
The ultrasound shows

76
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,652
abdominal aneurysm...
Four centimeters.

77
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,999
Yeah, we'll take him
off your hands for you.

78
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,039
Ah, not so fast, Dr. Carter.

79
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,808
Check his femoral pulses.

80
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,721
The ultrasound
indicates surgery.

81
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,010
What do you think, Dr. Doyle?

82
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,974
I agree with Carter.
There's a chance for rupture.

83
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,031
Ten percent.

84
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,533
How are his femoral pulses?

85
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,845
Two plus, bilaterally.

86
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,696
So he has good blood
flow to his lower extremities.

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,182
But the ultrasound
indicates a risk.

88
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,505
Shows no leakage.

89
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,985
Let's get a CT to confirm it.

90
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,720
So, you want to
manage it medically?

91
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:57,809
Yes, I'd like to try.

92
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,410
The machines can
give us test results,

93
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,297
but they like to keep us around
here for diagnostic judgment.

94
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,693
You see, this is her last shift

95
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,828
maybe our last patient together.

96
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05,834
She's just trying to bust me.

97
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,503
Someone has to hold
you surgeons back.

98
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,367
Page me if you need me.

99
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,657
Okay, let's get him to CT.

100
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,371
I guess I got a lot to learn.

101
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,661
Yeah, it takes practice.

102
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,128
Don't be afraid to step up.

103
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,176
You should have
seen me my first year.

104
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,499
Don't believe her.

105
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,568
She was always this good.

106
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,325
Are you with the moving company?

107
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,949
No, I'm Mark Greene,
a friend of Susan's.

108
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,563
Then you're the one who's
interested in taking over the lease?

109
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,719
Yes.

110
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,721
Ah, Phyllis Dodds.
I'm the landlady.

111
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,473
Hi, Phyllis.

112
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:46,574
Are you okay?

113
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,909
It's just a muscle spasm.

114
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,055
Probably stress. Yeah.

115
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,662
It's a great one-bedroom.

116
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,992
Lots of closet space,
nice cross-breeze

117
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,248
on a quiet street.

118
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,083
Yeah, I've spent some time here.

119
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,402
You worked with Susan?

120
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,669
About three years.

121
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,589
Actually, more than three years.

122
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:01,651
Are you single?

123
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,042
Divorced, and I've
got my daughter

124
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,810
every other Saturday.

125
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,580
No live-ins, no
parties, no pets.

126
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,048
None of the above.

127
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,628
There it is. A landlady's dream.

128
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,619
Well, at least, it
works for someone.

129
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,019
Oh, good.

130
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,989
All the boxes go,
the luggage stays.

131
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,758
Place looks a lot bigger

132
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,771
without Susan's
stuff, doesn't it?

133
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,962
Yeah, it's a whole lot emptier.

134
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,130
Start here.

135
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,498
I got it.

136
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,009
So basically, we're screwed.

137
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,945
We can pull the
interns off their electives,

138
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,480
but unless the senior residents
lose their vacation time,

139
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,216
we won't be able to
cover the schedule.

140
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,650
Are you okay?

141
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,496
Yeah. Just didn't get
much sleep last night.

142
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,265
I'm sorry, what'd you
say after "We're screwed"?

143
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,456
It's gonna be a pain
to lose Susan Lewis.

144
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,502
A big mistake for
her... Phoenix?

145
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,560
I mean, what was David
Morgenstern thinking

146
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,761
letting her go?

147
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,231
You know, I want to be
supportive of lifestyle choices

148
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,266
but we're getting
the short end here.

149
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,267
Good morning, all.

150
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:53,601
Hang tough, coach Pino.

151
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,815
We've got a 35-year-old
roller hockey coach

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,372
got slammed into the boards.

153
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:58,806
Possible hip dislocation.

154
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:00,586
Dr. Weaver, can I take this one?

155
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,721
Be my guest.

156
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:03,111
One of you guys nail him?

157
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,623
He told us to play the body.

158
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,581
Never apologize
for a good hip check,

159
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,782
right, Coach?

160
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,918
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

161
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,030
Yes. Stiff muscles.

162
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,088
I might be coming
down with something.

163
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,423
You know, go home. This
might be your only chance.

164
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,558
Yeah, I think I'm
going to stick around.

165
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:18,604
Hey. Hey.

166
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,661
So, T-minus five
hours and counting?

167
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,575
Yeah. I'm starting
to get nervous.

168
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,232
You'll do great in Arizona.

169
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,800
The winters there
are like heaven.

170
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:28,669
I just don't want to leave
anyone in the lurch, you know?

171
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,938
We'll muddle through.

172
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,639
Oh, hey, I signed the lease.

173
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,752
Oh, great. That's great!

174
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,410
That would be a shame
to let that place go...

175
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,323
and I'll never
forget your address.

176
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,314
You want to help me
with a teaching demo?

177
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:40,365
Yeah.

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,534
Did you give him
five of morphine?

179
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,636
And Valium and 100 Methohexital.

180
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,405
First, the nurse... Or
in this case, Susan...

181
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,073
Applies counter-traction.

182
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,408
Good job, Susan.

183
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,177
Then, you grab behind the knee

184
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,013
and you lift.

185
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,026
And you lift... until...

186
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,650
you feel the...

187
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,363
hip slip back into place.

188
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,820
That's it.

189
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,154
Okay.

190
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,723
Thanks, Susan.

191
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,991
Anytime.

192
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,292
Anytime in the next four hours.

193
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,839
Dislocations aren't that tough.

194
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,863
You get the feel for it.

195
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,075
I know.

196
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,878
I've done a bunch of them.

197
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,535
Why'd you ask for help?

198
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,850
I didn't.

199
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,206
That was perfect.

200
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,841
Will you take one for me?

201
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,409
We will do anything
for you, Dr. Keaton.

202
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,445
Say "discharged."

203
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,241
Discharged. Great.

204
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:30,932
Oh, good. There's Dr. Benton.

205
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:33,418
The Herlihys are taking
Megan home today finally.

206
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,663
Oh, yeah. I heard.

207
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,698
Congratulations.

208
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,033
David, get one with
Dr. Benton in it, please.

209
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,801
Oh, yeah, please.
Oh, no, no, no, I...

210
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,693
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

211
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,008
Smile.

212
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,213
We owe both of you so much.

213
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,167
Well, we're not usually
shy about taking credit,

214
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,436
but in this case, Megan deserves

215
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,071
all the congratulations.

216
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,072
Thank you, Dr. Keaton.
We'll be in touch.

217
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,073
Bye.

218
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,074
God bless.

219
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,075
Bye!

220
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,944
Well, that was awkward.

221
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,011
Why?

222
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,991
Because I almost
killed their baby.

223
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,615
Never begrudge a good outcome.

224
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,194
Well, it's nothing
to be proud of.

225
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,096
But sometimes, the gods smile.

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,587
There you are. Hi.

227
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,138
Carter? What are you doing here?

228
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:14,976
Uh... actually, I was,
um... I was coming to...

229
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,156
Were you ready to go
over the literature review?

230
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,314
Yes, I was. I am...

231
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:20,382
if you are.

232
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,766
The literature review?

233
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,362
Um, I kidnapped your intern.

234
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,031
I hope you don't mind, but
I'm up against a deadline,

235
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,454
so I asked Dr. Carter

236
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:29,157
to contribute to an
article I'm writing.

237
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,241
Yes. She did.

238
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,987
Well, as long as
it doesn't interfere

239
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,155
with your other work.

240
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,079
No. This thing
with Dr. Keaton...

241
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,398
This article won't
get in the way at all.

242
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,195
I can go over your
first draft at 3:00.

243
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,685
Okay. Okay?

244
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,686
Yeah.

245
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,054
Okay, see you at 3:00.

246
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,653
Hey, cleaning out your locker?

247
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:48,876
Oh, this is too weird.

248
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:50,478
What time's your train?

249
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,480
4:20. I have to go by my house

250
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,048
and pick up my stuff.

251
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,417
I'm not cutting it
too close, am I?

252
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,686
You're on until 2:00?

253
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:01,789
There's not any farewell
thing going on, is there?

254
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:04,169
No, not that I've heard of.

255
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,394
Okay, good. Mark
is acting so odd.

256
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,579
Well, he's going to miss you.

257
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,732
He's the one who
thinks I should go.

258
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,618
If I hear how great
Phoenix is one more time...

259
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,087
I think he's just trying to
be a good sport, you know,

260
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,082
judging from how
miserable he looks.

261
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,859
You having second thoughts?

262
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,978
I never made a decision
that seemed so right.

263
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,733
You know, once I
made it, I just felt great.

264
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,868
Of course, I'm having
second thoughts.

265
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,831
Well, I wish you
weren't going...

266
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:33,220
but you do look happy.

267
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:34,389
Do I?

268
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,891
I'm just afraid that I'm
not really happy at all.

269
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:39,444
I'm just barging in on
Chloe and Joe's happiness.

270
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,490
Yeah, well, she owes
you a couple of barge-ins.

271
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,758
Susan.

272
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,181
There you are.

273
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:44,899
What's wrong?

274
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,267
Uh, I need a second opinion.

275
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,468
Sure.

276
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,422
See? Odd.

277
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,538
I want to get your
opinion on a patient.

278
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,294
You coming down with something?

279
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,808
I hope not. Exam Room One.

280
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,610
28-year-old smoker, on the pill

281
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,512
complains of
shortness of breath.

282
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,301
Diffuse low voltage on her EKG.

283
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,671
I'm thinking
pericarditis... Get an echo.

284
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,050
Yeah. That's what I'd do.

285
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,808
You don't think it could
be a pulmonary embolism?

286
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:14,045
She's at risk, abnormal EKG,
It could be lead placement.

287
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,424
No. I'd go with the echo.

288
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,414
You sure?

289
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,493
Yeah. It's a no-brainer.

290
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,695
You can always get a VQ scan

291
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,730
if the echo's negative.

292
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,131
You know, that's
what I was thinking,

293
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,155
so I'll order an echo.

294
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,683
There they are...

295
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,975
The Mutt and Jeff of
emergency medicine

296
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,409
pooling their expertise

297
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,227
before she leaves
us in the dust.

298
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,228
Doug, stop.

299
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,441
All right, Randi, call the lab.

300
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,598
Pick up these tests.

301
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,916
Where have you been?

302
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:36,028
The hell mobile.

303
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,219
Still no reason to
make us miserable.

304
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:39,854
Diaper rash, curtain three.

305
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,222
Saved it just for you.

306
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,402
Wait, Anspaugh made
you ride the mobile again?

307
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,687
Anspaugh didn't make us do it.

308
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,094
The immunization
program was Dr. Ross' idea.

309
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:48,096
Is this true?

310
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,264
Keeps me off the streets.

311
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,543
Check this out.

312
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,966
I got sunscreen.

313
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,012
I got a turquoise belt buckle.

314
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,898
I got a snake bite kit.

315
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,522
What for?

316
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,457
Susan's farewell.

317
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,186
Yeah, and we got a
cactus-shaped cake.

318
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,643
Oh, guys, I don't know.

319
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:03,945
I think she's gonna hate this.

320
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,257
Of course she's gonna hate it.

321
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,326
That's why we're doing it.

322
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,927
Let me know when
those labs get back.

323
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,128
You look lousy.

324
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:11,653
Oh, God. I woke up with this
neck thing, you know, fever.

325
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:12,732
Right.

326
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,756
There's a flu going
around, but I had a flu shot...

327
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,802
So you didn't do it, right?

328
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,136
You didn't tell
her how you feel?

329
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,125
She's leaving. Right.

330
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,472
She's made her decision. Mm-hmm.

331
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,963
I didn't see any point
in saying anything.

332
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:23,264
Mm-hmm.

333
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:28,603
In two hours, we'll have
a one-week-old male baby

334
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:29,771
on this table,

335
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:32,574
and what do we know
about this poor soul?

336
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,086
He has a distended abdomen

337
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,855
visible peristalsis.

338
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,680
The upper G.I.
series showed a partial

339
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:40,515
small bowel obstruction.

340
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,829
So, when we open him
up, we're expecting...

341
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:44,285
A malrotation of the gut.

342
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,620
Mm-hmm. Meaning?

343
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,756
In the tenth week
of fetal development,

344
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,991
the cephalic limb
of the intestinal loop

345
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,926
elongated and
twisted 270 degrees.

346
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,840
Okay, but begin
with the duodenum.

347
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:56,898
What would you expect to
see in a normal one-week-old?

348
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,544
What, you mean like
the duodenum leads to...

349
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,550
Mm-hmm.

350
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,586
Close your eyes.

351
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
Try to see it.

352
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,835
The, uh...

353
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,794
duodenum leads to the jejunum
which connects to the ileum.

354
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,730
Okay, but slow down,
and tell me what you<i> see.</i>

355
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,466
What do you mean?

356
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,368
Um, start with the
image of a healthy gut.

357
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,306
I'm seeing the head
of the pancreas.

358
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,859
It's like a tiny fist
holding two straws.

359
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,573
You mean the mesenteric
artery and vein?

360
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:28,262
Uh-huh.

361
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:29,747
It's nestled

362
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,666
in the open-C of the duodenum

363
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:36,187
and its surface is
like fine pebbles...

364
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,072
a beautiful shade of...

365
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:39,691
tannish yellow.

366
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,309
Go on. You try.

367
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,833
Okay, the, um...
the pancreas is...

368
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:54,606
shaped like... a
tadpole with a big head.

369
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,807
Uh-huh.

370
00:12:55,842 --> 00:13:00,378
Um... it narrows
into a tail that curls

371
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,898
into the hilum of the spleen.

372
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,366
Go on, now, see the spleen.

373
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:12,240
Susan.

374
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:13,241
Yes.

375
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:14,675
I know you and I
had a rocky start,

376
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,544
but I thought we'd
worked on our relationship

377
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,079
and developed a
professional rapport.

378
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,225
What are you talking about?

379
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:20,915
The smoker in
one... I diagnosed him

380
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,183
with a pulmonary embolism

381
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,595
and consented her for a VQ.

382
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,486
Well, I thought it
was Mark's patient.

383
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,854
He asked me for my opinion.

384
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,801
Oh, well, I guess my
beef is with him, then.

385
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:29,868
You know what, I'll talk to him.

386
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,759
I think I know
what the problem is.

387
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:32,760
Thank you. Okay.

388
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:33,839
No. Absolutely not. No way.

389
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:35,029
It just ticks me off.

390
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,764
I mean I probably
could go up there...

391
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,077
No. You can't.

392
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,579
Well, it wouldn't kill me to finish
up just one shift up in neuro.

393
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:41,702
It's the principle.

394
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,049
Last week I let
Lydia go up there,

395
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,616
and it just encouraged
them to do it more.

396
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,706
What's up?

397
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,886
I got called up to Neuro
to fill in for the day.

398
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,111
Yes, may I speak to the
nursing administrator please?

399
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,612
Carol Hathaway in the ER.

400
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,625
Hey, Haleh when do you
max out on your pension?

401
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:54,649
Two more years.

402
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:56,695
See? They<i> are</i> hassling
the senior nurses.

403
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,719
No. I'll hold.

404
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,354
Hey, what's in the box?

405
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:00,455
Bridal shoppe?

406
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,457
Did you and Al
finally set the date?

407
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:03,624
No. The opposite.

408
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:04,959
She broke off with Al.

409
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,628
I'm returning this
ridiculous fake virgin outfit

410
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,964
and they better not
offer me store credit.

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Still holding. Sorry, Lydia.

412
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,334
What did Al do?

413
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,802
Nothing. That's the problem.

414
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:17,116
He kept putting it off. He
didn't want to get married.

415
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,352
I don't know why
he ever proposed.

416
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,442
What's the matter with you guys?

417
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:22,443
They're wimps.

418
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,956
They're all petrified
to make a move.

419
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,124
It's lack of spine, isn't it?

420
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:26,725
Whatever you're talking about,

421
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:27,994
I'm sure you're right.

422
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,783
Hey, Mark, I
need to talk to you.

423
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:32,420
Ah, Mary. Yes, hello,
Carol Hathaway in the ER.

424
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,822
Well, I'm not doing
too good at the moment.

425
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:37,425
One of my nurses just
got floated up to Neuro.

426
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,693
Look, I'm trying to
run a department here,

427
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,562
and it doesn't benefit my nurses

428
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,731
to be shipped all
over the hospital.

429
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,266
No. You know what?

430
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,002
She is not going up. She
is not going up to Neuro.

431
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:50,471
Right. Right.

432
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:53,774
Hot stuff.

433
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,144
Yeah. Unfortunately,
you still have to go

434
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,611
but this is the last time.

435
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,381
I've made an appointment
with her this afternoon.

436
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,615
I'm going to stop this.

437
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,616
Uh-huh.

438
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,218
Hang in there, Lydia.

439
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:05,719
Don't worry about me.

440
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,356
But you can't put
me in the middle

441
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,924
of your conflicts
with Kerry Weaver.

442
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,225
I mean literally, you can't,

443
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,693
because I'm not
going to be here.

444
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:13,955
I just trust your judgment.

445
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,380
Look, I know what this is about,

446
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,100
and I'm having a hard time, too.

447
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,502
I think we've both been
spoiled by what we have...

448
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:22,519
The shorthand.

449
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,688
Uh-huh.

450
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,723
It just makes our
job so much easier.

451
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,835
Dr. Greene? Jobs. Right.

452
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,899
When I go to Phoenix, I'm
afraid that there won't be

453
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,562
a single person in the
ER that I can talk to.

454
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,208
They got great doctors there.

455
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,531
They have great doctors here...

456
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,801
The best I've ever worked with.

457
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,736
You can rely on them.

458
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,212
Thanks for the pep talk.

459
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:42,923
Mark.

460
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,259
Is it something else?

461
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:46,727
No. No, nothing else.

462
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:50,898
I mean, I could ask you to
consult on the hives in Four,

463
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:54,502
but you know, time for us
to stand on our own two feet.

464
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,641
Jeanie.

465
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,977
Jeanie.

466
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,212
Jeanie, I'm glad I caught you.

467
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,224
Did you get the
mortgage papers back?

468
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,115
No, actually that's
what I wanted to tell you.

469
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,116
Al, you promised.

470
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,384
I talked to this lawyer

471
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,952
we were doing a remodel for.

472
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,620
He gave me some advice, and...

473
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,055
here.

474
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,156
You were right.

475
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,392
Everything you said
about our marriage,

476
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,894
about how you
carried all the weight.

477
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,662
Well, that's going to stop.

478
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:41,927
What is this?

479
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,434
Divorce papers.

480
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,486
I'm giving you the
house, the car, everything.

481
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:47,688
And don't say no.

482
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:50,341
It's not just because
you deserve it.

483
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,193
See, this guy
helped me figure out

484
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:53,794
that if I get my assets down

485
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,129
and show that my job
doesn't have insurance

486
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:58,466
then I'll be able to
get this state program

487
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,700
for the working poor.

488
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:02,253
They offer the drugs I
need. It's a good deal.

489
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,889
But your income has to
be less than $15,000 a year.

490
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,157
You don't have to
worry about me anymore

491
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,109
Okay?

492
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:11,745
You just take care of yourself.

493
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,431
I got to go.

494
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,553
Hands off.

495
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:20,955
I don't want to be here.

496
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,734
Settle down. Hold her.

497
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,903
Thank God, she was
passed out at Cubby's.

498
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,538
The bartender started to worry

499
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,907
after she downed that
sixth double bourbon.

500
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,130
She looks full term.

501
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,010
Let go of me. I am out of here.

502
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,034
No, you're not.

503
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,501
Security! We need security!

504
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:36,670
Oh, damn!

505
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,073
Damn this damn thing!

506
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,652
Doyle, Ativan... two migs.

507
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:43,360
Ma'am, are you
having contractions?

508
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,506
I need a drink

509
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,981
and I need to
get... out of here!

510
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,215
Restraints!

511
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,096
You're not going anywhere.

512
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,436
I'll do whatever I want.

513
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,282
Hold still so we
won't hurt your baby.

514
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,540
Go ahead and kill it!

515
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,574
I never wanted
the little bastard.

516
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,338
It's a little late to
think about that now.

517
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,506
Just sedate her.

518
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,730
I'll kill myself and
I'll take it with me.

519
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,882
Damn thing. Ow! Ruined my life.

520
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,166
You're pissing me off, lady.

521
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:07,784
Hold on, Doyle.

522
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,836
I want to die.

523
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,299
Uh-oh. Look out. What happened?

524
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,935
Her water broke. We'd
better get her up to OB.

525
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,541
I'll alert Pedes.

526
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,094
Another kid with Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome on the way.

527
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,162
Need some help?

528
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,208
Yeah, we could use
some muscle here.

529
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,099
Doyle, take her up to OB.

530
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,946
She was trying to kill her baby.

531
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,147
She admitted it.

532
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,404
Yeah, she's bombed.
Alert Social Services.

533
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,717
Will they do anything?

534
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,907
They'll try.

535
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,908
Oh, man.

536
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,420
Keep your legs together, honey.

537
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,510
Yeah.

538
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,645
That was ugly.

539
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:35,824
It was criminal.

540
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,093
Excuse me, Chaplain.
Do you have a minute?

541
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,684
Did you call for last rites?

542
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,729
No. I wanted to see

543
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,597
if you were free
to see this woman.

544
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,666
She's in labor.

545
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,056
Does she want a prayer?

546
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,702
No, but I think her baby will.

547
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,937
Mark, I've got a
brittle diabetic in two.

548
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,906
Came in with a
blood glucose of 406.

549
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,607
Are you ill? You look flushed.

550
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,664
Uh, no, I'm fine.

551
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,177
Anyway, he hadn't
taken his insulin

552
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,212
and his BP was
210/115. Off his dilt.

553
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,581
I gave him both, but
he wants to see Susan.

554
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,416
He says he always
sees Dr. Lewis.

555
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,484
Yeah, well, I can take it.

556
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,473
Okay.

557
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,809
Where's Dr. Lewis?

558
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,977
Well, she's busy right
now. I'm Dr. Greene.

559
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,780
We've debrided
Mr. Ceebar's ulcerated ankle.

560
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,282
Uh-huh. Do you have
an endocrinologist?

561
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,884
Uh, sort of.

562
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,787
Well, the emergency room
is really not the best place

563
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,633
for you to manage your diabetes.

564
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,958
My ex stole 500 bucks from me.

565
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,309
Well, I'm sure

566
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:24,711
that was quite upsetting,
but that's still no reason

567
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,675
for you not to monitor
your glucose level.

568
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,750
I-I wanted to tell Dr. Lewis.

569
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,952
Well, you can't
see her right now.

570
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:33,720
Diabetes is a serious disease.

571
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,323
You can manage it if
you follow the regimen.

572
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,436
But if you neglect it

573
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,354
you're at risk
for kidney failure

574
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,262
blindness, and vascular disease.

575
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:42,430
Why?!

576
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:43,931
Why...

577
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,732
Can't I see Dr. Lewis?

578
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,084
Should I try to find her?

579
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,803
Look, Dr. Lewis is leaving
us, Mr. Ceebar, okay?

580
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,272
She's not going to work
here anymore. Malik?

581
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:54,286
I-I-I didn't tell
her about my car.

582
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,521
Someone ran into it
and didn't even stop.

583
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:58,357
Malik, will you get
psych for Mr. Ceebar?

584
00:19:58,381 --> 00:19:59,346
I can find Dr. Lewis...

585
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:00,914
Get psych.

586
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,550
Dr. Ross, labs came
back from the healthmobile.

587
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,352
Can you take a look at this CBC?

588
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:06,353
Crit's 28.

589
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:07,621
Iron deficiency anemia?

590
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,301
Nope. Normal MCV, No blasts.

591
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:10,902
We've got to get this
kid back in for follow-up.

592
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:13,760
It's Ahmed Lopez, the
baby that kid brought in.

593
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,807
Charlie? Sisters of
Mercy Shelter? Yeah.

594
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:17,225
All right, I'll get the number.

595
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,066
I need a hand here.

596
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:21,313
What's the problem?

597
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:22,436
I never felt better.

598
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,216
The guy is sick, he's
coughing his head off.

599
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,218
I thought I better
bring him in here.

600
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,619
Now it's a crime to cough.

601
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,942
Shut up and be grateful.

602
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,010
I'll get a history.

603
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,045
Lydia.

604
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,791
Cops get stranger all the time.

605
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,693
Don't worry. This
isn't about you.

606
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:35,850
Lydia...

607
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,885
Oh, she hates me, doesn't she?

608
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,631
Well, she's pretty fed up.

609
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,455
I don't know how
she got the idea

610
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,156
I didn't want to get married.

611
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:44,870
Al, you kept putting it off.

612
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,427
Yeah, but that didn't mean

613
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:47,995
I didn't want to, you know?

614
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,030
I know.

615
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:50,242
I don't.

616
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,544
If you want to be
with her, be with her.

617
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:54,201
Yeah, you're right.

618
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:56,270
I woke up this morning

619
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:58,171
and it was like I was dying.

620
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,456
I couldn't breathe.

621
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,691
You ever get that?

622
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,992
Yeah.

623
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,661
I got so crazed...

624
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,941
I tried to get the license,
I drove to the church...

625
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,509
I tried to drag the
priest over here

626
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,749
to marry us right now, today,

627
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:09,933
you know, if she'd have me.

628
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:10,918
What happened?

629
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:13,054
They were all at a CPR class.

630
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,616
Well, you know, we do have

631
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,418
a chaplain here in the hospital,

632
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,722
if you're serious.

633
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,027
Oh, yeah?

634
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,156
Mm-hmm.

635
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,797
He's in Trauma
One, giving last rites.

636
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:33,090
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy. Look at that.

637
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,158
Where's the cecum?

638
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,160
Can't see for all
the small bowel.

639
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,505
It's pretty blue in here.

640
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,762
Let's eviscerate.

641
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,398
Peter, want to take
care of that obstruction?

642
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,844
Sure. Metz. Retractor.

643
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,817
Look different

644
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,152
from a healthy gut?

645
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:46,286
I'll say.

646
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,555
Visualize the transduodenal
peritoneal bands

647
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,358
attached to the cecum
and the ascending colon.

648
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,726
I am.

649
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,395
I'm putting some
traction on this mass,

650
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,662
twisting it counterclockwise.

651
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:56,763
It's pretty tangled.

652
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,343
Like a drawer full of socks.

653
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:01,618
I'll have to remember that one.

654
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,003
Okay, it's pinking up.

655
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,739
I don't think we
have dead bowel.

656
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:06,740
Do you have it?

657
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:07,803
Uh, yeah, it's...

658
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,072
everything's turned
around in here.

659
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,879
Tell me if you need me.

660
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,563
I...

661
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:16,484
uh...

662
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,068
You better take it.

663
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,704
Okay, retract the intestine.

664
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,539
Metz.

665
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,725
Pick up.

666
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,076
The baby's name is Ahmed

667
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,577
the mother's name is Gloria

668
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,557
and I don't know
what she looks like.

669
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,293
He doesn't remember the mother.

670
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,128
He took the blood
without consent.

671
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,296
I didn't hear that.

672
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,552
That's great, Doug.

673
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,188
I know that all
of your residents

674
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,990
are single moms. If...

675
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,192
Okay, sister, maybe I will.

676
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,961
Thank you. Thank you.

677
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,162
Don't ask.

678
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,264
Don't worry, I won't.

679
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,843
Has anybody seen Mr. Ceebar?

680
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,835
Mr. Ceebar, uh...
a brittle diabetic?

681
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,981
Yeah, psych is here

682
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,416
but he's flown the coop.

683
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,309
All he just needs is five minutes
of TLC and a cup of hot tea.

684
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,743
Well, he's gone now.

685
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,011
Hey.

686
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,146
Look at that.

687
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,815
Think he'll talk her into it?

688
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,083
Shouldn't be too hard.

689
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,217
It's what she wants.

690
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,496
Talk her into what?

691
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,071
Living happily ever after.

692
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:12,934
Sorry I couldn't
step up in there.

693
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,925
Well, at least you
knew you weren't ready.

694
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,939
The malrotation was more
disorienting than I expected.

695
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,430
90% of correcting a
congenital anomaly

696
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,932
is knowing your embryology.

697
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,411
Yeah, and I reviewed that.

698
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,402
Well, then you had
90% of the job aced.

699
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,315
What was the other ten percent?

700
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,705
Being able to stand there

701
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,208
and let the confused anatomy
start to make its own sense.

702
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,209
How?

703
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,977
By letting it happen.

704
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,879
Abnormalities in neonates

705
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,997
can be overwhelming

706
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,133
if you try to break
it down into parts.

707
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,069
Aristotle would have made
a lousy pediatric surgeon.

708
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,149
Sorry to interupt. Dr. Benton,
they're calling for us from the ER.

709
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,000
They need us. What is it?

710
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,124
A wedding.

711
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,444
Oh, my God, it wasn't a joke.

712
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,434
Is this crazy?

713
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,714
Yeah, this is crazy.

714
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,138
Good thing you had
this old rag lying around.

715
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,317
Well, make it snappy, girl.

716
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,285
They only gave me a
20-minute break in Neuro.

717
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,921
Oh, this veil's
a little crushed.

718
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,689
Let me see if
the coast is clear.

719
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,791
Wait, hold still. I don't
want to stick you. Hold still.

720
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:10,881
How do we look?

721
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,260
No traumas coming in.

722
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,129
Let's go while
the radio's quiet.

723
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,352
Am I too late?

724
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,431
No, right this way.

725
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,975
Bride's side or groom's?

726
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,871
Okay, they're a little drippy.

727
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:23,994
Yeah?

728
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,196
All right, everybody.
They're ready, okay?

729
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,110
Right over there...
That'd be good.

730
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,700
Okay, ready?

731
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,830
Well, uh, dearly beloved,

732
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,971
friends and colleagues,

733
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:52,617
we have come here today

734
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,786
as part of God's eternal plan

735
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,777
and on the spur of the moment

736
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,462
to this holy place

737
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,147
of life and death and healing

738
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,334
to join Lydia Wright

739
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,769
and Alfred...

740
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,337
Grabarsky.

741
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,505
Grabarsky.

742
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,041
Anybody get a stool
culture on curtain...

743
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:11,975
Oh, my God.

744
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,777
I'm sorry.

745
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,745
It's okay. I'll go.

746
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,526
I did the rectal swab.

747
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,065
His chart's in exam one.

748
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,200
Best wishes, man.

749
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,064
Like all of us here, they have

750
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,515
chosen as their life's work

751
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,839
to care for and protect
their community.

752
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:29,843
It's taxing and draining

753
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:31,689
and at times, it's
dangerous work.

754
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,691
And now, Lydia and Alfred
are choosing to take on

755
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:35,849
the care and
protection for each other

756
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:37,250
and the love they share.

757
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,964
Dr. Benton sends his apologies.

758
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,698
He was called into an emergency.

759
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:42,021
Oh. We join them today

760
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:44,603
to witness and declare this
sacred union between two people...

761
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,593
Testicular torsion.

762
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,107
Whose souls feed
each other with that love.

763
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,915
It's a love that sustains
all their outer efforts.

764
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,051
A love that is rare, and
that should be treasured.

765
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,269
Code Six.

766
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,754
A... a love

767
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,689
that, at times,
will burn brightly...

768
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,142
I need a hand.

769
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,544
And yet, at other times

770
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:04,672
it will flicker.

771
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,874
And now the vows.

772
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,042
Do you, Lydia,

773
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,782
take Alfred to love and cherish

774
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,067
from this day forward

775
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,969
till death do you part?

776
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,415
I do.

777
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,105
And do you, Alfred, take Lydia

778
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,407
to love and cherish
from this day forward

779
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,126
till death do you part?

780
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,338
I do.

781
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:23,981
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

782
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,665
You may kiss your bride.

783
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,756
So then he just handed
you the divorce papers?

784
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,090
Yep. It wasn't like him.

785
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,370
What do you mean?

786
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,528
It was the most unselfish
thing he's ever done.

787
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,774
She's throwing the bouquet.

788
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,074
Come on, come on.

789
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,443
Come on. No pushing.

790
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,611
Come on. Hey, Carol.

791
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:43,900
Yeah?

792
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,213
It's bouquet time.
No. Thank you.

793
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,337
Come on! No, no.

794
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,650
Hey, you think we should do
the good-bye for Susan now

795
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,018
while we've got everyone here?

796
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,508
No. We'll do it
in an hour or so.

797
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:53,076
Hey, did you see those two?

798
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,690
Yeah. Did you see them
during the ceremony?

799
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,679
Yeah, it was pathetic.

800
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,258
I always felt those two
would make a go of it.

801
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,394
Hey, they're best friends.
What more do you want?

802
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,451
No, it's not what I want.
It's what Mark wants.

803
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,198
I don't know. Things
happen for a reason,

804
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,632
things don't
happen for a reason.

805
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,701
Then why is she leaving?

806
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:06,968
She doesn't have a life here.

807
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,058
And one

808
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,910
two, three!

809
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,261
Oh, my God!

810
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,631
You're next!

811
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,266
Oh, yeah, Susan!

812
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,787
Congratulations.

813
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,688
You're next.

814
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,756
Yeah, right.

815
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,936
That was kind of great, huh?

816
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,927
Yeah. They seem happy.

817
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,596
Hey, Mark?

818
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:32,099
I guess I proved I'm
no good at good-byes.

819
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:33,411
Me, neither.

820
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,903
I-I'm sorry that I
snapped at you earlier.

821
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:37,570
I just don't want to go...

822
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:40,073
unless I know we'll
always be friends.

823
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:41,389
We will.

824
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,431
You ready for me?

825
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,061
Come on in. Almost there.

826
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,968
Why don't you shut the door?

827
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,770
So, um, about your
literature review...

828
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:02,112
It's very complete.

829
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,515
I have a few quibbles
about emphasis.

830
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,050
I mean, I'm not sure
that Ladd warrants

831
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,419
an entire paragraph.

832
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:09,787
Probably not.

833
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:12,238
But you have a very nice style.

834
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,674
Easy to read,
not a lot of jargon.

835
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,409
Thank you.

836
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,612
Um, I would ask you to co-author

837
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:21,248
if you weren't first
year, but I think

838
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,861
that we need to be careful

839
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:25,197
and not draw a lot of
attention considering...

840
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:27,420
considering us? Yes.

841
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,000
What happened last
Thursday? Mm-hmm.

842
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:30,924
And Saturday
afternoon and evening?

843
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,670
Yes. And Tuesday before rounds.

844
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:34,228
Yeah, we could talk about that.

845
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:36,263
I mean, the only thing
we need to keep straight

846
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,597
is that this is separate.

847
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,815
Completely separate.

848
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,133
Yes, from our work.

849
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,068
I mean it shouldn't
matter. I am not your boss.

850
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:43,815
No. You're my boss' boss.

851
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,238
Did you lock the door?

852
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:46,317
Mm-hmm.

853
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:48,174
Okay, so that we both understand

854
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,743
this is strictly personal.

855
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:51,578
It has nothing to do with work.

856
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:52,863
Oh, I love that.

857
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,531
There are so many things

858
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,444
I'm not going to
miss about this place.

859
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,602
Aftercare documentation
is one of them.

860
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,570
I can't tell you how many hours

861
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,038
I've spent doing this.

862
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,051
You're the only one
who ever bothers.

863
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,252
You kidding me?

864
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,610
No.

865
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,623
She said she's going
to leave at 2:00 sharp.

866
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,113
Are they setting up?

867
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,447
In the lounge.

868
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,616
Hey, Mark.

869
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,584
I got a call from the DA today

870
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,798
about a drunk woman
who came in in labor.

871
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,254
Uh-huh.

872
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,757
They're bringing charges
against her... attempted murder.

873
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,092
Social Services really
jumped on that one.

874
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,272
No, actually, they're
acting on a call from us.

875
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,597
So you've seen that
crayon-in-the-nose trick before?

876
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,999
Millions of times.

877
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,668
Doctor, I got that address
for you... Sisters of Mercy.

878
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,870
Yeah, we can handle it together.

879
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:36,150
Doctor Doyle, did you make the
call to the 32nd precinct today?

880
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,924
Yeah, I got a cousin there.

881
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,626
She said she wanted

882
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:41,595
to kill her baby.
I was a witness.

883
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,096
We get a lot of women

884
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,842
with alcohol and drug problems.

885
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,628
If we let Social
Services handle it.

886
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,252
It can fall through the cracks.

887
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,764
That's not what happens.

888
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,434
More to the point, initiating a
criminal investigation wasn't your job.

889
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,075
What about protecting the
health of the baby... is that my job?

890
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,777
We not going to improve
prenatal care for high-risk infants

891
00:29:57,812 --> 00:30:00,252
if we scare off the mothers.

892
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:02,794
How about this? If I get
to testify against the bitch

893
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,595
I'll do it on my own time.

894
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,932
I think we're going to like her.

895
00:30:06,956 --> 00:30:09,323
Randi, could you try
and find me some aspirin?

896
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,109
It doesn't work for us.

897
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,695
We never had floats in
and out of the department.

898
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,363
Budgets are tight, Carol.

899
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,109
Yeah, well, we're
all aware of that.

900
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,717
Look, the hospital
values its RNs.

901
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,652
Registered nurses
are the best trained

902
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,371
and most versatile part
of the entire nursing staff.

903
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,740
Thank you.

904
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:29,626
We are also the most
expensive part of that staff.

905
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,444
County has got
to figure out ways

906
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,513
to utilize RNs more effectively.

907
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:37,133
Well, at least, have
the floats make sense.

908
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,735
Go on.

909
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,922
ER and ICU have
more skills in common

910
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,708
than ward nurses,
Recovery or Neuro.

911
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,710
That's a very good point, Carol.

912
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,445
That is precisely why

913
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,747
I keep trying to
get you managers

914
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,917
who are in the trenches
more active on the committees.

915
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,852
We need your perspective.

916
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,787
Oh, Mary. I'm swamped.

917
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,856
Okay. How about a deal?

918
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:03,126
I confine ER floats to
ICU per your suggestion.

919
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:04,811
In exchange, you come sit

920
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:07,747
on the hospital-wide
re-engineering committee...

921
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,699
We only meet once a month.

922
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,611
Okay. I stalled her
with one last patient.

923
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,107
Better be a good one.
She was out the door.

924
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,287
I think Mr. Frick

925
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,289
will keep her busy for a while.

926
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,779
Hey, you got any tape?

927
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,314
Yeah, yeah. Is Mark coming?

928
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,782
I beeped him twice.

929
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,017
Sorry, folks. We've
got an MVA coming in.

930
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,587
Kindergarten car pool
versus joyriding teens.

931
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,921
All right, let's go.

932
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,757
Could be as many
as eight victims.

933
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,325
I'll clear the trauma rooms.

934
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,593
There goes the party.

935
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,838
What's the ETA?

936
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,429
Oh, they are pulling up now.

937
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,797
Let's go. Come on.

938
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:45,067
That's me. Runner-up
for Mr. Universe.

939
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,770
Call me a fool, Doc

940
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,772
but I'm betting on a comeback.

941
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,441
I haven't changed
a lick since 1947.

942
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,521
Well, I'm afraid
you may have lost

943
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,657
a little too much
weight recently.

944
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,414
Hey! I'm in training.

945
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,148
Midwestern finals.

946
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,083
American bodybuilders.

947
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,752
70 and older.

948
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:06,088
Ah! I got to take care
of this damn sciatica.

949
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,924
Oh, man, that smarts.

950
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,004
Yeah. Why don't
you take a seat again.

951
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,579
Do you know how
this injury happened?

952
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:15,181
My B-12 shot. Must
have hit a nerve.

953
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:16,800
You're injecting vitamins?

954
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,368
Hey, don't worry. I steer
clear of the steroids.

955
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,548
Oh, that's good.

956
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,749
Scoot back.

957
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,439
Press against my hands.

958
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:24,774
Yeah. Good.

959
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,109
Any other complaints?

960
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,360
Nope.

961
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,245
Best I've looked in ten years.

962
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,780
When's the competition?

963
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,082
Mid-March.

964
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,366
I'll be 74 by then.

965
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:35,502
And ready for a comeback.

966
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,402
You think?

967
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:37,737
Yep.

968
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:39,951
Plenty of bed rest,
anti-inflammatories

969
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,575
and start back slowly.

970
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,526
Thanks, Doc.

971
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,328
Okay.

972
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:46,858
This one had a seat belt on

973
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,560
but there was passenger
space intrusion.

974
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:49,349
Fractured tib-fib.

975
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,929
Hey, honey. You're
going to be fine.

976
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:53,553
Order a portable
c-spine and left tib-fib.

977
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:54,966
All right, come
with me this way.

978
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,768
I'll find you a place to sit.

979
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,837
My mom and dad
are going to kill me.

980
00:32:58,861 --> 00:33:00,927
I'll tell them it was my fault.

981
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,106
Ah...

982
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:32,091
Signing out, Randi.

983
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:33,170
Thanks, Dr. Lewis.

984
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,772
Good luck in Phoenix. Thanks.

985
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:36,508
No, this is the ER again.

986
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,275
We need a neurosurgeon<i> now.</i>

987
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,766
I need Dr. Benton's x rays.

988
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,379
Get him to the suture room.

989
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:43,247
Set me up with some 4-0 nylon.

990
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,082
Wait! Wait! Wait!

991
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,718
Ma'am, you have
a ruptured spleen.

992
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:48,486
You're going to need
immediate surgery.

993
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,809
But it's my car pool.

994
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:51,422
All the parents
need to be called!

995
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,212
Randi, come take
these numbers down.

996
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,748
I'm coming. I'm coming.

997
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,494
I told you not to let him drive.

998
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,795
He told me he knew how.

999
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,419
We were just goofing around.

1000
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,921
Hush! Hold still.

1001
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,134
Complains of chest
pains, shortness of breath.

1002
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:04,702
Diminished breath
sounds on the left.

1003
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:05,937
Let's get a chest tube tray.

1004
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,105
We need an abdominal CT
for the kid in Trauma One.

1005
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,274
BP's coming down. 190/130.

1006
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,276
Poor cap refill. Pulse ox 90.

1007
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,000
Type and cross two units.

1008
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:16,069
X ray's coming for the c-spine.

1009
00:34:16,104 --> 00:34:17,403
Lower that IV bag.

1010
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,738
Anybody need any help?

1011
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:20,351
Susan, what are
you still doing here?

1012
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,808
You're going to miss your train.

1013
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,276
Lavage is negative.
Get an x-ray.

1014
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,510
Call us.

1015
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:25,946
Get some O-negative, too.

1016
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,213
I'm calling CT.

1017
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:28,426
Left pupil's sluggish.

1018
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,916
Dusky. You want to intubate?

1019
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:31,084
Yes.

1020
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,418
All right. You do it.

1021
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:34,754
7.0 ET tube.

1022
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,256
Possible subdural hematoma.

1023
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,524
Mannitol.

1024
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,859
90 grams IV

1025
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:41,995
Let's, uh, hyperventilate him.

1026
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,129
All right?

1027
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:45,599
Here you go.

1028
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:46,600
Okay.

1029
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,301
Use suction if you need it.

1030
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,922
Visualize the cords.

1031
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,156
Good, good.

1032
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,158
All right, take your time.

1033
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,294
He's breathing on his own.

1034
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,726
She didn't even leave a note.

1035
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,518
Well, you know, she was saying
good-bye to everyone all day.

1036
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:07,320
Dr. Greene, one of those car
pool kids crashed in Radiology.

1037
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,321
Which one?

1038
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,900
The fractured tib-fib.
How'd it happen?

1039
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:12,003
So, if it's okay with you, I'd
love to get out of here by 7:00.

1040
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,971
What, are you working on
that literature review for Keaton?

1041
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:15,072
No, actually, I've got a date.

1042
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:16,441
Yeah? Well, just
don't procrastinate

1043
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,409
and keep Keaton waiting...
It reflects poorly on me.

1044
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:20,411
You know something? She's
a hard one to get, isn't she?

1045
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:21,401
How do you figure?

1046
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:22,913
Well, obviously,
she's a great surgeon

1047
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:24,516
but she's not much of a teacher.

1048
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,572
You don't think so?

1049
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,385
Oh, come on... all
that psychobabble?

1050
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:30,043
Her explanations can
be a little bit eccentric.

1051
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:31,623
She doesn't say what she wants.

1052
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:32,812
Sometimes, she does.

1053
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,947
Then again, you know, I
haven't been working with her

1054
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:36,316
the same way that you have.

1055
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:37,462
Carter, she's soft.

1056
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:38,618
She can be.

1057
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:41,032
She doesn't act like a surgeon.

1058
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,390
Well, you know, it is difficult
to learn from somebody

1059
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:44,757
who teaches by intuition,

1060
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:46,787
which is one of the things I've always
appreciated about your teaching.

1061
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,794
Excuse me, Carter.

1062
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,878
Carla?

1063
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,046
There you are. You know,

1064
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:52,348
I've been sitting in
that lot for half an hour.

1065
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,583
Why?

1066
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,618
Kingston Mines.

1067
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,918
Dinner before the early set.

1068
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,031
That's tomorrow night.

1069
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,004
No, that is tonight.

1070
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,216
Anything you need?

1071
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,306
No, Carter.

1072
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:01,374
Oh, I'm sorry.

1073
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,675
Carla, this is Dr. Carter.

1074
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,377
Carter, this is Carla Reece.

1075
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,656
Pleased to meet you. Same here.

1076
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,658
I'm sorry. I'm on
till midnight tonight.

1077
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,782
So this is where you
work until midnight?

1078
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:12,185
Yeah. Why don't I
walk you to your car?

1079
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:13,932
Oh, you haven't
been here before?

1080
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:15,621
No, no, I haven't,
knock on wood.

1081
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:16,968
We should give you a tour.

1082
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,436
No, no, no, she's got plans.

1083
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,426
Not anymore. I've been stood up.

1084
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:21,873
Well, if Trauma One is open,

1085
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:23,196
we could start there.

1086
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:25,698
Mmm. Really. Just don't
show me anything bloody.

1087
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:26,811
No, no, no, no.

1088
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:28,079
What do you do, Carla?

1089
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,270
I have this Caribbean
restaurant on Western.

1090
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:32,483
No kidding? My
family used to sail

1091
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:34,607
to the islands every spring.

1092
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:35,675
Half day, Dr. Ross?

1093
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,809
I was immunizing

1094
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,823
when you were hitting
the snooze button.

1095
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,624
I'm upset because
I don't understand

1096
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:42,626
how you could send
a surgical abdomen...

1097
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,584
I asked if I should
send him for a CT.

1098
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,619
You said go ahead.

1099
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:47,065
Yeah, I assumed he was stable.

1100
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:48,688
No, Mark, I asked for your call.

1101
00:36:48,723 --> 00:36:49,789
You weren't listening.

1102
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:51,102
Well, you didn't ask me...

1103
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,092
you were distracted.

1104
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,626
You were looking for Susan Lewis

1105
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,628
worried that she
had left, which is fine.

1106
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:57,808
I understand that, but
don't yell at me now.

1107
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,099
Hey, Mark, grab your coat.

1108
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,367
Let's go talk.

1109
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:02,218
Hmm, Admin actually listened?

1110
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,931
So, no more floating?

1111
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,354
You laid down the law?

1112
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,757
Well, they won't be
sending any of you to Neuro

1113
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:08,925
or the wards anymore.

1114
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,144
They're going to
limit our floats to ICU.

1115
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:12,345
How is that any better?

1116
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:13,991
Well, at least the
nursing skills are similar.

1117
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:16,232
We're going to have
to get it in our contract.

1118
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,567
Only way they'll respect us.

1119
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,112
Honey, they'll never respect us.

1120
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,471
Dr. Weaver is wondering
where all the nurses are.

1121
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,034
Look, I don't think it's so bad

1122
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:24,940
floating to ICU.

1123
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,025
I'm not going.

1124
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,171
They won't send you.

1125
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:29,228
You're not close
enough to your 20 years.

1126
00:37:29,264 --> 00:37:30,808
Look, I know it's a compromise

1127
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,899
but it's better than
what was happening.

1128
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:34,067
Careful, Carol.

1129
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:36,080
You're sounding an
awful lot like management.

1130
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,737
Wow.

1131
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:39,039
I didn't even say good-bye.

1132
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:40,851
Good-bye is not what
you need to tell her.

1133
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:41,875
Well, it's too late now.

1134
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,254
What time's her train leave?

1135
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:44,344
4:20.

1136
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,523
It's less than an hour.

1137
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:47,558
They're usually
running a little bit late.

1138
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:50,250
She probably had to go
home to get her luggage.

1139
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:51,818
Yeah, well, I'm on till 11:00.

1140
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:52,853
I should just go?

1141
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:53,932
You could.

1142
00:37:53,956 --> 00:37:54,966
No, no, no. It's impossible.

1143
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,289
She's getting on a train.

1144
00:37:56,325 --> 00:37:57,523
She's made up her mind.

1145
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,437
It may be, but
that's not the point.

1146
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:00,726
So, what would I say now?

1147
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:01,989
You would say to her

1148
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,447
what you've been
wanting to say for years.

1149
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,949
You tell her how you feel

1150
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,551
or you can let her go
without saying a word

1151
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:11,387
and you'll regret it
for the rest of your life

1152
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,483
and make yourself

1153
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:14,602
and everybody else
around you miserable

1154
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,325
like you have today.

1155
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:19,112
You're right.

1156
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:20,291
Mm-hmm.

1157
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:22,482
W-w-wait. C-can
you tell Kerry...?

1158
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,066
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go.

1159
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:27,703
This is great!

1160
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:28,805
Oh, my goodness.

1161
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,785
Is this where you
operate on them?

1162
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,875
No, no, no, no.

1163
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,743
We just stabilize
them down here.

1164
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,979
Then we send them
upstairs to the OR. Oh.

1165
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,346
Speaking of upstairs...

1166
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,026
Yep. Nice meeting you, Carla.

1167
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,785
Yes. Thank you, thank
you for showing me around.

1168
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,864
What's in here?

1169
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,520
Uh, it's just a suture room.

1170
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,800
Oh, really?

1171
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,268
What goes on in here?

1172
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,893
Uh, we just take
patients down here...

1173
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,734
Mmm.

1174
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,172
Oh.

1175
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:05,008
You're going to mess up
my reputation around here.

1176
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:08,278
I've been wanting to do that
since I came into this place.

1177
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,456
Oh, yeah?

1178
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,780
Yeah.

1179
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:14,117
Um... I'm sorry I
got to work late.

1180
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:18,688
Well, there's late,
and... there's later.

1181
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,391
Taxi?

1182
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,428
Whoa, whoa.

1183
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,762
Hold on.

1184
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,357
Susan?

1185
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:30,726
Susan, are you here?

1186
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,762
Oh, Dr. Greene,
you just missed her.

1187
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:33,930
She left you a note.

1188
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,097
W-where?

1189
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,465
On the mantel.

1190
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,106
Thank you.

1191
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,175
Uh... i-is the
clock right, Sister?

1192
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,276
Oh, yes.

1193
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,377
It must be slow.

1194
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,180
I got a friend trying
to catch a train.

1195
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,883
Sister Ann, try to
get them to share.

1196
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,763
Sorry. We haven't had

1197
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,219
a Lopez all month.

1198
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,788
It's a mother and an infant.

1199
00:40:58,823 --> 00:40:59,967
Yes, I know, doctor.

1200
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,268
I'm sorry.

1201
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,960
You could leave a
note on the board.

1202
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,777
Southwest gate.

1203
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,745
Track ten.

1204
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,113
Track ten.

1205
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,528
Looking for the Chief, sir?

1206
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,862
She got moved.

1207
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,297
Track six.

1208
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:52,718
Susan!

1209
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:56,188
Susan!

1210
00:42:58,226 --> 00:43:00,126
Susan!

1211
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:03,095
Susan, Susan!

1212
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,081
All aboard!

1213
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:05,848
Susan!

1214
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,800
Mark?!

1215
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,468
Are you okay?

1216
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,671
You came to say good-bye?

1217
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:13,956
No. Stay.

1218
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:16,159
I want you to stay.

1219
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,576
But, Mark...

1220
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:18,705
I love you

1221
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,415
And I'm stupid for
not saying it before.

1222
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,967
No, it's okay. I knew.

1223
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,902
In a way, I knew.

1224
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,788
Stay.

1225
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:32,091
We belong together.

1226
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:35,844
Tell me you don't feel the same.

1227
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,017
I'm sorry.

1228
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,304
Train's leaving, ma'am.

1229
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:47,273
We're right together.

1230
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,358
Mark... you are my best friend.

1231
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:52,762
I don't know how I'm
going to make it without you.

1232
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,863
Don't go.

1233
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,080
I have to.

1234
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:56,816
I don't belong here anymore.

1235
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:57,950
I have a new life.

1236
00:43:57,986 --> 00:44:00,168
It's going in a
different direction.

1237
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,905
Susan, I don't want to lose you.

1238
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,274
Oh...

1239
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,255
Ma'am... ma'am,
we're leaving. Come on.

1240
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,090
I'll never forget you.

1241
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,911
I do love you.

1242
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:27,062
What?

1243
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,781
I love you!

1244
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,752
Bye.
