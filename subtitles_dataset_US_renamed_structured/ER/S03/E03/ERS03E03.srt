1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,847
Susan.

2
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,349
Susan.

3
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,350
Hey.

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,851
Good morning.

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,621
Yes, it is. I'd even go as far
to say it's a glorious morning.

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,901
Didn't your mother
teach you not to gloat?

7
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,158
What good's a vacation
if you can't gloat?

8
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,661
Just think. In eight
days, you'll be back here

9
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,374
slogging miserably through life

10
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,698
like the rest of us.

11
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,633
Yeah, but tomorrow,
I will be in Maui

12
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,168
with the sun on my face,
drinking a sea breeze.

13
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,348
I hope you burn.

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,705
Thanks for house-sitting.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,273
My cat owes you big time.

16
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,186
I'll try to remember
to feed her.

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,810
Hope you recognize the
hospital when you get back.

18
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,990
I hear Anspaugh's got
a lot of changes in store.

19
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,147
Like what?

20
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,482
I don't know.

21
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,028
I'm philosophically opposed.

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,063
That's my new motto.
Change is not good.

23
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,787
Well, we're getting
more residents.

24
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,723
Maybe we won't
have to work as hard.

25
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,236
We'll work twice as hard.

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,392
What?

27
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,860
They're from Southside.

28
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,473
Their program is, shall we say

29
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,841
less than discriminating.

30
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,676
We're going to
spend half our time

31
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,150
trying to keep them
from killing the patients.

32
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:10,519
Okay, I'm coming!

33
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,440
Good morning, Dr. Carter.

34
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,342
I saw your car in the garage.

35
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,410
I didn't want you
to oversleep again.

36
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,657
Well, I'm not on for
another two hours

37
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,981
but thanks.

38
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,367
I brought you some Borscht.

39
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:26,968
Here, here.

40
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,737
They eat this for
breakfast in Russia.

41
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,089
Hmm.

42
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,824
Thank you for helping me

43
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,826
fix my tank the other day.

44
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,461
I hate this damn thing!

45
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,497
It's like dragging an anchor.

46
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,111
Just don't light that
cigarette around it, okay?

47
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,434
Oh. By the way

48
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,836
I've been feeling this
waxy buildup in my ear.

49
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,738
Would you mind
taking a look at it?

50
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,085
You know, ears really
aren't my specialty

51
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,321
<i>but</i> there's a
family practitioner

52
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,022
who lives on the second floor.

53
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,329
Really?

54
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,849
And he is so much
more qualified than I am.

55
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,450
Oh! Thank you, Dr. Carter.

56
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,151
I'll be back for that bowl.

57
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,521
Okay.

58
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:06,824
Isn't this exciting?

59
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,326
Yeah, like a junior
high assembly.

60
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,140
Here comes the
assistant principal.

61
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,375
Susan, I want you to
meet Margaret Doyle

62
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,909
one of our new interns

63
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,533
from Southside. Maggie.

64
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,485
Pleasure. Hi.

65
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,468
Wonder what med
school she went to.

66
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:25,059
Guys, come on. Saved you a seat.

67
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:27,207
You look like hell. Did
you pull an all-nighter?

68
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,564
Yeah, Price is sick so they
called me in at midnight...

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,199
Interrupted a very
promising date.

70
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,546
Morning, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

71
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,681
I'm due on

72
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:36,565
the surgical floor
in ten minutes

73
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,268
so I'm going to
make this snappy.

74
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,424
We're in trouble.

75
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,909
With the closing

76
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,260
of Southside hospital

77
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,879
we can expect an
increase of at least 30%

78
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,026
in our normal patient
load here at county.

79
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,668
To meet these demands,
we're going to be instituting

80
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,604
the efficiency standards
that made the Southside E.R...

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,307
No offense... The
best one in the city.

82
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,258
All residents

83
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,171
and attendings
will see an average

84
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,062
of 2.5 patients per hour.

85
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,110
Your patient quotient will
be checked on a daily basis.

86
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:06,434
The highest PQ wins a gumdrop.

87
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,570
The lowest has to wax my car.

88
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,771
What about the dead?

89
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:10,606
I'm sorry?

90
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:11,885
DOA's? Train wrecks

91
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,319
who croak on the way in?

92
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:14,904
Do we get points for them?

93
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,205
Yes, you do

94
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,846
but, uh, try not to kill

95
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,709
all your patients at
once, Dr. Greene.

96
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,400
We wouldn't want
to draw suspicion.

97
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,630
Now, who handles the scheduling?

98
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:24,654
I do.

99
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:26,499
Will you make
sure that I'm CC'd?

100
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:27,667
Chart review?

101
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:28,940
That's, uh, me too.

102
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,276
I want a daily
summary, and budget?

103
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,544
It's me.

104
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,312
Greene

105
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,474
aren't you

106
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,642
an attending here?

107
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,966
I'm patient ombudsman

108
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,312
I run the mentoring program

109
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,047
and I'm in charge
of staff morale.

110
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:43,188
Well, let's even
out the duties a bit.

111
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,874
Greene, you take chart
review. Get me a report by noon.

112
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:46,891
Can I suggest...?

113
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,571
People, change is
like a freight train.

114
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,495
You're either on board

115
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,825
or you're grit in the gears.

116
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:52,993
Same time Tuesday.

117
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,983
Oh. I think he likes you.

118
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,773
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

119
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:52,757
It was ugly, the
ugliest thing I ever saw.

120
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,759
It was big like a
bear and fearsome.

121
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,494
Well, look what he done to me.

122
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,662
What's this?

123
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,775
Dante says a
kangaroo attacked him

124
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,810
in Humbolt Park.

125
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,100
That's a nasty cut.

126
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,735
Had a claw like a razor.

127
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,848
Smelled like an elephant's ass.

128
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,422
Exam six.

129
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,058
Jerry, who was
attending last night?

130
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:11,059
Um, Mishkin.

131
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,527
Well, get him on the phone

132
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,529
'cause I can't read
his handwriting.

133
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,630
It's like Sanskrit.

134
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,065
Stuck in chart-review hell?

135
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,244
I've been here an hour

136
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,013
and I haven't seen any patients.

137
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,086
Well, pick it up

138
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,321
or you'll be waxing
Anspaugh's car.

139
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,724
One down. Anyone got
the broken tib-fib in Two?

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,727
Actually, I'd rather
you stayed supervised.

141
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,562
Doug, did you meet, uh...?

142
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,608
Maggie Doyle.

143
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,298
Maggie, hey, I'm
Doug. How are you?

144
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,344
I was handling my
own cases at Southside.

145
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,451
It's your first day.

146
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,130
I'd like you to stick with Doug.

147
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:39,337
Jerry, get on the PA

148
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,217
and tell the idiot
with the red BMW

149
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,540
to get out of my parking spot.

150
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,576
Space 37?

151
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,576
Yeah.

152
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,804
Security told me
I could park there.

153
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,045
Space 37 is my space.

154
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,063
It's been my space
for the past three years.

155
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,793
Maggie, I'd like you to
meet Carol Hathaway.

156
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,083
She's our head nurse.

157
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,518
She also heads the
welcoming committee.

158
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,503
I'll move.

159
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,305
Good.

160
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,392
Who's that?

161
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,260
Intern from the Southside.

162
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,661
Intern? With a BMW?

163
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,564
I thought your car
was repossessed.

164
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,398
It's still my spot.

165
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,004
Before I do the stitches

166
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,073
I'm going to give
you some medicine

167
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,374
so they won't hurt, okay?

168
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,586
You know what?

169
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,011
I'll even let you choose
the color of thread.

170
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,791
I've got blue, purple, black.

171
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,081
Jeanie.

172
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,017
Uh, can I talk to you
for a minute outside?

173
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,385
Yeah.

174
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,700
I'll be right back.

175
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,171
You should call a surgical
intern to do the sutures.

176
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,629
I'm sure the interns have
more important things to do.

177
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,998
Have you told the
mother and the patient

178
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,532
that you're HIV positive?

179
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,685
None of your damn business.

180
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,324
All right.

181
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,538
This is just going
to hurt for a second.

182
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,690
Jerry, get these
charts out of my face

183
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,447
and get me a sick person to fix.

184
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,317
Actually, the board
is covered right now.

185
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,319
Kleinman's been turfed to neuro

186
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,121
Figueroa... has been discharged

187
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,391
and Nguyen signed out AMA.

188
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,160
Your labs on Otis
and Fenning came up.

189
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,028
Okay. Thank you.

190
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,197
You're cooking.

191
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,009
I heal 'em and deal 'em.

192
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,144
Besides, in...

193
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,837
46 hours and 18
minutes I will be in...

194
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,272
Don't say it.

195
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,174
Maui, Maui, Maui.

196
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,275
You're cruel.

197
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,444
I haven't had a day off

198
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,845
since Christmas.

199
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,859
Why don't you come with me?

200
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,483
Yeah, right.

201
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,854
You're kidding, right?

202
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:38,984
Uh, I-I don't know.

203
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,920
I mean, you have the time coming

204
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,588
and there's plenty of people

205
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,011
to cover for you.

206
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,379
What about your cat?

207
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:46,876
I can ask a neighbor.

208
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,577
Mark! This guy's crashing.

209
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,667
I'm coming.

210
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:52,904
We'll talk later.

211
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,705
Sure.

212
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,255
Good morning. How are you?

213
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,279
I've been better.

214
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,324
Me too.

215
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,159
So did you see
if the triage nurse

216
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,516
brought your chart back?

217
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,067
I don't know.

218
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,163
So what seems to be the problem?

219
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,153
Kidney stones.

220
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,622
I've had them in the past.

221
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,857
Woke up with the
same pain this morning.

222
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,024
It starts back here

223
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,827
and it works its
way around front

224
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,928
and then<i> down.</i>

225
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,330
Yeah. Sounds like a stone.

226
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,643
They're probably
going to want a cat scan.

227
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,107
Let's get you in a gown first.

228
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,403
Do you eat a lot of ice cream?

229
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,239
Yes, actually.

230
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,239
Drink tea?

231
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,807
Almost every day.

232
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,209
Why do you ask?

233
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,961
Well, calcium from the ice cream

234
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,907
combined with the
oxylate in the tea

235
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,548
forms calcium oxylate stones.

236
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,466
A simple ionic bond.

237
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:39,818
Makes sense.

238
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,285
Mr. Sidowski?

239
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,536
That's right.

240
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,607
I was in your chemistry
class at Saint Monica's.

241
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:46,624
Carol.

242
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,259
Hathaway.

243
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,195
Second row...

244
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,563
right near the window.

245
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,999
God, I can't believe
you remember.

246
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,818
I remember the good ones.

247
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,121
I always knew you'd do well.

248
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:02,040
There you are, a doctor.

249
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,409
Do you specialize in
emergency medicine

250
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,143
or surgery or..?

251
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,713
No. I'm a nurse, actually.

252
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,014
In the E.R.

253
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,200
A<i> nurse?</i>

254
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,069
Well.

255
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:16,237
That's wonderful.

256
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,588
What's the story?

257
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:25,146
They found him obtunded
at his board and care.

258
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:26,814
BP's 50/30.

259
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,132
Pulse weak at 130.

260
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,445
No tendon reflexes.

261
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,562
No response to pain.

262
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:31,602
This IV's blown.

263
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,437
His vein's too weak to hold it.

264
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,438
What's his name?

265
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,790
Johnson.

266
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,408
Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?

267
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,377
He seems plenty gorked to me.

268
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,378
How old?

269
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,128
Eighty-nine.

270
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,146
Does anyone know what his

271
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,192
quality of life was like?

272
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,616
I'm calling his board and care.

273
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,978
Find out if he's
got a living will?

274
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,485
I don't want to get into

275
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,120
heroic measures if he's DNR.

276
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,255
I don't get a pulse.

277
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,417
He's bradying down.

278
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:52,640
You getting through?

279
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,559
They put me on hold.

280
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,447
All right, let's bag him.

281
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:01,198
Break out the atropine.

282
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,285
This is ridiculous.

283
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,498
It's a crime.

284
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,022
Every surgical intern
is in the OR today.

285
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,457
Everyone but us.

286
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,770
Benton let me spend
more time in the OR

287
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:12,760
as a med student.

288
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:14,562
Man, the man...
the man is a sadist.

289
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:15,997
Look at this.

290
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,665
Edson's double bypass?

291
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,733
No, but geez.

292
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:21,236
No, Keaton. That's Abby Keaton.

293
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,737
Pediatric surgeon.

294
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:25,173
She used to be at Southside.

295
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:27,942
Oh, man.

296
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,210
What?

297
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,779
Benton's going to try
for an elective with her.

298
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:32,780
No way. Mm-hmm.

299
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:34,081
He signed up for thoracic

300
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:35,183
with the new chief.

301
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,829
Then why did I see him reading

302
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,631
<i>Essentials of Pediatric Surgery?</i>

303
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:39,720
Benton and kids?

304
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,834
See, it's the most
difficult specialty.

305
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,391
It is impossible to get into.

306
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:45,160
It is exactly what he'd go for.

307
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:46,161
I don't buy it.

308
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,796
Benton's no Mr. Rogers.

309
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:51,327
It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood

310
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,967
boys and girls.

311
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,201
Gant, cover med-surg today.

312
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,653
I heard that you signed up

313
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,206
for a thoracic elective
with Anspaugh.

314
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,958
Oh, Carter. Pre-ops
and transfers for you.

315
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,827
Any chance we might get into OR?

316
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,479
Today?

317
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,514
Maybe... possibly...

318
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,327
Call surgery! Tell them we got

319
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:09,850
a major chest impalement!

320
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,018
What happened?

321
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,781
A motorcyclist
hit a glass truck.

322
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,473
Start an IV. And set
up the rapid infuser.

323
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,858
Okay, let's move him.

324
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,343
Ready. And...

325
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,344
Go.

326
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,146
Oh! Watch out.

327
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,198
BP's 70.

328
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,432
He's getting dusky.

329
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,534
Try for a 16 gauge...
He needs more volume.

330
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,736
He's seizing.
Someone hold his arm.

331
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,921
Ativan, two.

332
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,055
Use both hands.

333
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,423
Get the needle in.

334
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,458
He's moving.

335
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,475
Wait, wait.

336
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,593
Okay.

337
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,629
Now. Now!

338
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,996
Rapid infuse the o-neg.

339
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,680
No breath sounds on the right.

340
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,742
Tension pneumo.

341
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,562
Damn. Connie? Hold his head.

342
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:45,370
Jeanie, grab hold of
this glass and watch

343
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,685
your hands.

344
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:48,873
Pulse ox is down to 70.

345
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,057
Jeanie?

346
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:52,621
Get over here now.

347
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,345
I'll get someone.

348
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,313
Jeanie?

349
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,214
Jeanie!

350
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,978
Malik, they need you in there.

351
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:00,301
I'm going to the lab.

352
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:01,514
I'll take them. Go.

353
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,871
Go.

354
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:14,415
Do you pluck your eyebrows?

355
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,400
Uh... wax.

356
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,536
They look good, girl.
You do it yourself?

357
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,266
No, I found this
place on Dearborn.

358
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,773
Time?

359
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,708
12 minutes.

360
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,359
More Epi?

361
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:26,511
I guess.

362
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,629
What's going on in there?

363
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,959
The board and care

364
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,282
found medical records

365
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,233
but no DNR.

366
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:32,917
Let's hear it.

367
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:33,952
He's got COPD.

368
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,721
Renal failure,
congestive heart failure

369
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,139
prostate cancer, diabetes.

370
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,857
Any family we can contact?

371
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,426
A son. They're
trying to reach him.

372
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,147
If I ever get this old, I want "do not
resuscitate" tattooed on my forehead.

373
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,584
Get this. His PH is 6.97.

374
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,619
All right, he's been
down long enough.

375
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:52,637
Time of death:

376
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,805
10:06.

377
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,984
Get a strip.

378
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,208
I'm going next door.

379
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,657
Mark.

380
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,961
He's got a rhythm.

381
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,933
It won't last.

382
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,301
BP's 50 palp.

383
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:09,554
Guess we better put
him back on the mask.

384
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,673
Tough old geezer, ain't he?

385
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,313
So she asked you
to come to Hawaii.

386
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:19,725
Yeah, but I don't
know what she meant.

387
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,382
Well, seems fairly unambiguous.

388
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,162
Well, if she
meant it as a friend

389
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:25,498
then that means
separate hotel rooms right?

390
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:26,832
Right, or you could
be sharing a bed.

391
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:27,866
Right.

392
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,168
All right. Well, you
get adjoining rooms

393
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,636
with a broken lock and
you see what happens.

394
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,626
You're not helping.

395
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,771
What do you think she meant?

396
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:33,872
Well, I think she meant

397
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,007
something a little
more than friendship.

398
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,175
Yeah, and how do
you feel about that?

399
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,243
Well, I'm...

400
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,433
You're interested?

401
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,045
Maybe. Get on a plane, Humphrey.

402
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,737
Well, what if that's
not what she meant?

403
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,340
Three hours divided by
seven patients is 2.33.

404
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,674
How's it going, Mark?

405
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,120
Three hours, one patient.

406
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:49,444
I'm on a roll.

407
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,024
Jerry, I'll take that
plantar wart in five.

408
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,348
You got it.

409
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,160
Neuro come down for Mr. Johnson?

410
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:56,351
Who?

411
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:57,863
That Gomer that
came back to life.

412
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,186
Oh, yeah, they
wouldn't take him.

413
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,355
They said he's a renal case.

414
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,567
Yeah, well then try renal okay?

415
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,402
We've got to get
him out of here.

416
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,392
<i>Jawohl.</i> Hey, your wart.

417
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,738
Oh, right. Thank you.

418
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,805
Could I have some more soup?

419
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:07,940
Whose patient is Johnson?

420
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,130
Why?

421
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:10,298
He stopped breathing.

422
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,666
They need you in two.

423
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:12,667
I'll take it.

424
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:14,034
Has anyone seen Jeanie?

425
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,035
She went on break.

426
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,349
More soup?

427
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:17,905
Shh. Quiet.

428
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,785
Of a sighting of a
kangaroo in Humbolt park.

429
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:20,941
Yep, you heard me.

430
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,277
Lydia, come here.

431
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,379
The mystery marsupial
was recently sighted

432
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,158
hopping along the
Kennedy expressway.

433
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,916
The Department of Animal
Control has issued a warning

434
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,652
that kangaroos can be dangerous

435
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,421
and have been known
to attack when threatened.

436
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,872
Soup?

437
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,709
So... you asked
him to go with you?

438
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,245
It just popped out.

439
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,946
Have you guys ever...?

440
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,515
No!

441
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,251
But you asked
him to go to Hawaii.

442
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,987
I mean, that's...
that's pretty bold.

443
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,655
Oh, it's stupid.

444
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,036
I mean, Mark and I are friends.

445
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,393
We work together

446
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,062
and I basically invited
him into my<i> bed.</i>

447
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,530
What did he say?

448
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,298
Oh, he was appalled.

449
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,101
He couldn't wait to
get away from me.

450
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,670
Oh, I'm such a fool.

451
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,206
Uh, how long is
Anspaugh going to be?

452
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,208
One never knows.

453
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,043
Dr. Benton.

454
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,043
Carter...

455
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,411
What are you doing here?

456
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,342
I just admitted a
woman with a lipoma.

457
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,376
She's going to need surgery.

458
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,700
A fat tumor? It can wait.

459
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:19,845
Hey, well, she
wants it out today.

460
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:21,035
All right. Well, then

461
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,754
go ahead and book
an OR, all right?

462
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,790
Can I assist, please?

463
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:25,806
Yeah, whatever.

464
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,975
Just get out of here, all right?

465
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,927
Solid.

466
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:41,923
Hey, this guy in the
picture with Dr. Anspaugh...

467
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,224
Is that, um...

468
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,741
General Schwarzkopf.

469
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,910
They were roommates
at West Point.

470
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,840
Judith, I'll be in neonatal.

471
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,233
Hey, uh, Dr. Anspaugh,
I chose cardiothoracic

472
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:53,800
as my eight-week elective.

473
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:54,913
Congratulations.

474
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:56,303
Means you're on my team.

475
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,305
Uh-huh. But I just
found out today

476
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,074
that Dr. Keaton's coming here.

477
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,187
Yes. Very, very
happy to have<i> her.</i>

478
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,423
Yes. I know... I
followed her work.

479
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:06,813
Do I sense a wind
shift, doctor, uh...

480
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:07,814
Benton.

481
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,783
Look, Dr. Keaton
is one of the finest

482
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,419
pediatric surgeons
in the country.

483
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:12,764
An opportunity to work
with her is hard to pass up.

484
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,400
Well, she may not
have a slot for you.

485
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:15,822
Well, I'd like to see.

486
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,525
I'll give you until 6:00.

487
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,327
So if I don't get the pedes

488
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:21,940
I'm still on for
thoracic, right?

489
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,598
Dr. Benton, if I don't
hear from you by 6:00

490
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,951
you get neither.

491
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,100
Jane, I'm Dr. Ross;
this is Dr. Doyle.

492
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,290
Hi.

493
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,636
I understand you've
been having some pain

494
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,704
when you urinate.

495
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,829
Yeah. I think it's
a bladder infection.

496
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,163
I had one before.

497
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,165
Uh, when was that?

498
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,750
Last year.

499
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,763
Okay. Any soreness
or tenderness?

500
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,454
Um, just when I
go to the bathroom.

501
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,340
Are you sexually active?

502
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,770
Have you ever had intercourse?

503
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:52,760
Oh, no.

504
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:55,023
Okay, well, we're
going to do some tests.

505
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,548
When we get those
back, we'll talk some more.

506
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,549
Okay?

507
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,550
Okay.

508
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,551
All right.

509
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,552
So what do you think?

510
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,721
Either an STD.
Or she's pregnant.

511
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,800
Based on?

512
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:09,160
Her sweater... cashmere,
probably Neiman Marcus.

513
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,095
Why does a rich girl
come to a county ER?

514
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,174
She doesn't want her
family doctor what's wrong.

515
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,497
Okay, so what do you do?

516
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,900
Dip her urine and do

517
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,601
a pregnancy test for starters.

518
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,914
Sounds good.

519
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,899
Sorry. The OR's are booked.

520
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:22,956
Dr. Benton sends
his apologies...

521
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:25,104
He can send
flowers for all I care.

522
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,072
You've got a breast
reconstruction

523
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,974
a thyroidectomy and a
hemicolectomy ahead of you.

524
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:29,963
This is important.

525
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:30,964
What is it?

526
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,233
It's a pheochromocytoma.

527
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,234
A pheo?

528
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,568
Her BP is through the roof.

529
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,903
If we don't go in soon,
she's going to stroke out.

530
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:37,904
All right.

531
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,807
Tell Dr. Benton he has his OR.

532
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:42,643
And tell him I like tulips.

533
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,632
Jeanie, if you have an
explanation, I'm listening.

534
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,112
I'm sorry. I haven't
been feeling well.

535
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,213
I got nauseous.

536
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,248
If you're feeling
ill to the point

537
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,183
where it interferes
with your work

538
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,707
you should let me know.

539
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,643
It won't happen again.

540
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,978
Everything else okay?

541
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,680
Yeah. Everything's fine.

542
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,148
How's Al?

543
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,950
He's, uh, he's holding his own.

544
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:06,951
It's difficult.

545
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,318
I'm sure it is.

546
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,239
Can I help you?

547
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,353
Uh, yeah. I need
to see Dr. Keaton.

548
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:15,554
You're too late.

549
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:17,706
Well, the patient's
still conscious.

550
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,024
Come back in three hours.

551
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:20,347
I need to talk to her.

552
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:22,683
You don't know Dr. Keaton
very well, do you?

553
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:23,784
Just by reputation. Why?

554
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,030
I guarantee

555
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,605
that if you go in there
right now, the only words

556
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,274
she's going to have
for you are "get out."

557
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,676
All right, look,
if I write a note

558
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,343
will you make sure
she that she gets it?

559
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,712
I'm not her secretary.

560
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,147
Leave it in her box.

561
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,336
Mr. Johnson, your father

562
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,105
was found unconscious
this morning.

563
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,491
He has what we call
multisystem failure...

564
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,842
Heart, lungs, kidneys...

565
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,611
And he may have
suffered a stroke.

566
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,746
That's like Alzheimer's.

567
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:54,799
No. But it's very serious.

568
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,067
Did you ever talk
with your father

569
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,670
about whether he
wanted to use machines

570
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,938
to keep him alive

571
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,506
if his body were failing?

572
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,652
Not a lot, no.

573
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,227
Were you and he close?

574
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:08,111
About a hundred miles.

575
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,231
I live in Boone County.

576
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,949
I smoke hams.

577
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,169
Your father is very ill.

578
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,536
In all likelihood

579
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,173
he may never
regain consciousness.

580
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,607
And we can use

581
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:24,795
a machine to keep his body alive

582
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,496
or we can give him

583
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,699
medication to take
care of his pain

584
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,751
and let nature take its course.

585
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:34,171
As next of kin,
it's your decision.

586
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,642
What do you think?

587
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,096
If it were my father...

588
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:45,799
I would try to make
him comfortable

589
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:46,867
in his final moments.

590
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:47,912
Okay.

591
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,753
Okay.

592
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,722
So I'll get somebody
to bring you the papers?

593
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,067
You're going to help him, right?

594
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,508
I'm sorry?

595
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,127
You're going to make him better.

596
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,180
I'm not sure that we can.

597
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:02,199
Just don't let him die, okay?

598
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,499
All right, Carter, make the
incision below the costal margin,

599
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:08,833
straight across,
six centimeters.

600
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,824
Okay.

601
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:14,127
Now, just like carpentry,
measure twice, cut once.

602
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,496
Right.

603
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:18,782
Benton, you should have
told <i>me</i> you're doing a pheo.

604
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,385
Trying to keep all the
exotic ones for yourself, huh?

605
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,382
What are you talking about?
I'm doing a lipoma removal.

606
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:25,350
It's on the board,
"pheochromocytoma"

607
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:27,140
in big red letters.

608
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,475
Who the hell put it

609
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:29,688
up there?

610
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:31,378
That one.

611
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,990
Hey, Carter, Simon's
letting me do an Appi.

612
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,659
I'm going in.

613
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,134
No. It's called Gonorrhea.

614
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,569
It's sexually transmitted.

615
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:58,505
It is treatable, but we
have to do it right away.

616
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,385
Are you going to
tell my parents?

617
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,710
No. Whether you
tell your parents or not

618
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:03,910
that's up to you.

619
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,946
I would tell the,
uh, boy or boys

620
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,581
that you've had sex with.

621
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,717
I only did it once.

622
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:12,853
Then you need to tell him.

623
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,321
I... I can't.

624
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,389
Why is that?

625
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:18,191
Because he won't talk to me.

626
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,796
When I see him in the halls

627
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:24,832
he won't even look at me.

628
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,402
I feel really disgusting.

629
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,740
Sorry.

630
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:35,576
That's all right.

631
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:38,278
I wanted it to be special

632
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:40,764
and it was like I
wasn't even there.

633
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,551
He didn't even drive me home.

634
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:46,749
Hey Jane, guys
who are interested

635
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,049
in having sex with you

636
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,208
aren't necessarily
interested in you.

637
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,059
You know?

638
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,079
If you want it to be special

639
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,581
you're going to have
to wait for the right guy.

640
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,751
I would suggest
waiting a long time...

641
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,620
like until you can vote.

642
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,558
So, Mr. Johnson's in V-tach.

643
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,094
Paddles.

644
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,695
Why not?

645
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:12,941
Charge?

646
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,098
You pick.

647
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,099
200?

648
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,334
200 it is.

649
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,636
Clear.

650
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,620
Next contestant.

651
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,021
Do I hear 300?

652
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,039
300, sure.

653
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,373
300 from the stunning woman

654
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,558
in floral scrubs.

655
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:25,509
Clear. Clear.

656
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:29,329
I'll see your 300
and raise you 360.

657
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:31,364
Mark?

658
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:34,501
What a joke.

659
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:35,318
360.

660
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,704
Clear.

661
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:40,508
And he's back.

662
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:41,508
What a trooper.

663
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,627
Congratulations, Mr. Johnson.

664
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,978
You are the lucky winner

665
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,830
of a brand-new ventilator

666
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,166
at a cost of $5,000 a day

667
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,852
and as a bonus, your
very own chest x ray...

668
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,370
Perfect for decorating

669
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,706
the small sterile hospital room

670
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,457
where you're going to spend

671
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,927
the rest of your
brief, unconscious life.

672
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,501
She's still in there? It's 4:00.

673
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,724
She went back in.

674
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,259
She's got a four-year-old
with a Wilm's tumor.

675
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,928
Excuse me, what are you doing?

676
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,363
I'm just seeing if
she got my note.

677
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,947
Look, uh, when
Dr. Keaton comes out

678
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,316
please, please make
sure that she gets this.

679
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,573
Yes.

680
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm Peter Benton, I'm
a fourth-year resident

681
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,711
and I'm interested in a
pediatric surgery elective.

682
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,758
I need to talk to
her about 6:00.

683
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,926
My pager number is...

684
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,418
3376. I can read.

685
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,598
Look, just make
sure she gets it, okay?

686
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,622
Okay.

687
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,538
<i>So you always vomit</i>

688
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,794
when you screw up?

689
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,714
Only when I get written
up by the Chief of Staff.

690
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:55,933
Yeah, well, ten
migs of Compazine

691
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,736
should get your
stomach back on its feet.

692
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,504
You missed a great appendectomy.

693
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,950
I could lose my residency.

694
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:05,042
Retracted the internal
obliques, clamped that sucker...

695
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,357
My career is over.

696
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:09,629
Ow! Sorry, sorry.

697
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:11,298
Dr. Benton.

698
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,716
What makes you think

699
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,801
you can assist

700
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,753
on a surgery behind my back?

701
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,171
Simon needed an intern.

702
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,288
I'm your resident.

703
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,018
You don't blink
without asking me.

704
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,941
This afternoon,
you're on bedsore duty.

705
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,560
If there's a boil, you lance it.

706
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,797
If there's a weeping decubitus,
you debride it, and if...

707
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,700
Anspaugh's leading
chief rounds in 20 minutes.

708
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:31,701
Don't be late.

709
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,186
Especially you, Carter.

710
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,555
He asked for you by name.

711
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,900
<i>I can't believe</i>

712
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:37,791
<i>I spent four years in med school</i>

713
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,309
and four years as resident

714
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,245
so now I can take orders
from a guy who smokes hams.

715
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,414
Other than that,
how's your day going?

716
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,483
Just got worse.

717
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,884
Who does this belong to?

718
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,063
Yep, that's mine.

719
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,889
Wear it. We lose
20 or 30 a year.

720
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,557
Who invented the stethoscope?

721
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,559
I have no idea.

722
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,561
Rene Laennec, 1819.

723
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,390
You can see I taught her well.

724
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,559
Keep hustling, boys.

725
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,927
You don't want to end up

726
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:04,384
with the turtle wax.

727
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,468
Oh.

728
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,554
Hi. Hi.

729
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,606
I haven't seen you much today.

730
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,070
Yeah, it's been
a pretty busy one.

731
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,827
So you've been, uh...

732
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,612
you've been busy.

733
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,814
Yeah, pretty much.

734
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,901
So, about Hawaii...

735
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,953
How much are the hotel rooms?

736
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:23,938
Rooms?

737
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:25,338
Or a room...

738
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,257
for me.

739
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,876
Um... yeah, I'll have
to check on that.

740
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:32,362
You'll let me know.

741
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,364
Sure.

742
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,449
Jerry! Jerry, turn on

743
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,661
channel five, quickly!

744
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,185
They've spotted him again.

745
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,632
He was at the railyard an hour
ago, I hope he made it through.

746
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:41,755
Remains unknown.

747
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,824
That kangaroo watch continues.

748
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,553
The kangaroo that
mysteriously appeared on

749
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,812
Chicago streets, was seen
entering this abandoned building

750
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,864
at the corner of
Kenzie and Maplewood.

751
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,850
That's six blocks from my house.

752
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,536
Armed fish and wildlife officers
have surrounded the building

753
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,655
in an attempt to
apprehend the animal.

754
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,890
They're not going to
shoot him, are they?

755
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:01,926
I hope so.

756
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,127
That thing looks
like a giant rat.

757
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,596
Jeanie?

758
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,063
You paged me?

759
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,233
Yeah.

760
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,467
Where's the patient?

761
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,730
There is no patient.

762
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:13,070
We need to talk.

763
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,071
About what?

764
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,333
About my working here.

765
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:17,991
I need to know if you're
planning to tell anyone

766
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:19,054
that I'm positive.

767
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,510
No, I'm not.

768
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,915
Look, Jeanie, I don't agree
with what you're doing.

769
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,584
But how you handle
your patients...

770
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,686
That's your responsibility.

771
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:32,239
Thank you.

772
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:33,274
But I do want you

773
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:35,375
to stay away from my patients.

774
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,145
And I don't want to be in
a trauma room with you.

775
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,014
That 13-year-old with the clap

776
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,003
has had her ceftriaxone.

777
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,083
You want me to
write her a scrip?

778
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,139
Ten days of doxycycline

779
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,875
and tell her to stay away
from insincere suitors.

780
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,260
You were good with her.

781
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:54,745
Thanks.

782
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,882
Listen, uh... Why don't
you grab some lunch?

783
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,884
I was on all night.
I'm kind of beat.

784
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,953
I'm going to sack
out for about an hour.

785
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:04,766
Sure, I'll round you
up when I get back.

786
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,523
That's not necessary. Thank you.

787
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,096
Susan, can you
push some Ketorolac?

788
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,243
Actually, I'm suturing a thumb.

789
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,844
Do you know where Mark is?

790
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:17,913
Mm, try the desk.

791
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,237
Hey, Malik, have you seen Doug?

792
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,138
Haven't seen him.

793
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,694
Where are all the doctors?

794
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,893
Um... are you available?

795
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,884
Sure.

796
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,551
Exam one.

797
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,587
In a minute.

798
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,224
<i>Next, we have</i>

799
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,560
a 73-year-old post-thyroidectomy

800
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,731
exhibiting both Chvostek's
and Trousseaus's signs.

801
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,066
Treatment?

802
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,968
Dr. Carter?

803
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,572
Saline diuresis, three
to six liters per day

804
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,941
plus Pamidronate.

805
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,278
A textbook treatment
for<i> hypercalcemia,</i> doctor.

806
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:04,580
Unfortunately, this
patient has<i> hypocalcemia</i>

807
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,549
and you've just
stopped his heart.

808
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,885
Rest in peace, Mr. Edmonson.

809
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,165
Next, we have a...

810
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,554
Man, he's gunning for you.

811
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,755
You okay?

812
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,803
I can't control the
muscles in my neck.

813
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,627
You're having a dystonic
reaction to the Compazine.

814
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,895
I am?

815
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,564
Yeah, muscle spasms
are one of the side effects.

816
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,766
So is lip smacking.

817
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,113
Help me.

818
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,004
The aortography on
this patient revealed

819
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,607
a small type "A" dissection
of the thoracic aorta.

820
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,259
Dr. Carter

821
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,506
differentiate between type "A"

822
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,132
and type "B" aortic dissection.

823
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:41,935
Type "A" involves

824
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,899
the ascending aorta and type "B"

825
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,773
the descending.

826
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,419
Correct.

827
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:49,504
Next, a traumatic amputation.

828
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:53,230
The patient is a
35-year-old female,

829
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,442
otherwise in good health...

830
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,232
<i>How much longer do I</i>

831
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,567
have to wait?

832
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,403
They're prepping an OR
for you know, Mr. Sidowski.

833
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,405
In two hours, you
will be stone-free.

834
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,407
I have some
questions for the doctor.

835
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,287
Uh, the surgeon will
be down in a minute.

836
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,889
He can answer your questions.

837
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,557
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

838
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,476
I had half a mind
to give him saline

839
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,877
instead of the painkiller.

840
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:13,867
Why?

841
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,313
He flunked me in chemistry.

842
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,470
You went to St. Mo's?

843
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,549
Yeah, you? Yeah.

844
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:19,518
You know what? I think
you were in my history class.

845
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:20,985
Mrs. Hester. Never had her.

846
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,610
You might be thinking
of my sister. So, listen...

847
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:24,646
What year were you?

848
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,646
'88.

849
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,314
Oh, see, I was '85.

850
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,094
Yeah, Mary's three
years older than me.

851
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,412
Check Sidowski's urine
output before moving him.

852
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,887
The last entry
was two hours ago.

853
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,877
Hey, Jer, Animal Control
cop got shot with a tranquilizer.

854
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,112
Where do you want him?

855
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,848
Exam four. Excuse me,
officer, how did this happen?

856
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,795
I was trying to hit
that friggin' kangaroo

857
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,930
that's running around
Ukrainian village.

858
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:49,919
My partner got in the way.

859
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,188
How about the kangaroo?

860
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,189
Hopped the wall.

861
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,124
He's still out there.

862
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,911
Mr. Johnson?

863
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:00,492
Do you recognize this?

864
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:01,764
What?

865
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,384
This was found at your
father's nursing home.

866
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,614
It's a living will.

867
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,688
It says that your
father did not want

868
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,307
any heroic measures
used to prolong his life.

869
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,009
A will? What I get?

870
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,645
No. What it means is,
we never should have

871
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,479
put him on the ventilator.

872
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,759
We've kept him alive

873
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,916
against his expressed wishes.

874
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,335
See this? Right here? This line?

875
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:23,836
Does that signature

876
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:25,171
look familiar?

877
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:26,623
Yeah, it's mine.

878
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,124
Yes, it is.

879
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,082
I got to go put the hams to bed.

880
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:41,655
Except this one.

881
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,908
This one's for you.

882
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,445
So you'll call me when
he wakes up, right?

883
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,382
My work number.

884
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,669
Bye, Pop.

885
00:30:58,707 --> 00:30:59,823
What happened?

886
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,092
30-foot fall off an
I-beam. Head trauma.

887
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,927
Near amputation of the left leg.

888
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,162
I'll get some O-neg.

889
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,931
Eight units. And call
the reimplantation team.

890
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,968
Let's go, trauma two. Let's go.

891
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,107
Yeah?

892
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,619
Jane wanted to say good-bye.

893
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,943
Jane.

894
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,779
Thanks for helping me.
You've both been really nice.

895
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,614
Well, okay.

896
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,333
Be careful out there.

897
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,846
You, uh, need to get that?

898
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,604
Excuse me.

899
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,989
Uh...

900
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:40,613
Faint dorsalis pulse.

901
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,916
Decreased breath
sounds on the right side.

902
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,584
Set up for a chest tube.

903
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:45,897
All right.

904
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:46,921
What's going on?

905
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:49,056
30-Foot high dive

906
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:51,441
facial trauma, multiple open
fractures, tension pneumo.

907
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,458
He's not breathing.

908
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,227
Laryngoscope, now. Move.

909
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:56,012
Lacerated femoral artery.

910
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,364
Get me a vascular

911
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:58,931
clamp and suction.

912
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,128
Can't visualize the cords.
There's too much blood.

913
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,152
From where?

914
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,265
I don't know. Looks
like the nasopharynx.

915
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,222
Jeanie can pack the nose.

916
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,335
Get a 16 foley

917
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,944
and an umbilical clamp.
Peter can talk you through it.

918
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,396
I thought you were
staying out of my traumas.

919
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,248
It's not your trauma.
I was here first.

920
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:15,999
Pulse ox is dropping. 78.

921
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:16,950
Come on, let's go.

922
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:18,718
Thread the catheter
through the nose.

923
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:20,119
Let's move.

924
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,738
Can you visualize the balloon?

925
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:22,739
It's down there.

926
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,141
Inflate and retract.

927
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,243
Artery's clamped.

928
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,304
Can you come up here

929
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:28,245
and take over for Jeanie?

930
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,562
She's got it.

931
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,214
I think I've got it sealed.

932
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,082
Clamp it to keep it in place.

933
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,618
It's clamped.

934
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,218
Peter?

935
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,203
Bleeding stopped.

936
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,372
He's tubed.

937
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:39,389
Bag him.

938
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,306
Nice job, guys.

939
00:32:40,342 --> 00:32:41,453
Good breath sounds.

940
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:43,443
All right. Let's get him
upstairs. Let's move.

941
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:48,582
Good work.

942
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,192
What kind of greens?

943
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,961
Yeah, romaine, spinach, alfalfa.

944
00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:03,563
Right.

945
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,664
Who's he talking to?

946
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:05,743
Australian Embassy.

947
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,245
Unfortunately, there
was some confusion.

948
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:10,870
We intubated him first,
and then, we found the DNR.

949
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:11,871
Yes, I know.

950
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,473
Mark...

951
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:16,009
No, no, no, he never should
have been put on the ventilator

952
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:17,010
to begin with.

953
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:18,578
I just need the legal okay

954
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:19,579
to take him off.

955
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:20,580
Mark...

956
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:21,581
Absolutely.

957
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:23,517
His pulse ox barely registers.

958
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:25,852
There's not a single
functioning organ

959
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:26,887
left in his body.

960
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,022
He's got one foot
in the grave, okay?

961
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,357
This man...

962
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:32,659
Is awake!

963
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:34,528
I'll call you right back.

964
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:41,167
Mr. Johnson, do you
know where you are?

965
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,520
You're very sick.

966
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,651
You were found
unconscious at your home.

967
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:48,391
Do you understand?

968
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,662
You want me to take that
tube out of your mouth?

969
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,145
There is a risk of
respiratory failure

970
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,064
if we take you
off the ventilator.

971
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:03,923
Are you sure that
that's what you want?

972
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,662
All right.

973
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:10,263
What I want you to do

974
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:13,182
is to blow real hard
on the count of three.

975
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,019
Okay. One, two

976
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,038
three, blow.

977
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,260
Good, good.

978
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,745
You okay, Mr. Johnson?

979
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:30,216
Call me Jack.

980
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,336
The Compazine wore off

981
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,138
and now, I'm sick
to my stomach again.

982
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:36,472
What a day, huh?

983
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,508
I just want to go
home and go to bed.

984
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,620
So, tell me, how much longer

985
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,855
are we going to
put up with this?

986
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,845
With what?

987
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,924
With Benton.

988
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,915
What else we going to do?

989
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,550
I don't know if I can
take this abuse for a year.

990
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,120
Betty?

991
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:52,555
Betty, what happened?

992
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,392
Smoke inhalation.

993
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,709
There was a fire.

994
00:34:57,912 --> 00:34:59,178
Was anybody hurt?

995
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:00,997
Just me.

996
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,833
What about your apartment?

997
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:05,335
It's gone.

998
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,736
Everything.

999
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,004
Everything.

1000
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,338
Everything.

1001
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,585
The whole building.

1002
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,075
The whole building?

1003
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,693
Yes.

1004
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:14,894
My floor too?

1005
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:16,229
Yes.

1006
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:17,663
Yes.

1007
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,383
Yes!

1008
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:25,088
She's not here.

1009
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,123
I think she went home.

1010
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,327
Damn.

1011
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:35,414
So there he was,
naked as a jaybird.

1012
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,817
I mean, not a stitch.

1013
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:39,886
So I said

1014
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:44,624
"Son, what the
hell are you doing?"

1015
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,893
He turns, looks straight at me

1016
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:50,547
and says, "Fishing, Pop.

1017
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,515
Fishing."

1018
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,301
He's a sweet boy.

1019
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:57,871
Just slow.

1020
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,706
You want me to call him?

1021
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,874
No.

1022
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,627
I don't like him
driving at night.

1023
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,814
We're going to transfer
you up to intensive care.

1024
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:10,111
They'll make sure
you're comfortable.

1025
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,229
Is there anything else I can do?

1026
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,004
No.

1027
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,958
I had a good spin.

1028
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:20,977
Saw two wars...

1029
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,563
Ten Chevys...

1030
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,867
Boston, San Francisco

1031
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:31,404
Paris, France.

1032
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,540
Married a woman

1033
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:36,759
who put up with me

1034
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:40,212
and died as beautiful
as the day we met.

1035
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:44,283
Can't ask for more.

1036
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,934
Hi. Uh, is Dr. Anspaugh here?

1037
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,058
He's not here.

1038
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,004
He was supposed
to be here at 6:00.

1039
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,796
He was. He left
about five minutes ago.

1040
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:58,147
Uh, listen, um...

1041
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,982
You have his pager number?

1042
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,968
Sorry, I'm new here.

1043
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:03,302
Yeah, beautiful.

1044
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,154
Thank you.

1045
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,491
Hey, you're Benton, aren't you?

1046
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,443
Abbey Keaton.

1047
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,012
I'd shake your hand, but
I've got pepperoni on mine.

1048
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:16,115
Don's just letting me use
his computer till I move over.

1049
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,168
Well, it's...

1050
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:21,354
Sorry.

1051
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,189
Uh...

1052
00:37:23,224 --> 00:37:25,158
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1053
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:27,260
You know what, actually...

1054
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:30,546
I've been trying to get
in touch with you all day.

1055
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,680
I got your note.

1056
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,967
So, you're interested
in pediatric surgery.

1057
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,152
Yes, I am, very much.

1058
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,187
Mm-hmm.

1059
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,008
How do you feel about deep-dish
pepperoni and anchovies?

1060
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:44,994
Well, um, I don't
eat meat, but, hey.

1061
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,629
You could scrape it off.

1062
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,348
Sit down.

1063
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:51,234
Let's talk.

1064
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,271
Gee, it's cold out tonight.

1065
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,707
Yeah, it feels like fall.

1066
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,642
You off?

1067
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,812
Waiting for a break in the rain.

1068
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:08,918
How long have you
and Al been separated?

1069
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,053
Almost a year.

1070
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,100
No chance of a reconciliation?

1071
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,457
No.

1072
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,292
Mmm.

1073
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,808
Must be tough to
be sick and alone.

1074
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,619
A good friend of mine
tested positive last year.

1075
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:30,373
I think I'm one of the
two people he's told.

1076
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,826
He's a lawyer.

1077
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:36,529
Didn't want to
tell his coworkers.

1078
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,859
Afraid he might lose clients.

1079
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,217
It's got to be hard

1080
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:44,420
to carry that around all day.

1081
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,345
It is.

1082
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,375
I'm glad you decided
to keep working.

1083
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:09,056
It would be a real
loss to the patients

1084
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,360
if you quit.

1085
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,912
Is there anything you need?

1086
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,637
No, I'm okay.

1087
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:18,971
Okay.

1088
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,777
It's freezing out here.

1089
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:26,111
Well, good night.

1090
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:36,300
Wait, wait. You're serious?

1091
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:37,924
Yeah, yeah.

1092
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,259
Aah!

1093
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,860
I've given it a lot of thought

1094
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:42,795
and I've decided
to be spontaneous.

1095
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,630
What the hell,
I'm going to Maui.

1096
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:45,631
Good for you.

1097
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,300
You don't think I
misread the situation?

1098
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,347
You don't invite
somebody to Maui

1099
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:50,982
to play scrabble by the pool.

1100
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:52,571
So how's that new intern?

1101
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:53,617
Doyle? She's fine.

1102
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,041
She's competent, does her job.

1103
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,221
What do you think, keep her?

1104
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:59,456
Sure, keep her. Why not?

1105
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,580
Mark, I need your signature.

1106
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:03,716
Oh, more paperwork
on Mr. Johnson.

1107
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:04,850
Surprise, surprise.

1108
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:05,851
Transfer orders?

1109
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:06,852
Death certificate.

1110
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:07,853
What?

1111
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:09,455
He arrested in the elevator.

1112
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,924
ICU never admitted him

1113
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,326
so technically, he's
still your patient.

1114
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,930
Hey, that's my locker.

1115
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,099
Gotcha.

1116
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:23,002
So do you get back to
the neighborhood much?

1117
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:25,216
Uh, every night.
I'm still living

1118
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,538
with my parents.

1119
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:28,441
Really?

1120
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:30,487
Yeah, same room I used
to share with my sisters.

1121
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,522
I'm trying to save
money, you know.

1122
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:33,112
You could always
sell the beamer.

1123
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:34,547
It was a gift from my dad.

1124
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,216
Bought it at a police auction.

1125
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:37,216
Oh, he's a cop?

1126
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:38,262
Third generation.

1127
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:40,720
He wanted me to be the
first female commissioner

1128
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:41,954
but I took after my ma.

1129
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,155
Oh, she's a doctor.

1130
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,156
Nurse.

1131
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,142
I was going to be

1132
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,421
until I got kicked
out of nursing school.

1133
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,329
I never was very
good at taking orders.

1134
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,798
See ya.

1135
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:04,376
Jerry, I don't want that thing
eating out of my mixing bowl.

1136
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,614
Oh, ma, I'll clean
it when I'm done.

1137
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,739
Lewis, Weaver, Weaver.

1138
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:21,177
Ross, Lewis. Greene?

1139
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,379
Did you work today?

1140
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,881
Yeah.

1141
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,516
This it?

1142
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,517
Uh-huh.

1143
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,264
You mean to tell me you worked

1144
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,333
a 12 hour shift and you
saw only one patient?

1145
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,190
It was unusually time consuming.

1146
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,657
What was the outcome?

1147
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:36,693
He died.

1148
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,839
On the other end of the scale

1149
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,746
it looks like we have a tie

1150
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:44,083
between Dr. Lewis
and Dr. Weaver.

1151
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,185
Last patient, out the door.

1152
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:50,256
Well, congratulations, Doctor.

1153
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,259
You win the gumdrops.

1154
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:54,860
Greene...

1155
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:58,797
It's the uh, black
Cadillac Seville.

1156
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,700
Front row, burgundy interior.

1157
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,673
Don't forget the sidewalls.

1158
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,642
Is he serious?

1159
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:12,561
No.

1160
00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:17,900
I want to talk to you
about that invitation.

1161
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,485
I'm sorry about that.

1162
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,153
No, no, I... I...

1163
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,656
I hope you didn't
misunderstand me.

1164
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,124
I mean, we can
still get you a room

1165
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,827
if you still want to come.

1166
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:28,828
Oh.

1167
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:30,363
But you can't, that's okay.

1168
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:32,998
I wasn't really
serious about it myself.

1169
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:34,333
Right.

1170
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,856
So, uh, I'll see
you in ten days.

1171
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,826
Sure. Don't worry about the cat.

1172
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,195
Thank you.

1173
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,798
Have a great trip.

1174
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,333
Call me.

1175
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:54,286
Yeah, from the pool.

1176
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,804
Bye.

1177
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,873
Bye.
