1
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:17,566
Oh, my.

2
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,418
On the dance floor again.

3
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,802
Thank you, Bubbles.

4
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:22,271
Should I try a one?

5
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:23,346
Nope. Use a three.

6
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:24,839
You got more control.

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,743
What did you get
on the last hole...

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:28,810
Six, five?

9
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:29,811
Uh, six.

10
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:30,812
Take a five.

11
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:31,914
Use your Mulligan.

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,082
That was six with my Mulligan.

13
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,194
You know what you got to do?

14
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:36,530
You got to go to
the driving range

15
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:37,452
with me more often.

16
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:40,188
You don't have to carpool
on Tuesdays, right?

17
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:43,091
You know, I think a car full
of screaming eight-year-olds

18
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,393
arguing over who's got shotgun

19
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:47,273
is less aggravating than this.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,764
Okay, hang on. Wait.

21
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,399
Straighten up
your back like that.

22
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:51,466
Keep your head down.

23
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:52,634
I'll watch the ball.

24
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:53,969
Okay.

25
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,593
You're in the fairway.

26
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,829
It's the wrong fairway,
but you're in the fairway.

27
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,277
I think it's this whole
doctor-golf clichÃ©

28
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,845
that's really throwing me.

29
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,101
Well, you can't fight it.

30
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,204
You got to play nine
holes twice a week

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,539
and then 18 on the weekends.

32
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,057
You'll be shooting in
the low 80s by Labor Day.

33
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:18,020
Dr. Benton, I see you have

34
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,839
a thymectomy scheduled.

35
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:22,580
Would you mind if I
gave it to Dr. Levin?

36
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,866
Uh... yes, I would.

37
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,729
Because Drs. Fecteau
and Loesch are looking

38
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,365
for a resident to assist them.

39
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,371
On a transplant?

40
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:30,783
35-year-old with lupus.

41
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,902
Her brother is
giving her a kidney.

42
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,704
I thought you'd
like the opportunity.

43
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,222
Oh, yes, yes, I... I would.

44
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,741
Dr. Carter can still

45
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,397
scrub in on the thymectomy.

46
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,732
Sure.

47
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,268
Unless, of course, uh...

48
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,804
the transplant team
could also use Dr. Carter.

49
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,757
Perhaps Dr. Carter

50
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,993
could assist the donor's team.

51
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:52,994
I'll ask.

52
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,496
Dr. Benton, thanks.

53
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,098
It means a lot to me that you...

54
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:59,835
Carter, I'll see
you up there, okay?

55
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,853
Jeanie...

56
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,589
Jeanie, it's after 7:00.

57
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,924
Oh, my God.

58
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,592
Didn't my alarm ring?

59
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,873
Every ten minutes
for the last hour.

60
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,029
My 7:00...

61
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,208
Pills. Yeah.

62
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,877
That's why I woke you.

63
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,034
I can't believe I overslept.

64
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,516
Here's some juice and toast

65
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,005
to take with it.

66
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,019
You take AZT first, right?

67
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,577
Yeah. Then I can
take my nine o'clocks

68
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,011
on an empty stomach.

69
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,347
Thanks for letting me stay...

70
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,349
and for not asking why.

71
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,784
Sure.

72
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,780
I didn't want to be alone,

73
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,272
but I didn't feel right
calling anyone else.

74
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:40,775
I'm glad you called.

75
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,377
Minor meltdown, you know.

76
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,814
I was doing great,
and then out of the blue,

77
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,249
it snuck up on me.

78
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:48,728
Yeah, I forget sometimes

79
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,130
for a couple of hours,

80
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:51,664
and then I remember.

81
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:52,537
What's that?

82
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,790
They're playing
around with my meds.

83
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:58,026
The good news is, if I
start the day with this stuff,

84
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:00,495
then I can work in
my Oreos at bedtime.

85
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,164
You still haven't
outgrown that Oreo thing?

86
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,849
Hell, no.

87
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,701
Why are they adding

88
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:07,836
to your meds?

89
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,337
Is your viral load up?

90
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:10,655
I'm fine.

91
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,527
I got to be on the
job in about an hour.

92
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,507
You want to walk
to the El together?

93
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,764
Al, how are you doing?

94
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,837
You know, it seems I'm
resistant to something or other.

95
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,256
What about some
of those new drugs...

96
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,941
The nucleoside analogs?

97
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,127
Yeah, my docs
are trying to get me

98
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:35,630
into a trial study for those,

99
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,299
but they only take 20 people.

100
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,101
Why didn't you tell me?

101
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,770
It's not your problem.

102
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,105
Well, I might be able to help.

103
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,074
I do know some doctors.

104
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,254
I didn't want to bother you.

105
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:51,280
I could probably
get you an interview.

106
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,781
Where's the study?

107
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,283
At County.

108
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,803
Some docs who work
in, uh... Infectious Disease

109
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,472
are running it.

110
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:03,608
It's a hassle.

111
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,927
No, no. It's, um...

112
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,096
it's a simple request.

113
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,347
Are you sure?

114
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,882
No problem.

115
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,690
I told you.

116
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,227
"She reached to
hang his banana bag,

117
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,018
"her breasts swelling
under the pink of her uniform.

118
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,065
"'Carly.' His voice
was hoarse with desire.

119
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,054
'Call me Nurse... Hallonan'"?

120
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,734
Carly Hallonan...
That's you, girl.

121
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,902
No, you got to read the part

122
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,226
about the gentle
giant at the Admit desk.

123
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,240
You didn't mind he
was Neanderthal?

124
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,563
More brawn than
brains... He's a dude.

125
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,743
Who wrote this trash?

126
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,078
It had to be Randi. I
found it under the desk.

127
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,067
Or maybe it was Lydia.

128
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,646
She had a poem in
<i>Good Housekeeping</i> once.

129
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,015
No, it was definitely
written by a woman.

130
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,238
No man thinks like this.

131
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,274
Wait. Listen to this:

132
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,186
"Witchcraft attracted
her as a child

133
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,743
"when Zulu tribesmen on
her father's game preserve

134
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,857
tried sorcery to heal
her shriveled leg."

135
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,881
Weaver's in it?

136
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,326
Oh, man, you're cruel.

137
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,951
"Now she aimed her spells at
fellow attending Martin Bean.

138
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,063
"She nightly stirred

139
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,865
"and whispered in
a frenzy of jealousy

140
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,855
and, yes, perhaps a
perverted yearning"?

141
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,891
Yikes.

142
00:05:58,926 --> 00:05:59,926
You know what?

143
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,170
We should be careful with this.

144
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,738
Yeah, people's
feelings could get hurt.

145
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,607
So, how many
copies should I make?

146
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:05,841
Yeah, a lot.

147
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,377
That LOL in curtain
one's still waiting.

148
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,333
I'll get it.

149
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,346
Water cannot wash away prophecy.

150
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,415
Still, we'll start
with a shower.

151
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,950
Those who minister
to the anointed

152
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,440
must shun the flesh of pigs,

153
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,275
refuse the carnal
touch of any man.

154
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,377
No meat, no men...
I'm your woman.

155
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,346
And all we know
will crumble unto dust

156
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,347
and the face...

157
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,459
Did you call Psych?

158
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,950
They're on their way.

159
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,285
You shouldn't play
into their delusions.

160
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,820
I was telling the truth.

161
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,221
The world is delusion,

162
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,325
and truth shall rain upon
thee with fists of thunder!

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,993
Okay, let's go take a bath.

164
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,061
Rejoice, lost man.

165
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,395
Chaos is your destiny.

166
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,796
I am the prophet...

167
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,443
Carol, I'll be in
curtain area one.

168
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,966
Okay.

169
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:44,819
Good.

170
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,821
I thought I was late.

171
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:48,323
You are.

172
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:49,891
Dr. Coburn's later.

173
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,460
Oh.

174
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,595
So, how you doing?

175
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,064
I'm glad to be out of the house.

176
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,132
Yeah, I know.

177
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,333
How was the cab ride?

178
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,413
You know, I would
have picked you up.

179
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,148
The cab ride was fine;
I'm fine, Peter, I'm fine.

180
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,606
The Lamaze class... You
were able to reschedule it?

181
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,309
I did, but I'm not going
to need you to be there.

182
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,977
You're fired.

183
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,495
What are you talking about?

184
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,331
Peter, I cannot work with you.

185
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,467
The way you bark orders at me?

186
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,718
"20 seconds! Blow!"

187
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,753
Uh-uh. Please.

188
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:20,388
Nah. No, no, no, no, no.

189
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:21,856
You're going to scare this baby.

190
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,392
He's not going to
want to come out.

191
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,961
Carla, look, I didn't
make up the drills.

192
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:30,798
Well, I'm planning on a
birth, not a military maneuver.

193
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,895
Folks, I'm sorry,
but Dr. Coburn's

194
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,152
been called into
another delivery.

195
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,338
She's going to be delayed

196
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,922
at least another hour.

197
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,924
Oh, damn!

198
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,358
Peter, it's okay.

199
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,760
I know you're working.

200
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,840
Yeah, but I wanted to ask her

201
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,190
about your iron supplement.

202
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,299
Go save a life.

203
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,818
Okay.

204
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,987
Um... I'll call you later, okay?

205
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:57,836
Are you kidding?
Look at all the typos.

206
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,328
You think I'd put out
something so sloppy?

207
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:01,374
Sorry.

208
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,964
I'm going to Rachel's
school for a conference.

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,132
I'll be back...

210
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,734
It's only in a couple
inches of water.

211
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,002
So he puts on his waders...

212
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,349
But you're still sitting sweet?

213
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,606
Oh, yeah, two under after 15.

214
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,608
Is Doug's fellowship
in question again?

215
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,421
No, he's just angling an invite

216
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:16,922
to play golf at Fair Oaks.

217
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:18,424
Anspaugh's a member there.

218
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:20,882
Dr. Ross has gone
to the dark side.

219
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,061
Help! I need help.

220
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,696
I'm looking for the
Emergency Room.

221
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,852
You found it.

222
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:26,565
My daughter's leg
was cut with a saw.

223
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,666
She's bleeding a lot.

224
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,623
I'm Dr. Greene.

225
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,790
Why don't you come this way?

226
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,537
Call Doyle. Have her
meet us in Trauma 1.

227
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,028
I thought you were leaving.

228
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,029
I am soon.

229
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:35,497
It's not that bad, Daddy.

230
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:37,743
This is why girls
shouldn't take Shop.

231
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,844
But it was Jim
Rentschler who did it.

232
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:39,800
I'm going to take a look at it.

233
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,302
Jeanie, I got your message.

234
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:42,882
You didn't need to come down.

235
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:44,066
It's my pleasure.
I called last night.

236
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,239
You didn't pick up.

237
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,240
I got in late.

238
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,242
I need to ask a favor.

239
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,259
Shoot.

240
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,206
Dr. Kramer in the AIDS Clinic

241
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,730
is doing a trial study
of nucleoside analogs.

242
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,593
Are they still
looking for subjects?

243
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,285
Jeanie, are you having
trouble with your meds?

244
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,315
No. I'm fine... Knock wood.

245
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,205
That's a relief. Want
to have dinner tonight?

246
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,340
I can't.

247
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,687
You'll tell me if I
should stop asking.

248
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,012
Yeah. I have someone I'd
like to recommend for the trial.

249
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,125
I'll make sure any
patient you recommend

250
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,349
gets an interview,

251
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,596
and I'll flag their file
if they fit the protocol.

252
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,920
That's wonderful,
but it's not a patient.

253
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,196
Actually, it's my ex, Al.

254
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,292
I'll get him an
interview this afternoon.

255
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,760
Thanks.

256
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,909
<i>Irrigate. Debride.</i>

257
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,911
Single-layer closure
with 4-0 nylon.

258
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,979
Sounds right.

259
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,680
You're lucky it
didn't cut deeper.

260
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,515
Was she talking
about stitches, Doctor?

261
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,572
That's right.

262
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,285
You're in good
hands with Dr. Doyle.

263
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,475
Are you going someplace?

264
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,021
Yeah, I'm not on duty right now.

265
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,622
You're leaving
us with a student?

266
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,757
Dr. Doyle is an intern.

267
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,159
This is a simple skin repair.

268
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,027
Another attending
will consult with her

269
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,395
if there are any problems.

270
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,629
There's already a problem.
I don't really want an intern.

271
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,864
I don't want my daughter

272
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,499
to end up with a
scar on her leg.

273
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,840
Am I going to have a scar?

274
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,840
A small one.

275
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,208
But I'm a majorette!

276
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,910
Get a plastic surgeon down here.

277
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,446
Mr. Gunther, we don't
consult plastic surgeons

278
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,026
for lacerations of this kind.

279
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,683
Well, for God's sakes, don't
stick us with a student doctor.

280
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:03,879
I am an emergency

281
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,053
medicine resident.

282
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:06,733
You're learning
on the job, dear.

283
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:08,100
This is a teaching facility

284
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:09,502
and a county hospital.

285
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,593
If you want to investigate
a plastic surgeon

286
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,105
on your own, that's your right.

287
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,496
Oh, like I can afford that.

288
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,108
Dr. Doyle is fully qualified

289
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,565
for this kind of repair.

290
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,779
I'm running late,
so I'm leaving now.

291
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,914
You're not the only one
that's leaving, Dr. Greene.

292
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:23,421
Alyssa, get your shoes on.

293
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,618
My daughter's injury
may be nothing to you,

294
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,119
but I bet if it were your kid,

295
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,854
you'd make sure
she got the best!

296
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,712
Yeah, whatever you
think, Mr. Gunther.

297
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,324
Yeah, great. Just walk away!

298
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:34,015
I owe you one, Kerry.

299
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,327
Don't worry. I got it.

300
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,617
Give a damn, Doctor!

301
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,098
Is this going to
put me to sleep?

302
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:42,490
No, this is just for I.V.
access, Mr. Twomey.

303
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,091
They won't start the anesthesia

304
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,393
till you get to the OR.

305
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,773
Good, because I was hoping

306
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:49,074
I could see my sister
before I went under.

307
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:52,350
It's a great thing you're
doing, giving her a kidney.

308
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,085
She practically raised me.

309
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,253
Our family wasn't
too interested,

310
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,724
and... then she got lupus, and
she's been through so much,

311
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,176
you know, with dialysis and all.

312
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:03,428
Hang on a second.

313
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,745
This might be her.

314
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:05,346
Jean Twomey?

315
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:05,780
Yeah?

316
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:06,297
Got someone here

317
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,866
who wants to see you.

318
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,667
Oh, my God!

319
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,687
He is going to bug me

320
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:15,105
until the last minute, isn't he?

321
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,741
If I can.

322
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,759
Change of heart, crybaby?

323
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,094
Of course not.

324
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,707
I already offered him my stereo

325
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:22,914
in a trade.

326
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,527
A stereo for a kidney? No.

327
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,062
You're going to have to
throw in the jet ski, too.

328
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,053
Okay. As long as that settles it

329
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,523
and I am not beholden
to my kid brother

330
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,090
for the rest of my life.

331
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,170
Does this sound fair
to you, Dr. Carter?

332
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,061
Hey, fair and square.

333
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,397
All right, it's a deal, then.

334
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,733
Deal.

335
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,103
Are you going to
be with my brother?

336
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,872
I sure am.

337
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,373
Well, take care of him.

338
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,309
He's a wimp.

339
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,966
Excuse me.

340
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:00,001
I'm looking for a head doctor.

341
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,002
Which one?

342
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,588
Bald, white guy, little glasses.

343
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,934
Dr. Greene... He's not here.

344
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,907
What do you need?

345
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,825
Well, a few weeks ago,

346
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,294
he took care of my brother.

347
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,679
Now I got this.

348
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:14,532
Yeah, you're going
to have to take this

349
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,346
to the third floor, past
reception to the East Wing.

350
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,986
They can help you there.

351
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,288
Thank you.

352
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,290
<i>The secret to putting,</i>

353
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,625
since you didn't ask,

354
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,638
is you got to change your focus.

355
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,373
These machines are for idiots.

356
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,108
Anybody can sink the same shot

357
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,343
over and over again.

358
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,199
I'm really getting
hooked on this.

359
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,269
You know, I think Randi
has a hidden talent.

360
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:35,914
She said she didn't write it.

361
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,572
Well, a nurse didn't write it.

362
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,707
Nurses go home
too tired to write, so...

363
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:40,953
Maybe a doctor did.

364
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,277
No, the medicine's too cheesy.

365
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,912
She has got you down:

366
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:48,282
"The suave resident
cocked his head boyishly

367
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:50,751
"and winked... a quick wink,

368
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:51,970
"almost a reflex.

369
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,471
"She trembled, her resolve

370
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,471
crumbling."

371
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,973
Who's he winking at?

372
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,124
Huh?

373
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,771
My character...
Who's he winking at?

374
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:02,296
Oh, you know, a lot of these
characters are just made up.

375
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,648
Douglas, there you are.

376
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,727
Hey, Donald, how are you?

377
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,584
Listen, I'm glad to see
you're not swamped.

378
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,552
I need your help.

379
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,831
Yeah, okay, sure, absolutely.

380
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:09,820
Do you mind?

381
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,221
No. Here, go ahead.

382
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,491
Listen, I just got a phone
call from a friend of mine...

383
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,694
P.K. Palmer, of the
railroad Palmers?

384
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,940
Sure, yeah.

385
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,007
Oh, damn it.

386
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,950
You know, I know P.K.
from the club, of course...

387
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:26,320
A hell of a guy, a two handicap.

388
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:28,100
Yeah.

389
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,690
You know, this
floor must be sloped.

390
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,092
Yeah, it slopes.

391
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:33,355
Anyhow, P.K. just called

392
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,539
from Hilton Head.

393
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,164
He's down there with his missus.

394
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,699
Seems their little one
stayed home with the nanny

395
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,734
and took a spill...
Could be a fracture.

396
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,403
Their pediatrician's
out of town,

397
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,078
and he called me and
asked for a referral.

398
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:45,584
Well, have his
nanny bring him in.

399
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:46,774
They're on their way.

400
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,726
There we go, right in the heart.

401
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,011
Anyway, the parents
are flying home now.

402
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,513
I promised them

403
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,193
that their son
would get the best.

404
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:55,861
I'll take good care of him.

405
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:56,885
By the way,

406
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,119
if you're interested,
you couldn't ask

407
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:02,289
for a better recommendation
to Fair Oaks than P.K.'s.

408
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,503
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

409
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:07,228
Fair Oaks is one of the, oh...

410
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,064
25 best courses in the country.

411
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,967
Really? Well, maybe you
could take me as your guest.

412
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,369
You don't play golf.

413
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,048
Oh, well, that's a good thing,

414
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,950
because they
don't allow women...

415
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,206
or blacks.

416
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:20,486
Jews either.

417
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,243
No, I think they changed that.

418
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,244
Nope.

419
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,928
Pretty sure they changed that.

420
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,353
Hey.

421
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,488
Hello.

422
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:36,290
Chris Law.

423
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:38,976
My brother was Kenny.

424
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,311
Yeah, I remember.

425
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,312
How you doing?

426
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,379
Not so good.

427
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,648
My mother got this yesterday...

428
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,949
A $19,000 bill

429
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,237
from a hospital
that killed her son.

430
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:51,672
My mother doesn't
have insurance.

431
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,592
I'm sure the Billing
Department can...

432
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,822
What? Be happy to
make a payment schedule?

433
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,841
See, they don't understand

434
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,643
that my mother,
who pays every bill,

435
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,812
is not going to pay
one penny of that one.

436
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,002
She's not going to
pay because, well...

437
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,282
I'm telling her that
that bill's a mistake,

438
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,583
that you don't get bills

439
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,302
from people who kill your child.

440
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,994
You don't pay people
who lose your son's body

441
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,174
between their morgue
and the coroner

442
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,298
so that you have to postpone
a funeral for two days.

443
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,735
I'm sorry. I had no
idea that that happened.

444
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,453
Nobody has any idea,

445
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,706
but you tell them
that she doesn't get

446
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:29,426
another piece of mail
from this hospital...

447
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,412
unless it's an apology.

448
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:35,683
I'm very sorry for your loss.

449
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,903
I'm not threatening to sue...

450
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,506
because I'm sure you have

451
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,541
a department for that, too.

452
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:47,245
But if my mother
gets another bill

453
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,506
from this hospital,

454
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,198
maybe I'm going
to kick some ass.

455
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:53,584
Maybe I'll start with yours.

456
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,070
If it were me, I'd
report it to security.

457
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,171
He was just blowing off steam.

458
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,273
He had a good point, actually.

459
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,195
I called the morgue,

460
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,642
and they did mix
up the body transfer.

461
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,598
How's Rachel?

462
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,432
That's the good news...

463
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,367
She's doing a lot better.

464
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,879
She'll be Marco Polo
in the school play.

465
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,869
Save me a seat.

466
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,215
They didn't have chocolate chip.

467
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,204
It's chocolate.

468
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,817
Okay, thanks. Hey,
aren't you in there with me?

469
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,152
Lydia's on it... One
RN per collarbone,

470
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,186
even for the country club set.

471
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,288
Who's getting the VIP treatment?

472
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,889
I get yogurt for kids
when they have to wait.

473
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,057
All right.

474
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,866
I've got some chocolate yogurt

475
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,368
for the big guy with
the sore clavicle.

476
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,703
Thank you very much.

477
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,982
You're very welcome.

478
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,550
You want to see why it hurts?

479
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,552
Yeah? Here, hop down.

480
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,555
Will you give me ice
and a sling please, Lydia?

481
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,945
Be right back.

482
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:40,381
There's his anomalous
left renal vein

483
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,383
posterior to the aorta.

484
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,920
Can you see that, Dr. Carter?

485
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:47,155
Yes.

486
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,639
We're standing by.

487
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,758
Houston, do you read me?

488
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,443
Loud and clear.

489
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,645
This is very cool.

490
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,430
Our first time

491
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:57,365
on intercom.

492
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,417
We usually have a nurse
running back and forth

493
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,520
between the donor
and the recipient.

494
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,072
Ready for countdown, Fin?

495
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,574
Ready and waiting.

496
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,342
Clock starts.

497
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:11,161
And why does it become
interesting now, Dr. Carter?

498
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,331
You want to monitor
your ischemic time.

499
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,450
Bingo. I'm lifting
the kidney out.

500
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,338
Basin, please.

501
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,773
Ever pass the baton
in a relay, Dr. Carter?

502
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,608
Ran the 440 in high school.

503
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,344
Good. Perfusate.

504
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,245
Good.

505
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,563
That's it.

506
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,083
Well, Dr. Carter...
don't get lost.

507
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,604
Dr. Carter is
bringing the kidney

508
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,888
your way, gentlemen.

509
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,218
Oh, my God.

510
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:40,574
Is there a problem, Dr. Benton?

511
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,593
No, no. Not at all.

512
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,229
Somebody want to sign for this?

513
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,042
What's your name, Doctor?

514
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,216
John Carter.

515
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,644
Well, John Carter,
why don't you scrub in?

516
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,735
You can join us

517
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,086
for the second act.

518
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,453
Great.

519
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,961
You see this line right here?

520
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,362
Hey, come here.

521
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:03,642
Take a look.

522
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,965
See that?

523
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,478
You know what that is?

524
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,480
That is your first broken bone.

525
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,815
You're officially a man.

526
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,172
I shouldn't have let him

527
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,307
talk me out of
bringing him last night.

528
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,641
He said it didn't hurt.

529
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,788
Because he's such a tough guy.

530
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:17,622
Because he didn't
want to get in trouble.

531
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:20,047
He's not supposed to
play outside after dark.

532
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:22,316
It's tough to stay in
when it's this warm.

533
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,151
My mom says I'll get hurt.

534
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,664
She does? What
does your dad say?

535
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,653
I'm a klutz.

536
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,988
He does?

537
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,090
P.K. gets a lot of
bumps and scrapes.

538
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,837
His father's quite
an athlete, you know.

539
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,327
You fall down a lot?

540
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,996
Yeah, I'm not supposed
to let him run around

541
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,331
without watching.

542
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,678
Listen, you and I
play a game, okay?

543
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,346
I'm going to cover my eye.

544
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,837
You do the same thing.

545
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,806
You cover your own eye.

546
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:47,558
Okay, ready? Now, tell
me if you can see my finger.

547
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,061
Tell me when you see it.

548
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,063
Don't do that. Don't look.

549
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,158
Look straight ahead.

550
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:54,226
Cover your eye.

551
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,410
There you go.

552
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,053
Okay.

553
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:01,989
See it?

554
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:03,324
I see it.

555
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,626
Good.

556
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,913
Good.

557
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,766
Okay. Let's try the
other eye, okay?

558
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,039
So, you found it, huh?

559
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,040
Certainly did.

560
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,509
How much have you read?

561
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,210
I've gotten past the part

562
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,056
where the "alpha
bitch attending"

563
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,348
goes to a faith healer
to cure her limp.

564
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:31,352
The seduction scene
after that is... is really hot.

565
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,854
Really?

566
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,700
I don't think whoever wrote
it was being mean-spirited.

567
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:36,568
It's just a sleazy romance...
Tongue in cheek, you know?

568
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,619
You got to take it that way.

569
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,088
Sounds like you got into it.

570
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,244
Yeah, it's kind of a hoot.

571
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,647
I think it's meant to be.

572
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,650
Oh, my God, Kerry, you wrote it.

573
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,651
I did not.

574
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,652
You did, too.

575
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,964
Why would I waste my time?

576
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,288
Well, for the money.

577
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,856
I mean, there's a big
market for this kind of thing.

578
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,959
Too bad I didn't write it.

579
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,960
Hey, somebody!

580
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,545
I need help now.

581
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,747
Is this the ALOC 57 called in?

582
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,859
He had a stroke.

583
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,917
Why aren't you in uniform?

584
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,317
Day off.

585
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:05,363
It's okay, Gramps,
we're here now.

586
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,353
You'll be okay.

587
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:07,432
Take it easy, Pam, we got him.

588
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,466
He had a stroke, I know it.

589
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,389
Okay, okay.

590
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,936
We had acute stroke
training last week.

591
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,926
I did the SAS test on him.

592
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:12,993
Slow down.

593
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,878
He's got one-sided weakness.

594
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,625
I went by to take
him grocery shopping.

595
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,948
I always go by on my day off.

596
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,132
Give me the bullet.

597
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:20,946
73-year-old
African-American male,

598
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,102
ALOC, slurred speech.

599
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,115
Loss of motion on the left side.

600
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,283
He's never been sick before.

601
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,273
Vitals?

602
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,452
BP 175/100.

603
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,776
I didn't have a cuff.

604
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,777
Pulse was 140.

605
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,289
When did you find him?

606
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,390
20 minutes ago. I
called it in right away.

607
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,292
We were closer to Mercy, but
Pam insisted on coming here.

608
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,015
Why?

609
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:35,783
I knew you'd set up

610
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,462
a new treatment
program for stroke.

611
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,497
Call Dr. Greene.

612
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,121
How's the time, Dr. Carter?

613
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,800
You're at 43 minutes.

614
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,525
And anastomosis is completed.

615
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,795
Dr. Benton, why don't you
remove the DeBakey clamps?

616
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,497
Can everybody see in here?

617
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,800
Okay.

618
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,468
It's pinking up.

619
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,137
Look at that.

620
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,471
Wow.

621
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,473
Yeah, that's what I live for...

622
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,791
The sight of urine flowing.

623
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,637
Hey, Fin, we've
got trouble in here.

624
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,961
What is it?

625
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,012
Our donor's hemorrhaging.

626
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:06,997
Pressure's falling.
He's tachycardiac.

627
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,610
Sounds like a tie slipped off.

628
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,800
The renal artery?

629
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:10,767
That'd be my guess.

630
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:11,601
Let's open him up.

631
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,881
He's losing blood fast.

632
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,166
Get me a tonsil clamp.

633
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,168
Okay, people, let's
stay in the game.

634
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,858
We got to close here.

635
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,655
Is that pedes
ophthalmologist still in 3?

636
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,823
He's got a bunch of messages.

637
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:22,746
Yeah, he's finishing up.

638
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,080
Ophthalmologist?

639
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,750
You really are giving that
boy the million-dollar work-up.

640
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,751
What do you mean?

641
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,185
I guess if you're a Palmer,

642
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,288
you get the full
treatment around here.

643
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,857
You think I'd put a kid
through unnecessary tests

644
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,526
just to impress his family?

645
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,860
I guess not.

646
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,607
You were right...
Retinitis pigmentosa.

647
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,863
He's going blind.

648
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,565
I was afraid of that.

649
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,412
All right. His parents
are on their way.

650
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,863
They'll want to
hear all the options.

651
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,420
Possible brain attack?

652
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:49,256
Yes. This is Paramedic
Olbes's grandfather.

653
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,592
Let's get a CBC, PT, PTT,

654
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:53,427
platelet count, fibrinogen.

655
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:54,928
Type and cross four units.

656
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:57,098
Team's on alert.
Malik, record the BP.

657
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,599
Stick of glucose.

658
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:00,612
Alert Radiology
that we're coming in

659
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,603
for a noncontrast head CT.

660
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,288
BP's 185/110.

661
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,357
I.V. labetalol... 15 migs.

662
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,792
Sir, do you know where you are?

663
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,138
Are you going to
be able to help him?

664
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,212
What's his name?

665
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,192
Ralph, but everybody
calls him Gramps.

666
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:16,567
Hey, Gramps. Gramps, can
you tell me what happened?

667
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,638
Sir, can you squeeze my hand?

668
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:21,972
Can you squeeze?

669
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,141
Was he complaining
of any headaches?

670
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,726
No, I talked to him last night.

671
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,561
Nausea, vomiting?

672
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,578
No.

673
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,147
Is your grandfather
on any medications?

674
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,164
No.

675
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,633
Does he take aspirin?

676
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:33,917
No, he hates pills.

677
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,502
Are you going to give him TPA?

678
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:37,482
That's what he needs, right?

679
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,640
That's what we're
trying to assess.

680
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,742
Do you know when
the symptoms began?

681
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,827
No.

682
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,972
Do you know anybody who might?

683
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,040
Maybe his neighbor.

684
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,775
They walk to get their
papers in the morning.

685
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,365
Can you give them a call?

686
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,683
Go, go.

687
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,318
CT's ready for us.

688
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:52,664
All right, let's
get him upstairs.

689
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:54,321
Mark, this is what
I was afraid of

690
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,823
with the stroke team.

691
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:57,825
People have heard
there's a miracle cure.

692
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,660
They don't understand the risks.

693
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:01,328
I understand the risks.

694
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:03,831
I've seen patients
hemorrhage with TPA.

695
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:04,998
It's no cure-all.

696
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,678
That's why we follow protocol.

697
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:08,201
The results aren't convincing.

698
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:10,771
Look, Kerry, I understand
that you have reservations,

699
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,441
so that's why I'm on the
stroke team and you're not.

700
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,708
Fine.

701
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:17,377
But if she can't clarify
the onset of symptoms...

702
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:18,712
I'd be a fool

703
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:20,028
to give TPA.

704
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,488
It's just an interview.

705
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:30,669
They're going to ask me
a bunch of nosy questions.

706
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:31,992
Well, they have to make sure

707
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,493
they're getting
reliable candidates.

708
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,340
That's what makes me nervous.

709
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,509
I don't deserve all this help.

710
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,666
Everyone deserves
help from their friends.

711
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:41,001
Friends, huh?

712
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:43,670
It reminds me of
when we first met...

713
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:45,172
Before we even started dating.

714
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,685
No, we were never friends.

715
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,687
I always had my eye on you,

716
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:50,845
wondering when I
could make my move.

717
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,179
See, you're a good liar.

718
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:53,942
You'll do fine in the interview.

719
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,977
The CT confirmed
an ischemic stroke,

720
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,301
and Gramps' neighbor
was able to verify

721
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,314
that he had no
symptoms two hours ago,

722
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,973
so he's easily within
the 180-minute range.

723
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,976
Mark, if you're looking
for my blessing on this,

724
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,310
forget it.

725
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,980
Actually, I was hoping
you could talk to Olbes.

726
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,315
She's heard from the
neurologist and from me

727
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,996
that we think her grandfather
is a candidate for TPA.

728
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,988
I'd like her to hear
about the risks from you.

729
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,289
Why?

730
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,368
I happen to believe

731
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,221
that he'll respond
to thrombolysis,

732
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:23,922
but if I'm wrong, he could die.

733
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:26,096
She needs to hear
that loud and clear.

734
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,447
You want me to tell her?

735
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:29,144
Who better than a
respected colleague

736
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,212
who's on the other
side of the fence?

737
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,264
I suspect you
won't soft-pedal it.

738
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:34,321
I won't.

739
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:35,322
Mark...

740
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:36,740
thank you.

741
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,466
How's he doing?

742
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:48,868
Looks like they got the
bleeding under control.

743
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,470
They're starting to close.

744
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:51,783
Wow, this is a first.

745
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:53,451
Usually, Keith has had a shower

746
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,136
by the time I get finished.

747
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,138
Would you gentlemen
care to join us

748
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,640
for the post-game wrap-up?

749
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,798
We find that
debriefing can be useful

750
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,644
when there's been
a complication.

751
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,634
Uh... yes.

752
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,969
We'd be honored.

753
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,638
Dr. Benton, you had a
call from Carla Reese.

754
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,306
Would you like the number?

755
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,307
No, I got it.

756
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,642
Carter, coming?

757
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,261
Hey, Shirley, can you call
Recovery, ask them to page me

758
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:15,629
when Jean Twomey wakes up?

759
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:16,764
Sure.

760
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,477
Dr. Kramer, I was wondering

761
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,779
if I could interview
this candidate.

762
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:21,935
Al Boulet?

763
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,437
You know him?

764
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:25,801
No, but I'm familiar
with his treatment.

765
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,953
I'm curious to
see what he's like.

766
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:29,476
Be my guest.

767
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,462
I'm Dr. Fischer.

768
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,797
Thanks for taking the time

769
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,799
to fill out all these forms.

770
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,468
I thought I was
meeting a Dr. Kramer.

771
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,970
I'm helping him out.

772
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,972
All the information
looks complete.

773
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,974
You mention a couple of slip-ups

774
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,143
with your drug
regimen in the past.

775
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:49,113
There were so many
pills to keep track of.

776
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,126
I've got it under control now.

777
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,782
You began treatment a year ago.

778
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,284
That's right.

779
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,530
You contracted AIDS through...?

780
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,522
Heterosexual contact, I guess...

781
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,726
I mean, since I never shot
up or had sex with a guy.

782
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:05,445
Uh-huh. But you were unable

783
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,581
to identify the partner
who infected you.

784
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:10,617
No, no. I contacted
all the women I could...

785
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,103
to let them know, you know.

786
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,805
No one had any prior infection.

787
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:20,394
But it was a lot of years
and a lot of women.

788
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,462
Now you live alone?

789
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,363
Right.

790
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:24,798
Well, that's the only factor

791
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,451
that mitigates against
your inclusion in the trial.

792
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,153
Those who
participate must adhere

793
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,287
to a strict regimen.

794
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,106
Ideally, participants would
have someone to back them up.

795
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:35,058
I'm sure I can handle it.

796
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,462
And I have backup.

797
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:42,616
My ex-wife is around off and on.

798
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,085
Off and on?

799
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,898
A lot recently.

800
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:50,073
I mean, she's, uh...
kind of back in my life...

801
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,428
Stays over and all.

802
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:53,777
She's a physician assistant.

803
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,413
She'll keep on me...
Make me stick to it.

804
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,114
I see.

805
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,533
I mean, once Jeanie
takes something on,

806
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,089
she doesn't mess around.

807
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:08,469
Ten migs TPA over one minute.

808
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,795
Follow with 50 milligrams
over the next hour

809
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,798
for a total dosage of 60 migs.

810
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,433
Monitor his vital signs

811
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,436
and maintain a
diastolic of under 110.

812
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,938
Now we wait?

813
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,473
Now we wait.

814
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,947
In retrospect, studying
Mr. Twomey's renal angiogram,

815
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,460
we might have predicted
a potential problem.

816
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,452
Yeah, with the angiogram
and a crystal ball, maybe.

817
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,122
No, no. Look at
the short renal vein.

818
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,477
Do you appreciate
that, Dr. Benton?

819
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,144
I think Dr. Fecteau is
being hard on himself.

820
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:46,157
How did we do on ischemic time?

821
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:47,509
We can do better.

822
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,511
Yeah, we could do
better if you weren't

823
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,712
so chintzy with the ureter.

824
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,864
Let's go step by step.

825
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,933
Now, I lost time
dividing the vein.

826
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:56,435
Well, our biggest deviation

827
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,892
was anastomosis... 41 minutes.

828
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,589
Yeah, so? What are you
saying? We weren't working...

829
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,579
Of course she denied it,

830
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,626
but I could tell it was true.

831
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,949
I bet she wrote it

832
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,951
when she had all that free time.

833
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,297
Yeah, when she
was on suspension?

834
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,699
Carol, did you get that history

835
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,022
from the abdominal pain

836
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,707
in Exam 2? Yep.

837
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,863
What?

838
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,365
You little slut.

839
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,265
What?

840
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,250
I see you in a whole new light.

841
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,652
We know you wrote the book.

842
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,238
I didn't write it.

843
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,551
You ought to be proud of it.

844
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,058
Kerry, did you tell them...?

845
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:32,904
She wrote the book.

846
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,411
Yeah. Nice try.

847
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,790
Like I'd make
myself the villain?

848
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,047
I knew it was you.

849
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,815
I didn't do it.

850
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,233
You thought it was Jeanie.

851
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:41,668
Or Carol. I mean, I knew it was

852
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,703
an incurable romantic
who was very warped.

853
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,472
I'm not warped.

854
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,426
This is cool.

855
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,995
Watch it! The big spinout!

856
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,313
Baby!

857
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:54,848
Look out for the folks, baby.

858
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:56,183
Hit the button.

859
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:57,545
Hit the down button. Hop up.

860
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,531
Listen, I know you've been given

861
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:01,249
a lot of information.

862
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,939
This is kind of a tough time.

863
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,941
There are a lot of
new interventions.

864
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,276
P.K.'s doctor will be able

865
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,244
to fill you in on those, though.

866
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,579
I like Dr. Ross.

867
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,914
We all do, sweetie.

868
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,182
Well, I like you, too, buddy.

869
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,685
Make sure you keep these
glasses on for me, okay?

870
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,652
Hey...

871
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,921
where's your sweater?

872
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,739
I know where I left it.

873
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:21,419
All right, let's
get that sweater.

874
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,343
Go get it.

875
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,239
One thing you need
to be careful about is,

876
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,430
you have to make sure

877
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,949
that he doesn't feel like
he's been bad in any way.

878
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:31,501
Sometimes, kids with RP...
They feel like it's their fault.

879
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,987
Well, we'll be careful of that.

880
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,305
Thank you, Doctor.

881
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,640
Okay? All right. Great. Thanks.

882
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:37,975
Thank you.

883
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,575
Bye, you guys.

884
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,509
There you go!

885
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,410
No holding you back!

886
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,411
Bye.

887
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,746
Bye-bye.

888
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,726
You know, some
people think of RP

889
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,494
as looking through a telescope.

890
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,263
It's a good way to think of it.

891
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,254
Doug, I owe you an apology.

892
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,432
Oh, forget it.

893
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,756
No, I was wrong.

894
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:55,425
I have no reason to ever
question your integrity.

895
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,772
As a doctor, at least.

896
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,762
Everything's so glib
with you these days.

897
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,108
You know, I don't
know you anymore.

898
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,498
I don't know what
matters to you.

899
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,644
Me either.

900
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,711
Great job, Carol.

901
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,080
Did you know she wrote the book?

902
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,248
Wrote the book? Are you kidding?

903
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,871
She stole the idea from me.

904
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,856
I did not write the damn book!

905
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,092
Welcome back.

906
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,397
You're doing well.

907
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,232
Why isn't Carl here?

908
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:21,068
Nobody will tell me anything.

909
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:23,081
He's still under anesthesia.

910
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:24,737
Why? What went wrong?

911
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:26,440
Your brother's fine.

912
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:27,752
There were some complications...

913
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:29,409
Some bleeding...

914
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:31,744
And they had to
open him back up.

915
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,714
Oh, no. I was afraid
of something like this.

916
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,261
Jean, he's stabilized.

917
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:37,433
He's fine.

918
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:41,054
I wouldn't tell you
that if it wasn't true.

919
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,216
In fact, I'm going to go see

920
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,818
if they can move
him in here with you.

921
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,625
And I'll stay with him

922
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,272
until he wakes up.

923
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,428
Okay? Yeah?

924
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:49,880
Great.

925
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:50,897
Any response?

926
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,898
Not yet.

927
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,411
You seen Dr. Greene?

928
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,767
You just missed him.

929
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,904
Dr. Ross, I'd like you

930
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,906
to meet a new resident,
Anna Del Amico.

931
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,041
This is our pedes
fellow, Doug Ross.

932
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,176
My pleasure.

933
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:04,144
Mutual.

934
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:05,479
So, you're starting early.

935
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:06,657
I'm doing

936
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:07,725
an emergency pedes elective

937
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:09,749
before my residency
starts in July.

938
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,701
We always welcomes
slave labor in Pedes.

939
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,387
Okay, I'll show you around.

940
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:14,771
Dr. Del Amico

941
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,122
is a pediatrician.

942
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:18,136
She's double-boarding
in emergency medicine.

943
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,260
Great. What we
need around here...

944
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,812
More overachievers.

945
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,413
There you are.

946
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,081
Hi. Can you believe it?

947
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,428
I'm actually getting
out of here on time.

948
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,751
Al qualifies for the trial.

949
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,387
He should read
over this material

950
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,056
and then come in Tuesday
to pick up his meds.

951
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,402
Shouldn't you tell Al this?

952
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,393
We left him a
message, but I figured

953
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,406
you'd probably
be seeing him first.

954
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,729
Greg, what's going on?

955
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,409
You know, I've been
asking myself that question

956
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,743
for the last two months.

957
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,745
I thought that I was
pretty honest with you,

958
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,414
that I understood
all the reasons

959
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:47,737
you might be hesitant

960
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,083
about getting
seriously involved.

961
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,073
I guess I missed one.

962
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,541
Greg, I don't know
what you think...

963
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,920
I<i> think</i> that you're
still involved

964
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:53,809
with your ex-husband.

965
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:54,989
After the way he treated you,

966
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,090
he can still manipulate you

967
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,425
into getting him
the latest meds.

968
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,689
He did not manipulate me, Greg.

969
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,997
But you do still love him.

970
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:03,937
I don't know.

971
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:18,885
Dr. Greene, can I
ask you something?

972
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,554
Sure.

973
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,233
You ever think Carol Hathaway

974
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:24,524
might be interested
in me at all?

975
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,971
I mean, did you ever
pick up on anything?

976
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,145
Uh... no.

977
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,730
No, I can't say that I have.

978
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:34,234
You haven't read
her book, have you?

979
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,202
What book?

980
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:38,655
Uh... Carol wrote a book.

981
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,745
There's some parts about
me that are pretty flattering.

982
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:48,682
She say anything about me?

983
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,564
It seemed a little amateurish.

984
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,010
Really?

985
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,000
I was impressed.

986
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,603
I didn't read too much
of it, just a few pages.

987
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:00,982
Oh, you've got to
give it a chance.

988
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,284
Reading good trash is
like reading Shakespeare.

989
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,357
Oh?

990
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:06,437
You got to get into the rhythm.

991
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,756
But, hey, don't
take my word for it.

992
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,347
Chuny, didn't you think that
Carol's book was pretty decent?

993
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,011
The part I read was racist.

994
00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:14,145
Don't tell Carol I said that.

995
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:15,446
You didn't like
the Latina nurse?

996
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,403
It wasn't real.

997
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:17,420
I got to go.

998
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,539
I didn't think the
ethnic characters

999
00:34:19,575 --> 00:34:21,775
were handled differently
than anything else.

1000
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,921
I don't know.

1001
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:24,243
Have you seen Mark?

1002
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:26,023
Gramps' blood
pressure is coming down.

1003
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:27,347
That's a good sign.

1004
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:29,482
No, I was looking for him, too.

1005
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:35,988
Look who's here.

1006
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,393
Hey.

1007
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:43,129
You did it.

1008
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,466
<i>You</i> did it.

1009
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,118
Okay, no fighting.

1010
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,853
I did it.

1011
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,220
Dr. Carter.

1012
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,204
They're doing really well, huh?

1013
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,361
Where'd you go?

1014
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,830
I wanted to make sure
they saw each other.

1015
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:03,266
Carter, two of the best
transplant surgeons

1016
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,334
in the country

1017
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,336
let us look over
their shoulders.

1018
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,922
They're debriefing on one of
the most fascinating procedures

1019
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:11,491
you and I ever participated in,
and you just get up and leave.

1020
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,610
Well, I promised the sister.

1021
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,311
I knew she'd be worried.

1022
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,416
Is that a problem?

1023
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:23,903
I don't know.

1024
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:25,166
Another message

1025
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,190
from Carla Reese.

1026
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,136
It's okay. I called her at home

1027
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,425
and got her machine.

1028
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,995
No, she left an
extension... OB, I think.

1029
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,267
I've never lived
anywhere but Philly.

1030
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,117
Kerry, will you take
Dr. Del Amico back?

1031
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,519
I'm intimidated enough already.

1032
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:45,508
Anna, please.

1033
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,188
All right, Anna, welcome aboard.

1034
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,177
Thanks.

1035
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,691
You find a place yet?

1036
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:50,614
No, I don't know Chicago at all.

1037
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,792
I figured I'd look
around this weekend.

1038
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,515
Is there a neighborhood?

1039
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,516
Hey, guys!

1040
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:54,517
Oh, my God!

1041
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:55,518
It's Mark.

1042
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,786
Stabilize his neck.

1043
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,849
Where do I find a C-collar?

1044
00:35:58,873 --> 00:35:59,956
I'll get it.

1045
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,790
You help Doug.

1046
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,025
Hold his neck.

1047
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,622
In-line
stabilization... I got it.

1048
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:06,296
Good breath sounds.

1049
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,663
Good pulse. Is he an ER doc?

1050
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:08,648
Yeah, attending.

1051
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:10,116
Give me the collar, please!

1052
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,601
Mark?!

1053
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,302
Get the board ready.

1054
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,448
Slowly, slowly,

1055
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,549
slowly, okay.

1056
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,006
Here we go.

1057
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,469
Now we're going to roll him.

1058
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:19,476
Nice and easy.

1059
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,978
Just roll him towards me.

1060
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,390
Okay. Slide the board in.

1061
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,414
Nice and gentle.

1062
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,176
Good. That's fine, right there.

1063
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,183
Roll him back.

1064
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,813
Go. Roll. Roll him.

1065
00:36:28,837 --> 00:36:31,103
Gently.

1066
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:32,439
Mark,

1067
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:34,118
you're going to be okay,
buddy. Hang in there.

1068
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:36,459
Okay, let's get him
monitored right away.

1069
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,429
Cross-table C-spine, chest,
CBC, type and hold, dip a urine.

1070
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,442
On my count, we're
going to lift him.

1071
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,743
Got that? Nice and
gentle, real slow.

1072
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,662
You all right, Malik?

1073
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,152
One... two...

1074
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:48,071
three... go.

1075
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,689
Let's go.

1076
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:51,657
Alert CT.

1077
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:52,992
He's vomiting.

1078
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,360
Watch out for aspiration.

1079
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,980
All right, let's roll him.

1080
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,726
What's going on?

1081
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,717
Oh, my God! Mark!

1082
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,246
Pulse is 120, resp's 24,

1083
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,002
BP's 100/60.

1084
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:03,903
What happened?

1085
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:05,082
We need to put him on a mask.

1086
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,038
15 liters.

1087
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:08,375
We need to rule
out a pneumothorax.

1088
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,643
Chuny, aren't you
with the stroke team?

1089
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,644
Yeah, but...

1090
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,979
Go back to your patient.

1091
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:13,980
Kerry, he's...

1092
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:14,981
Go on! Now!

1093
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:15,982
Kerry, come on!

1094
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,684
Get back there.

1095
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,852
Pupils are round

1096
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:19,869
and sluggish,

1097
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,137
react to light.

1098
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,805
Possible hyphema.

1099
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,391
DTR's two plus bilaterally.

1100
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:25,625
Babinski's negative.

1101
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,993
Radiology's on their way.

1102
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,295
Oh, my God, it's true.

1103
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,862
We got some crunchy ribs here.

1104
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:32,365
I'll get this bleeding
under control.

1105
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,366
Who are you?

1106
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:34,550
New resident.

1107
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,851
Guarding and tenderness.

1108
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,554
Abdominal CT?

1109
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,555
You bet.

1110
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,823
Give him the works. Come on!

1111
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,904
She was still in my office
when the contractions started.

1112
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,306
The good news is, her
membrane hasn't ruptured,

1113
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,107
and the baby's not in distress.

1114
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,097
Is she dilated?

1115
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,098
Just two centimeters.

1116
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,145
So I admitted her. I put
her on complete bed rest.

1117
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,231
With some luck, we can keep her

1118
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:54,553
from going into labor.

1119
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:55,855
Thank you, Dr. Coburn.

1120
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,290
You're welcome.

1121
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,927
Hey... Carla.

1122
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,929
Hey.

1123
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:06,599
Dr. Coburn said they
stopped the contractions.

1124
00:38:06,635 --> 00:38:07,783
Mm-hmm.

1125
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:11,154
Do you mind if I sit?

1126
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,538
No.

1127
00:38:12,574 --> 00:38:17,710
So, you, uh... pretty much
have to stay like this, huh?

1128
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:21,881
Exactly like this...

1129
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,883
for eight weeks.

1130
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:26,052
Can I get you anything?

1131
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:28,238
No. Mm-mm.

1132
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,290
No, just sit there...

1133
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:32,325
and entertain me.

1134
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,530
Never mind!

1135
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,132
What? No, no...

1136
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,019
You know, I was...

1137
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,154
wondering about it, and...

1138
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,309
I think I know when
this baby was conceived.

1139
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,560
Yeah.

1140
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,929
Me, too.

1141
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,830
Really?

1142
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,549
Oh, yeah, really.

1143
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,783
You remember that morning?

1144
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,335
Mm-hmm.

1145
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,423
Oh... well...

1146
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,361
seems like a long time ago.

1147
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,798
Yeah, it does.

1148
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,220
"Possible side effects:

1149
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,056
bloating, nausea,
sustained diarrhea..."

1150
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,591
Oh, stop reading that.

1151
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,805
I don't have a single vice left.

1152
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:24,972
Forget beer.

1153
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,974
Sometimes, I'd
double my viral load

1154
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,976
for an old-fashioned
glass of milk.

1155
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,867
I don't mind the soy stuff.

1156
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:33,703
Well, you were
always a pushover.

1157
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,455
Yes, I was.

1158
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,242
And I took it for granted.

1159
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,780
You know what I
miss most about us?

1160
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,067
Hearing you laugh.

1161
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,821
The sound of you
laughing in the dark.

1162
00:39:54,776 --> 00:39:57,177
We both took a lot for granted.

1163
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,615
I don't take anything
for granted anymore.

1164
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,072
I better go.

1165
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:28,775
Sure.

1166
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,992
Or stay.

1167
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,939
On the couch, if you want.

1168
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,764
I don't want to
stay on the couch.

1169
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,098
Then you better go.

1170
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,901
Okay. I'll stay on the couch.

1171
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,235
Me, too.

1172
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,308
Oh, Jeanie...

1173
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,012
Wait. Can you... can
you stay right there?

1174
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,013
I doubt it.

1175
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,313
No...

1176
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,215
I'll be right back.

1177
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:56,252
I don't have a condom
that's not over a year old.

1178
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,387
And I have to have one, right?

1179
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,557
You're right.

1180
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,753
I mean, I could
have a different strain

1181
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:06,946
or a stronger strain than
you, and we need to be safe.

1182
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,531
Uh-huh.

1183
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,011
I'll be two minutes.

1184
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,267
Will you wait?

1185
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,501
Yeah, I'll try.

1186
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:15,538
That's it.

1187
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:20,927
That's what I missed.

1188
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:28,635
Oh...

1189
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,405
CT is negative.

1190
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,571
He was really lucky.

1191
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:33,739
Let's get Ortho

1192
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,752
to take a look at
that broken hand.

1193
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,588
I'll go see what's keeping them.

1194
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:38,577
Any change?

1195
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:39,745
Nobody saw anything?

1196
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,425
I told the cops that
basketball player's brother

1197
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,515
was around earlier.

1198
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,245
A psych guy kind of threatened
Dr. Greene this morning.

1199
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,369
Cops will want
to hear about that.

1200
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,503
Dr. Ross,

1201
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:50,055
that kid with the allergic
reaction is still in Exam 2.

1202
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,235
Oh, I'll take it.

1203
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,459
That's okay. You
don't have to do that.

1204
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:54,327
Can you

1205
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:55,844
rustle me up a lab coat?

1206
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,179
I'll find you one.

1207
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,866
It's usually not this
crazy around here.

1208
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:01,451
Not a problem.

1209
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,269
Dr. Weaver, can
you check this out?

1210
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:04,270
I'll be back.

1211
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:05,449
Keep working, people.

1212
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:07,706
We've still got an ER to run.

1213
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:08,841
What about Rachel?

1214
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:10,176
The sitter called.

1215
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:12,611
She's going to keep
Rachel overnight.

1216
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:16,882
He had an on-the-table
response a few minutes ago.

1217
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,684
His speech is coming back.

1218
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,420
Something... was wrong.

1219
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,887
Yeah, Gramps.

1220
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:23,423
You had a stroke.

1221
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,576
You're going to be better now.

1222
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:29,979
I couldn't... do that.

1223
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,327
He's being admitted upstairs.

1224
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,853
Guess Dr. Greene
made the right call.

1225
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,889
I want to thank him.

1226
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,791
I'll tell him for you.

1227
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,026
He'll be very pleased.

1228
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,481
GCS is still 13.

1229
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:52,596
I know. You just
did a neuro check

1230
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,920
ten minutes ago.

1231
00:42:53,955 --> 00:42:55,221
How's his I.V. rate?

1232
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:56,266
Fine.

1233
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,957
Don't want to overhydrate him.

1234
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,152
That's why I cut it back.

1235
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,160
Yeah, I have him
on 80cc's an hour.

1236
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:02,595
He weighs about 80 kilos...

1237
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,858
Doug, why don't
you go call Ortho,

1238
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:04,991
find out what's keeping them?

1239
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,966
I'm bugging you
that much, right?

1240
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,417
Mm-hmm.

1241
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:09,768
I guess I'll go call Ortho.

1242
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,220
That's a good idea.

1243
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,789
All right.

1244
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:19,228
Doug!

1245
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,231
He's back.

1246
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:25,601
Hey, Mark. Hi.

1247
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,581
You're going to be fine.

1248
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,471
Hey, buddy.

1249
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,374
What happened?

1250
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,428
Well... you got beat
up, but you're okay.

1251
00:43:35,463 --> 00:43:39,064
You got some bruised
ribs and a concussion,

1252
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,217
midshaft fractures
of two metacarpals,

1253
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,097
but other than
that, you're fine.

1254
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,705
I signed you up for a
double shift on Saturday.

1255
00:43:52,981 --> 00:43:54,764
What happened?
