1
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,323
Meckel's is like a
rose-colored index finger

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,425
protruding from the
antimesenteric border...

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,728
Then you bake it in a
400-degree oven for an hour...

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,885
Occasionally attach itself

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,387
to the umbilical
area, producing...

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,389
Fresh rosemary,
a little pepper...

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,958
which is a, uh, pipe
connecting Meckel's

8
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,393
to the outside world.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,395
Clove of garlic under the skin.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,440
You know, excuse me.

11
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,842
I'm trying to visualize
here, all right?

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,000
You might want to
visualize setting up soon.

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,334
Your intern's late.

14
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,737
Gloves and gown for Dr. Keaton.

15
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,017
What size gloves does she wear?

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,008
I don't keep a chart.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,509
Good morning, Dr. Benton.

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,577
Carter, you're late.

19
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,690
Two minutes.

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,513
You're supposed
to set up for Keaton.

21
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,681
Okay.

22
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,861
You know what size
gloves she wears?

23
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,384
Seven and a half, no powder.

24
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,807
"A man pushes a vacuum cleaner

25
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:01,677
"with a force of 70 Newtons
at a 45-degree angle

26
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,490
"and moves the vacuum cleaner

27
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,091
"a distance of five meters.

28
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,793
How much work has he done?"

29
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,728
Well, let's start
with the unlikelihood

30
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,730
of a man pushing
a vacuum cleaner.

31
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:13,188
Work equals force
times distance.

32
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:16,091
I thought work equaled one-half

33
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:17,092
of MV squared.

34
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,093
It's both.

35
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,562
Oh, God, I'm
never going to pass.

36
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:21,980
It's just a midterm.

37
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,582
It's one-half of our grade.

38
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,784
You have all day to study.

39
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,004
No, William. I have
to go to work<i> now.</i>

40
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,639
So, you're not
going to eat that?

41
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,863
Okay, the daily specials are...

42
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,432
Doubled-over gas pains in two,

43
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,633
hemorrhoids in three.

44
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,535
It's a below-the-belt
kind of day.

45
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,869
I know the feeling.

46
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,538
Oh, and a puking
toddler in five.

47
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,539
'Tis the season.

48
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,508
Everybody have their flu shots?

49
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,543
I'd rather puke.

50
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,054
Gant, can you
handle a hemorrhoid?

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,178
Not in this life.

52
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,547
Hey, that leg ulcer in
one is getting cranky.

53
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,781
Yeah, I'm getting to it.

54
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,982
Poor kid.

55
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,551
Got the dark cloud today, huh?

56
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,826
12 patients already

57
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,820
and he's got a
rule-out appi in four

58
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,256
and a rigid abdomen in six.

59
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,291
Hey, where's Mark?

60
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,292
Getting ready for
a staff meeting.

61
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,092
Oh, I can't wait.

62
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,639
Weaver and the
sound of her own voice.

63
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,962
A love story.

64
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,497
Dr. Greene called this one.

65
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,831
Mark called a meeting?

66
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,061
Do I look delusional?

67
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,517
Meckel's diverticulum.

68
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,453
Start with the rule of twos.

69
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:20,399
Uh, yeah, go.

70
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:22,501
Okay, Meckel's occurs in
two percent of the population

71
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,292
of which only two
cases are symptomatic.

72
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,627
The diverticulum is located

73
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:28,063
approximately two feet
from the ileocecal valve.

74
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,241
Diagnosis?

75
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:31,032
Technetium
pertechnetate imaging.

76
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,400
Complications?

77
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,047
Intestinal obstruction,
hemorrhage, volvulus

78
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,570
inflammation and perforation.

79
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,005
Treatment?

80
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,639
Excision.

81
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,941
You know this stuff cold.

82
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:41,654
Yeah, right.

83
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,578
Only if Keaton thinks so.

84
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,406
They have to give me
time off for my honeymoon.

85
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,966
It's not like I get
married every year.

86
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,480
Just every other year.

87
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,237
Well, I worked extra
hard for this one.

88
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,316
I deserve a reward.

89
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,606
Honey, your<i> man</i> is your reward.

90
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,786
That's right. 40 years of
snoring, hairs in the bathtub

91
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,488
and "Honey, can you find my...?"

92
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,777
Okay, I'll bring it up

93
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,692
at the re-engineering
committee today, but no promises.

94
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,227
Hey, Gant is screaming
for a suture kit.

95
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,662
I put it right under his nose.

96
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,063
That child needs a honeymoon.

97
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,431
Hey. Hey.

98
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,032
Have you seen Mark? Is he okay?

99
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,501
Let me put it this way:
He called a staff meeting.

100
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,824
Mark Greene?

101
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,058
Yep.

102
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,206
Glasses, receding
hairline, broken heart?

103
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,423
That's the one.

104
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,841
Scan demonstrated
a diverticulum.

105
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,316
And what caused
this one to bleed?

106
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,195
Presence of aberrant
gastric mucosa

107
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,313
in the Meckel's.

108
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,604
Very good, Peter.

109
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,906
There's the Ileocecal junction.

110
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,991
Uh-huh. I see it.

111
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:32,127
Now, follow my motion

112
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:34,329
as I move the bowl proximally.

113
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,347
Got it.

114
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,581
There's the Meckel's.

115
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,799
You've done your prep

116
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,333
on this one, haven't you?

117
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,435
Just your standard visualizing.

118
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,789
Sorry to interrupt, Abby,
I got to steal Dr. Benton.

119
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:44,789
For?

120
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,024
Perfed ulcer.

121
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,025
Dr. Grady was going to assist

122
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,744
but his wife's gone into labor.

123
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,390
She went from two
centimeters to six in record time.

124
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:52,542
Can't argue with Mother Nature.

125
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,627
Dr. Morgenstern, I'm not

126
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,983
prepped for that.

127
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,297
Oh, it's a nothing surgery.
You can do it in your sleep.

128
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,303
It's okay. Go ahead, Peter.

129
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,855
John can take over

130
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,970
the camera.

131
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,961
Since we're short
one resident for now

132
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,607
things are going
to be a little tight.

133
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:09,308
You might have noticed, what
we have is kind of controlled chaos.

134
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,177
Yeah, it's not all
that controlled, Mark.

135
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,561
Yeah, well, we're
going to fix that

136
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,453
with teamwork and a
new schedule, Kerry.

137
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,249
Now, what I've made
up is a chart here,

138
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:18,573
to help illustrate
how it's going to work.

139
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,093
Every doctor has been
designated a color.

140
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,878
Green is obviously taken.

141
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,357
Weaver is yellow.

142
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,897
Gant, red; Sanders, orange.

143
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,415
Ross is blue.

144
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,050
Doug, you have a problem?

145
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,571
No. Uh, no. You
just call me Mr. Blue.

146
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,535
All right. This is going to
be up in the admit area today.

147
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,425
Learn it, know it, do it.

148
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,728
This is an excellent
starting point, Mark

149
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,491
but since we're all
together, I'd like to bring up

150
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,131
food at the admit desk.

151
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,934
Someone spilt guava
juice on my labs yesterday.

152
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,519
All right then, no uncovered,

153
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,688
free-standing liquids
in the admit area.

154
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,222
All right. That's it.

155
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,974
Let's get busy.

156
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,242
Did I miss something?

157
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:56,255
You're not the one
missing something.

158
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,124
Oh, it's going to be a long day.

159
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:00,292
I wonder who drinks guava juice.

160
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:01,282
Mark, wait up.

161
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:02,951
Not now, Doug.

162
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,064
The chart was very
nice, very colorful.

163
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,566
Uh, "free-standing liquids"?

164
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,590
Don't start.

165
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,201
Think you're going
a little overboard?

166
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,203
Well, what? If they're
spilling liquids everywhere...

167
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,505
That's not what I meant.

168
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,340
I think your heart is broken
and you're overreacting.

169
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,542
No. I'm not. I'm
doing my job, okay?

170
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,943
The last few months,
I've been distracted.

171
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:17,933
Had other things on my mind.

172
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,245
That's right, and
despite everything

173
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,747
that's going on with Susan

174
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,804
you're still getting
the job done.

175
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,850
No. I'm not.

176
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,752
I'm letting Kerry
Weaver do my job

177
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,186
and that's going to stop.

178
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,454
I'm the Senior Attending

179
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,356
and it's time for
me to take control.

180
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,614
So you're going to step
back up, so to speak?

181
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,693
That's right.

182
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,116
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Everything else okay?

183
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:36,428
Everything else is fine.

184
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:37,847
All right. If you
ever want to talk...

185
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,472
Everything else is fine.

186
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,239
All right, I've already had
four cases of flu this morning.

187
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,440
Should I mention
the "shot" word?

188
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,430
Had mine. Me, too.

189
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,764
I'm done.

190
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,344
How about you,
Randi? I take garlic pills.

191
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,378
Good. Very cutting edge.

192
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,534
What about you, Carol?

193
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,613
Huh?

194
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,881
Who's taking this guy the
paramedics are bringing in?

195
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,871
Is he a child?

196
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,206
I'll take it.

197
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,208
Malik, hey, where's Dr. Gant?

198
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,876
Just took an admit up to O.R.

199
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,112
54-year-old male
putting up insulation

200
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,125
took a 15-foot fall
from the ladder.

201
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,793
Alert and oriented times three.

202
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,528
Vitals stable, BP's 130/90

203
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,797
possible fractured
left pelvis and tib fib.

204
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,632
Gave six of
morphine in the field.

205
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,968
Okay, let's get him
into trauma one.

206
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,124
Page Dr. Gant.

207
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,459
Mark, I can use you.

208
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,127
Yeah, I'll be
there in just a sec.

209
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,463
Doug, you're aware
that the board is full.

210
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,976
Luck of the draw. No pedes.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,266
Well, you are aware
that the adult anatomy

212
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,601
is remarkably similar.

213
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,746
I don't know

214
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,648
if a 50-year-old with chest pain

215
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,251
will be thrilled with having a
baby doctor take care of him.

216
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,908
Arthritic diabetic in four.

217
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,643
Rule out MI in three.

218
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,412
If you need any help, just ask.

219
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,725
I don't know if I'm color-
coordinated enough for this.

220
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,394
Doug, can you help me out here?

221
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,985
If a red quark is attracted
to an anti-red quark

222
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,420
is it a gluon or a meson?

223
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,255
Thank you, Carol,
for pointing out

224
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,290
something else I
know nothing about.

225
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,996
Mostly in my legs today.

226
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,364
Chest pains.

227
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,101
I'm guessing it's a
vaso-occlusive crisis.

228
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,081
Sounds like you understand
your disease pretty well.

229
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,689
I've been living with
sickle cell all my life.

230
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,269
Temp's 101, BP's 110/80

231
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,092
Tachy at 110.

232
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,827
What do you take for pain?

233
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,596
Darvocet usually does it.

234
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:03,031
Not today.

235
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,677
Okay, we'll get you
something stronger

236
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,001
soon as we get an I.V. going.

237
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,385
Thanks.

238
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,803
Connie, let's get her changed

239
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,871
and get a CBC

240
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,939
with retic count

241
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:12,440
chest film, and start a line.

242
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:14,108
O2 two liters by nasal cannula

243
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,610
and five migs of morphine.

244
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:16,945
Can you hang on?

245
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,281
If you hear me screaming,
you'll have your answer.

246
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:23,217
A simple patch
closure should do here.

247
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,887
So what did I pull
you away from?

248
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,221
Meckel's.

249
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,890
Goodness.

250
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,892
Baptism by fire.

251
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,227
I was holding my own.

252
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,630
Still, it's tough, isn't it?

253
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:36,965
What do you mean?

254
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,867
You've chosen

255
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:40,596
the most difficult elective.

256
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,187
Many are called,
but few are chosen.

257
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,356
Did Keaton say something?

258
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,825
Retract, please.

259
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,261
Uh, I mean, did she
say how I was doing?

260
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,397
If you're concerned,
you should ask her.

261
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,332
No, no, I'm not concerned.

262
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,167
I just, you know, look,
all of my procedures

263
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,168
haven't been perfection,

264
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,888
but Keaton knows I could've
handled that Meckel's.

265
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,901
"Man's reach should
exceed his grasp,

266
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,903
else what's a heaven for?"

267
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,004
Browning.

268
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,112
Or was it Keats?

269
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,428
Ah, well, they're all a
bunch of hopheads, anyway.

270
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:13,968
Peter? What are you doing?

271
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,370
Oh.

272
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,170
Give me a broader scope there.

273
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:21,960
Good.

274
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,839
How late are you on, Dr. Carter?

275
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,162
Late?

276
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,931
Not late, 7:00.

277
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,367
Um... big plans?

278
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,702
No.

279
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,037
Well, uh... maybe.

280
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,507
Just dinner... eating.

281
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,342
I was thinking of
Indian food myself.

282
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,677
Indian food?

283
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,190
You got a problem, Shirley?

284
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,181
You got a problem
with Indian food?

285
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,485
Oh, I'm sure she
doesn't, do you, Shirley?

286
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,037
Good for the sinuses.

287
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:50,872
It's that spice they use.

288
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,707
Hold still, please.

289
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,609
Good.

290
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,044
Maybe I'll just order in

291
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,613
and rent a movie.

292
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,227
My VCR's broken.

293
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:02,883
Which is probably

294
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,887
why I'm not going
to, uh, myself.

295
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,900
Rent a movie,
that is... tonight.

296
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,457
So maybe you'll just eat

297
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,125
and call it a day?

298
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,728
Yeah, that's probably
what I should do.

299
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:17,398
Just study, prep for tomorrow.

300
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,734
Cumin.

301
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,068
What?

302
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:22,570
That's the spice... cumin.

303
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:24,004
Oh.

304
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
Right.

305
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,527
BP's 120/80, heart
rate's 90, resps 30.

306
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:30,862
He's HIV-positive.

307
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,542
Complaining of
shortness of breath.

308
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:33,865
Al Boulet?

309
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,033
Is he some relative of Jeanie's?

310
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,402
Not that I know of.

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,039
Al Boulet?

312
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,040
Dr. Greene.

313
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,041
Yeah.

314
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,543
Any relation to Jeanie Boulet?

315
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,211
We're divorced.

316
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,047
Oh. So, you're having
trouble breathing?

317
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,549
Just a little.

318
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,050
No-nothing big.

319
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,121
And when did you first
test positive for HIV?

320
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,956
About six months ago.

321
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,458
Mm-hmm.

322
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,295
And you're on AZT, 3TC
and a protease inhibitor.

323
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,831
Your last t-cell count was 200?

324
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,134
Yeah.

325
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,138
CBC, chest film and
sputum induction.

326
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,308
O2 nasal cannula, four liters.

327
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,129
Bactrim, four
amps I.V. piggyback

328
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,064
60 migs solumedrol I.V.

329
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,618
And let's admit
Mr. Boulet to medicine.

330
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,406
Yep. Okay.

331
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,075
So, when'd you get divorced?

332
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,744
Uh... separated about a year.

333
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,413
Uh-huh. Open.

334
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,881
Divorce just came through.

335
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,304
The new float system
seems to be working well

336
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,638
across the board.

337
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,109
E.R. and ICU both had a
few adjustment problems

338
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,179
but altogether, I would
say things are settling down.

339
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,547
From where risk
management sits, we're fine.

340
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,327
Incident reports
haven't increased

341
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,851
since the new rotation started.

342
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,186
Can you give us an idea

343
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,514
how long this floating
is going to last?

344
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,455
Indefinitely, Carol.

345
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,074
This is not a Band-Aid.

346
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,325
It's the cure.

347
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,960
It's being negotiated
into the new contracts?

348
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,591
Financial affairs is ever so
pleased with this temporary fix,

349
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,381
but we still need to cut
non-physician related care.

350
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,884
Meaning the nurses?

351
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,298
Honestly speaking, nurses
simply don't generate the revenue.

352
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,621
And what about saving lives?

353
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,918
They don't tend
to do that either.

354
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,324
Hold on a minute, Dean.

355
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,224
You're just

356
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,226
talking statistics,
aren't you, Dean?

357
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,040
Averages, numbers...
Whatever you want to call it.

358
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:29,441
I think you're
calling it nurses.

359
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:30,765
And in the E.R.,

360
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,067
nurses are in trauma
situations every day.

361
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,547
It's only going to hurt
an emergent patient

362
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,738
to have some<i> floor</i> nurse
set up the wrong lavage kit.

363
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:40,358
You want a lawsuit
over that one?

364
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,671
Look, Carol. That's
why we're all here.

365
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:42,705
To help iron out these problems

366
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,523
before your contract's up.

367
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,197
Now, have you got a suggestion?

368
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,483
Stop floating them.

369
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,050
E.R. nurses

370
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,385
are not interchangeable.

371
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:52,720
They work differently.

372
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,323
They work longer, and
the stakes are higher.

373
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,591
So we should show them
preferential treatment.

374
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:00,962
We should show emergent
patients preferential treatment

375
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,781
by giving them nurses
trained in handling crises.

376
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,151
What do we say to pedes or
ob/gyn when they complain?

377
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,992
You tell them it's like triage.
Critical cases come first.

378
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:18,996
Hey, Jeanie.

379
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,330
Hi.

380
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,344
I just treated your husband Al.

381
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,936
Ex-husband.

382
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,420
Still, I-I-I didn't realize

383
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:28,823
that you've been
going through all this.

384
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:32,277
Unfortunately, it's Al
who's going through it.

385
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,378
I mean, I'm doing
what I can to help.

386
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:38,266
So I guess you guys have
been separated for a while.

387
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,784
Yeah, quite a long time.

388
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,286
And the marriage was
over long before that.

389
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,390
I guess you didn't feel
any need to get tested.

390
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,557
No, no. I did.

391
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,137
I got lucky. I was negative.

392
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,727
I'm glad.

393
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,796
Yeah. I got to get
this suture kit to Gant.

394
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,626
He is just swamped
with patients.

395
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,683
Hey, that's a central line kit.

396
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,318
You're right.

397
00:13:58,555 --> 00:13:59,555
Right. Thank you.

398
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,377
Now, Mrs. McCourt, when
did the chest pains start?

399
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,713
Uh, this morning,
right after breakfast.

400
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,047
What did you eat?

401
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,649
Toast with raspberry jam.

402
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,718
Well, those jams
can be pretty acidic.

403
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,731
Oh, I've eaten toast
and raspberry jam

404
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,388
every day for 40 years.

405
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,067
It doesn't give me heartburn.

406
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,391
I know heartburn.

407
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,426
Yes, I'm sure that you do.

408
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,557
All right, let's get a 12-lead,
pulse ox and a chest film.

409
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,581
And maybe cardiac enzymes?

410
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,149
Oh, uh, yeah.

411
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,184
Are you on any medication?

412
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:33,004
Of course I am. I'm 73.

413
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,367
Hmm. Uh...

414
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:35,356
Digoxin,

415
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:36,535
for my heart,

416
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,644
and allopurinol for my gout,

417
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,313
glipizide for diabetes

418
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,326
and simvastatin for, um...

419
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,328
Ooh, I never can
remember this one.

420
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,030
What am I taking that one for?

421
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,331
Uh... High cholesterol.

422
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,866
Oh, yeah, you don't
want to skip that.

423
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,890
It's very important.

424
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,759
Yes, I...

425
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:55,805
And, uh...

426
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,829
What a cow. Famotidine.

427
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,775
Kerry, you got a minute?

428
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,343
Sure. What's up?

429
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,745
We might have a
problem with Jeanie Boulet.

430
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,080
What sort of problem?

431
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,415
This morning, I treated
her ex-husband Al.

432
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,917
He has AIDS.

433
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,251
I see.

434
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,587
Did she mention anything to you?

435
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,699
Why would she?

436
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,690
She claims she tested negative.

437
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,860
Well, we'll have to take
her word on it, won't we?

438
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,862
Doesn't this make
you uncomfortable?

439
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,363
Not especially.

440
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,699
She says she's negative.

441
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,367
What else can we do?

442
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,870
I guess I'm just
a little surprised

443
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,371
at your lack of concern.

444
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,239
It's a lack of alarm, Mark.

445
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,741
There's a difference.

446
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,746
I'm in the tall grass

447
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,917
and so... I take the five iron

448
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:58,623
and I sail that puppy, like,
two inches from the cup.

449
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,290
It was poetry.

450
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,959
It was a sonnet.

451
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,639
It was practically a haiku.

452
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,129
Excuse me, Dr. Morgenstern.

453
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,631
Are we done yet?

454
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,999
Looks good to me.

455
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,435
Thank you, Peter.

456
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:16,507
What happened to
the pelvic pain in two?

457
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,642
Ruptured ectopic. OB
took her up to surgery.

458
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,156
Yeah, well, then why
don't you erase the name?

459
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,312
Is that too difficult?

460
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,426
I was busy calling up
the charts you asked for...

461
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,593
Al Boulet.

462
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,250
He was Kerry Weaver's patient?

463
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,851
That's what it says.

464
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,065
You're welcome.

465
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,254
So you're telling me

466
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,256
this Indian food
thing has a purpose.

467
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,603
I'm just trying to prep
myself for Pakistan.

468
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,594
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

469
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,107
Well, I only found out
yesterday afternoon.

470
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,109
I haven't told anyone
but Anspaugh.

471
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,932
You're not sleeping
with Anspaugh.

472
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,301
Are you?

473
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,270
Um, maybe...

474
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,271
You know what?

475
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,272
We got it. We'll take it.

476
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,618
Thank you. Thank you.

477
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,120
Listen, it's a
great opportunity.

478
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,589
Three of us from the
U.S. going to teach

479
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,676
pediatric surgical techniques
to Pakistani surgeons.

480
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,678
Think of the help
we'll be giving.

481
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:01,335
They don't need that kind
of help in, like, Indianapolis?

482
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,004
Well, it's only for four months.

483
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,671
Thought you said six.

484
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,222
Well, you know, it could be six.

485
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,252
Well, then that means
it could be a year or five.

486
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,571
Next thing you know, you're
going to become Mother Teresa

487
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,478
and start living amongst them.

488
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:15,266
Did you have long-term
plans for us, John?

489
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,602
Well...

490
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,239
I don't... you know...

491
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,906
Well, neither did I,

492
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,509
so, for the next few weeks

493
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,522
why don't we just
keep having fun?

494
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,347
Same kind of fun, though, right?

495
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,349
Yes, the same kind of fun.

496
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,550
Okay.

497
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,231
<i>I've got a patient</i>

498
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,522
present with PCP pneumonia.

499
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,241
Been tested positive
for HIV six months ago

500
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,910
and I'm worried he
didn't tell his wife.

501
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,912
Uh-huh.

502
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:47,698
I need to see if she was tested.

503
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,750
Those are private
files, Dr. Greene.

504
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:53,604
In the case of spousal
report, I'm allowed to check.

505
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,668
In the case of spousal report,
you're allowed to tell the other spouse

506
00:17:56,692 --> 00:18:00,111
not to look into
someone's private files.

507
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,312
Give me a break, huh?

508
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,748
I don't think this
guy's telling her.

509
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,442
Okay. Name?

510
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,460
Uh, Jeanie Boulet.

511
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,845
B-o-u-l-e-t.

512
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,023
You know, that re-engineering
committee is a joke.

513
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,680
It's downsizing in
sheep's clothing.

514
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,682
I should have spent
the time studying.

515
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,550
I still don't know
iodine from cosine.

516
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,897
Okay, well, if memory serves me

517
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,221
one is an element that
you find in antiseptic

518
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,556
and the other has
to do with right angles

519
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,903
or hypotenuse...
Something like that.

520
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,559
If that's how your memory serves

521
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,528
how did you get through it?

522
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,909
Well, they told us we could
bring one sheet into the exam

523
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,778
with all the
formulas written on it.

524
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,934
And?

525
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,697
I brought in a really big sheet.

526
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,988
Have you seen Weaver?

527
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,489
What color was she?

528
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,024
Never mind.

529
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:06,671
Excuse me. I've
been waiting here

530
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:07,995
for two hours

531
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,008
and I have a luncheon
in less than 20 minutes.

532
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:11,609
Right, well, we'll be
right there Mrs. Uh...?

533
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,946
Murison. If I don't
get my B-12 shot

534
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,948
I might as well just
resign from my job.

535
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,604
Someone is going to help you.

536
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:18,939
Gant, can you...?

537
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,274
No, no.

538
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,608
Gant, the answer is yes.

539
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,610
You give Mrs.
Murison a B-12 shot.

540
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:24,945
I've got 17 surgical patients.

541
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:26,280
She's not one of them.

542
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,614
I'm sorry.

543
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,516
You're going to have to wait.

544
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:32,503
Natalie, you get a lot of
ear infections, do you?

545
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,789
Can you just give
me the amoxicillin?

546
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,223
I have a playdate.

547
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,541
Mm-hmm.

548
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,910
You don't need to look.

549
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,546
Just give me the antibiotic.

550
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,376
Augmentin will be just fine

551
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,233
if you're worried
about resistance.

552
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,709
You know a lot of things
about a lot of things

553
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:50,082
don't you, Natalie?

554
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,789
Yes, I do.

555
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,802
So, you want to
tell Nurse Hathaway

556
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,410
about Coulomb's Law?

557
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,746
That's the fundamental
law of electrostatics

558
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,749
which states that the force
between two charged particles

559
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,085
is directly proportional to
the product of their charges.

560
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,432
And inversely proportional

561
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,767
to the square of the
distance between them.

562
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,758
Isn't<i> that</i> right, Natalie?

563
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,704
You can't give me another shot?

564
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,361
You've already had two doses.

565
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:17,031
The attending physician
has to approve a third.

566
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,698
Jeanie.

567
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,379
Mark, I'm glad you're here.

568
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,214
I've got a patient
in sickle crisis.

569
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:23,703
She's in a lot of pain.

570
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:24,749
I'd like for you
to evaluate her.

571
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,218
She needs more narcotics,
maybe an admission.

572
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,685
Right, well, I'll
see what I can do.

573
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:28,608
But right now, I need you

574
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,988
to cover the waiting room.

575
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,312
The waiting room?

576
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:33,458
Yeah, there's about a dozen
people need to be triaged.

577
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,949
But I'm with a patient.

578
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,261
I'm going to handle
this from here.

579
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:37,717
Understand?

580
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,792
So what kind of movie
do you want to get?

581
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,628
I was thinking maybe a comedy

582
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,796
or maybe a comedy.

583
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,498
Forget it.

584
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,300
Tonight, you're
going to participate

585
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,469
in a long-standing
Carter family tradition.

586
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,971
Sounds painful.

587
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,805
Every year, at exactly this time

588
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,808
the intrepid Carter
male goes into the woods

589
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,978
picks out the perfect
Douglas fir tree

590
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,991
and with his own
strong, Protestant hands

591
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,314
he cuts it down.

592
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,316
We're going to cut down a tree?

593
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,650
Not just<i> any</i> tree.

594
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,930
The Carter family
Christmas tree.

595
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:13,587
Oh, oh, I do not
saw after hours.

596
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:14,921
Don't worry.

597
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,256
That's my job.

598
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,924
Oh, Dr. Benton,
how was the ulcer?

599
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,593
Uh. Uh... fine.

600
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,929
Look, I saw the thyroglossal
duct on the board

601
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,776
and I was hoping to assist.

602
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,177
I haven't had a
lot of experience

603
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,468
with neck surgery

604
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:28,869
and, you know, considering

605
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,365
that I was called
out of the Meckel's...

606
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,307
Sorry. I already called
in Wallace to assist.

607
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,220
Yeah, but is there any
possibility of rescheduling

608
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,577
considering everything that...

609
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:37,944
There'll be plenty

610
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,747
of other opportunities,
Peter, really.

611
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:42,516
Carter, don't you
have something to do?

612
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,753
No. Actually, I'm all caught up.

613
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,054
What about post-op notes?

614
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,334
They're on the charts.

615
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:49,518
I'm done.

616
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,203
That's it.

617
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,371
I'm done.

618
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,550
I'm going to lunch.

619
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,706
Here. Earache in four.

620
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,042
I'm not going to lunch.

621
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,721
Hey, Carter,
otitis media in four.

622
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,877
Sorry, Doug.

623
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,012
I beeped him.

624
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:13,992
You might want to
check on your friend Gant.

625
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,249
Why? What's wrong?

626
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:16,116
Well, surgical admits

627
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,229
are in a holding
pattern and piling up.

628
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,585
You've got four patients

629
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,920
on your service.

630
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:21,255
He's got 20.

631
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,457
Give him these... The
labs on lung cancer.

632
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,459
Hey. You heard I was here, huh?

633
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,710
I'm better now.

634
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,379
It must be the Jell-O.

635
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,730
Why did you tell

636
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,809
Mark Greene about me?

637
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,877
I didn't.

638
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,629
Then how does he
know I'm positive?

639
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,268
I don't know. We were married.

640
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,670
I guess he just assumed.

641
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:38,038
He's not<i> assuming,</i> Al.

642
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:39,272
He knows.

643
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:40,608
Well, it didn't come from me.

644
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,904
Did it ever occur to you to go to
a different hospital for treatment?

645
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,112
My insurance is still a mess.

646
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:46,280
I know the doctors here.

647
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:47,625
<i>I</i> know the doctors here!

648
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:49,583
Well, even if they found out

649
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,918
they couldn't fire
you, could they?

650
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,432
That's not the point, Al.

651
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,067
Do you think at all about
what<i> I'm</i> going through?

652
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:56,601
This is not just about you.

653
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,892
I know this is
not just about me.

654
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,427
Then act like it.

655
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,380
Jeanie.

656
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,203
Look, I know how
mad you are at me.

657
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,539
And you have a<i> right</i> to be.

658
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,846
Living with AIDS, that's...

659
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,398
nothing, but...

660
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:25,185
knowing...

661
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,272
I gave it to you...

662
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,460
There's no pill for that.

663
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:38,916
I just have to face it...

664
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:43,153
Every day.

665
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:52,446
Hating me might feel good,
but it won't change anything.

666
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,966
It doesn't feel good, Al.

667
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,318
Nothing about this feels good.

668
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,155
I don't see Weaver as yellow.

669
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,157
I see her more
in the red family.

670
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,815
Yeah, something in burnt sienna.

671
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,761
Lavender's too pastel for Doyle.

672
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,418
She's more like an eggplant.

673
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,097
Are you redecorating my board?

674
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,922
Just a little
constructive criticism.

675
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,924
Mark, I need to speak with you.

676
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,269
All right, I'll be
there in a second.

677
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,876
I'll wait outside.

678
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,494
What the hell are you doing?

679
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:31,084
Funny, I was going to
ask you the same question.

680
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,764
Why is Jeanie
checking vital signs

681
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:34,087
when we're swamped?

682
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,422
Patient safety.

683
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,102
She is not a health risk.

684
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,425
Oh, maybe you know that

685
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,771
but I haven't had the opportunity
to assess her condition.

686
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,106
Why didn't you tell me that
you treated her husband?

687
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,541
I didn't think it was relevant.

688
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,396
You lied to me.

689
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,043
It wasn't any of your business.

690
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,733
If someone in my
E.R. is HIV-positive

691
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:47,984
I think it's my business.

692
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,230
Hey, it's<i> our</i> E.R.

693
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,766
and you don't even
know if she's HIV-positive.

694
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,006
The hell I don't.

695
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,424
I checked with medical records.

696
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,321
You went into her
confidential file?

697
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:58,340
I wouldn't have had to if
you had told me the truth.

698
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,031
Nice try, Mark, but there's
no excuse for what you did

699
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,066
and you know it.

700
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:06,598
Hey. I've been looking for you.

701
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,266
I heard you could use a hand...

702
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,589
That you're getting buried.

703
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,924
I'm fine.

704
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,204
Yeah, well, I don't
mind helping you.

705
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:14,206
You've certainly bailed me
out when I've been under.

706
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,141
<i>Benton</i> minds. Look, he
wants me to pull my weight.

707
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:17,275
I'm damn well going to pull it.

708
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:18,877
I'm not letting him
get another shot at me.

709
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,200
Gant, lower abdominal pain.

710
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,236
Rule out small
bowel obstruction.

711
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,192
We may have a
problem in the E.R.

712
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:36,060
I thought you should
know about it right away.

713
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:37,595
Is this going to
give me acid reflux?

714
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,386
If so, save it until I'm done.

715
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:42,523
I have reason to believe
that we may have a worker

716
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:44,224
that's HIV-positive.

717
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,242
Say no more.

718
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,410
I don't want details.

719
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,156
This could have
serious ramifications.

720
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,657
I've already removed the person

721
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,925
from direct patient care.

722
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,894
Well, I hope you
didn't indicate why,

723
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,952
or else we're going to have a
discrimination suit slapped on us.

724
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,732
No. What is the hospital policy?

725
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,222
We'll deal with it.

726
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,469
We're not going to race at it

727
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,238
like a herd of buffalo.

728
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,212
The first thing I want
to do is talk to Legal.

729
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:07,280
Does Kerry know?

730
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,015
That's part of the problem.

731
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,569
I believe Kerry may have
known for as long as six months

732
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,987
without informing anyone.

733
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:15,088
Good.

734
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,508
I want you to be
equally discreet.

735
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:21,311
But by keeping this to
herself, Kerry may have left us

736
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,612
wide open for litigation.

737
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,914
I know that all too well

738
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,450
but right now, it's just a
suspicion, Dr. Greene.

739
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,801
And please...

740
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,088
don't correct me if I'm wrong.

741
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,411
I had a dream like this once.

742
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:38,778
Now it's come true.

743
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:39,846
What happened?

744
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,759
We were on our
winter nature hike

745
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:44,218
identifying perennials,
varieties of moss.

746
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:45,630
One of the boys
found a sick bat,

747
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,521
brought it back to the van.

748
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,467
Before I knew what was going on,

749
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:50,790
he had passed it around.

750
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,859
Were any of them
bitten or scratched?

751
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:54,127
Maybe. We don't know.

752
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:55,128
Their stories changed

753
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:56,808
when they found out they
were going to get a shot.

754
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:57,797
I don't understand it.

755
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,177
The bats should be well
into hibernation by now.

756
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,878
Okay, let's get the bat in
the lab and see if it's rabid.

757
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:01,868
Oh, we don't have a bat.

758
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:03,036
No bat?

759
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:05,349
No bat. I threw it
out the car window.

760
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,435
I'm going to go
start some charts.

761
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,876
Mm-hmm.

762
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,577
It was flopping, drooling.

763
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:12,780
And you panicked.

764
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:15,615
Yes... I suppose I did.

765
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,035
All right!

766
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,220
Anyone seen Randi?

767
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:22,389
Went to the roach
coach for a sandwich.

768
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:23,901
This has to be a mistake. What?

769
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:26,560
"Please observe that all
E.R. nurses will be exempt

770
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:29,129
from the flotation
schedule currently in effect."

771
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:30,330
No way!

772
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,077
Does it say anything
about my honeymoon?

773
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,066
No, you must be dreamin', girl.

774
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:34,367
What'd you say to them?

775
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,368
Who?

776
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,581
"No more floating."

777
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,349
You must be kidding!

778
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:39,406
Good work, Carol.

779
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:41,219
No wonder management wanted you.

780
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,609
I'm not management.

781
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,711
Paramedics got a live one
coming in right behind me!

782
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,023
Haleh, Carol...

783
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:47,825
Bring these to
Doug in exam three.

784
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,228
Order a series of R.I.G.
and rabies vaccines.

785
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,151
How many?

786
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,152
Eight... no, nine.

787
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,220
What happened?

788
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,865
Ten-year-old
male, vitals stable.

789
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:55,933
BP 100/70.

790
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:58,324
Severe throat
pain with bleeding.

791
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,554
I took him to the circus.

792
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,322
He thought he could
be a sword swallower.

793
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,525
He tried at home with
one of our carving knives.

794
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,498
Let's get him into

795
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,515
trauma one.

796
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,649
Who's covering surgery?

797
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,152
Gant, but I think
he's in Radiology.

798
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,166
Yeah, you know what, you're
going to have to wait out here.

799
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,822
Page Carter and Benton.

800
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,023
Uh... Dr. Keaton

801
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,693
I see you're going to
have a trisegmentectomy

802
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,861
for a hepatoblastoma
this afternoon.

803
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,163
No. I decided

804
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,832
the child needed a
course of pre-op chemo.

805
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,301
But it's on the board.

806
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,380
Well, it shouldn't be.

807
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,903
I canceled it.

808
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,516
Peter, you were unlucky today

809
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,051
but you've already seen more

810
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,253
during a single
rotation than I ever did.

811
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,343
Yeah, I know, Dr. Keaton.

812
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,112
I just feel that if I
get more experience

813
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,813
I'll be better prepared
for the future.

814
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,149
That's not how you
should be looking at it.

815
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,151
Damn.

816
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,652
Uh... what do you mean?

817
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,233
Focus on what's in front of you.

818
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,335
Your residency
is five years long.

819
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,919
It's a marathon, not
a sprint. Excuse me.

820
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,690
I feel crepitation.

821
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:54,692
He's got subcutaneous
air in his neck.

822
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:55,582
Probably perfed his esophagus.

823
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:56,583
I'll start a second line.

824
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:57,834
You want a chest film?

825
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,114
And a soft tissue neck.

826
00:28:59,138 --> 00:28:59,970
You paged me?

827
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:00,970
Probable perforation.

828
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:01,971
The temp's 100.

829
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,440
Let's get a gram of Unasyn.

830
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,575
He might be
developing an infection.

831
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,887
You going to scope him? Yep.

832
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,877
I wouldn't.

833
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,295
He's obviously perfed.

834
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,950
Carol, let's go ahead and set up

835
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,185
for endoscopy.

836
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,122
This is Jeanie Boulet.

837
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:23,493
I'd like to know if anyone
inquired about my file today.

838
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,597
Around noon?

839
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,333
All right.

840
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,335
Thank you.

841
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,069
Are you okay?

842
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,638
I'm fine.

843
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,126
It's so damn swollen in here.

844
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:40,977
Can you visualize the cords?

845
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,095
All right, what do we got?

846
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,497
Ten-year-old trying to
be a sword swallower.

847
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,865
Used a carving knife.

848
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,500
Vitals are stable.

849
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,780
Gave him a gram of Unasyn.

850
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:50,648
We're trying to
see if there's a perf.

851
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,550
Okay. Carter, what the
hell are you doing here?

852
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:55,225
I thought Gant was
covering the E.R.

853
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,226
Gant's jammed.

854
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,261
I paged Carter to help.

855
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,361
He's not jammed.

856
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,857
The kid is slow and
we're not helping him out

857
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,198
by picking up his slack.

858
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,327
I thought the patient was
more important, Peter.

859
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:04,412
Carol made the right call.

860
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,646
Well, they're Peter's interns.

861
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,953
It's his decision.

862
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:10,040
Well, in any event, he's
perfed his esophagus.

863
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,758
We all knew that one.

864
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,877
Anybody want me to drop an NG?

865
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,307
Nope. We'll do it up in the O.R.

866
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:16,913
I'll page Dr. Keaton.

867
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,915
No, why don't you stay down here

868
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,184
and help your friend. Let's go.

869
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:28,291
All right.

870
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,937
Now, next time you see a bat

871
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,928
what are you going to do?

872
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,274
Leave it alone!

873
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,264
All right!

874
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,399
Good, good, good.

875
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,867
Now, hop out of the way here.

876
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:39,051
Let's send some
instructions home with them.

877
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,720
We want follow-up injections

878
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,090
on days three, seven, 14 and 28.

879
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,659
Okay... Mr. Wilbourne.

880
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,994
Time for your shot.

881
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:49,562
I barely touched the thing.

882
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,515
Well, rabies is nothing
to fool around with

883
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,782
as you well know.

884
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,817
Can we watch?

885
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,031
Mark, do you have a minute?

886
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,021
What's up?

887
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,834
Well, I just wanted
to talk to you

888
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,702
about the memo I got from
the re-engineering committee

889
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:02,837
about floating the nurses.

890
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,172
Carol, that's your
responsibility.

891
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,606
I really need you
to handle it yourself.

892
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,741
I<i> am</i> handling it.

893
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,598
You want me to put a word in?

894
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,100
No.

895
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,246
You know what I'd really
like is just one 24-hour period

896
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,869
where no one
complains about their job

897
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,004
and maybe just one person

898
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,001
might appreciate the
fact that they have one.

899
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:17,357
Is that too much to ask for?

900
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,786
Well, actually, what I
was going to tell you is

901
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,223
that they agreed to my request

902
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,390
and they're going to
stop floating the nurses

903
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,092
which will make both
our jobs a lot easier.

904
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,666
I just thought you might
want some good news.

905
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:27,984
Thanks.

906
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,008
Eh... poor kid.

907
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,843
Trying to swallow a knife.

908
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:38,578
I've seen worse.

909
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:40,313
Mobilize the esophagus.

910
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:41,814
Okay. Got it.

911
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,216
Debride the wound.

912
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,685
Okay.

913
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,920
Mm-hmm.

914
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:47,937
And...

915
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,773
I'm there.

916
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:55,312
Uh... Dr. Keaton?

917
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,313
Mm-hmm?

918
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,393
I need to ask you something.

919
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,382
Suction.

920
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,784
Well, uh...

921
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:05,338
I'm a little concerned
about... how Carter's doing.

922
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,624
How do you think he's doing?

923
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,978
Well, he... had to
scramble this rotation...

924
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,630
Well, we both did...

925
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,966
But, uh... I-I don't know,
I-I think he's doing fine.

926
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,735
So do I.

927
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,639
You know, he had a
rough bit in the beginning

928
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,975
but he listened, he learned...

929
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,577
He's very, very good with kids.

930
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,412
Yes, he is.

931
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:33,617
If that's the way you feel
about Carter, you should tell him.

932
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,752
It's very important
for the teacher

933
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,655
to keep his intern
informed of how he's doing.

934
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,073
You-you think so?

935
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:43,059
Absolutely. That way, he
knows he's on the right track.

936
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,662
It's very easy to get
discouraged in a vacuum.

937
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,764
I... yeah, I agree.

938
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,066
I... yeah, agree.

939
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,638
Hey, it looks like snow.

940
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:55,838
Smells like snow.

941
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,174
Carol, what does that mean?

942
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,775
You can smell snow coming.

943
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,909
It has a smell.

944
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,344
It smells like burritos.

945
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,380
Look, what are we
going to do about Mark?

946
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,793
Put him on a plane,
or have him killed.

947
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,235
I don't think I can take this
much longer, you know?

948
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,653
Maybe you should talk to him.

949
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,833
I talked to him once;
he said he was okay.

950
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,068
If I ask him again,
it gets a little weird.

951
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,360
Oh, you'd be
violating the guy code.

952
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:17,361
The guy code?

953
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,028
Yeah, of non-communication.

954
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,197
Don't you have a
test to study for?

955
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,367
You can't let him self-destruct.

956
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,513
Well, let him get it
out of his system.

957
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,937
If he stomps around,
acts like a jerk

958
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,150
then he'll be back.

959
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,475
Yeah, but will he
have any friends left?

960
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,243
Didn't you get more morphine?

961
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,273
He said he would,
but never came back.

962
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:36,213
Dr. Greene?

963
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,330
I don't even remember.

964
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:39,110
Please, I really can't
take this anymore.

965
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:40,266
I know. Okay.

966
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:42,380
Jeanie, what are
you doing in here?

967
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:43,948
I hold you to handle triage.

968
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:45,238
Could I speak to you?

969
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,140
I'm treating a patient
that you've neglected.

970
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:48,752
Do you have any idea
how much pain she is in?

971
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,021
Yeah, when I
assign you to an area

972
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:51,155
that's where you go.

973
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:52,857
Oh, is that how it works?
You make the rules?

974
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,347
Yeah, that's how it works.

975
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:56,349
And you get to break them

976
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:57,517
by going into my file?

977
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:59,063
I requested that information

978
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,631
under the Spousal Report Law.

979
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:01,787
That's a lot of crap, Mark.

980
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:03,423
You wanted to know,
and you found out.

981
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,724
It was completely unethical.

982
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,159
You want to talk ethics?

983
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:07,126
How about you lying to me?

984
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:08,144
Well, I guess the truth

985
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,212
is out now, huh?

986
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,825
You should've come to
me from the beginning.

987
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,882
Why, so I can lose
my job sooner?

988
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,235
No. So I could have dealt

989
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,464
with the situation
appropriately.

990
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,405
No. It's better this way.

991
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,257
You know about me, and I know

992
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,810
a hell of a lot more about you.

993
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,645
Excuse me.

994
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,948
I have to attend to a patient.

995
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,745
It's not the flu.

996
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,746
I'm not saying anything.

997
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,015
It's allergies.

998
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,482
I didn't say a thing.

999
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,483
I'm gone.

1000
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,785
Break a leg.

1001
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:49,786
Hey, where you going?
We're going to celebrate!

1002
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:50,787
Celebrate what?

1003
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,267
It's happy hour! We're
not floaters anymore!

1004
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,534
First pitcher of
margaritas is on us.

1005
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,936
Oh, it sounds
like fun, but I can't.

1006
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,842
I have an appointment.

1007
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:57,138
Oh, come on! What
can be that important?

1008
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,595
You're the guest of honor.

1009
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,296
Sorry. Have fun.

1010
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:02,815
Be right there.

1011
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,658
Hey, are you done?

1012
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,128
Yeah.

1013
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,130
Benton just ripped me a new one.

1014
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:18,998
Huh. About what?

1015
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,801
About not being in trauma
for the perfed esophagus.

1016
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:23,069
Ah.

1017
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,872
Why didn't you come
get me out of Radiology?

1018
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:27,239
Hey, they paged me.

1019
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:31,110
Look, I know you
were trying to help

1020
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:32,545
but you didn't.

1021
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,980
You made it worse.

1022
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,182
I'm sorry.

1023
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:40,553
The best thing you can do for me

1024
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:42,605
is to leave me alone.

1025
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,243
Mm-hmm.

1026
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:55,234
- ♪
- millionaires money can... ♪

1027
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:58,805
Anything good?

1028
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,139
Just surfing.

1029
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,474
Done for the day?

1030
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,809
Almost.

1031
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:04,711
Al, about this afternoon...

1032
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,179
Hey. No, it's okay.

1033
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:08,682
No, I'm sorry that I
jumped to conclusions.

1034
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:11,184
It's just... I get up
every morning thinking

1035
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,119
"What's going to happen today?

1036
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:15,538
How's this going to get worse?"

1037
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:18,224
What else am I going
to do to ruin your life?

1038
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,525
No...

1039
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,860
Yeah.

1040
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:22,228
Maybe.

1041
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:26,299
I do want to blame you.

1042
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,502
I know things happen.

1043
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,271
They happen for no good reason.

1044
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,605
I see it every day

1045
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,674
but when it's happening to you

1046
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,577
you want it to be
somebody's fault.

1047
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,092
I haven't told anybody at work.

1048
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,233
Still play poker on Tuesdays.

1049
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,668
Shoot hoops on Saturdays.

1050
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,573
Some of the guys I
could tell, some I couldn't.

1051
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,310
But, uh...

1052
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,698
none of them would ever
treat me the same again.

1053
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,492
You don't deserve this.

1054
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,266
Neither do you.

1055
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,974
So, what's in store
for tonight, the usual?

1056
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,677
Karate class, a couple
of laps around the track...

1057
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,822
Actually, my goal

1058
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,180
is to stay awake
through the 10:00 news.

1059
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,115
Ah. How's Susan's
apartment working out?

1060
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,263
I don't know why
I was so worried

1061
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,197
about where I was going to live.

1062
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,232
I'm never there.

1063
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,221
Look, I'm sorry.

1064
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,468
Today, I was, uh...

1065
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,824
What was I today?

1066
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,160
Uh, officious, humorless,
pain in the ass.

1067
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,662
Yeah. Right. Thanks.

1068
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:46,929
You want to talk?

1069
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,108
I want to sleep.

1070
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,877
Look, it's...
nothing's the same.

1071
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,133
You notice that?

1072
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,569
It's just not fun
in there anymore.

1073
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,848
It was fun once?

1074
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,172
You know what I mean.

1075
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,173
<i>Sun-Times.</i>

1076
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,474
It's just...

1077
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,344
I'm up to my ears in
administrative problems.

1078
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,314
Kerry Weaver and I are
constantly butting heads

1079
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,648
and it's just like...

1080
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,483
the whole staff is lying to me.

1081
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,719
I used to think
of this as a family.

1082
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,887
Didn't it feel like that?

1083
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:12,933
Well, you got to remember

1084
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,769
my idea of a family
is a little screwed up.

1085
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:19,629
Look, Mark, it's
okay to miss her.

1086
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,964
No. It's more than that.

1087
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,877
Well, I think, whatever you do,

1088
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,635
you should keep it separate.

1089
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,115
My mom, she used
to work at this office,

1090
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,518
and she never put
a picture of me out,

1091
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,841
and I asked her why,

1092
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,577
and she said, "Never
confuse where you work

1093
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:35,911
with where you live."

1094
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,348
Your mom didn't work in the E.R.

1095
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,149
I just shared with you

1096
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,796
a very profound
childhood moment...

1097
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,163
Okay, I'm sorry.

1098
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,822
It's moving, and your
mother is a very wise woman.

1099
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,122
Thank you very much.

1100
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,059
I can't face going home
to another frozen dinner.

1101
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,139
Do you want to get a
burger or something?

1102
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:52,862
I can't tonight.

1103
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,196
I got this thing I got to do.

1104
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,276
But if you want to talk
later, you know where I'll be.

1105
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,878
No, I<i> don't</i> know where you are.

1106
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,771
Well, at home.
After 10:00. Alone.

1107
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:18,771
Dr. Benton. Hi.

1108
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:19,951
Hey.

1109
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:21,274
How was the surgery?

1110
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:24,010
Well, I, uh, missed out
on the thyroglossal duct

1111
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:26,996
but then a perfed
esophagus fell into my lap.

1112
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,031
Good. Great.

1113
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,348
Listen, uh...

1114
00:39:29,384 --> 00:39:31,596
Carter, I wanted to talk to you

1115
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,896
about your work.

1116
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,405
I, uh... I know I
don't usually give you

1117
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,240
a lot of feedback, but...

1118
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,225
you know, the fact is...

1119
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,676
you're doing good work.

1120
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,790
Yeah. I mean, you've, uh...

1121
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,097
your work has
consistently improved.

1122
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,532
You're more confident.

1123
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:49,068
You've become more proactive.

1124
00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:50,636
Great.

1125
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:52,934
Yeah. Now, listen,
there are still some areas

1126
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,491
that need improvement,
like focus, you know?

1127
00:39:57,379 --> 00:39:58,527
What?

1128
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,029
Focus, Carter.

1129
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,080
Focus.

1130
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,115
Yeah.

1131
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,027
Yeah. Anyway,
we'll work on that.

1132
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,184
Okay, great, good.

1133
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:06,463
Hey... I don't know.

1134
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,299
I just wanted
to tell you that...

1135
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,605
you're doing good work.

1136
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,607
Thanks.

1137
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:11,702
Yeah, um...

1138
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:12,992
Listen, I got to run.

1139
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:14,193
Uh...

1140
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:15,428
All right.

1141
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:16,540
All right.

1142
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:17,708
Good night, Carter.

1143
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:18,898
Good night.

1144
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:23,235
Hi.

1145
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,415
Okay, you...

1146
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:27,573
you just missed
Benton by a second.

1147
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:28,691
I saw him.

1148
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,010
I slowed to a stroll.

1149
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:32,912
I can hardly breathe.

1150
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,113
It's okay.

1151
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:36,389
Ah.

1152
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,338
Jeanie.

1153
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,246
About today...

1154
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,992
Mark Greene looked in my file.

1155
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,182
I know.

1156
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,517
I got a memo from
Anspaugh this evening.

1157
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,087
He set a time for
Mark and I to meet

1158
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,755
and discuss hospital policy.

1159
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,935
Okay.

1160
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,758
It's going to
remain confidential.

1161
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,105
I don't put much faith
in that around here.

1162
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,930
Maybe it's not going to
be as bad as you think.

1163
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,932
At least you're
dealing with doctors.

1164
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,901
There's<i> some</i> degree
of understanding

1165
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,303
about the disease
and how it's transmitted.

1166
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,938
Right.

1167
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,107
Right.

1168
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,441
Mm.

1169
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,144
Well... you know what?

1170
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,347
I'm starving.

1171
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,682
The aroma coming
from the cafeteria...

1172
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:30,019
isn't... well, it's
not<i> too</i> scary.

1173
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,054
Want to join me?

1174
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,360
Well?

1175
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,529
Hey, what are you doing here?

1176
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,364
Hey, I'm invested in this exam.

1177
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,532
And I helped you study.

1178
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:43,700
How did we do?

1179
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,879
We did pretty good.
I think we got lucky.

1180
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:46,536
Ah, luck nothing.

1181
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:47,403
You know what you did?

1182
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,649
You earned yourself a night out.

1183
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,084
A couple of
Manhattans straight up...

1184
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,742
Carol! What did you get
on that fireman question?

1185
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:53,921
35 Newtons.

1186
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,144
All right!

1187
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,457
Doug, you remember William?

1188
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,491
How you doing, William?

1189
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,848
How's it going, Doug. So...

1190
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,027
the entropy question?

1191
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,061
Rudolf Clausius.

1192
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,785
Yes! Man, I'm starved.

1193
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,820
Anybody feel like ice cream?

1194
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,457
Lead the way, William.

1195
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:15,909
You all right?

1196
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,032
Yup.

1197
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,247
Thanks for bringing
the extra boots.

1198
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:20,914
I know they're a little big.

1199
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,539
Oh, just three or
four sizes, that's all!

1200
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,408
You want to carry the axe?

1201
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:26,809
No. No, thank you.

1202
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,723
Oh! So what are we looking for?

1203
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,380
We're looking for that...

1204
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,448
A Douglas fir with
perfect branches

1205
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:34,450
and a very, very thin trunk.

1206
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,886
Uh-huh. Well, are
you sure this is legal?

1207
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,721
Whose land is this?

1208
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:39,722
It's our land.

1209
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,691
What, as in public land?

1210
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,226
As in, uh...

1211
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,562
see that light coming
through those trees?

1212
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:49,165
The smoke coming
out of that chimney?

1213
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,733
No.

1214
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:51,901
There. Right... there.

1215
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,569
No.

1216
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:54,837
No? Well, it's there

1217
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,939
and it's the house I grew up in.

1218
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,976
Tell me we're not going to have
cocoa with your parents later.

1219
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,312
No. You're safe.

1220
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:04,113
They're in London.

1221
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,682
Oh, look!

1222
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:07,016
Look!

1223
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,551
It's the perfect tree!

1224
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,219
All right. Stand back.

1225
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,088
Did I ever tell you about
my lumberjack fantasy?

1226
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,191
Abby, this is a very
sacred tradition.

1227
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,293
Oh, it's a sacred fantasy.

1228
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:25,117
Let me turn you
into a little snowman.

1229
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:26,452
Don't you dare!

1230
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:27,798
That is not part
of your fantasy.

1231
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,767
That is not part
of your fantasy!
