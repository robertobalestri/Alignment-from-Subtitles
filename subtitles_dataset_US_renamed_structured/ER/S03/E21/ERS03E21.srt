1
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:17,532
Is Dr. Benton done with
that thyroidectomy yet?

2
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:19,067
So he's still in there?

3
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:27,542
Dr. Benton...

4
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,210
Carter, what are you doing here?

5
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:30,545
Let's get an ABG in 20 minutes.

6
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,347
I thought you were
covering the ER today.

7
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:33,348
I'm on in a few.

8
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:34,861
Listen, I need to talk to you.

9
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:36,551
Well, you better make it fast.

10
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:38,353
I've got two
admissions, a clinic

11
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,066
and an aneurysm with Dean Rowe.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,557
I've been thinking about that
kidney donor case last week...

13
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:45,627
The one where I left to go check
on the patients during the debriefing.

14
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:46,806
Instead of listening to two

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,908
of the finest transplant
surgeons in the country.

16
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:50,064
Yeah, I guess so.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,000
And I've just been wondering,

18
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,135
you know, I don't know, maybe...

19
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,070
maybe I'm in the wrong place.

20
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,183
Well, if you're still here

21
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,251
in two minutes, you are.

22
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,441
No, I mean surgery.

23
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,143
Obviously, I love it, and I
still feel very challenged by it,

24
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:04,996
but are there ever days where
you don't feel quite satisfied?

25
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,026
Carter, sometimes,
the patient dies.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,617
Yeah, I know, but otherwise?

27
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,618
Otherwise what?

28
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,154
Well, it just feels like
sometimes they exist

29
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:13,555
for us to do procedures.

30
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,668
Well, that's what
they come here for.

31
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:18,627
And we don't need to know
anything else about them,

32
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,028
like how worried they are

33
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,896
or where they
went to high school

34
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,865
or whether they
like cats or dogs?

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,445
Carter, what are
you talking about?

36
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,336
Sometimes, I like to
know the other stuff.

37
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,337
What for?

38
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:29,372
I mean, if you...

39
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:34,343
Oh, damn, um... listen,
we'll, uh... talk later.

40
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,824
I'm telling you it was
at least 50 questions

41
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:38,958
about my family background.

42
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,293
Nothing like the
head of security

43
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:41,361
to make you feel insecure.

44
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:42,562
He almost withheld my photo ID,

45
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:44,620
because I didn't know my
stepmother's maiden name.

46
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,321
Who knows their
stepmother's maiden name?

47
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:47,567
He didn't cut you much slack

48
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,835
on that picture there, either.

49
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,171
You'd think I was walking in
the front door of the White House.

50
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,227
Which is easier.

51
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,228
I've done it.

52
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:55,308
Randi, can you get
these over to Radiology?

53
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:56,298
Now?

54
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,011
Unless you're doing
something urgent

55
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,045
that I can't quite see, go.

56
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,069
Yo, Dr. Ross...

57
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,069
Yeah?

58
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,137
Pedes called.

59
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,251
You're covering deliveries
for John Lavagnino.

60
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,752
Broke his kneecap
playing soccer.

61
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:06,975
Okay, good morning to you.

62
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,976
Oh, not for Anna.

63
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,956
She just had her security
clearance interview.

64
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,491
Oh, yeah, you get
stripped searched?

65
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:12,692
They check for track marks?

66
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,682
Practically, yeah.

67
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:14,683
They're cracking down

68
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,185
because of what
happened to Mark.

69
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,486
He starts back today, right?

70
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,831
I wish he'd take another week.

71
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,489
Let's make sure
we're grabbing cases.

72
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:22,424
Keep his load light
for the first few days.

73
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,870
I don't want him working at all.

74
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,506
I want him helping me plan
Carol's surprise birthday party.

75
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,530
Doug...

76
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,530
Happy birthday, Carol.

77
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:29,909
I got vomiting
and diarrhea in 4.

78
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:30,532
Happy birthday.

79
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:31,768
Thank you.

80
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:34,080
I'm taking the quadruple
bounce-back migraine in 5.

81
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:36,405
Nothing like drug-seeking
behavior to start your day.

82
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,319
Doug, you promised me you
wouldn't tell anybody about my birthday.

83
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:40,475
That was last year.

84
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:42,155
Yeah, and you told
everybody then, too.

85
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,179
At least I'm consistent.

86
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:44,195
Ugh! Hey!

87
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,066
All right, coffee can wait.

88
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,774
What's this?

89
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,543
Uh, it's a coffeepot.

90
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,290
<i>That</i> is not a coffeepot.

91
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,113
It's called a French press.

92
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,193
Oh, no more aluminum percolator?

93
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,719
No, we're going to have
great coffee, which can wait.

94
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:09,788
What's that?

95
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,789
Uh, the microwave.

96
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,624
I'm just heating up
some cinnamon buns.

97
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,625
The microwave.

98
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,694
Mm-hmm.

99
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,940
I always wanted a microwave.

100
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,263
I know.

101
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,943
But you would
never let me get one.

102
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,912
You said that it broke
down the vitamins.

103
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,703
I know. I'm sorry, I was wrong.

104
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,471
Now, just come back over here.

105
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,872
This is nice.

106
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,242
I mean, this is really nice.

107
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,244
What happened?

108
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,412
She's getting close...
Nine centimeters.

109
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,413
What?!

110
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,414
I'm all right, Peter.

111
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,383
She fell and her
contractions are strong.

112
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,085
They went from four
to nine in no time.

113
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,430
Why didn't you call me sooner?

114
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,699
Last time they gave me
that stuff, and it was fine.

115
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,368
Couldn't you have
done something else?

116
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,491
Peter, this baby's coming.

117
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,725
What are you talking about?

118
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,726
It's two months early.

119
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,095
I know that.

120
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,496
You should have called me.

121
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,709
I just did, hoping
that you might want

122
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,111
to participate in the
birth of your child.

123
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,812
If that's what you'd like to do,

124
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:57,947
I suggest you gown-up

125
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,604
and get in here.

126
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,739
Hi.

127
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,918
Dr. Greene, right?

128
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:09,908
How are you?

129
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:10,909
I'm fine, thank you.

130
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:11,910
Who are you?

131
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:12,956
Anna Del Amico.

132
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,145
We met last week.

133
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,358
We didn't actually meet,

134
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,393
but I was there when
you were attacked.

135
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,517
Oh, in the men's room?

136
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,296
No, in the trauma
room afterwards.

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,731
I don't remember either room,

138
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,399
so I don't remember you either.

139
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,089
I start my emergency
residency in July.

140
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,992
I'm doing an ER Pedes
elective until then.

141
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,292
That was my first day.

142
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,373
I'm sorry it had
to be so exciting.

143
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,731
No, I'm just glad you're okay.

144
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,165
So... welcome back.

145
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
Thank you.

146
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,118
Where is everybody?

147
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,898
Mark, what're you doing here?

148
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,222
Getting back to work.

149
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,697
Doug and Carol are
bringing in an MVA.

150
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,996
Hi.

151
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,375
Hey, Mark, how are you doing?

152
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,365
Mark, welcome back.

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,366
It's nice to be back.

154
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,367
What do we got?

155
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,479
Bicycle versus tour bus.

156
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,870
Don't worry, buddy, we got it.

157
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:56,404
All right, you
just take it easy.

158
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,873
Settle in, nice and easy.

159
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:59,119
Dr. Greene, you look great.

160
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:00,108
Dr. Ross, OB called.

161
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,676
They need you for that delivery.

162
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,111
They said it's kind of urgent.

163
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,112
Find Dr. Del Amico.

164
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:05,225
See if she can take it.

165
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,592
Mark, I'll talk to you later.

166
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,150
She's at the desk.

167
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,262
Who?

168
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,586
Dr. Del Amico...
She's at the desk.

169
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,854
Oh, right, thanks.

170
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:13,899
Help me shift her down.

171
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:14,889
Breathe, Carla.

172
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:15,890
Come on, baby, breathe.

173
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:16,891
You can do it.

174
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:18,271
How much mag did you give her?

175
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,427
Six-gram load.

176
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,540
Had her on three an hour
until she hit four centimeters.

177
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:22,763
Then we had to let her go.

178
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,099
Dorgan, scalp electrode.

179
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,367
Keep breathing, Carla.

180
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,479
You're doing great.

181
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,470
Dorgan... what
kind of name is that?

182
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:30,016
Irish, through and through.

183
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,201
We've a lot of experience
having a lot of babies.

184
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,769
Is she at risk for
chorioamnionitis?

185
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,143
Come on, Carla, breathe.

186
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,423
Don't yell at me, damn it!

187
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:39,697
Did you give her any
antenatal steroids?

188
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,015
12 milligrams betamethasone.

189
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:42,250
What about her blood sugar?

190
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:43,684
She's got gestational diabetes.

191
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,897
You're doing great, Carla.

192
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:45,998
You just hang in there.

193
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,566
It's not going to
be much longer.

194
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,368
You're going to be
able to push soon.

195
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,591
What about a second dose?

196
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:52,460
This baby's going to have RDS.

197
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,012
Peter, what is RDS?

198
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,047
It's okay, Carla.

199
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,042
It just means that
the baby's lungs...

200
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,266
They haven't matured yet.

201
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,267
What?

202
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,936
You hold her hand,
you help her breathe,

203
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:03,337
you help her focus.

204
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,551
That's your only job here, okay?

205
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:06,819
Now, get over there

206
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,144
and help the
mother of your child.

207
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,496
There'll be two additional
security cameras here.

208
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,176
And two at the
employees' entrance.

209
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
That's right.

210
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,334
Now, the ambulance bay
doors will be changed over

211
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,535
to bulletproof glass,

212
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,671
which we'll also add
to your triage section.

213
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,174
The hospital has agreed
to additional armed security

214
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,209
in your waiting room.

215
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,409
What about the bathrooms?

216
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,844
Any security cameras in there?

217
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,179
Unfortunately, privacy issues

218
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,379
won't allow us to do that.

219
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,714
Yeah, my assailant's privacy

220
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,416
would have definitely
been violated.

221
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,362
We can only do what
we can do, Dr. Greene.

222
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,430
Thank you, Mr. Biggers.

223
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,954
It's nice to see
you up and around,

224
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,222
but what are you doing here?

225
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,501
Working.

226
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,203
It's nice to see
you, too, Chuny.

227
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,961
Mark, these additional
security measures may not help,

228
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,029
but they can't hurt.

229
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,441
I think everyone
is overreacting.

230
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,343
What we should really
be changing is the way

231
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,112
we deal with patients
and their families.

232
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,713
Yeah, can't we keep
them out of here.

233
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,881
They're a pain in the ass.

234
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,582
Your compassion
knows no bounds, Randi.

235
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,006
Oh, Detective Warrington called.

236
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,086
He can't make it by
until later this afternoon.

237
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,076
Okay.

238
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,923
You think that's who did this...

239
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,691
Some patient or family member?

240
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,015
I think that gives
them a good reason.

241
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,651
Louise Pierson: ankle
X ray three hours ago.

242
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,719
Where is it?

243
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,856
Discharge orders written
over an hour and a half ago.

244
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,391
The chart's still here,
so the guy's still here.

245
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,945
Med-surg admission: 5:30
this morning... still here.

246
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,981
Neuro consult, ETA
7:15 this morning.

247
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:20,982
Where are they?

248
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,695
We keep these
people hanging around.

249
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,119
I'd get pissed off enough
to clobber somebody.

250
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,599
Before Records clobbers me,

251
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,367
I need you to sign
off these charts

252
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,357
from last week.

253
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:30,524
Okay, I got them.

254
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,413
I'm fine.

255
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,650
Push, push.

256
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,651
You're almost there.

257
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,718
Keep going, keep going.

258
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,686
Hi, I'm Del Amico from pedes.

259
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,687
Janet Coburn.

260
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,000
I thought Ross was covering.

261
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,134
He's got a teenager MVA.

262
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,592
This is Carla Reese...
mother... Peter Benton... father.

263
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,204
Hey, how're you
doing there, Carla?

264
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,394
You just keep on pushing,

265
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,441
so I can take a look
at this little baby.

266
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,865
Mr. Benton, how are you doing?

267
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,632
It's Dr. Benton.

268
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,833
He's a surgical resident.

269
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,913
What are you, new here?

270
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,577
Came over from
Children's in Philadelphia.

271
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,336
Are you a resident?

272
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,504
Yes, that would be correct.

273
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,484
How many deliveries
did you attend?

274
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,241
I stopped counting around 200.

275
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,611
We've got a late
D-cell here, Dr. Coburn.

276
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,845
Carla's at 32 weeks.

277
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,575
Any meconium? No, fluid's clear.

278
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,582
Heart rate's dropping.

279
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,617
Where's the NICU nurse?

280
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,483
On her way.

281
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,384
Down to 120.

282
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,319
Why isn't he coming?

283
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,687
He's coming, baby, he's coming.

284
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,733
All right, let's get
this baby out of here.

285
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,302
Dorgan, I need
vacuum extraction.

286
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,692
Why vacuum extraction?

287
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,693
We're at 100 here.

288
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,893
That's why.

289
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,562
Number for respiratory therapy?

290
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,397
3-3-9-4.

291
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,916
Uh... I brought
some stuff in today,

292
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,852
because I knew
you'd be starting back.

293
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,421
What are you doing?

294
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,922
Well, you know,

295
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:37,725
I know you're going to
be a little resistant to this,

296
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,143
but you'll feel a lot safer

297
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,818
if you carry something
on you for a while.

298
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,613
I don't even know
what this stuff is.

299
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,926
I've got cops in my family,

300
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,129
so I can get anything...
Electronic stun gun,

301
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,518
personal Taser.

302
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,153
I don't think so.

303
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,766
Well, at least take
the pepper spray.

304
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,425
I appreciate it, really,
but, uh... it's not for me.

305
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,238
I'm not suggesting that
you start packing a gun,

306
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,589
although that's what I do.

307
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:58,880
You carry a gun?

308
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,559
Under the front seat of my car.

309
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,094
I was at the drive-thru once,

310
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,384
waiting for some fries,

311
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,021
and this punk walks up,
sticks a knife in my face

312
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,132
and wants my wallet.

313
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:08,917
So I reach under the
seat, grab the .357,

314
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,026
stick it up his nose, and,
whoa, could that kid run.

315
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,512
Dr. Greene, welcome back.

316
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,947
Thanks.

317
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,616
Thanks, Maggie, but I'm
going to pass on the armaments.

318
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,096
Carter, are you
in the ER all day?

319
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,085
Yeah.

320
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,021
Great, because I
think I'll need your help.

321
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,356
I don't really have full
mobility yet for procedures.

322
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,624
Uh-huh, what is this stuff?

323
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,500
Well, I was just trying
to get Dr. Greene to...

324
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,379
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

325
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,525
Sit down, sit down.

326
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,248
Maggie, help me!

327
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:33,914
Just sit! Just sit!

328
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,361
All right, I'll get a nurse.

329
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,351
I'll be right back.

330
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,352
Just don't move.

331
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,520
Don't touch your eyes.

332
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,383
That's it, Carla,
push, push, push.

333
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,041
Come on, Carla, breathe.

334
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:43,975
We got him.

335
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,177
It's okay, baby.

336
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,178
It's okay.

337
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,379
Blue and floppy.

338
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,562
Peter, what is it?

339
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,886
I can't hear him.

340
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:55,903
What is it?

341
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:56,904
What's going on?

342
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,905
What's wrong?

343
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,974
Suction.

344
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,643
I don't like his color.

345
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,278
Come on.

346
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:04,923
Come on, little
guy, pink up for us.

347
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,364
Come on, let's go.

348
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,782
What's the Apgar?

349
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:08,950
What's the Apgar?!

350
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:09,751
Peter, back off.

351
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:11,051
Let her work.

352
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,388
Muscle tone
zero, one for reflex.

353
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,406
Two for heart rate.

354
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,667
One-minute Apgar,
four out of ten.

355
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,091
What are you doing?!

356
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,026
You got to do something!

357
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:20,845
Peter, please tell
me what's going on.

358
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,213
It's okay, baby.

359
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,648
It's okay.

360
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,066
They got him.

361
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,261
He's got retractions.

362
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,086
I need to tube him.

363
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,364
2.5.

364
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,755
Heart rate down.

365
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,773
Eighty-five.

366
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,442
Start compressions.

367
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,860
Draw up .02 epi.

368
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:36,911
Dorgan, call the NICU.

369
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,312
Tell them we're on the way.

370
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,930
I'm sorry!

371
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,599
I know it's not funny, but...

372
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,367
No, it's funny.

373
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,847
My whole life is just

374
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,137
one big fun fest.

375
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:04,505
Anspaugh hates me.

376
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,275
Benton looks at me like
I'm some kind of an alien.

377
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,877
Well, I think those things
are in your favor, actually.

378
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:10,945
Right, thank you.

379
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,909
So when you were thinking

380
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,483
about med school, you
were willing to start over?

381
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:16,484
All that work?

382
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,252
As opposed to your
five, six more years

383
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,488
of surgical residency
you've got ahead of you?

384
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:21,922
I guess I see your point.

385
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,975
Carter, are you back
among the living?

386
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,944
Yes, absolutely.

387
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,128
We've got an MVA coming

388
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,848
in six, seven minutes.

389
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,050
I know it's not my place to say,

390
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,785
but he looks kind of bad.

391
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,321
Are you okay there, Carla?

392
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,157
I'm just going to get
everything ready for you.

393
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,225
I'll be right back.

394
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,227
Just hang in there, Carla.

395
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,596
You're almost there.

396
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,165
Peter...

397
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,602
what are we going to do?

398
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,503
Have you seen him?

399
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:56,557
I'll go check on him as
soon as I get you settled.

400
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,792
Just take it easy.

401
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:58,926
Shh.

402
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,261
It'll be a couple of minutes.

403
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,596
Housekeeping hasn't finished.

404
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:02,763
Okay.

405
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:25,319
One, two, three.

406
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,321
Rib?

407
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:28,322
Yeah.

408
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:30,135
We're going to
kick you out of here.

409
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,904
Normal vital signs,
oxygen at five liters.

410
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,205
You mind if I steal some saline?

411
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,195
Go ahead, help yourself.

412
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,941
Pupils are equal and reactive.

413
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:37,365
No haemotympanum.

414
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,050
Chest is clear,
abdomen soft and flat.

415
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,619
Pulse is 80, BP 120/75.

416
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,765
What's his name?

417
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,866
Harry Smith.

418
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,872
Harry, can you hear me?

419
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,101
Do you know where you are?

420
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,224
Order something.

421
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,488
CBC, chem seven,
type and screen.

422
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:50,979
Want a dip of urine?

423
00:13:51,014 --> 00:13:53,481
Yeah, let's get a
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

424
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,526
Police said it was a DUI?

425
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,844
The guy was swerving
in and out of lanes

426
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,879
on the Eisenhower
only going about 35.

427
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:58,769
Then he hit a light pole.

428
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,016
Let's get a blood alcohol level.

429
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,439
There's no alcohol

430
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,673
on his breath.

431
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,719
Hey, thanks for the supplies.

432
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:04,875
Anytime.

433
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,412
Whoa!

434
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,447
Okay, get some Ativan, two migs!

435
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,594
Where's Tabash?

436
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,322
Well, he's with another patient.

437
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,340
What's he ordered?

438
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,609
Everything.

439
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,577
CBC, lytes, blood
cultures, what?

440
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:57,812
Yes, all that.

441
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,146
ABG, chest X ray?

442
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,247
Yes.

443
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:01,482
Dr. Benton.

444
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:06,320
Your son is stable
at the moment.

445
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,233
What labs have you ordered?

446
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,324
We've done a
complete septic workup.

447
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,369
No, I need to know

448
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,005
exactly what you've ordered...

449
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,573
What, uh, labs,
what antibiotics.

450
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:18,132
Dr. Benton, your
son's heart rate is 170,

451
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,452
and his pulse ox is
91 on 100% oxygen.

452
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,904
We've taken a chest X ray,

453
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
drawn blood for
CBC, lytes and ABG

454
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,641
and sent off a blood culture,

455
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,595
a urine culture, an
endotracheal aspirate culture

456
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,912
a spinal fluid culture

457
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:34,665
and started him on 100
milligrams of ampicillin

458
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,584
and six milligrams
of gentamicin.

459
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:37,652
He was hypotensive

460
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,498
with a blood pressure of 30/18,

461
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,801
so he's received
five percent albumin...

462
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:44,658
10cc's per kilo... And
we've started dopamine...

463
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,593
Five mics per kilo per minute.

464
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,464
And we'll titrate
to a map of 40.

465
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,500
Now, what you need to know...

466
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,938
What you need to share
with this child's mother...

467
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:59,740
Is that at the moment
the baby is stable,

468
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,108
but critically ill.

469
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:03,894
Probably has a serious
infection in his blood,

470
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,779
and we don't know if his lungs

471
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,848
can provide enough
oxygen to sustain life.

472
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,317
Unfortunately, we have no choice

473
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,769
but to wait and see
how he responds

474
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,604
to the present therapy.

475
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,040
Let's see how he's
doing in an hour,

476
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,075
and that's when
we should talk again.

477
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,980
What's your son's
name, Dr. Benton?

478
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,120
He doesn't have one.

479
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,409
Carol, hi.

480
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,456
I've got some good
news and bad news.

481
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,413
You're going to tell
me both, so go ahead.

482
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,493
The bad news is your
brothers and sisters-in-arms

483
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,362
are planning a little
surprise birthday party

484
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,352
for you tonight.

485
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,387
You did this joke this morning.

486
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,122
This is real,
because I got invited.

487
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,168
Well, I'm not listening.

488
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:52,593
The good news is I know
you hate your birthday,

489
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,340
so I got you out of it.

490
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:56,330
I do not hate my birthday.

491
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:57,877
You've always
hated your birthday,

492
00:16:57,901 --> 00:16:59,378
so I told them you
cannot make it,

493
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,080
because you're
having dinner with me.

494
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,070
I do not believe a word of this.

495
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,873
How many people wished
you a happy birthday today?

496
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,152
Just Kerry this morning.

497
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:09,243
And how many people know

498
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,711
that it<i> is</i> your birthday?

499
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,046
You know theirs, right?

500
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,193
Yeah, we've worked
together for years.

501
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:15,516
What is the one reason

502
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,919
why you don't wish
someone happy birthday

503
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,520
when it<i> is</i> their birthday?

504
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,488
Because they're
planning a surprise party.

505
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:22,701
That's all I'm saying.

506
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,908
Why is it I feel you've
trapped me into this.

507
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:25,909
Trapped you?

508
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:26,910
I saved you.

509
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,908
You should be buying me dinner.

510
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:30,892
I'll pick you up anytime.

511
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,017
You name the place.

512
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,436
Got some gauze out here.

513
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,167
Okay, I'm out of here
as of an hour ago.

514
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,404
Randi, can you send that Carla
Reese chart up to OB, please?

515
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,393
Sure, I got it.

516
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,095
Did you say Carla Reese?

517
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,891
She delivered about an hour ago.

518
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,348
Carla?

519
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:48,427
You know her?

520
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:49,684
No, not really.

521
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,084
She came through

522
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,603
the ER a month or so ago.

523
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,471
She wasn't near being due.

524
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,134
The baby's only 32
weeks... a little boy.

525
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,491
Is he okay?

526
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:59,043
I don't know.

527
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,043
He's in the NICU.

528
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,823
Apgar was poor, had to intubate.

529
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,891
It's touch-and-go.

530
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,315
Is she doing all right?

531
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,161
She didn't have
other complications,

532
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,362
if that's what you mean.

533
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,864
I don't know how many
preemies I've resuscitated,

534
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,201
but somehow I still
haven't gotten used to it.

535
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,724
I'll see you all tomorrow.

536
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,725
See you.

537
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,327
Jeanie, were you
taking that woman

538
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,662
with the eye pain,
or was that Maggie?

539
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,663
No, I'm taking her.

540
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,664
I'm just about to head in.

541
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,910
Don't keep the patients waiting.

542
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,412
They might get
angry and beat you up.

543
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,268
Dr. Greene's on a bit

544
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,236
of a rampage about that.

545
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,470
He'll settle back in.

546
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,183
He just needs a
couple more days.

547
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,218
<i>Hey, Mark.</i>

548
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,224
Hey, Doug.

549
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,103
I've been missing
you all day today.

550
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,305
How you doing?

551
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,229
Feels good to be back.

552
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:36,430
Not too soon?

553
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,766
No, I mean, it was nice
having time with Rachel,

554
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,201
but a week at home
is about all I could take.

555
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:42,848
Yeah, so any word
from the police?

556
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,038
They're going to
come by this afternoon.

557
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:48,075
I gave them a list of names
of patients and family members

558
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,678
who might have had
reason to be that angry...

559
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,680
At least the ones
I can remember.

560
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,025
So you're okay with this?

561
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,215
Yes and no.

562
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,718
It hasn't been the most
pleasant experience,

563
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,553
but it's kind of a wake-up call,

564
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,623
you know, a reminder that
I can be abrupt with people,

565
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,658
and it will sure
as hell backfire.

566
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:05,659
Hey, Doug...

567
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:06,839
Yes.

568
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:09,563
You've got a five-year-old
with a wrist fracture in 4.

569
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,176
Child in pain...
Music to my ears.

570
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,840
I'll catch up with you
later, get some lunch?

571
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,565
I'm so sorry, Peter.

572
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,772
The chest X ray showed
a diffused, patchy infiltrate,

573
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,710
and the endotracheal aspirate

574
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,346
showed gram-negative bacteria.

575
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,483
He's got pneumonia,
sepsis, premature lungs

576
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,753
and respiratory
distress syndrome.

577
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:54,925
They just gave him surfactant
to try to open up his lungs.

578
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,627
How's Carla doing?

579
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,915
She asked me to
wait outside in the hall.

580
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,448
You probably haven't shared this

581
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,766
with anyone, have you...

582
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,607
Your family, people
you work with?

583
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,864
You do have friends, Peter...

584
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,584
A community.

585
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,622
I hope everything
will be all right.

586
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:37,034
And you need to stop
standing in the hall.

587
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,663
Just keep your hands
on your sides, Mr. Lensky.

588
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:50,664
I can't.

589
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:51,731
It hurts.

590
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:52,999
Yes, I think we know that.

591
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:55,803
Pulse is 130, BP is 180/95.

592
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,137
Pre-op labs?

593
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,138
Yeah.

594
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,373
And you've been taking

595
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:00,924
a lot of ibuprofen lately?

596
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,011
Uh, yeah, about
eight tablets a day.

597
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,541
That's because I
twisted my knee,

598
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,281
not because of this stomachache.

599
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:08,543
Dr. Carter,

600
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,195
do you have a minute?

601
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,201
Sure.

602
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,003
Connie, let's get an
upright chest X ray

603
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,705
and give ten of
morphine, slow I.V. push.

604
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,457
That'll help with
your pain, Mr. Lensky.

605
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,603
I'll be right back.

606
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,053
I'm just double-checking.

607
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,195
This guy's the writhing
and groaning in Exam 2

608
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,729
that Dr. Greene was
concerned about?

609
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,476
Yeah, but I didn't
know he was concerned.

610
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,600
He was worried the
guy was waiting too long

611
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:27,734
for a surgical consult.

612
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,814
Well, Mr. Lensky's got
a boardlike abdomen,

613
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,078
absent bowel sounds

614
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,185
and rebound and guarding
in all four quadrants.

615
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,209
A perfed ulcer?

616
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:35,887
Sounds like it.
I ordered a film.

617
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:37,378
Have Anspaugh check it out.

618
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:38,457
Okay.

619
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:39,613
Colles fracture.

620
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:41,448
Going to have to do
a closed reduction?

621
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:43,584
Yep, his dad still too
flipped out to watch?

622
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:45,363
His dad's sacked
out in curtain 3,

623
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,332
having self-medicated
with ten of Valium.

624
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:48,488
Well, that's helpful.

625
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,323
Maybe we should get
a lollipop for Russell.

626
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,324
Fentanyl oralet?

627
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,593
Mellow him out.

628
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:55,473
I'm going to have to order
it from Central Pharmacy.

629
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:57,330
Okay, well, we
can try it without.

630
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,332
Russell, what we're
going to do here, buddy...

631
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:02,614
I'll just get that lollipop.

632
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,004
Yeah, get right on it.

633
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,918
I want to give
it a little longer,

634
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:08,453
but basically, the
surfactant didn't do much.

635
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,321
He's still requiring 100% oxygen

636
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:12,624
with high pressures
on the ventilator.

637
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:15,348
Okay, well, his mother
is going to want to know

638
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,150
everything that might happen.

639
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:19,230
Dr. Benton, every parent in here

640
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,299
wants to know what might happen.

641
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,168
We just can't know for sure.

642
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:28,762
You know, I did a Pedes
Surgery elective earlier this year,

643
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,432
but I'm not up to speed
on all the, uh... sequelae.

644
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:34,601
You mean like retinopathy?

645
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,582
Yeah, exactly,
although his eyesight

646
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,189
should be the least of
our worries right now.

647
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,235
We need to be more concerned

648
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,138
about intraventricular
hemorrhage,

649
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,812
periventricular leucomalacia,

650
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,357
necrotizing enterocolitis,

651
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,178
and in a few weeks,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

652
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,667
All right, what do we do?

653
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,718
Well, I'm concerned

654
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:54,337
about the high vent pressures
causing lung damage,

655
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,218
so I want to switch him over

656
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,226
to an oscillating
ventilator, and we wait.

657
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,049
Hey, Dr. Greene,
you got a second?

658
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,395
Yeah, what is it?

659
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,618
I got the head CT
back on Harry Smith...

660
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,820
The slow-moving
MVA from this morning.

661
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,189
It's negative, no bleed,

662
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,041
but I was talking to his mother,

663
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,659
who was filling out
some paperwork.

664
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,311
She said Harry was on his way

665
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:19,747
to a preemployment
physical for a new job.

666
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:22,416
She also let it drop that
she was pretty relieved

667
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:25,118
that the cops didn't find
any marijuana on him.

668
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,071
Carter, is this leading
to helping the patient?

669
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,773
His urine is like water.

670
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,091
Check this out.

671
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,626
Specific gravity: 10-0-5.

672
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,427
Uh-huh, I think we
should give him Lasix.

673
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:35,912
It might be hyponatremia.

674
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,064
Water intoxication?

675
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,016
If he's worried about
a urine drug test,

676
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,634
maybe he thinks he can dilute it

677
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,303
or wash out his
system or something.

678
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,548
Dr. Greene, transfer that LOL

679
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:44,983
back to her nursing home.

680
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,574
Did you hear anything
from that police detective...

681
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,987
The one who said
he was coming by?

682
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,489
Haven't heard, haven't seen.

683
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,390
That's a good thought, Carter.

684
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,609
Why don't you call the lab

685
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,077
and see if his lytes are back?

686
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,801
Okay.

687
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,286
Does that hurt?

688
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,555
That's why Dr. Ross
gave you that shot.

689
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:02,734
Nurse Hathaway...

690
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,803
She's going to pull
down on your arm,

691
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:05,904
and I'm going to push.

692
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:07,806
We're going to
pop that little bone

693
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,113
right here right
back in place, okay?

694
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,242
Ready to start?

695
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,415
Where's my dad?

696
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,197
Uh...

697
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,171
Taking a nap.

698
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:21,742
Uh, but he wanted
us to be here with you.

699
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:23,327
He sings to me.

700
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:27,497
He sings to you, does he?

701
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,815
So you'll do it?

702
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,937
Oh, I think Dr. Ross would
love to sing to you, Russell.

703
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:38,208
Yeah, you know, Nurse
Hathaway would like to join in,

704
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,205
but she doesn't know the words.

705
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,563
Oh, I believe I do,
too, know the words

706
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:45,932
to whatever it is Dr. Ross
is going to sing to you.

707
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,319

00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,878
You brought me all the
way down here for this?

722
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:22,002
I think he might have
perfed his stomach ulcer.

723
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:23,147
Well, of course he has.

724
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,149
There's free air
under the diaphragm.

725
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:26,685
It's a slam-dunk, no-brainer.

726
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,186
Drop an NG, consent him

727
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,491
and redline him to the OR.

728
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:32,696
Carter,

729
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,475
I realize you needed backup,

730
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,201
but any senior resident
could've handle this.

731
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:40,237
So please think twice next time.

732
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,554
Good news, Mr. Lensky.

733
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,956
We'll be able to fix
you up right away.

734
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,045
What is it?

735
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,826
You have an ulcer
which has eaten

736
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,627
through the lining
of your stomach,

737
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,929
but, with surgery,
can be easily repaired.

738
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:55,953
Surgery?

739
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,466
Yeah, it's a fairly routine...

740
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,622
I can't do surgery.

741
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,735
Well, let me explain.

742
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,319
It really is the only option.

743
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:02,176
No, I feel better.

744
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:03,221
That's the morphine.

745
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:04,740
Nothing's really changed
with your condition.

746
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,325
Mr. Lensky, wait a
second, listen to me.

747
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:09,333
No, you listen to<i> me.</i>

748
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,362
I will not have surgery, and
you can't make me have it.

749
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:12,352
Now leave me alone.

750
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:13,369
I want to go.

751
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,573
Can you tell me why
you feel so strongly?

752
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,177
Something happen to you?

753
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,495
To somebody else?

754
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,862
Mr. Lensky, I'm
trying to help you here,

755
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,454
but I can't help
you if you leave,

756
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,471
and I can't help you

757
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,624
if you won't tell me
what the problem is.

758
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,770
Of all the stupid things...

759
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,706
the gallbladder.

760
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,509
Well, my dad was such a believer

761
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:55,879
in modern doctors,
modern medicines...

762
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,148
"Oh, pop this thing out.

763
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,384
I'll be home tomorrow."

764
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,086
58 years old,

765
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,822
and he dies having his
stupid gallbladder taken out.

766
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,025
And the surgeon...
All he could talk about

767
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,860
was how simple it was.

768
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,730
"No big deal."

769
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,567
Afterwards, he came
out to the waiting room,

770
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:19,436
he couldn't even look
my mother in the eye.

771
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:23,173
He gave us the news and
spouted some fancy medical words,

772
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:26,776
and all I could think was,
"You lying son of a bitch!"

773
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,650
We shouldn't have
believed him, Dr. Carter.

774
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:36,352
How can I believe you?

775
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:42,587
I stayed in there.

776
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,156
I talked to him about his
father's gallbladder operation.

777
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,357
I explained why his surgery

778
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,059
was going to be
completely different.

779
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,494
I couldn't get the guy to budge.

780
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:50,595
I don't know what to do.

781
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:51,518
Not much you can do.

782
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:52,352
It's his decision.

783
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:53,598
He needs to get to the OR...

784
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:54,588
Not to mention

785
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:56,868
Anspaugh's going to take
my head off one more time.

786
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,469
I know we can't
override the consent

787
00:27:58,493 --> 00:27:59,459
for emergency surgery.

788
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:01,361
No, we can't, but I
read a paper somewhere

789
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,964
about forme fruste... ulcers
that spontaneously seal off.

790
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,065
Do a paper-chase search,

791
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,366
see what you can come up with.

792
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,046
Maybe I should do
a hypaque upper GI.

793
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,987
See what's going on in there.

794
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,555
Good idea.

795
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,635
These labs came back
for you on Harry Smith.

796
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,892
Sodium 115?

797
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,160
I don't believe it.

798
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,161
I was right.

799
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,213
This guy's been
drinking buckets of water.

800
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:22,077
He's also waking up if you want

801
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,433
to talk to him.

802
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,236
Yeah, yeah, where's Dr. Greene?

803
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,015
Can I get you anything to drink?

804
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,273
Sure, I'll take a pop
if you've got one.

805
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,375
So it's good news.

806
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,710
All the leads you
gave us came out clear.

807
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:34,911
What?

808
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,381
Yeah, everyone checked out.

809
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,850
The patients, the families?

810
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,885
Everyone you gave us.

811
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,454
There wasn't anything on anyone?

812
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,857
Doc, usually people are
pretty glad to hear that.

813
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,576
They don't like things
happening in their own backyard.

814
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,711
Right.

815
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:53,780
Right.

816
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,766
Are you okay?

817
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,884
Sure.

818
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,753
I see you made a
pretty quick recovery.

819
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:06,176
Yeah, it wasn't as bad as I
thought it was going to be.

820
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,877
We'll keep
investigating, of course.

821
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,714
Got to go.

822
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,235
Dr. Greene...

823
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,536
Later, Carter.

824
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:18,905
I was right about the
water-intoxication guy.

825
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:19,906
His sodium is 115.

826
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:21,174
He drank three gallons.

827
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:22,453
That's great, Carter.

828
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:24,022
Great, terrific, wonderful.

829
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:25,286
Admit the medicine.

830
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,982
It's not that it's a better

831
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,117
or a worse option.

832
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,042
It just may be the only
other thing to consider.

833
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,678
Babies can respond
to inhaled nitric oxide,

834
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:43,891
and it can improve
their oxygenation.

835
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,699
In<i> full-term</i> babies.

836
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:46,900
That's correct.

837
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:49,336
It's still being studied
in premature infants.

838
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,582
We're participating

839
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:52,616
in a national multicenter trial.

840
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,092
There is a small series
which showed that nitric

841
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,762
did improve oxygenation
by 50% on average.

842
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,415
Now, half of those kids did
develop bleeding in the brain,

843
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,018
but no one knows if
the gas caused that.

844
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,520
Bleeding in the brain.

845
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,039
There would be a
risk of retardation

846
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,268
and cerebral palsy.

847
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:13,193
Yeah, but if we keep
doing what we're doing now,

848
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,063
then there's a risk of
permanent lung disease.

849
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:17,909
Yes, and possible brain damage

850
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:20,000
if the oxygen
level falls too low.

851
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:21,451
That's a hell of a choice.

852
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,020
How do I make that decision?

853
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,522
Dr. Benton, I wish I
could answer that question

854
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,539
for every parent

855
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,341
I talk to every single day.

856
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:29,475
Dr. Tabash?

857
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:32,029
Talk it over with
the baby's mother

858
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,529
and let me know soon.

859
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,864
Okay.

860
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,232
Excuse me.

861
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,475
Mark.

862
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,210
I'm an idiot, Kerry.

863
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,045
I'm a complete idiot.

864
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,215
Was that the police detective
you'd been waiting for?

865
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,733
It wasn't an angry patient.

866
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,403
It wasn't a family member
of an angry patient.

867
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,548
It wasn't Chris Law.

868
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:58,805
It wasn't Mr. Gunther.

869
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,290
It wasn't that crazy guy

870
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,886
who was yelling about Krishna.

871
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,376
They checked everybody out.

872
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:04,777
Yeah.

873
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:07,058
I thought I was
remembering it piece by piece

874
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,261
like a puzzle that
would all come together.

875
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,313
But the Chicago
Police Department

876
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,064
was nice enough to inform me

877
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,739
that I am simply the victim
of a random act of violence.

878
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:18,575
You knew that, Mark,
patient or no patient.

879
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,576
No, what I knew is

880
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,889
that everything I do
every day of my life,

881
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,725
I do because I'm not the victim.

882
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:24,793
I treat the victim.

883
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:25,782
I cure the victim.

884
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:27,629
I watch them roll the victim out

885
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,103
like a piece of
meat, but the truth is

886
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,916
I'm the piece of meat.

887
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,223
Yeah, but we can't
think about that, can we,

888
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,126
because we're the ones who
see what goes on out there.

889
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,328
We're the ones who
know every single day,

890
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,598
some child is not going to
make it home from school,

891
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,733
some father is not going
to make it home from work.

892
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,185
But if we allowed ourselves

893
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,820
to think that could be us,

894
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:49,289
we couldn't walk
out of our front door.

895
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,285
The problem is, that<i> is</i> us.

896
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:56,563
No, Mark, the problem is, it
makes us like everyone else.

897
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:19,563
Dr. Anspaugh, I was
just coming up to see you.

898
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:21,387
Where in the hell
is that perfed ulcer?

899
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:23,690
We should have had him
in and out two hours ago.

900
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:25,536
Actually, that's
why I wanted to talk.

901
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,939
Mr. Lensky prefers
not to have surgery.

902
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,729
Well, nobody <i>wants</i> surgery.

903
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:30,808
So... what?

904
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:32,699
I've discovered he
doesn't really need it.

905
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:33,778
Of course he needs it.

906
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:34,717
There's a hole in his stomach.

907
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,403
If we don't repair
that perf, he's at risk

908
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,434
for peritonitis, sepsis, death.

909
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,424
If you look, there's the ulcer,

910
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,192
but there actually is no leak.

911
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,611
It spontaneously sealed
itself off against the liver.

912
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:47,058
This patient was
redlined to the OR.

913
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:48,592
Who in the hell
ordered an upper GI?

914
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:49,866
I did.

915
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,529
You were supposed
to consent him.

916
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,702
He doesn't want surgery.

917
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,653
He<i> needs</i> surgery.

918
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:54,353
Maybe not.

919
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,490
I found an article that shows me

920
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:58,425
that he could be
treated medically,

921
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,659
which is what he wants.

922
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:01,089
Do you think this is about

923
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,612
what he<i> wants?</i>

924
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,114
Yeah...

925
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,165
I guess, a little bit.

926
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,163
Well, you're wrong, Carter.

927
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,882
This job is about determining

928
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,016
what a patient needs,

929
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,019
and the best way
for us as surgeons

930
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:15,119
to meet that need.

931
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:17,644
And as surgeons, we cut.

932
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,665
Dr. Anspaugh, as a
doctor, if I can find a way

933
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,450
to do what my patient wants
that's medically acceptable,

934
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:26,769
then I think that's
what I should do,

935
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,706
and I don't believe I
should cut somebody open

936
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,957
just because I can.

937
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:32,425
It bothers me, Carter,

938
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,777
that this patient is
willing to risk death

939
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:38,448
rather than undergo a
simple surgical procedure,

940
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,446
but, you know, it
bothers me even more

941
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,337
that you are so willing
to help him do that.

942
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,597
Oh! Sorry.

943
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,632
Mark, I still really
need you to sign off

944
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:56,667
on these QA reviews.

945
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,045
I don't have time right now.

946
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,069
But I'm off in five.

947
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,236
I just wanted to get...

948
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,983
Lily, why don't
you just leave them

949
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,127
at the desk for me, all right?

950
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,075
Done...

951
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,176
done... done.

952
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,312
You look very nice
tonight, Dr. Ross.

953
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,547
Thank you, E. Ray.

954
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,026
E. Ray, can you
file these for me?

955
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,795
I'll certainly ask Ms.
Kelly if she'll do that.

956
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,084
Ms. Kelly?

957
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,297
She's our temp clerk tonight.

958
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,331
Why do we have a temp?

959
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,321
I'm sorry, Carol,

960
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,957
but I don't think that's
any of your business.

961
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:21,958
Okay.

962
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,337
Good night. Good night.

963
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,628
Go grab a burger?

964
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:25,795
Yeah, he is so strange.

965
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:26,913
Where did we find him?

966
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,147
Mark...

967
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:30,684
Nina, damn, I was
supposed to call you.

968
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,686
Yes, although I hate having you

969
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,087
think of it that way.

970
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:36,489
It's been really busy.

971
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:37,724
Good first day back?

972
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,036
Completely fabulous.

973
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,860
Did you call Dr. Gillum?

974
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,278
That PTSD guy?

975
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,313
Well, you are post-trauma.

976
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,783
Look, I know I need some time

977
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,886
to settle back
in, but it's not like

978
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,806
I'm a postal worker
with an AK-47.

979
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,274
I... I know you're not.

980
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:57,911
I'm... I'm just trying to
help any way that I can.

981
00:34:57,946 --> 00:35:00,191
I know, and...
and I appreciate it.

982
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:01,325
I'm... I'm fine.

983
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,434
Everything's getting
back to normal.

984
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:08,304
Mark, I don't like you
trying to cover with me.

985
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,740
I don't like you trying to be

986
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,275
a shrink with me.

987
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,311
How's Rachel doing?

988
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,975
She's, uh... sleeping over

989
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,132
at a friend's house tonight.

990
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,868
Great, tell her I say hi.

991
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:22,986
Sure.

992
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,341
Hey, Peter, how you doing?

993
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,430
How is she?

994
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,177
Well, remarkably
well, considering.

995
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,566
She's a pretty strong lady.

996
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,769
Oh, God, Dr. Coburn,
I wanted to apologize

997
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,272
for my behavior this
morning in the delivery.

998
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,540
Thank you, but it's unnecessary.

999
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,176
I've never met a father
who could handle it

1000
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,873
sensibly, calmly, maturely.

1001
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,408
If I ever do, that's the guy

1002
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:52,260
I'm really going to slap around.

1003
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,733
Yeah.

1004
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:57,270
Today was the first
day I was ever afraid.

1005
00:35:57,305 --> 00:36:00,973
Well, I'm glad to
hear that, Peter.

1006
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,760
I better get back in here.

1007
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,807
Yeah, I'll check on her again

1008
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:06,930
before I leave.

1009
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,131
Hey, Carla.

1010
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,522
I made the bed.

1011
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:19,242
Isn't that the stupidest
thing you've ever seen?

1012
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:27,567
I spoke to Dr. Tabash.

1013
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,567
He presented

1014
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,465
another option for the baby.

1015
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,449
I think we should consider it.

1016
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:35,609
There are a lot of
serious risks involved,

1017
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:38,928
so I'm going to try to
explain them to you,

1018
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:42,549
and, uh, then we have a
decision to make, okay?

1019
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,674
You don't have to change for me.

1020
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,008
I'm not changing<i> for</i> you.

1021
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,122
You said we were
going to grab a burger.

1022
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,179
We can get some
burgers at the Pump Room.

1023
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,592
Doug, I'm not wearing
scrubs to the Pump Room.

1024
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,916
Okey-doke.

1025
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,518
I don't know, I think it
would be rather daring.

1026
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,703
Surprise!

1027
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:05,605
Happy birthday!

1028
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,307
Happy birthday, Carol!

1029
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,542
Oh, God, I hate you for this.

1030
00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:11,711
It worked out well,
don't you think?

1031
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:29,262
What are you doing?

1032
00:37:29,298 --> 00:37:30,763
Waiting for you.

1033
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,765
Come on... right this way.

1034
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:34,512
What are you doing?

1035
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:36,970
Come on, come on,
just come over here.

1036
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:37,971
Have a seat.

1037
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,006
Okay.

1038
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:44,577
What's this?

1039
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:46,612
A little something for you.

1040
00:37:56,558 --> 00:37:58,258
A garage door opener.

1041
00:37:58,293 --> 00:37:59,926
Go ahead, try it.

1042
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:03,563
I always wanted one of these.

1043
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:04,742
I know.

1044
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,632
You always said
they were stupid.

1045
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,278
Well, they<i> are</i> stupid.

1046
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:10,247
I don't get why a person

1047
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,922
can't just open the damn door.

1048
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,127
I think this is the nicest thing

1049
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,828
you've ever done for me.

1050
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,208
That's pretty pathetic.

1051
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,665
I love it.

1052
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,736
I love it.

1053
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,877
Let's have a beer.

1054
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,196
Okay!

1055
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:43,636
Ah!

1056
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,323
This is special, Doug.

1057
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:53,524
I love having 20 people over,

1058
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,526
especially when I have
so much to serve them.

1059
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,793
Here, peel an orange.

1060
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:58,184
Will you lighten up?

1061
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,201
They brought booze.

1062
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,453
Okay, I'll lighten up.

1063
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:02,266
I'll, uh, just have
a sip of this milk.

1064
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,558
You just drink that
right out of the carton

1065
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,671
like that?

1066
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:08,061
What's wrong with that?

1067
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:12,932
Well, it's just kind
of a guy thing to do.

1068
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:14,633
So, Doug, what
is all this about?

1069
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:16,135
What is what about?

1070
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:18,938
This little dance
you did today...

1071
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,773
This... this party... you.

1072
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:24,427
Well, I know you haven't
had very good birthdays

1073
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,140
last couple of years, and...

1074
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,013
The ones I spent with you?

1075
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:29,126
The ones I forgot.

1076
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,028
And, uh... I just thought

1077
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,603
it's time you have a nice one.

1078
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,973
You want a sip of milk?

1079
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,286
Yes, well, I would<i>
love</i> a sip of this milk.

1080
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,860
Thank you.

1081
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,830
Thank you.

1082
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,352
Dr. Weaver.

1083
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,353
Hi.

1084
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,422
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1085
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,857
Uh, sure.

1086
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,637
I know this isn't the right time

1087
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:59,061
or the right place,
but I was just curious,

1088
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,541
um... what would be involved

1089
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,610
with getting into
Emergency Medicine?

1090
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:03,583
What do you mean?

1091
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,212
If one wanted to
change his residency,

1092
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,947
would you have to
redo your intern year?

1093
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,839
Has one talked to
Dr. Greene about this?

1094
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,574
Ah! No.

1095
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,769

candles on this cake.

1103

Uh, yeah!

Hold on, hold on, one second.

00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,460
Oh, I almost forgot.

1107
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,313
Oh, wait a minute.

1108
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,384
