1
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,355
17-year-old male.

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,344
Multiple G.S.W.

3
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,345
to the chest and abdomen.

4
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,346
Pulse 140 and thready.

5
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,347
B.P.'s 80 palp.

6
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,427
Stop squirming around!

7
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:51,911
This fool look familiar to you?

8
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:53,396
Uh-huh, somebody shot
him a couple of months ago.

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,553
Oh, man, it hurts!

10
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,149
I hope so. Two
times in six months...

11
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:59,533
You got yourself a real low
learning curve going here, boy.

12
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,658
Unit 68's on the way.

13
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:19,494
Drunk dove off the balcony
of the Westside Motor Lodge

14
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,829
looking for the pool.

15
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:21,830
Did he find it?

16
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:22,831
Nope.

17
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,165
Ouch.

18
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,500
Hey, hey.

19
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:27,246
Dr. Carter, I presume.

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,837
Carter, what's up?

21
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:31,017
So surgical interns are supposed
to meet down here someplace?

22
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,174
Yes, yes. Your lemmings
are all over here.

23
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,310
Hey, Jerry, that lead
poisoning come in?

24
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,378
Yeah. Trauma two.

25
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:37,512
Hey, are you going to make

26
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,858
to the Fourth of July
picnic this afternoon?

27
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,360
My bat and glove are in my car.

28
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,696
I parked the guy with T.B.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,364
hocking up red
snappers in the fish tank.

30
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:45,354
Hey, Dr. Lewis.

31
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:46,688
Carter, your first day?

32
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:49,023
Hey, Carter, if you
can't cut it in surgery

33
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,937
there's always family medicine.

34
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:52,193
Or Gerontology.

35
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,294
Or Psychiatry.

36
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,474
Don't forget: they
can't throw you out.

37
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:55,942
Nope, they can make
your life so miserable

38
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,444
you're going to beg
them to let you quit.

39
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:58,668
Susan, we need you down here.

40
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,813
Don't worry, It's only a year.

41
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:00,837
You'll make it.

42
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,948
Well, I guess I better
go join the group.

43
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,238
Right. Good luck then.

44
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,051
Yeah. Hey, try
not to kill anyone.

45
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:06,508
Surgical interns?

46
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,054
John, Dale Edson, Harvard Med.

47
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,155
We met last year.

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,379
Yeah, yeah. How you been?

49
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:12,459
Great. Great, Just spent the
last six weeks down at Hopkins

50
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,215
on a thoracic elective.

51
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,717
The resident was a nazi,

52
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:18,052
but they let me scrub in
on 20 valve replacements.

53
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:19,053
Wow.

54
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,567
This is Julie Dixon, Duke.

55
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:21,723
Hi. Hello.

56
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,803
This is Leung Joo Hua,
U.C. San Francisco. Hi.

57
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,894
And Dennis Gant, ol' Miss.

58
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,061
L.S.U., actually.

59
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:28,397
They let us wear scrubs?

60
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:30,042
Yeah, yeah. It's pretty
informal around here so...

61
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,244
Oh, great. John
went to school here.

62
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:32,912
He can show us the ins and outs.

63
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,737
All I want to know at 6:00 a.m.
is where the hell is the coffee?

64
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,751
Blue team surgical
interns, good morning.

65
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:38,907
My name is Dr. Melvoin.

66
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,920
Today is the last
day of my internship

67
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,243
and the first day of yours,

68
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,913
which means, in this great
game of medical education

69
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:46,014
tag... you're it.

70
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,582
House staff guidelines.

71
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,651
This lists the
conferences and clinics

72
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,920
that all interns are
required to attend.

73
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,789
Miss one, and your evaluation

74
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,967
will be degraded.

75
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:57,926
Vascular conference:
Monday, 4:00 to 5:00.

76
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,928
Pathology: Monday, 5:00 to 7:00.

77
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,930
Radiology: Tuesday at 5:00.

78
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:04,198
M&Ms: Wednesday, 7:00 a.m.

79
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:07,502
Intern reports: Monday,
Thursday, Friday

80
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:09,020
at 7:00 a.m.

81
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,223
Vascular Journal
Club, Tuesday at 7:00.

82
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,624
Chairman's Conference:
Friday, 7:00 a.m.

83
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,973
Doesn't the chairman's conference
conflict with the intern report?

84
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,641
Yep. You're on five days a week

85
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,132
5:00 a.m. till you
finish up after 7:00 p.m.

86
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,302
You're on call every third
weekend and every third night.

87
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,982
Which means, every
three days, you will be here

88
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,672
from 5:00 a.m. the first day,

89
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,918
till at least 7:00
p.m. the next.

90
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,053
When do we get to sleep?

91
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,777
You don't. You are wedges.

92
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,213
The wedge is the most
primitive tool known to man.

93
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,481
That is you.

94
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,760
You think you know
what you're doing.

95
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,551
Believe me, you don't.

96
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,288
Breakfast with your senior
surgical resident, Dr. Benton

97
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,723
will begin in 15 minutes.

98
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,593
Dr. Benton is an
intern's worst nightmare.

99
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,828
He's smarter than you.

100
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,896
He never eats, he never sleeps,

101
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:55,634
and he reads every medical
journal, no matter how obscure.

102
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,237
He is the antichrist,
Beelzebub, Lucifer,

103
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,605
a devourer of wedges.

104
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,172
You will go to sleep at night

105
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,942
wishing plague and pestilence
on his unborn children,

106
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,177
and you will wake up
every morning praying

107
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,812
for his approval.

108
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,514
You won't get it.

109
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,255
Welcome to hell,
ladies and gentlemen.

110
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:21,627
Benton... he can't
be that bad, can he?

111
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,043
Peter.

112
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,779
Hey.

113
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,147
Hi.

114
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,148
I left a message last night.

115
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,649
You never called me back.

116
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,795
I was in surgery.

117
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,954
I, um...

118
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,056
I tested positive.

119
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:05,046
Did you get your results back?

120
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:12,187
No. I, uh...

121
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,841
some time today.

122
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,313
I'm going to have to talk
to Mark Greene about it.

123
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,149
Yeah.

124
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,421
I thought you'd want to know.

125
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:46,087
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,477
There you go.

127
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,623
Now you're getting
the hang of it.

128
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:16,418
All right, remind me
again why we're doing this.

129
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,418
'Cause it's fun.

130
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,498
Oh, it's fun, right. I forgot.

131
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,056
All right, 10-1.

132
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,156
Here we go.

133
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,437
Hey, how was
that date last night?

134
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,160
Awful.

135
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,813
Oh!

136
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,051
You're supposed
to use your hands.

137
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,969
Ha, ha, ha.

138
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:37,539
Okay...

139
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:39,541
Hey, did you call Alicia?

140
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,209
The aerobics instructor?

141
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,511
Yeah.

142
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,046
What the hell are we
supposed to talk about?

143
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,914
She's an aerobics instructor.

144
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,133
Don't you want to talk
to someone before sex?

145
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,219
Uh, not really, no.

146
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:53,071
Shared experiences?

147
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,156
Common interests?

148
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:56,341
Are you suggesting
you and I date?

149
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,042
No, I just...

150
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,344
I'm looking for a
little more than that

151
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,557
in a relationship.

152
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,814
A relationship?

153
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,549
You're 32 years old.

154
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,784
Have some fun.

155
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,952
Dixon, Charcot's triad?

156
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,222
Um... hypercoagulability...
stasis...

157
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,107
pain, fever, jaundice.

158
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:14,626
Gant...

159
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,210
the ducts of Luschka?

160
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,023
Um, aberrant
ducts that drain bile

161
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,224
but do not communicate

162
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,726
with the gallbladder lumen.

163
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,584
An intern who wasn't
asleep during med school.

164
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,452
Thank you.

165
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,649
Edson, this morning's patient

166
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,518
is jaundiced but
no cholangiolitis.

167
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,075
Now, should we
perform the surgery open

168
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,744
or laparoscopically?

169
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,812
Open. There may
be multiple stones.

170
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,881
I'm going in laparoscopically.

171
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,584
You get an E.R.C.P.?

172
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,754
Hmm.

173
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,991
Okay, Edson, you scrub in.

174
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,210
Don't you want to
ask me something?

175
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,630
Dixon, Leung, you
guys cover the ward.

176
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,027
Gant, you're runner-up.
Take the S.I.C.U.

177
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,233
The surgical I.C.U.?

178
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,012
Don't worry, the nurses
won't let you kill anybody.

179
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,997
Any questions?

180
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,987
Dr. Benton?

181
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,033
Oh. Carter.

182
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:02,890
Help with the wards
and cover the E.R.

183
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,142
The E.R.?

184
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,276
Lastly, we need to discuss

185
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,445
the on-call rotation
for the night shift.

186
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,291
Dr. Benton, I was
kind of hoping...

187
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,082
Good, Carter. Thank
you for volunteering.

188
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,584
You can take the first
shift starting tonight.

189
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,298
I'll set up the other schedules

190
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,183
and post them in the
on-call room okay?

191
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,173
Tonight?

192
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,975
Surgical ward, four minutes.

193
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:26,681
Better start looking.

194
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:27,894
Ah, it's just a rumor.

195
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,217
They're closing us down.

196
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,763
They can't close down county.

197
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,131
Where would the patients go?

198
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,188
It was in the<i> Trib.</i>

199
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:34,600
The mayor's setting
up a commission.

200
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:35,590
What was in the<i> Trib?</i>

201
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,635
They've got to squeeze

202
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,937
a couple of hundred
million out of the budget

203
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,005
so they're shutting us down.

204
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,661
I read that article.

205
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:42,608
They said closing county was<i> one</i>
of the options under consideration.

206
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:43,598
They said that?

207
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,977
We're all getting fired?

208
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,034
Nobody's getting fired.

209
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,147
Man, I just took a
second out on my house.

210
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,215
So what's the union say?

211
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,538
We got a contract.

212
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:53,074
They've been talking about
closing us down for years

213
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,153
but we're still here.

214
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,344
Hey, uh, are all you
guys going to the picnic?

215
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,890
Yeah, I'm going to stop
by on my way to work.

216
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,525
Me, too. I'll see you all later.

217
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,082
It was in the<i> Tribune?</i>

218
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:02,851
<i>Sun Times</i> too.

219
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,518
Oh, God.

220
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,867
Hey, Carter, what are
you doing down here?

221
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,624
Oh, Benton dumped
me back in the E.R.

222
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,226
It's my first day as a surgeon

223
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,661
and he ships me off to
do trauma assessments.

224
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,374
Well, sounds to me
like he trusts you.

225
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,465
Somebody beep for
a surgical consult?

226
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,699
L.O.L. In two.

227
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:21,335
82 Years old, rule out
small bowel obstruction.

228
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,381
Benton on his way?

229
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,172
No, I'm the surgical consult.

230
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,841
He'll be fine.

231
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,227
God help the poor patients.

232
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,007
Mark, I'm concerned
about the lack

233
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,275
of direct communication
between attendings.

234
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,777
I noticed last year as Chief.

235
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,478
Biweekly meetings would give us

236
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,147
a chance to get
on the same page...

237
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,381
Improve patient care.

238
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,884
Tuesdays and Thursdays
during lunch might work.

239
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,920
That will be a little rough
on the night shift guys,

240
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,121
having to be dragged down here

241
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,745
in the middle of the afternoon.

242
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,324
I also think we need to adhere

243
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,193
to Jcaho Guidelines all the time

244
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,461
not just when we're
expecting the committee.

245
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,818
The nurses will hate that.

246
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,664
The rules were
created for a reason.

247
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,133
Take the board, for example.

248
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,568
Patient confidentiality
is breached every day.

249
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,870
Here, look at this entry.

250
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:01,860
"Al Johnson

251
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,139
Penile Discharge."

252
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,307
How would you feel if
that were you up there?

253
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,076
Not only are we risking lawsuits

254
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,278
but we could lose
our accreditation.

255
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,237
Unit 79's bringing in an
86-year-old male, altered L.O.C.

256
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,705
I've created a diagnostic
code for the board.

257
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,219
It's a list of a few hundred

258
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,376
easy-to-remember
two-letter combinations

259
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,322
of our most common
patient complaints.

260
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,981
And we can use the patient's
social security numbers

261
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,981
to protect

262
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,149
their anonymity.

263
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,534
"B.E." Uh...

264
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:27,602
Barium Enema?

265
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:28,786
Blunt Extremity Trauma.

266
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,288
Some guy with a nasty bruise

267
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,790
is going to get a
radioactive colon cleansing.

268
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,286
Mark, can I talk to you later?

269
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,788
Yeah, sure. This afternoon?

270
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,156
And there's a conference

271
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,658
on Saturday at Northwestern...

272
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:41,883
"Modern Architecture for
Emergency Medicine Management."

273
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,495
I definitely think we should go.

274
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,481
Saturday? I got to
be with my daughter.

275
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,332
Why don't you go
and fill me in later?

276
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:48,923
Sure. I'll tape it.

277
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,678
She's got to be kidding.

278
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,258
What brings you in today, ma'am?

279
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,247
I'm sick.

280
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,248
What's wrong?

281
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,249
My stomach hurts.

282
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,550
Didn't you tell him?

283
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,897
When did this pain start?

284
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:01,921
I don't know.

285
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,032
Early this morning maybe?

286
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,756
I said I don't know.
What is he, an idiot?

287
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,474
How old are you? Old enough.

288
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,910
I want you to tell
me if this hurts.

289
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,428
The abdomen

290
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,997
is apparently tender.

291
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:13,764
I gathered that.

292
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,861
Let's go ahead
and order a C.B.C.,

293
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,763
chem seven and
an abdominal series.

294
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:17,619
They're done.

295
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,570
I'm going to check
your tests, Mrs. Lukasi,

296
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,640
but I'm afraid that you're
going to require surgery.

297
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,393
You don't want to examine
her a little bit more, doctor?

298
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:26,839
She's had previous
abdominal surgery.

299
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,228
She probably has adhesions.

300
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:29,831
You sure he's a doctor?

301
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:32,916
You might consider,
uh, doing a rectal.

302
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,798
Never let the sun set on the
small bowel obstruction, Nurse Rey.

303
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,288
Dr. Carter, may I see
you for a moment, please?

304
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,289
Excuse us, ma'am.

305
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,025
What the hell is taking so long?

306
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,794
I come down here, for an
API and all of a sudden I see

307
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,207
you have four
patients on the board.

308
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,296
Didn't you check it?

309
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,132
I got beeped to
examine a patient.

310
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,311
Always check the board first.

311
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,264
How could you possibly tell
that this patient was emergent?

312
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,548
Small bowel obstruction.

313
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,852
She's going to need surgery.

314
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:03,264
I'd like to scrub in on
this one, Dr. Benton.

315
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,117
Carter, all surgical
abdomens require a rectal.

316
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,935
Even first-years know that.

317
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:10,271
She's impacted.

318
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:12,656
Look, go check on
the rest of your patients

319
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,842
and come back here
and disimpact this one.

320
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,937
Isn't that a nurse's job?

321
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,961
Not today, it isn't.

322
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,617
88-Year-old male, altered
L.O.C., hypotensive.

323
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,619
B.P. 60 palp, sinus tach at 128.

324
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,288
Resps shallow at 30.
Skin's warm and dry.

325
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:29,691
Poor cap refill.
Couldn't get an I.V.

326
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,693
O2 four liters, nasal canula.

327
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,305
All right, let's go. Trauma one.

328
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,473
What's the matter
with the board?

329
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:35,908
What are all these
letters and numbers?

330
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,833
Patient confidentiality system.

331
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,501
How am I supposed to figure out

332
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:42,270
who's surgical
and who's medical?

333
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:43,972
I don't have time for this crap.

334
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,373
Whose stupid idea is this?

335
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,187
Mine. First day on the
surgical service, Dr. Carter?

336
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,521
Nice to have you with us.

337
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,512
Need a surgeon in
one. Is Benton in?

338
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,025
It's you, right? Let's go.

339
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,094
There's always a
first time, doctor.

340
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,518
Might as well get it over with.

341
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,496
Oh, God.

342
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,865
Somebody call for a surgeon?

343
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,078
Drop a central line.

344
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,168
I'll intubate
after you get it in.

345
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,237
Pulse ox is 85.

346
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,832
Trendelenburg, please, nurse.

347
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,276
Central line kit.

348
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:25,563
One percent Lidocaine with Epi.

349
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,831
Thank you, nurse.

350
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,586
Intubation tray.

351
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,740
Angle toward the sternal notch.

352
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,341
I know.

353
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,386
Foley's in.

354
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,661
Come on.

355
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,613
Come on.

356
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,294
How you doing over there,

357
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,267
Dr. Carter?

358
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,579
Almost.

359
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,737
Almost.

360
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,113
I can't find it.

361
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,732
Prep for a right
subclavian approach.

362
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,073
Please.

363
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,908
Try not to hit the lung.

364
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,896
All right, what do we got?

365
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:17,926
88-Year-old male
needs a central line.

366
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,661
I couldn't get the
internal jugular

367
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,364
so I tried for a
subclavian approach.

368
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,515
Set me up. I think I might
have nicked his lung.

369
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,334
Oh, Damn! Decreased
breath sounds on the right side.

370
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,058
He's getting dusky.
I need to intubate.

371
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,933
His veins must have collapsed.

372
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,849
I'm in. Stethoscope.

373
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,766
Get respiratory down
here to set up the vent.

374
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,723
Congratulations, Dr. Carter.

375
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,343
Your patient now
needs a chest tube.

376
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,411
Chest tube tray. 28 French.

377
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,580
Ten blade.

378
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,960
All right, let's go, hook me up.

379
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,967
Hold still for the driver.

380
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:53,968
Vaseline gauze will be next.

381
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,481
Four by fours, how's
his pressure? 90 systolic.

382
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,304
Two liters, wide open.

383
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,907
Temps 103.

384
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:02,744
1.5 grams, Q.A.

385
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,345
I'd check him for pseudomonas.

386
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:08,449
Ceftazidime, two grams

387
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,685
Q-8 plus gent.

388
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,998
All right, people.

389
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:14,822
Somebody call up radiology,
get a stat for the chest...

390
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,324
Listen to this:
"Pearl white beaches

391
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:26,016
"set against an azure
blue tropical sky.

392
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,220
"Cool breezes that make
your semidetached bungalow

393
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,866
your own little
piece of paradise."

394
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,190
Where's that?

395
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,191
Micronesia.

396
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,192
Where's that?

397
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,193
Who cares?

398
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,305
It's a long, long
ways from here.

399
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,340
Ooh! "Dive with Lenny
and Francis and the boys

400
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,709
"at Fish 'n' Fins,
Palau's oldest

401
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,878
and most experienced
charter operators."

402
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,368
Is that a shark?

403
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,248
Ooh, five or six of
them. Cool, huh?

404
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,807
Oh, look! Hawaii.

405
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,220
Have you ever been to Hawaii?

406
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,943
Hawaii, South Pacific.

407
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,712
Don't all these places require

408
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,347
that you get on a plane

409
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,793
and fly over water,
like, at great heights?

410
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,783
Oh, I don't care. They
all look so beautiful.

411
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:00,951
I'll just self-medicate

412
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,064
and sleep through
the whole thing.

413
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,432
I can't understand a
damn thing up here.

414
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,934
What the hell is O.T.,
Occupational Therapy?

415
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,703
I mean, half the patients
on the board need it.

416
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,892
"Other." It's what you put

417
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,172
when you don't know
what's wrong with them.

418
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,441
Yeah, or you're too busy to look
at the abbreviations in the book.

419
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,564
Give it time, people.

420
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,965
Rome wasn't built in a day.

421
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,212
And what is this P.U.?

422
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,546
I can't find it in
the book anywhere.

423
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,936
Pleuritic chest pain.

424
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,817
E.H.?

425
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,352
Behavioral problems and psych.

426
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,842
How's he do that?

427
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,710
I reviewed the notes at lunch.

428
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,824
Hey, Dr. Benton,
some outside lab called

429
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,259
with test results for you.

430
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,315
How long ago?

431
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,894
I don't know. A couple of hours.

432
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,585
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

433
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,961
Hello.

434
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,530
Hi. You have an appointment?

435
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,126
No, I thought this
was a walk-in day.

436
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,650
Oh, normally, but
with the holiday

437
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,219
things are pretty jammed up.

438
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:52,553
You here for testing?

439
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,004
No.

440
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,890
You are HIV-Positive?

441
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,008
Yes.

442
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,509
When did you find out?

443
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,610
Yesterday.

444
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:00,723
I'll come back later all right?

445
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,712
Wait, you're already here.

446
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,858
Why don't you fill out a form,

447
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,576
and I'll make sure you
get in to see somebody,

448
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,483
okay?

449
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,519
Top form is general information,

450
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,137
next few pages
are for insurance.

451
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,672
Thanks.

452
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,796
You work here?

453
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,965
In the E.R.

454
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:41,635
HIV-Positive?

455
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,449
You, uh...

456
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,786
haven't told anyone
you work with, have you?

457
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,321
Not really.

458
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,524
You shouldn't be here.

459
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,961
You need to go someplace
else for treatment;

460
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:09,831
somewhere where
they don't know you.

461
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,346
Look, I was a surgical tech

462
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,970
over at Southside.

463
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:17,950
Believe me, don't tell<i> anyone</i>

464
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:19,707
you're HIV-Positive,

465
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,660
especially not anyone
in management.

466
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,145
They can't fire me.

467
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,147
Not legally, no.

468
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:29,449
But, uh... when I came
up positive four years ago

469
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,451
I told the chief of surgery.

470
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,021
First, they sent
me to Gerontology.

471
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,640
Wouldn't let me do
anything but take B.P.'s.

472
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,176
When that didn't
work, they stuck me

473
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,523
down in Pathology
working nights.

474
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,358
After six months of that

475
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,382
I-I finally quit.

476
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,533
I'd been there for eight years.

477
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,519
There's a real good clinic

478
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,026
up in Highland Park.

479
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,361
It's a long drive,

480
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,836
but it would be a lot safer.

481
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,370
I'm sorry if I'm scaring you.

482
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,904
Matthew.

483
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,209
I'm Matt Hyams.

484
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,544
What's your name?

485
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,880
Maybe I should
give you an alias.

486
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,449
Jeanie Boulet.

487
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,451
Get out of here, Jeanie.

488
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,420
Don't ever come back.

489
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,563
Uh... yeah. This is
Dr. Benton over at county.

490
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,066
Uh-huh. Um... you have
the results of an AIDS test

491
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,218
for a patient of mine.

492
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,120
Yeah, I-I-I know it's late.

493
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,956
Look, I don't want the patient

494
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,903
to have to agonize
over this thing

495
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:46,560
over the weekend, okay?

496
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:50,230
Uh, I-I'd really appreciate it.

497
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,732
The patient's name is Benjamin.

498
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,435
Peter Benjamin.

499
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,938
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

500
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,864
Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here.

501
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,605
Okay. Uh...

502
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,123
Thank you.

503
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,142
Yeah, uh...

504
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,295
Thank you.

505
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,096
Dr. Benton, I'm all caught up

506
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,798
and my night shift doesn't start

507
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,066
for another half hour,

508
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,834
so should I get
something to eat?

509
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,681
Take ten minutes,
then find Melvoin

510
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,670
for the hand-off.

511
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:47,671
Ten minutes.

512
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,284
That's more than
you'll usually get.

513
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,686
Are you going to
be with me tonight?

514
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,675
No.

515
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,777
Karubian's the resident on-call.

516
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,480
You okay, Dr. Benton?

517
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,455
Yeah.

518
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,309
I'm fine, Carter.

519
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,932
You going to the picnic?

520
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,211
What, are you kidding?

521
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,279
Last year, six at
bats, 15 R.B.I.S.

522
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,270
I<i> love</i> to play the pedes unit.

523
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,283
We're playing
paramedics this year.

524
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,274
The firemen? Really?
Who set that up?

525
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,287
It was either that
or the Orthopods.

526
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,544
Looked rough either way.

527
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,179
Ortho's got two ex-all Americans

528
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,181
and one retired minor
league shortstop.

529
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,694
If y'all are going to the picnic

530
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,962
pick up some more
chicken and ribs.

531
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,953
Carol, Darcy
called. Her kid's sick.

532
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,354
She can't work tonight.

533
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,623
Oh. Anybody want
to pull a double?

534
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,291
On the Fourth of July?

535
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,127
Oh, come on, guys. Please.

536
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,628
Somebody?

537
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,296
Guys, I'm playing right field.

538
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,276
Ooh. It's tough being boss, huh?

539
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,978
You could always quit again.

540
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,446
I can cover for a few hours

541
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,881
if you come back by 10:00.

542
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:53,971
Thank you, Lily.

543
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,305
Where's everybody going?

544
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,507
Barbecue and softball
game over at Grant Park.

545
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,521
<i>Everybody's</i> going?
I'm coming back.

546
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,944
Bring me back some barbecue.

547
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,190
Anything else, Doctor?

548
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,547
Yeah. Chicken, no dark meat.

549
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,727
Beans if they're not too sweet

550
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,995
and coleslaw, lots of coleslaw.

551
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,563
Carter is getting
a little uppity.

552
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,553
Really.

553
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,599
He may need a little
midnight potty training.

554
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,657
I'd be delighted.

555
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,659
Carter.

556
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,494
Last day, huh?

557
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,996
My vacation begins

558
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,998
in 14 minutes and 24 seconds.

559
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,599
I set my watch.

560
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,767
Fourth of July.

561
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,736
You're in for a treat tonight.

562
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:26,804
Knife and Gun club

563
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,105
should really get going later.

564
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,317
Where are we going?

565
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,440
Surgical wards.

566
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,687
Why?

567
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,376
You're covering them tonight.

568
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,090
I thought I was
covering the E.R.

569
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,614
Well, that, too,
and the S.I.C.U.

570
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,695
O.R. Prep, if the
resident needs you,

571
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,187
trauma team, pre-op
and all the surgical admits.

572
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,515
Hey...

573
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,917
Hey!

574
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:59,064
Look what the cat dragged in.

575
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:02,355
You've got a good
turnout here. Damn.

576
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,802
Yeah, you know this
neighborhood, Peter.

577
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,343
Mention free food and
beer, and they come running.

578
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,679
I'm glad you came.

579
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,193
What do you mean? I
said I was going to come.

580
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,250
I figured you were lying,

581
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,851
like always.

582
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:16,854
What are you

583
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:17,983
so happy about?

584
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:19,490
I'm just happy.

585
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,641
I can't be happy?

586
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,640
Now, you knew she was coming

587
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,941
didn't you?

588
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,967
That's why you showed up.

589
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,069
Jackie, how many
times I got to tell you

590
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,637
we're just friends, all right?

591
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,683
Okay, okay, all right.

592
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,108
Can I get you
something to drink?

593
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,795
Uh, yeah. Some, uh, some juice.

594
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,808
Give me that one.

595
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,110
I know what I'm doing.

596
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:47,912
Hey, man, what's up,
doc? You come to save me?

597
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:50,365
This crazy woman thinks
she knows how to grill.

598
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,172
Get out of here.

599
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,557
Bald-headed men don't
know how to barbecue.

600
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,738
She's just mad
because I'm big, black,

601
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,857
bald, beautiful,
barbecue-cooking man.

602
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,775
I'm going to go in and get
some chicken and links, okay?

603
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,799
I'll be right back.

604
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,960
All right, Walter.

605
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:04,568
I want my place back!

606
00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:09,022
How you doing?

607
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:11,558
Pass me that plate over there.

608
00:25:15,364 --> 00:25:17,231
You look good.

609
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,334
You don't come around
the restaurant no more.

610
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:22,336
You know, I, um...

611
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:23,988
I gave up meat.

612
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,784
You know, I heard
that about you.

613
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:27,107
I did.

614
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:29,559
All those long hours
you been working, I bet.

615
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,664
Yeah. It keeps me
pretty busy, you know?

616
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,331
That's a shame.

617
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,568
No time for old friends.

618
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,074
Well, you know, I, uh...

619
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,877
I get an hour here and there.

620
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:51,665
Well, it only takes
an hour, Peter.

621
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,484
Or don't you remember?

622
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,473
Oh, man.

623
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:01,486
Jeanie. Hi.

624
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,842
Hi.

625
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:03,988
How are you feeling?

626
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:05,079
I'm fine.

627
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:06,291
How's your husband?

628
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,714
He's doing all right.

629
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,149
Good. That's great.

630
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:10,217
Yeah.

631
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:11,253
Uh, did...

632
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:13,053
Uh, did you ever get that test?

633
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:14,388
Yes.

634
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,824
It was negative.

635
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,892
Oh, that's great.

636
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:20,527
Mm-hmm.

637
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:23,830
I won't keep you any longer.

638
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm glad the news was good.

639
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,950
Let's go, Jer. Put a lock

640
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:32,974
on the ball.

641
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:45,953
Safe!

642
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,539
Who told Jerry to pitch?

643
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,590
17-3. Let's go.

644
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,392
Okay, why don't we just forfeit

645
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:54,394
so we can go get
back to drinking?

646
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:55,573
Jerry, come on!

647
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,164
17-3. We're still in it.

648
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,231
Come on, let's go!

649
00:26:58,267 --> 00:26:59,700
17-3. We're still in this.

650
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:00,979
Jerry, come on!

651
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:02,402
Oh, we're in it.

652
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,527
I got it! I got it! I got it!

653
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,930
I got it! I got it!

654
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,899
All right, that's a
momentum swing.

655
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,018
This is our inning. Let's go!

656
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:22,990
Hi.

657
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:24,224
Hey.

658
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,092
You playing?

659
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:27,561
I don't know.

660
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,129
I just got off of work.

661
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:30,597
It seems like my guys

662
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,143
are doing okay without me.

663
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,967
Uh, your guys are
kicking our butts.

664
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:36,870
You left your boom
box at my house.

665
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,739
I got a new one.

666
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,241
Hey, my old one still have

667
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:43,137
my<i> Best of Conway
Twitty</i> tape in it?

668
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,689
If it did, I would
have burned it.

669
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:46,813
What happened to my beer?

670
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,418
Vicki Pastroni, this
is Carol Hathaway.

671
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,632
She's the head
nurse down at county.

672
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:54,688
Nice to meet you.

673
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,008
Oh.

674
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,021
Looks like Greene's going to try

675
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,689
to make a game of this one.

676
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,130
Maybe I better go warm up.

677
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:14,708
Hey.

678
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:16,743
You all right?

679
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,445
Yeah.

680
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:21,481
Fireworks!

681
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,298
Wow!

682
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:46,323
Whoa! Oh, I love fireworks!

683
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,559
Ah. Me too.

684
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,104
God, they're beautiful.

685
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,206
If we're all here

686
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,796
who's at work?

687
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,599
I don't know.

688
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:58,303
I don't care.

689
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,807
Tachycardiac at 180.

690
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,420
Get that o-neg
on a rapid infuser.

691
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,689
Step up here, Dr. Carter!

692
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,646
He's arrested.

693
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:10,962
Thoracotomy tray.

694
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,629
Make the incision deep and fast.

695
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,319
Spreader.

696
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,589
Vascular clamp.

697
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,230
Dr. Carter?

698
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,098
I'm up. I'm up.

699
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,951
What?

700
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:32,530
Mrs. Nupica's temp's up to 100.

701
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,387
Can we give her Tylenol?

702
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:36,289
How long have I been asleep?

703
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:39,192
About ten minutes. The Tylenol?

704
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:40,611
Yeah. Great.

705
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:41,678
Two?

706
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:43,247
Two. Right.

707
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:51,599
Dr. Carter?

708
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,623
Mm-hmm?

709
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,968
Can we give
Mr. Sifkin a little toast?

710
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,803
He's asking for
something to eat.

711
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:56,827
Sifkin?

712
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:57,811
Leg lac.

713
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,463
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

714
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,781
Toast okay?

715
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:04,418
Toast, oatmeal,
prime rib, whatever.

716
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:05,752
Thank you, Doctor.

717
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,623
Toast?

718
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:10,957
God.

719
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,154
Dr. Carter?

720
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,211
Mm-hmm?

721
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,640
Do you want a stool culture

722
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:16,646
on Mrs. Haney?

723
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,842
She's got diarrhea.

724
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,632
Haney. That's
Weaver's patient, right?

725
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:20,633
Yes.

726
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:21,935
What does she say?

727
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,298
She's upstairs getting coffee.

728
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,804
What would you normally do?

729
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,806
Not bother.

730
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,474
Let's not bother then, okay?

731
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:28,809
Thank you, doctor.

732
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,094
Haleh, is it always like this

733
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,479
when somebody's
trying to get a little sleep?

734
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:35,315
I wouldn't know, Doctor.

735
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,035
Nurses aren't allowed
to sleep on shift.

736
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,841
Should I beep him again?

737
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,843
Only if he doesn't come out.

738
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:04,021
Ah, bingo!

739
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:05,445
Cops are bringing in a drunk.

740
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:06,691
Fell through a
plate glass window.

741
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:08,014
Yeah, well, find a bed.

742
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,215
This guy's growing roots.

743
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,216
Resident's sleeping.

744
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:11,496
Claims he doesn't
have space upstairs

745
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,353
because he doesn't
want to work anybody up.

746
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:14,855
Good morning, Dr. Carter.

747
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,856
Get any sleep?

748
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,323
Somebody beep me?

749
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,492
E-ray?

750
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:19,826
No. Maybe another floor.

751
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:20,872
Really? 6195.

752
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:23,363
6195. That's the E.R., Isn't it?

753
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,031
Yes, but I didn't page you.

754
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,711
Must have been
some kind of mistake.

755
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:29,870
They can make your life easy
or they can make it miserable.

756
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:32,539
Whatever you did, I suggest
you apologize immediately.

757
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:34,040
I didn't do anything.

758
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,219
Apologize anyway.

759
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:36,743
Police are bringing in a drunk.

760
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,556
Went through a
plate glass window.

761
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,946
What? What?

762
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,726
Busting windows with his fist.

763
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,060
Trying to bust a display
window at the Gap,

764
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:44,050
but couldn't do it,

765
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,219
so he runs straight at it
from across the street.

766
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:47,721
Boom! Went right through.

767
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:49,901
We found him in
women's underwear.

768
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:51,658
I'm okay. I'm okay.

769
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:53,059
Hey!

770
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,095
Someone want to help me out?

771
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:58,932
No! No!

772
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,845
Hold on. Hold on. Wait.

773
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:01,947
He's not on yet.

774
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,770
I got him. I got him.

775
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,174
All right, clean it up.

776
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,878
Check his Tetanus, and
prepare him for suturing...

777
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:12,946
Lots of suturing.

778
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:14,681
That should take
the rest of the night.

779
00:32:14,717 --> 00:32:17,317
Dr. Carter, Connie, I need you.

780
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,730
Malik, let me know
when he's ready.

781
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:20,386
Elderly man, found down.

782
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:21,387
Vomiting blood.

783
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:22,388
B.P. 100/70.

784
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:23,890
Pulse is thready at 145.

785
00:32:23,926 --> 00:32:25,391
Two I.V.'s in the field.

786
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:26,467
He's kind of yellow.

787
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:27,794
Don't we know this guy?

788
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,208
Jim... he's a regular,
alcoholic, cirrhosis, seizures.

789
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:33,800
Oh, yeah, he's drunk.

790
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:36,469
Okay, let's move him.

791
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:38,504
Gently now.

792
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,407
One... two... three.

793
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:43,509
He's got a big scalp lac.

794
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,622
We found him in the gutter.

795
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:47,280
He may have hit his
head when he fell.

796
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:48,492
Whoo! What's that smell?

797
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:50,283
Code brown in the
shorts. Lots of blood, too.

798
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,585
C.B.C., type and
cross, four units.

799
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,120
Coag panel.

800
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:56,556
Dr. Carter, help us
with an N.G., please.

801
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:58,424
Hang a banana bag, wide open.

802
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,426
I'm ready for you, Dr. Carter.

803
00:33:00,462 --> 00:33:01,561
Hold still, sir.

804
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:03,763
What's the surgical
plan, Dr. Carter?

805
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:06,132
Transfuse and take him
to the GI lab for endoscopy.

806
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:07,484
Cauterize the bleeding sites.

807
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,468
Sounds right to me.

808
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:09,964
Dr. Carter, did you hear me?

809
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,466
Damn it, Malik, I said
I'll be there as soon

810
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,490
as I can all right?

811
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,192
God!

812
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:18,945
Sure.

813
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:20,480
Take your time.

814
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:23,394
Multiple burn
victims on their way.

815
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,718
Set up one

816
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,802
and alert plastics.

817
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,865
I'll be right there.

818
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,650
Don't look at us.

819
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,141
We're working here.

820
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,486
Tube's in.

821
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,810
What's 1019?

822
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,057
Surgical I.C.U.

823
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,547
Yes. This is John Carter.

824
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:38,982
You just paged me?

825
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,484
How many days since the surgery?

826
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,497
All right, I'll be right up.

827
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,654
Post-op, day two.

828
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,822
Triple-A repair.

829
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,990
Guy's desatting.

830
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,658
Don't be gone long, doctor.

831
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,727
We're getting buried down here.

832
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,755
Can I help you?

833
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,725
I'm Dr. Carter.

834
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,561
66-year-old male.

835
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,729
Abdominal aneurysm
repair two days ago.

836
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,231
Dropped his crit.

837
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,899
I don't know if he's leaking

838
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,401
or if he's hemodiluted.

839
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,735
What do you think?

840
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,655
Well, I hope he's
not bleeding out.

841
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,869
What should we do,
transfuse or diurese?

842
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,308
That's why I called you.

843
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,379
What's his crit?

844
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,196
30. It was 33 an hour ago.

845
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:45,743
The senior resident,
he's asleep?

846
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:46,733
Mm-hmm.

847
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:48,195
What time does
he usually get up?

848
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,552
Some time after 5:00.

849
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,921
That's two hours.

850
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,373
Two hours.

851
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:58,411
Do you want to wait and
see how low his crit goes?

852
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:01,498
If I don't transfuse
and he's bleeding out,

853
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:05,268
he's going to go into shock,
and if I diurese and I'm wrong,

854
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,553
then he's going to
go into renal failure,

855
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:08,599
right?

856
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,760
It's the E.R. 911.

857
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:16,046
Where's Dr. Karubian sleeping?

858
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,616
Dr. Karubian?

859
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,783
This better be important

860
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,286
or you'll be draining
rectal abscesses

861
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,788
for the rest of your
surgical residency.

862
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:26,956
Post-op, day two.

863
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:27,957
Aneurysm repair.

864
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,793
Crit's 30. Sat's down to 90.

865
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,110
Is he on oxygen?

866
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,395
Nasal cannula. Yes, sir.

867
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,463
Try a mask.

868
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,632
Check his crit
again in half an hour.

869
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,528
Yes, sir. Thank
you. Thank you, sir.

870
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,785
It's Carter, right?

871
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:40,120
Yes. Right, sir. Yeah.

872
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:43,006
All right. Shut up,
Carter, and close the door.

873
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,310
15 liters oxygen by mask

874
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,573
and call me in half an hour.

875
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:50,630
What's going on?

876
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:51,809
Third-degree burns.

877
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,511
Kid was playing with
fireworks in his apartment.

878
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:54,645
Sofa caught on fire.

879
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:56,302
Pulse ox is 65 on 100% O2.

880
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,138
Dr. Carter, nice
of you to join us.

881
00:35:58,173 --> 00:35:59,472
Where the hell you been?

882
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:00,651
I was up in the S.I.C.U.

883
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:01,974
Acute pulmonary edema.

884
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,476
Six E.T. tube, Versed.

885
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:04,810
Guy next door's in trouble.

886
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:05,811
Go. Go.

887
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:06,979
When I page you 911

888
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:08,493
I want you out of breath

889
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:10,128
when you show up down here.

890
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:11,117
What's going on?

891
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:12,618
He's taching at 200.

892
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:13,865
What?! No palpable BP.

893
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:15,021
Looks like S.V.T.

894
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,556
That's cardiovert, right?

895
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,668
How much?

896
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:18,658
I'd start at 50.

897
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,126
Hit the synch switch.

898
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:22,195
All right, everybody,<i> off.</i>

899
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,515
100. Off!

900
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,501
Okay. Okay.

901
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:29,669
Okay, sinus?

902
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:31,544
B.P. 70 palp. Dopamine?

903
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:35,608
Do you want dopamine?

904
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:36,721
I don't know, I don't know!

905
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:38,144
Somebody call a doctor.

906
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,046
You<i> are</i> the doctor.

907
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,402
Yeah. Yeah, uh...

908
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,903
right, right. Dopamine.

909
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,905
Titrate to a...

910
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,573
systolic of 100.

911
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,919
I can do this. I can do this.

912
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,794
He's not breathing,
so we have to intubate.

913
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:55,907
7.5 now.

914
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,196
I.V.'s blown.

915
00:36:57,232 --> 00:36:58,581
That's okay. In a minute.

916
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,810
In a minute. I got it.

917
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,234
All right, let me get in there.

918
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,838
Hey.

919
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:07,523
Need any help in here?

920
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,541
Little early, aren't you?

921
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:09,720
Yeah, well I couldn't
get any sleep.

922
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,978
Figured you could use a hand.

923
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:13,257
Yeah, get a third line started.

924
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:14,247
I.V.'s blown.

925
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:15,562
Okay, bag him.

926
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,851
What's wrong with this guy?

927
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:20,598
Known alcoholic, G.I. bleed

928
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:21,922
history of cirrhosis.

929
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:23,589
Possible subdural hematoma.

930
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,869
I had to cardiovert.

931
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:25,525
You're kidding.

932
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,693
No. Zapped him twice,

933
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,761
got him back, then
he goes apneic on me

934
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:30,096
and I had to tube him.

935
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:31,430
On your first night?

936
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:32,932
I haven't even told you

937
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:36,469
about the guy who
desatted up in the S.I.C.U.

938
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,909
Benton's breakfast starts
in a couple of minutes.

939
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:44,844
Last ones.

940
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,415
Breakfast... right.

941
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,749
After this year,

942
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:52,084
I'll associate
omelets and oatmeal

943
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,087
with a deep sense of
personal inadequacy.

944
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:57,757
How many sutures
have we put in this guy?

945
00:37:57,793 --> 00:37:59,437
I've lost count. Hundreds.

946
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:00,427
At least.

947
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:02,696
How you holding up?

948
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,030
Okay.

949
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,065
I'm really tired.

950
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:11,577
I can look on the
bright side, though.

951
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:13,372
I'm off in only 13 hours.

952
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:14,635
Whew.

953
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,858
I'm on tonight.

954
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,138
Thanks for coming in to help.

955
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,761
It's no problem.

956
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,709
Well, that's it.

957
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:22,898
We're done.

958
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,867
Well, then, guess it's time

959
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,203
for our early
morning humiliation.

960
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,305
Benton's breakfast it is.

961
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:30,535
Just in time too.

962
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,125
I was starting to feel
too good about myself.

963
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:40,666
Hi.

964
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,469
Hey.

965
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:45,904
Did you get your test back?

966
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:48,341
Uh...

967
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:52,645
Yeah.

968
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,147
It was negative.

969
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:58,001
That's good. That's good.

970
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,485
Yeah.

971
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:01,537
I'm glad.

972
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,273
Have you told anyone yet?

973
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,109
About my test? No.

974
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,910
About me.

975
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:10,830
No.

976
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:12,648
Good. I don't want you to.

977
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,751
Uh... I've decided not
to tell anyone about it.

978
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,633
Is that what Greene
told you to do?

979
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,307
No. It's a personal decision

980
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:23,692
and I'd appreciate
it if you'd honor it.

981
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,763
Jeanie...

982
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,859
Are you asking
me to lie for you?

983
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,133
I'm not asking you to lie.

984
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,018
I'm asking you to
keep your mouth shut.

985
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:33,981
But I don't know
if I can do that.

986
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,955
Fine. Thanks for
all your support.

987
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,835
Hey, hey, hey. Jeanie,
come here, come here.

988
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,141
Come here.

989
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,948
So, what?

990
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,029
Do you plan to
keep on practicing?

991
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,697
I don't know what the hell I'm
doing, Peter. I just don't want

992
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,854
my personal life spread
all over the hospital.

993
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,189
Is that asking too much?

994
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,402
I don't know, Jeanie.

995
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:55,975
Right.

996
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:58,344
Look, Jeanie, I'm...

997
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,851
We really need to
formalize chart review.

998
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:06,453
Why would we want to do that?

999
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,787
Quality assurance.

1000
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,323
The residents can't
improve their diagnostic skills

1001
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:12,069
without monitoring and feedback.

1002
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,392
Our residents' diagnostic skills

1003
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:15,394
are pretty terrific the
way they are, Kerry.

1004
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,129
They don't need
more supervision.

1005
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,465
They need more vacation.

1006
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,977
Good morning, everybody.

1007
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,646
Mark, it was just a suggestion.

1008
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,135
We can discuss it in depth

1009
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,982
at the Tuesday
Attendings meeting.

1010
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,706
What Tuesday Attendings meeting?

1011
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:28,407
Memo in your box.

1012
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:30,142
Mark, what's up with this board?

1013
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,311
Is it going to stay
like this forever?

1014
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,813
No, it's not.

1015
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,147
Come on, Jerry.

1016
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,495
Let's put the patients'
last names back up here,

1017
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,331
and let's list their
complaints in English, please.

1018
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,156
Yes, I promise I'll
give him the message.

1019
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,157
I will.

1020
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,158
Okay, bye.

1021
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,393
Bye now. Bye-bye.

1022
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:48,661
Ross in yet?

1023
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,662
That girl called again.

1024
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:50,663
What girl?

1025
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:51,876
Every five minutes.

1026
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,165
She's driving me crazy.

1027
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,166
You crazy, Randy?

1028
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,301
We can't have that.

1029
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:56,747
Gretchen... she's
called 50 times.

1030
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:58,015
It's not even 7:00 a.m.

1031
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,105
Thank you.

1032
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,173
Call her back. I'm
not your secretary.

1033
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,458
I've got a lot of work to do.

1034
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,305
Another stewardess? No.

1035
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:05,378
Cocktail waitress?

1036
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:06,846
Hat-check girl?

1037
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,015
You all think you
know me so well.

1038
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,516
Yes, that's because we do.

1039
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,186
Gretchen's a mergers
and acquisitions specialist

1040
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,520
at First National.

1041
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,923
She went to Smith and Yale law.

1042
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:18,758
She's a Rhodes scholar.

1043
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,109
Smith. Wow.

1044
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,961
Most of the women you
date can't even spell Smith.

1045
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,781
I'm shocked.

1046
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,166
Yeah, well, I'm
full of surprises.

1047
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:28,746
Hey, when do we get to
meet this renaissance woman?

1048
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,737
Uh...

1049
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,822
a Rhodes scholar?

1050
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,523
Carter have a nice
night? Oh, yeah.

1051
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,026
Boy will fetch, heel,
roll over and play dead

1052
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,127
if you ask him to.

1053
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,128
Doughnuts. Lydia, donut?

1054
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,142
I bought them for the nurses.

1055
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,299
Chocolate. Why,
thank you, doctor.

1056
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,467
Carter, come.

1057
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,634
I need you.

1058
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,981
Doughnut, Dr. Benton?

1059
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,638
Dr. Karubian told me that
you woke him last night

1060
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,707
asking him how to
work an oxygen mask.

1061
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,221
It was a little bit more
complicated than that.

1062
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,644
Carter, where's your tie?

1063
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,645
Long story.

1064
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,147
Uh-uh. No time for that.

1065
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,482
Five flights?

1066
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,997
I hope you had
plenty of rest last night.

1067
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,491
Doug.

1068
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,338
Gretchen, what
are you doing here?

1069
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,161
Hey, I've been
calling you all morning.

1070
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,407
Well, I've been busy.

1071
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,664
They're doing inventory
at the store today

1072
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,633
so I was hoping we
could have lunch.

1073
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,347
Today, I can't. I'm sorry.

1074
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,669
Um, uh...

1075
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,171
but, uh... listen.

1076
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,840
I've got to get back
to my patients, okay?

1077
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,021
So, why don't you
come over later?

1078
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,012
I don't want to come over later.

1079
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,480
I want to meet your friends

1080
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,048
go to dinner, go see a movie.

1081
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,527
Okay, Gretchen, listen to
me. All that is going to happen

1082
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,219
but right now, I've
got to get back to work.

1083
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,287
When, Doug? When will it happen?

1084
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,068
Tonight, we're going to go to
dinner, 7:00. I'll pick you up, all right?

1085
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:42,041
Yeah?

1086
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:43,153
Yeah. You pick the place, okay?

1087
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:44,277
Okay.

1088
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,463
Okay. But I now have
to go to work, okay?

1089
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,464
Okay.

1090
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,877
Okay, all right. I'll see you.

1091
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,933
7:00?

1092
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,008
Yep, 7:00.

1093
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,559
Gretchen?

1094
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:02,862
No. She's just somebody

1095
00:43:02,897 --> 00:43:05,564
that I haven't seen
in a... in a long time.

1096
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,704
Jerry, don't you have
some work to do?

1097
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,106
Hi. This is Gretchen.

1098
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:16,542
At the tone, leave your name,
number and message. Thanks.

1099
00:43:16,577 --> 00:43:17,877
Gretchen, hi. It's Doug.

1100
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:19,378
Listen, you just left here.

1101
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:20,713
Uh, I'm sorry.

1102
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:23,616
I just realized I can't have
dinner with you tonight.

1103
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:25,462
Uh, I'm swamped,
and I just forgot.

1104
00:43:25,486 --> 00:43:26,719
Uh, I'm sorry.

1105
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:29,388
Uh... I'll talk to you in
a couple of days, okay?

1106
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:30,423
Bye-bye.

1107
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,604
Carter.

1108
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,439
Uh, someone left some sparklers

1109
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,775
in the trauma room.

1110
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,942
You want them?

1111
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,449
I heard you caught
another central line.

1112
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,951
Any trouble?

1113
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,631
No. I hit it the first time.

1114
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,772
Yeah. That's the way it is.

1115
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:22,391
You know, sometimes,
you can't find them.

1116
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,693
Other times, they
are right there.

1117
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,970
I haven't seen one of
these since I was a kid.

1118
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,808
That's...

1119
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,488
It's me, it's me, it's me.

1120
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,312
You're a very popular guy.

1121
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,981
It's the E.R.

1122
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,983
I'll go check it out.

1123
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,985
Get some more fresh air.

1124
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,020
Thanks.

1125
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,825
Carter, how much
longer are you on?

1126
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,327
Two hours.

1127
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,329
You're going to make it.
