1
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,771
Come on, baby.

2
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,045
Oh, my God!

3
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,504
Help me!

4
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,588
Whoa, I got a pumper.

5
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,623
He's going to need an airway.

6
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,624
Stop moving around.

7
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,826
Scissors. Anybody?

8
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,261
We got a pressure?

9
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,563
70/40.

10
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,298
Pulse weak and thready at 150.

11
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,899
Buddy, you see who shot you?

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,634
You get a plate number?

13
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,703
He's not talking right now.

14
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,171
Start the O-Neg on infuser

15
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,128
and somebody find Lewis.

16
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,243
I feel a bullet.

17
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,644
I don't want to
die. You'll be fine.

18
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,679
Let's get a head C.T.

19
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,946
Where's Lewis?
How should I know?

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,537
Please don't let me die!

21
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,886
Jerry!

22
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,256
Jerry! Have you seen Dr. Lewis?

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,624
Curtain area three
with a heart attack.

24
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,048
Yo-Yo Ma plays the cello.

25
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,596
Get Benton out of the O.R.

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,731
Pregnant woman's coming in
with a gunshot to the abdomen.

27
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,798
How far out?

28
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,300
Two minutes or less.

29
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,324
Got it.

30
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,641
Your history suggests that
the pain may be heart-related.

31
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,042
Susan, Mark needs
you in Trauma Two.

32
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,310
Gunshot wound to the neck.

33
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,945
Okay, be right there. Does
C.C.U. have any beds?

34
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,146
Still backed up from last night.

35
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,115
Okay, we're going to
have to hold you down here

36
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,384
until a bed opens up
in the cardiac care unit,

37
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,220
and then we'll send you
up as soon as we can.

38
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,221
My baby!

39
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,723
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

40
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:27,757
Go, go, go.

41
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,759
B.P.'s 90/60.

42
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,893
Pulse is 120.

43
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,161
Come on, take it easy.

44
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,396
She's full term,

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,566
I need a fetal monitor from
L&D and doctor's scope.

46
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,550
Damn it!

47
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,801
Are you okay?

48
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,638
Watch that damn gurney? Damn.

49
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,939
We need a fresh gurney in here.

50
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,675
Belenzela with a "B" or a "V"?

51
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,010
Connie, get ultrasound in
here. Do the paper work later.

52
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:48,995
Please, please!

53
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,180
Is my baby all right?

54
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,167
Uterus tender, no exit
wounds. Let's prep for a pelvic.

55
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:55,191
Call OB.

56
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,439
We need a type
and cross, four units.

57
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,007
Where's everybody?

58
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,509
12 GSWs, four critical.

59
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,110
Glass is flying,
it's a real mess.

60
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:07,430
Pulse ox 95, BP
90/60, pulse 120.

61
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,748
Two hours late.

62
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,483
What? Carter.

63
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,586
Upstairs. I'm going to have
to run the blood up myself.

64
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,555
All right. Not dilated.
Vertex presentation.

65
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:16,690
Fetal heart rate's 145.

66
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:18,040
That's good. That's very good.

67
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,860
Lydia, I need you to
stay put. We need you.

68
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,728
I'm not done next door.

69
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,918
Where the hell is Carter?

70
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,645
Oh, God.

71
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,763
Oh, God.

72
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:40,930
Oh, God, oh, God...

73
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,048
Oh, God! What is all this?

74
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:43,116
Traffic.

75
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,168
Can't you do something?

76
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,192
Like what?

77
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,407
Stop the cab.

78
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,777
No problem.

79
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,284
Keep the change.

80
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,621
Oh, God.

81
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:23,228
Oh, God.

82
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,238
It still hurts so bad.

83
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:15,141
It started when I was
shopping for my children.

84
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,076
Fill that out, please.

85
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,578
Would you like to see
pictures of my grandchildren?

86
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:20,480
I always bring them with me.

87
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:22,348
I have four sons and
three grandchildren...

88
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,349
ER. Yeah.

89
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,151
Yeah, I'll hold.

90
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,286
Look at him. Isn't he darling?

91
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,222
Excuse me? And here's Jeff...

92
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,823
Where the hell is psych?

93
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,140
All blond and very... Excuse me.

94
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,531
Hang on, will you, please?

95
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,032
Oh, they're so...

96
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,335
I miss them so much.

97
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,786
Oh, Dr. Lewis. Bipolar.

98
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,921
I called psych, but there is
something wrong with her leg.

99
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,056
Got another gunshot coming.

100
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,724
Put her on the board
and hope psych shows up.

101
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,993
It was that
son-of-a-bitch cardiologist.

102
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,978
My sister met the president.

103
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,429
Excuse me!

104
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,430
What?

105
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,998
Thank you.

106
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,999
We're the new
third-year students.

107
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,000
We're looking for Dr. Greene.

108
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,101
You're a med student?

109
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,136
Yeah.

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
Anybody know how
to take a history?

111
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:03,210
Sure.

112
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,342
Mrs. Constantine? I
was not a cat person...

113
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,593
Mrs. Constantine, this is...

114
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,263
Harper. Harper Tracy.

115
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,932
This is Dr. Tracy.
Harper? Harper!

116
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,233
I knew someone who played

117
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,468
in the New York
Philharmonic named Harper.

118
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,070
I played with him.

119
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,606
You're going to go to
Exam Two Right over there.

120
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,141
Do you like Paul Newman?

121
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,342
I love those blue eyes.

122
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,444
All right, hang two units.

123
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,447
All right, Peter.
What have you got?

124
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,716
Full-term abdominal
GSW, no exit wound.

125
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,451
Baby's moving, heart's beating.

126
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,752
I think the bullet's
in the uterus.

127
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:34,853
Sounds like a section.

128
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:35,754
Fetal heart rate's
falling... 100.

129
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,306
How's mom?

130
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,375
80/50, pulse 140 and climbing.

131
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,426
Is my baby okay?

132
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,760
Free blood in the peritoneum.

133
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:42,995
All right, we're moving her now.

134
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,031
Call the O.R., let them
know we're on our way

135
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,366
with an emergency
section and get OB.

136
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,367
Peter, what happened to you?

137
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:49,435
Don't ask.

138
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,870
Can you handle this?

139
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:52,872
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I
just need to walk it off.

140
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:53,896
You're having your baby!

141
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:09,988
Oh, no.

142
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,125
GSW to the head.

143
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,860
Two large-bore IVs,
pressure's 60/40,

144
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,095
bradycardic at 50.

145
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,096
All right, Lee, Trauma One.

146
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,097
What happened?

147
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,098
Gang fight. Nice shirt.

148
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,099
I'm a dead man.

149
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,322
Hey! Welcome back, Carter.

150
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,424
Hey, Dr. Carter, I presume.

151
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,725
What's up, Carter? Great tan.

152
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,726
Thanks.

153
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,727
Jerry! Where's Dr. Benton,

154
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,929
and has he been asking about me?

155
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,497
Yeah, once or twice,
and he's up in surgery.

156
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,933
Crash section...
Pregnant woman got shot.

157
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,389
He just limped up.

158
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,670
Hi, Dr. Greene!

159
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,404
Hey! Who is that?

160
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,639
Carter, I think.
Dr. Benton's student.

161
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,775
Well, tell him to slow down.

162
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,577
I am on the phone with
cardiology every day.

163
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,745
They claim the CCU's full.

164
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,280
I go up, and there
are empty beds.

165
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,015
We had a rule-out MI
down here for two days.

166
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,150
Hey, you're an attending now.

167
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,552
You got a problem
with another department,

168
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,787
You solve it.

169
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,522
Oh, and you've got new
third-years coming in today.

170
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,723
Today?

171
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,224
Four of them. Bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

172
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,861
And staff meeting
at 4:00, don't forget.

173
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,128
Forget what?

174
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,465
My first staff
meeting's today at 4:00.

175
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,200
Hey, little boss, what'd
the big boss want?

176
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,268
Something about me accepting

177
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,336
the heavy mantle
of my new position.

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,871
You set the tone?
You got the drift.

179
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,206
Hey, how are you set for cash?

180
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,740
Oh, so you need
that 200 bucks back?

181
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,042
I'm a little strapped for cash.

182
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,510
No, no, no. I'll make you
up a schedule for next week.

183
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,612
I thought maybe you could
pull a graveyard attending shift,

184
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,614
put a little extra
cash in your pocket?

185
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,615
Really? Yeah.

186
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,616
Consider it done.

187
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,885
Great. Dr. Greene?

188
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,119
Yeah. I got three lost sheep,

189
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,254
claim to be medical students.

190
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,256
I thought there were
supposed to be four of them.

191
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,924
One's doing a
history of a bipolar.

192
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,125
Should be done by next Tuesday.

193
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,228
All right. Uh... this way,
guys. I'm Dr. Greene.

194
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,262
Jerry, you got anything

195
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,530
of the pediatric
persuasion up there?

196
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,733
I've got a Scandinavian
flight attendant

197
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,735
with a bum ankle and an earache.

198
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,270
And you saved her all for me?

199
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,196
I love you, big
man, you know that.

200
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,159
Nine months pregnant.

201
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,061
Couldn't find the bullet?

202
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,863
It's got to be in the
uterus here somewhere.

203
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,432
Her pressure's barely holding.
There's no time to waste.

204
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,433
Dr. Benton.

205
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,801
Carter, don't bother
coming in here.

206
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,003
I'm sorry. I came
straight from the airport.

207
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,137
Retract the bladder flap.

208
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,405
Big storm in the
Gulf. Hurricane Phyllis.

209
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,806
Your student?

210
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,807
Don't remind me.

211
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,142
Nice tan.

212
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,844
So, student, what
is the most important

213
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,696
anatomical
structure to identify?

214
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,531
Uh... the uterus?

215
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,733
Ureter.

216
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,702
Cut that, you're in
trouble... She can't pee.

217
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,837
What's its name?

218
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,005
Carter.

219
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,773
Carter, basic anatomy:
what muscle forms the floor

220
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,797
of the pelvis?

221
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,444
Uh...

222
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,812
Levator ani. Ah!

223
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,363
The ovarian artery
comes off the aorta, just a...

224
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,951
I know the ovarian artery
comes off the aorta to, uh...

225
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,702
Inferior mesenteric artery.

226
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,420
The word "student."
doesn't that imply

227
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,455
that you're actually supposed

228
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,962
to be teaching him
something, Peter?

229
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,457
Hello.

230
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,825
I'm Dr. Ross,

231
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,761
and you must be...

232
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:02,862
Hulda.

233
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,830
Hulda.

234
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,566
What a beautiful name, Hulda.

235
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,784
What seems to be the problem?

236
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,753
I hurt my ankle, and
it hurts very much.

237
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,420
Let's take a look at it.

238
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:14,557
A man dropped his little
vodka bottle in the aisle,

239
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,581
and she slipped.

240
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,759
It tickles.

241
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:25,768
Haleh, lateral A.P. and
oblique views, please.

242
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,870
Hulda, it doesn't
seem to be broken.

243
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,989
We're going to get some x-rays

244
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:34,059
and we may want to
consider a cast, just to be safe.

245
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,093
Oh, and my ear.

246
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,912
It's very sore.

247
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,447
For many months, all this...

248
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,284
going up and
coming down, I think.

249
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,308
Yes?

250
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,192
Look, we're really busy today,

251
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,894
and I didn't know
you were coming,

252
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,495
so you're going to
have to park yourselves

253
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,897
in here for a while,

254
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,833
and I'll come round you up
when I get a minute, okay?

255
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,601
Here you go.

256
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,837
Harrison's Principles
of Internal Medicine.

257
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,673
Rosen, volumes
one, two, and three.

258
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,775
Start reading.

259
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,342
Hey, who's that?

260
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,410
Med students.

261
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,412
I gave them Harrison's.

262
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,514
Wow. That'll keep them busy.

263
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,716
I need you in Curtain 2.

264
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,350
Yeah, sure.

265
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,451
Listen, there's another student

266
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,853
floating around some
place with a bipolar.

267
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,088
Could you try and find them?

268
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,189
Yeah.

269
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,590
So who's going to
be the new chief?

270
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,992
You.

271
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,994
Yeah, I wish. Maybe
next year when I'm eligible.

272
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,395
Who do you think it should be?

273
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,164
Jane Pratt... she's smart, nice,

274
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,999
easy to work with,
everybody likes her.

275
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,233
Jane's great.

276
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,367
Yeah. It's your decision, right?

277
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,736
Well, I'll find that
out this afternoon.

278
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,705
You guys were roommates
for a while, right?

279
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,539
Yep.

280
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,208
Me.

281
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,776
How you doing, sir?

282
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,512
I'm not so good.
I got a headache.

283
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,513
It's probably the nitro.

284
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,081
Why is he still down here?

285
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,105
CCU's full again.

286
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,117
Sir, you're going to have

287
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,119
to stay down here
for a little longer,

288
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,387
so if you can just relax

289
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,324
and enjoy the peace and
enjoy the peace and qu...

290
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,343
Jerry! For God's sake!

291
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,711
Shut him up, will you, please?!

292
00:11:58,735 --> 00:11:59,978
<i>Silencio, por favor.</i>

293
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,616
I'll try cardiology again.

294
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,068
Thanks. So, it's Jane
for chief resident?

295
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,092
Why not?

296
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,088
Carter, get ready to suction.

297
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,890
Here she comes.

298
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,226
How does she look?

299
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,744
She's breathing.

300
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,980
Color, tone, fair.

301
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,250
Apgar?

302
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,335
Eight.

303
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,336
Cord's cut.

304
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,437
Benton, you stay
with the mother.

305
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:26,772
Carter, come with me.

306
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,039
All right.

307
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,109
No exit wounds in the uterus.

308
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,111
Okay, Carter, see the hole?

309
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:34,847
Uh... oh, yeah, thighs.

310
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,248
We got through-and-through
gunshot wounds

311
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,517
through both thighs.

312
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,318
Doesn't look like
it hit any bone.

313
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,720
Got it! In the placenta.

314
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,655
Cut the umbilical line.

315
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,892
Good. Carter, you can
start dressing the wounds.

316
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,343
Rocephin and oxacillin,
250 milligrams each.

317
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,279
Displace the uterus anteriorly.

318
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,516
Check the other organs
for penetrating injury.

319
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,352
Hi. Hell of a way to
make an entrance.

320
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,655
This is your lucky day.

321
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,989
I'll run the bowel.

322
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,426
Oh, you're going
to be fine, just fine.

323
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,717
Yes, you are.

324
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:16,322
You jet-ski?

325
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:17,323
That's me. No way.

326
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:18,457
Haleh, diet or regular?

327
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:19,592
Unleaded.

328
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:20,760
Hey, hey. Listen up, everybody.

329
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,228
We don't have a lot of time.

330
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,231
Admin sent us
another action memo.

331
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:26,799
Excessive use of
surgical supplies.

332
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,968
What?

333
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,069
Personnel must exercise prudence

334
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,621
in the use of expendables

335
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,089
i.e., 4x4's, gloves,

336
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,091
surgical tape, suture kits.

337
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,594
Why don't I just bring a
needle and thread from home?

338
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,463
And alcohol wipes.

339
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,565
Next, ACLS.

340
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:43,866
Steph, you're up October 1st.

341
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,867
And, Wendy,

342
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,035
you've never certified.

343
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,687
What is it?

344
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,955
Don't worry, honey.

345
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,123
You're going to love it.

346
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:52,759
Okay, CPR re-certification.

347
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:55,161
Lily, Lydia, Haleh,

348
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,697
Saturday afternoon, 1:00.

349
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,265
This week?

350
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:00,834
Aw, man, I've got Sox tickets.

351
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,635
Okay, MICN ride-alongs.

352
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:06,973
Joanie, you've got to get
your hours in before Halloween.

353
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:08,541
And, Lily, if it makes
you feel any better,

354
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:09,843
I've procrastinated,

355
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:11,560
and now I have to do
a paramedic ride-along

356
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,561
in the next 10 days,

357
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,562
or I lose my certification.

358
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,697
Are you happy?

359
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,032
Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,568
Last but not least...

361
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,870
the hated peach.

362
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,511
They have stopped making
this particularly delightful shade.

363
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,929
Take a look at the catalog

364
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,631
and get back to
me with your choice.

365
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:32,649
I look bad in that green.

366
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:35,318
Carol, 47's three minutes out

367
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,752
and they're in trouble.

368
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,189
Okay, everybody, I need your
picks by the end of the day.

369
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,590
Most votes wins
unless I hate it,

370
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,358
and then, whatever I like goes.

371
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:46,462
What is this all about?

372
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,463
Air conditioning repairs.

373
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,464
Mark, hi.

374
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,400
Oh, hi, Jane. How you doing?

375
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,201
Susan told me that
she had talked to you

376
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,870
about my becoming
chief resident.

377
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,471
Well, I just wanted
you to know that

378
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,274
I didn't put her up to it. I
know you two are good friends,

379
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,077
and I do want the job, but I
didn't ask her to approach you.

380
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,178
No, I didn't think you had.

381
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,163
I hear Kerry
Weaver's interested.

382
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,631
Weaver over at Mount Sinai?

383
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,366
She'd do a good job.

384
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,084
I'll do it better.

385
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,602
All right. Thanks.

386
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,304
Thank you.

387
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,539
You're welcome.

388
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:16,442
Thank you.

389
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,377
I thought I'd left enough time.

390
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,779
You get here an hour before me,

391
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:20,980
you leave an hour after me,

392
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,381
You pre-round my
patients before I arrive,

393
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:24,951
you order tomorrow's
labs after I leave,

394
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,119
you check out my
surgical schedule,

395
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,955
and you study the
cases the night before.

396
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,190
What'd you get read this summer?

397
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:33,058
Schwartz's
<i>Principles of Surgery?</i>

398
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:35,127
<i>Sabiston's Essentials?</i>

399
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,550
<i>Surgical Secrets?</i>

400
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,400
Let me get a turkey
breast on whole grain.

401
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:44,437
Lettuce, tomato,
extra sprouts, no mayo.

402
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:48,208
Carter, you reflect on me now.

403
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:50,109
You screw up, I screw up.

404
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,711
You don't know the
answer to some question,

405
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,079
that's because I
didn't teach you.

406
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,731
Hey, no mayo.

407
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,732
What do you want, Carter?

408
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,233
Could I get a polish dog

409
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,802
with extra onions,
extra peppers,

410
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,904
and cheese?

411
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,138
A lot of cheese, please.

412
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:06,109
Surgery is the most
difficult specialty of all.

413
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,443
Fifteen students
wanted this spot,

414
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,445
and at least 100 will
want the surgical residency

415
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,480
that you're applying
for next year.

416
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,049
Now, you want to be a surgeon?

417
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,753
Well, then you start
acting like a surgeon.

418
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,971
I've got a thyroidectomy
this afternoon.

419
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,607
What do you know about
the arteries in the neck?

420
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:22,647
There's a lot of them.

421
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,146
You have an hour and 25 minutes.

422
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,348
I suggest you locate a<i> Gray's</i>

423
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,904
and start memorizing it.

424
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,456
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

425
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,191
What seems to be the problem?

426
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:39,692
I have a rash on my thighs.

427
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,026
Anywhere else?

428
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,395
Not this time.

429
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,996
Why don't you hop up on the bed

430
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,132
and we'll take a look.

431
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:48,301
Um, Ms., uh...

432
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,902
Sweet. Loretta Sweet.

433
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,304
Sweet.

434
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,871
Are you sexually active?

435
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,615
No. Mostly, I just lie there.

436
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,927
You use condoms?

437
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:02,048
If I owned the factory,
I'd be rich by now.

438
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,882
Looks like contact dermatitis.

439
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,151
Is that bad?

440
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,920
No. A little cortisone
cream will clear it right up.

441
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,788
You must be allergic
to something you came

442
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:10,807
in contact with.

443
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,775
Right.

444
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,377
I'd try to avoid
coming into contact

445
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,579
with it again in the future.

446
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,931
Okay? Okay.

447
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,675
I got two kids at
home, you know?

448
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,891
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

449
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,948
No, thanks.

450
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,987
Anytime.

451
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:45,291
Adult male found passed
out in his own vomit.

452
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,760
BP, 80/50 on
arrival. Pulse is 132.

453
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,796
Resps shallow at 24, tremulous.

454
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,164
Stopped breathing
two minutes out.

455
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,265
I can't ventilate him.

456
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,767
Cyanotic. Pulse up to 170.

457
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,935
That's airway obstruction.

458
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,137
We've got to move
him fast. Let's go.

459
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,439
He's had glucose and Narcan.

460
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:00,440
Daddy!

461
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:02,174
The kid found
him. He called 911.

462
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:03,359
Out of the way! Out of the way!

463
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,395
Daddy!

464
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,396
Nope.

465
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,064
Damn it!

466
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,134
Somebody get Mark in here.
We need a crike tray now.

467
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,802
Here. Take over.

468
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,372
No sign of trauma.

469
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,906
He's got two IVs
with saline wide open,

470
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,409
one liter so far.

471
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,710
We've sucked in 500 CCs of
blood from his upper airway.

472
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,695
One, two, three.

473
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,079
Again. One, two, three.

474
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,365
How much time do we have?

475
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:26,365
Almost three minutes.

476
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,700
Where's the damn doctor?

477
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:28,718
Daddy!

478
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:29,719
Again.

479
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:30,786
One, two, three.

480
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,288
We're out of time. Crike him.

481
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,689
Again. Harder.

482
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:34,674
Get this kid out of here!

483
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,476
Get him out of here!

484
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,844
You're not going to die on
my shift, you son of a bitch.

485
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,314
Come on. Come on.

486
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:42,982
I got it.

487
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,106
All right, hyperventilate him.

488
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,788
Daddy! Daddy!

489
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:51,857
All right, what do we got?

490
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,092
Airway obstruction. Male.

491
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:54,327
One, two, three.

492
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:56,295
Approximately 35 years of age.

493
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,897
Tremulous. Possible
impending D.T.'s.

494
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:00,099
Maybe septic, maybe stroke,
metabolic derangement.

495
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:01,501
Daddy! Daddy!

496
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:04,404
All right. CBC,
Chem-19, coag panel,

497
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:06,539
UA and a chest.

498
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,374
Push D-5 normal
saline. He's dehydrated.

499
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,376
Get the banana bag going.

500
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,377
Carol, get a blood gas.

501
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,378
Coming up.

502
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,381
Doctor!

503
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,116
Doctor!

504
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,317
Who the hell is that?

505
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:20,219
Some drunk looking
for a hot meal.

506
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,454
Doctor!

507
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,422
How long has he been at it?

508
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:25,190
About an hour.

509
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,925
It's damn irritating, isn't it?

510
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:30,963
At least he hasn't learned
how to say nurse yet.

511
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:33,266
Nice tan. Thanks.

512
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,267
What's that?

513
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,701
Anatomy of the neck.

514
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,536
Forget it. Too many arteries.

515
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,972
Exactly. I thought this
year was going to be easier.

516
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,074
Wait till you start
your residency.

517
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,042
Want to show a third
year how to start an IV?

518
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,911
No.

519
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,102
You haven't seen her yet.

520
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:51,033
I shave my legs.

521
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,168
I used to wax them,

522
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,769
but that hurts so much.

523
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,438
I love candlelight
and Christmas music,

524
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,539
and the smells...

525
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,775
the mulled cider and chestnuts.

526
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,944
I haven't had a
chestnut in years.

527
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,079
Hi. You the new med student?

528
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,479
Yes. Thank you.

529
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,480
Harper Tracy.

530
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,481
John Carter. How's it going?

531
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,117
I've been trying
to take her history,

532
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,437
but so far, we haven't
gotten past the Crimean War.

533
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,672
You're very handsome.

534
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:13,789
Are you a doctor?

535
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,641
My son's a doctor.

536
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:17,310
I play the cello.
Do you like music?

537
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,061
Yes. Sometimes.

538
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,730
This is Mrs. Constantine.

539
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,533
I think she has cellulitis
in her left lower extremity.

540
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,568
It's swollen, warm and tender.

541
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,471
Haydn, Bach, Saint-Saëns.

542
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,207
Cellulitis sounds about right.

543
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,474
Are you in any pain, ma'am?

544
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,043
The pain?

545
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,963
♪ The pain, the pain
stays Mainly in my brain ♪

546
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,466
I think she's got it.
By jove, she's got it.

547
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,918
She's also clearly bipolar.

548
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:45,555
Right. Dr. Lewis wanted me
to show you how to start an IV.

549
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,156
Pull this little gizmo out,

550
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,158
find your vein, go in bevel up,

551
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:52,661
skin taut,

552
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,314
advancing slowly
till you see a flash.

553
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,582
Needle out, cath in.

554
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:57,600
Thanks. Got it.

555
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,667
Really?

556
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,103
Yeah, I got it.

557
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,972
Madrid, Tokyo, Milano,

558
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,224
Buenos Aires, Barcelona.

559
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,681
I'm sorry, ma'am.

560
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,446
You hit it the first time.

561
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,065
Second chair.

562
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,233
I should have been first chair,

563
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,834
but the conductor...
That bastard...

564
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,203
Was sleeping with
a fat, Italian girl

565
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:19,405
who could not carry a tune.

566
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:20,972
Sex! Sex! Sex!

567
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,241
Same with my husband.

568
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:23,476
He doesn't care...

569
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,061
Thanks. I can take it from here.

570
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:28,430
But I could dance all night.

571
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,266
Okay, then, uh... great.

572
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,302
I would like to put the
moon under my heels,

573
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,871
and go flying up,
up, up into the sky.

574
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,591
Hey, Jerry, do you
know where the kid is

575
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:40,426
from that alcoholic
airway obstruction?

576
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,450
Hmm.

577
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:49,118
Thanks.

578
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,488
You sure it's not that one?

579
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,023
Nice shirt.

580
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,858
It's all I had.

581
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,193
What you doing?

582
00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:59,195
Noah's fixing the VCR.

583
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:01,797
Has a tape stuck in it.

584
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,754
You be cool now, Noah, you hear?

585
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,240
Your dad's going to be okay.

586
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:14,543
I know.

587
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,578
He's going to have to
stay with us for a while.

588
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,580
Is your mom coming?

589
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,983
She lives in Florida.

590
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,685
Is there someone else
who could come get you?

591
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,921
My dad'll take me
home in a while.

592
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,424
He never stays in the hospital.

593
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,465
He's done this before?

594
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,683
And you called 911.
That was very smart.

595
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:40,374
Have you done that before too?

596
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,294
Lots of times?

597
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,800
Do you have a Phillips head?

598
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,304
Sure.

599
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,243
You really know
what you're doing.

600
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,436
Is he still down here?

601
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,372
Kayson says he
doesn't have any beds.

602
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,606
I think we're being followed.

603
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,274
Student.

604
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,942
Uh, Harper Tracy.

605
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,711
Greene, Mark.

606
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,047
No, actually, my
first name is Harper.

607
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,081
The bipolar?

608
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,182
Off her meds.

609
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,350
Psych got her back on lithium,

610
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,685
admitted her for
IV for antibiotics.

611
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,155
How's the Jell-O, Mr. Kuzner?

612
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,623
Delightful.

613
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:38,460
We are going to have you
out of here as soon as we can.

614
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,496
Jerry, how long
is it going to be

615
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,597
until we get this air
conditioning fixed?

616
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,355
A week ago Thursday.

617
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:49,271
Oh, didn't they find asbestos

618
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,574
in this building a
couple of years ago?

619
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,876
Oh, not again.

620
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,877
Kiss little Suzie for me.

621
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:56,862
Yeah.

622
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:58,396
Ah!

623
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,865
Dr. Lewis,<i> pour vous.</i>

624
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,399
A little taste from the islands.

625
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,502
Oh, thank you.

626
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,837
Dr. Greene.

627
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,071
Yeah?

628
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:08,940
I have something for you.

629
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,075
There you go.

630
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,409
Oh, thank you.

631
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,011
Carol?

632
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,145
Hmm?

633
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:15,714
Oh, Carter, it's beautiful.

634
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:17,204
Thank you.

635
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:22,738
All right.

636
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,873
Carter?

637
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,897
Where are my charts?

638
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,931
Maybe you should have saved

639
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:33,432
one of these for yourself.

640
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,621
Oh, but I did.

641
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,045
Hey.

642
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,079
Hey.

643
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:48,103
Here you go.

644
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,870
Jerry, why are there
three kids in cheap ties

645
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:58,173
reading textbooks in Exam 3?

646
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,809
Oh, damn, the med
students. I forgot.

647
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,211
Dr. Greene, staff
meeting's in five.

648
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,446
Could you see if
they need anything

649
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,314
and tell them I'll
be back in an hour?

650
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,149
Sure. Right.

651
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,486
Uh, Dr. Ross, a little
taste of the islands.

652
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,087
Carter, you shouldn't have.

653
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,255
It's Wondoa. He's
the god of fertility.

654
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,323
Just what you need, Doug.

655
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,225
Come on, Mark,
I'll walk with you.

656
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,226
To the staff meeting?

657
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,728
Yeah, I'm nurse
manager. I always go.

658
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,451
Nice hat.

659
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,767
See you.

660
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,636
Yeah, see you.

661
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,170
Carter. Yeah?

662
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,039
O.R., let's go.

663
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,641
You should really
put some ice on that.

664
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,842
I'm fine.

665
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,377
I think I've got the
neck arteries down.

666
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,646
There's the Common
Carotid, Superior Thyroid...

667
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,715
Thyroidectomy's called
off. We're doing a hernia.

668
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:43,473
I hope you know your way
around Hesselbach's Triangle.

669
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:51,777
Folks, can we get started?

670
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,613
Please, can we start on time?

671
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,047
For those of you who don't know,

672
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,650
Mark Greene is joining
us as an attending,

673
00:25:57,674 --> 00:26:00,619
now that he's
completed his residency.

674
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,237
Mark, have you
given any thought as to

675
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,622
who should succeed
you as chief resident?

676
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,091
I was thinking Jane Pratt
would be an excellent choice.

677
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:08,827
She that blond,
always wears sweaters?

678
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:12,264
Uh... no, brunette, tall.

679
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:14,533
She's very smart,
uh... well-liked.

680
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:16,535
Easy to get along
with, very competent.

681
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,103
That's pretty much how
I would describe you.

682
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:19,304
You might want to
consider someone

683
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,606
Who would complement
your weaknesses.

684
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,575
Which are?

685
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,694
Discipline, paper work,

686
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,030
administration.

687
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,798
Any other candidates?

688
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,567
She'd be my first choice.

689
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,620
Carol, any thoughts?

690
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:37,055
Pratt's the best
of this year's crop.

691
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,741
She'd take the
least baby-sitting.

692
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,160
Mark, you know Kerry
Weaver over at Mount Sinai?

693
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,628
Only by reputation.

694
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:43,629
I'd like you to meet her.

695
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:45,063
Okay.

696
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,982
Can we get this Ross
thing finally resolved today?

697
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,051
Oh, Neil.

698
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,752
Look, I know nobody
thinks this is important,

699
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,887
but I don't understand

700
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,105
why my pediatric
budget is carrying the cost

701
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,974
of an ER fellowship
for Doug Ross.

702
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:59,511
It's an ER Pediatrics
fellowship, Neil.

703
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,747
Okay, then put him
under my supervision.

704
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:05,350
I'll keep him in the clinic
where I'm severely understaffed,

705
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,085
and when there's a real
pediatrics emergency,

706
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:08,887
you can call him down.

707
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,088
They need him
in the ER full-time.

708
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,422
Then let them pay!

709
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:14,392
They're severely
under-budgeted and you know it!

710
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,394
I like Ross, but he
is a bit of a cowboy.

711
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:17,745
A bit?

712
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,882
David, he's arrogant and
dismissive of my authority.

713
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,350
Now, I'm warning you right now,

714
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,487
when his fellowship comes
up for renewal in November,

715
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,039
I'm not going to sign off on it.

716
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,356
You want him,

717
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,191
you find the money for him.

718
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,455
Let's jump off that bridge
when we get to it, shall we?

719
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,397
Okay, Mark,

720
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,499
we need to talk about who covers

721
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,483
the attending swing shifts.

722
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:39,501
It's a nice piece of change.

723
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,502
Any thoughts?

724
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,037
Uh, no.

725
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,806
I'll... I'll get you
some names later.

726
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,491
Next on the agenda,

727
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:49,428
we've got a JCAH
inspection coming up.

728
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:50,629
Come on, people.

729
00:27:50,653 --> 00:27:52,731
This is what allows us to
call ourselves a hospital.

730
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,616
Help me, please!

731
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,218
Somebody, help me!

732
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,887
It's my brother. Please!

733
00:27:58,911 --> 00:27:59,955
He fell off the boat.

734
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,723
Grab the gurney on the side.

735
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:02,724
Come on, man.

736
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,325
No spontaneous resps.

737
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,327
Come on, Jimmy.

738
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,746
Get an ambu-bag
and set up suction.

739
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,998
Jerry, Trauma 1 open?

740
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,466
No, air conditioning
guys are down there.

741
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,168
Curtain 2.

742
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,003
Get respiratory here
stat! He's not breathing.

743
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,667
Lily, we're going
to need a scribe.

744
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,608
Pulse ox is 80. He's hypoxic.

745
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:21,459
E.T. Tray, seven and a half.

746
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:22,577
Please, what's happening?

747
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,296
Sir, you're going to
have to wait outside.

748
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,497
Someone get these
air conditioning guys

749
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:26,665
out of here now.

750
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:27,721
Anybody get a blood gas?

751
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:32,571
Please, please.

752
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,372
Tracy, get over here
where you can see.

753
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:35,941
Oh, god.

754
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,693
Don't do this, man.

755
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,260
Core temp's 82.

756
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,696
CBC, Chem-7, coag
panel, chest film.

757
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,263
Don't die, please.

758
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,200
Are those meetings
always that much fun?

759
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,267
Kind of boring this week.

760
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,836
Nobody took a swing at anybody.

761
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,005
Do they always talk about
the residents like that?

762
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,007
Want to hear what they
used to say about you?

763
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,508
No.

764
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,443
That drunk with the kid? He's
trying to check himself out AMA.

765
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,145
Okay, and Mark, I knows
it's none of my business,

766
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,146
but Jane Pratt?

767
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,214
I think Morgenstern has a point.

768
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,215
Listen, buddy,

769
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,316
I didn't get a chance

770
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,918
to thank you earlier
for the attending shifts.

771
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,452
It's going to make
a real difference.

772
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,221
I'm kind of behind
in my car payments.

773
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,523
Listen, you did some of your
residency with Kerry Weaver.

774
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,092
Yeah, we crossed paths.

775
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,728
Morgenstern wants me
to consider her for Chief.

776
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:13,929
Really?

777
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,764
That bad?

778
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,722
Did you ever see <i>Cuckoo's Nest?</i>

779
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:23,622
I hear you're going some place.

780
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:24,623
Yeah.

781
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,024
Where's my kid?

782
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:28,159
Noah's in the lounge
watching cartoons.

783
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,962
Well, get him, we're going home.

784
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:32,764
You're suffering from
severe electrolyte imbalance.

785
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:36,201
Your white blood count is high,
and you probably have pneumonia.

786
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:38,003
I just need to sleep it off.

787
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:41,006
You need to be admitted
for fluids and IV antibiotics.

788
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,925
So you can charge me
5,000 bucks like last time?

789
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,260
Let's talk about last time.

790
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,895
Paramedics found you
drowning in your own vomit

791
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,263
on the living room floor.

792
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,165
Your son called it
in, just like today.

793
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,149
Where's my damn shirt?

794
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:52,551
We had to cut it off you.

795
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:54,152
I paid 30 bucks for that shirt.

796
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,837
Who's going to pay
me for that, you?

797
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,290
Somebody... I swear to God,

798
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:01,360
somebody's going
to pay for that.

799
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,795
Find that shirt.

800
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,578
You're not going anyplace.

801
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,296
I don't know why,

802
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,298
but for some reason,
that boy cares about you.

803
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:41,366
Why don't you stay,
get straightened out,

804
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,325
give Noah something
to be proud of?

805
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:51,109
He's not warming up fast enough.

806
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,361
He's in V-fib.

807
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:54,785
Damn it, let's shock
him. Two hundred.

808
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,200
Clear.

809
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,068
Harper, clear.

810
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,270
Nothing. Three hundred.

811
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,294
Clear.

812
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:05,891
Man, someone get
them out of there!

813
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:07,709
Hey! Hey! Get down out of there!

814
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:08,961
What?

815
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:11,980
Come down now.

816
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,231
Three-sixty.

817
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,337
Clear.

818
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,776
Hey...

819
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,862
We've got a beat.

820
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,863
Hey, Davey,

821
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,086
are you okay?

822
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:37,789
What are the borders
of Hesselbach's triangle?

823
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,056
There's some kind of vessel.

824
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,391
Deep inferior epigastric.

825
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:41,892
A ligament? Poupon?

826
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,394
That's a mustard.

827
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,496
Poupart's ligament
and the rectus sheath.

828
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,065
You didn't get one of Dr. Hick"
questions right, not one.

829
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:49,467
Maybe because that's
because you told me

830
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,535
we were doing a thyroidectomy.

831
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,203
You embarrass me in
front of another surgeon,

832
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:53,705
and you'll spend
the rest of your sub-I

833
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,807
suturing bagel
cuts and baby falls.

834
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,241
Rescue 47's on its way.

835
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:59,705
The gang shooting this morning...
Somebody shot the shooter.

836
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:11,912
Uh... Dr. Greene?

837
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,776
Heard a lot of great
things about you.

838
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,610
I'm, uh... Kerry Weaver.

839
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,946
Oh. Hi. Hi.

840
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,231
I'm Mark. Sit down.

841
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:23,450
Oh, thank you.

842
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,904
Just eating something.

843
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,506
So, Morgenstern

844
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,408
says you're going to need
a lot of help around here.

845
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:33,098
Really?

846
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,180
Going to finish those fries?

847
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,871
Oh, no.

848
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,492
Uh, when do I start?

849
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:51,028
All right, people, we all set
for this guy's airway? Yep.

850
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,463
What happened?

851
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:54,899
Some guy fell through the
ceiling, landed on a patient.

852
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:57,434
You're kidding? Broke two of
the patient's ribs and his own leg.

853
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,588
15-year-old male, shotgun
to the chest at close range.

854
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,524
No vitals, no
pulses, no nothing.

855
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,259
This the shooter from
the pregnant lady?

856
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,394
So they say.

857
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,928
And go.

858
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,130
His chest is a mess, you guys.

859
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,154
Carter, CPR, six units
O-neg. Let's move.

860
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,619
Tube's leaking.

861
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:15,886
Asystole.

862
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,454
Oh, man! I think I just
punched right through his ribs.

863
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:20,624
Skip it. Let's tube him.

864
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:22,093
Amp of epi.

865
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:24,962
Carter.

866
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:26,113
Seven and a half.

867
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,297
I'm kind of rusty at this.

868
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:28,516
Find the cords and
thread it through, Carter.

869
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,500
Do it now, Carter.

870
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:31,903
Pull it, pull it, pull it.

871
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:32,920
All right. Let's crack him.

872
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,310
Ah! I got it.

873
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,732
Spreader!

874
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,554
Carter...

875
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:46,517
Retract that lung.

876
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,935
Here we go.

877
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,122
Come on. Just take a
deep breath, all right?

878
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:52,322
Okay.

879
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:54,346
I need you to stay
on your feet here.

880
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:56,794
He's totally dry.

881
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:58,495
Trendelenburg!

882
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,031
I think I'm going to be sick.

883
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,198
No, you're not.

884
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:02,742
Come on. Internal CPR.

885
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:05,119
He's fibrillating.

886
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,610
Damn! His right
ventricle is hit.

887
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,116
Twenty-five. Clear.

888
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,330
We got a beat.

889
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,548
Nope. It's gone.

890
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:18,704
Fifty. Clear.

891
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,452
Asystole.

892
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,020
Well, that helped a lot.

893
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,005
Man, smells kind of like
a barbecue in here, huh?

894
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,312
Oh, God.

895
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,453
Welcome back, Carter.

896
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,289
Oh, no. Please...

897
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:44,892
He's going to be okay.

898
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,195
Thank you.

899
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,163
Thank you.

900
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,122
He, uh... he does have
a couple of broken ribs.

901
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,162
All right. That's it.

902
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,464
Good try, people.

903
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:09,166
He was dead before
he came in the door.

904
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,334
Who's got the death bundle?

905
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,635
I'll get it.

906
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,871
You all right?

907
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:15,706
Good. Sew him back
up, nothing fancy.

908
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,441
I'll see you in the morning.
- 00 a.m. sharp.

909
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:18,459
And, Carter.

910
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,161
Prostatectomy in the morning,

911
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,763
adrenalectomy for a
pheochromocytoma

912
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,787
in the afternoon.

913
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,772
Hi, guys.

914
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,240
Here's your equipment.

915
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,242
The kid make it? No.

916
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,511
It's Hathaway, right?

917
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:37,745
Yeah.

918
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,247
This is Shep. Raul.

919
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,249
See you around, Hathaway.

920
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,233
Oh. Hey, guys.

921
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:44,902
I have to do a ride-along

922
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,336
for my MICN re-certification.

923
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,956
Do you mind if I tag along
with you some time next week?

924
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,257
Sure. You bet.

925
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,315
Anytime... Hathaway.

926
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,884
What?

927
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:00,885
Nothing.

928
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:01,986
It's not like that.

929
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,856
I didn't say a thing.

930
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,858
So, Nurse Hathaway,
what are you doing tonight?

931
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:10,661
I thought maybe I'd rent a
movie, make some popcorn.

932
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:12,463
Sounds good to me.
Maybe I'll bring a pizza.

933
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:13,798
I don't remember inviting you.

934
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:15,600
No, you didn't.
I invited myself.

935
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:16,601
Hello! Night, all.

936
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,969
Good night.

937
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,470
Cardiology still hasn't taken

938
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:20,471
my rule-out MI to CCU.

939
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:21,973
Susan, I can't miss this train.

940
00:36:21,997 --> 00:36:23,674
What's the point of
having a cardiac care unit

941
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:26,276
if you can never
get anyone into it?

942
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,277
If I don't make it

943
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,679
to Union Station in 25 minutes

944
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:30,681
I'm going to be walking
home to Milwaukee.

945
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,182
Mark, you need to do something.

946
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:33,818
I will. I promise.

947
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:36,153
First thing Monday, okay?

948
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:38,155
I heard you hired
Kerry weaver as chief.

949
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,091
That's definitely a move
in the right direction.

950
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,158
You didn't hire Jane?

951
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:42,192
No, I didn't.

952
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:44,161
Were you going to tell me,

953
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,163
or were you planningon
letting me read it off the board?

954
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:47,665
It was my decision,
and I made it.

955
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,970
I got to pick Suzie
up from daycare.

956
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,505
Oh. Hey, Dr. Greene,

957
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:55,572
those medical students

958
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:56,841
are still down in Exam Three.

959
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,242
You want me to send them home?

960
00:36:58,266 --> 00:36:59,266
Oh, God!

961
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,550
Hey. Excuse me.

962
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:08,019
Excuse me.

963
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,586
Yes, yes. You're the young lady

964
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,756
who helped me earlier
today, aren't you?

965
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,157
Mrs. Constantine.

966
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:14,525
Are you feeling better?

967
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,093
Well, I'm a bit tired.

968
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:18,462
Did I tell you that
I play the cello?

969
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,098
Once or twice.

970
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,500
Oh. I'm sorry.

971
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:25,269
I would like to play
something for you

972
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,371
as a kind of thank-you.

973
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,807
Oh, I don't think
that's necessary.

974
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,509
My son brought my cello to me.

975
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:35,345
It helps me pass the
time until I get better.

976
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,415
Really, you don't
have to do this.

977
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:40,673
I mean, maybe you
shouldn't do this.

978
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Hey, you okay?

979
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:02,198
Yeah.

980
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:03,550
No, I'm fine.

981
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,938
Tough first day back, huh?

982
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:09,940
Yeah.

983
00:39:09,964 --> 00:39:12,243
Some days, like
today, I have to forget,

984
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,267
or I'd never come back.

985
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,616
So, did you have a good summer?

986
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,120
Yeah.

987
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:26,190
It was great. Really.

988
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:29,293
I did a pedes rotation
over at Children's.

989
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:32,796
Spent about five weeks
kicking around St. Bart's.

990
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,666
Really? I always wanted
to go. Was it nice?

991
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,905
Yeah.

992
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,840
Doc! Doc! Can
you give us a hand?

993
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:44,984
Kid on a bike got hit
by a car. Full arrest!

994
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:48,345
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

995
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,802
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

996
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,406
Okay, give me the bullet.

997
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,536
Hold on!

998
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,360
No, no, hold it! Thanks!

999
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,757
Chloe?

1000
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,227
Oh, is dinner almost
ready? I am starving.

1001
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:55,629
Yeah, all we got to
do is drop in the pasta,

1002
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,264
and we're all set.

1003
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,865
Oh. Hello.

1004
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,968
My beautiful girl.

1005
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,903
Hi.

1006
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:06,573
Hi, prettiest girl.

1007
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,275
How was school today?

1008
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,309
Uh, great.

1009
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,477
They're teaching us

1010
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,148
how to use the Word and
the... the spreadsheets.

1011
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,549
Honey, you want to come up,

1012
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,851
say hi to mommy?

1013
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,785
Okay, here we go.

1014
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,020
We got your head there.

1015
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,555
Oh. Oh. Here we go.

1016
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,790
Oh... oh, no!

1017
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,759
Oh, no!

1018
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,361
Whoops!

1019
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:29,997
There we go. There we go.

1020
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:33,533
Oh...

1021
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,536
Yes, you're okay.

1022
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,805
Yeah. Oh. No, no.

1023
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,808
It's okay.

1024
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:46,413
Okay.

1025
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,939
I missed you. Yeah.

1026
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,520
Oh, God.

1027
00:42:09,544 --> 00:42:13,123
What time is it?

1028
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,080
Oh, God.

1029
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:25,969
Oh, man.

1030
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:26,993
Peter?

1031
00:42:29,096 --> 00:42:30,474
Peter, hey, wake up.

1032
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:31,941
What?

1033
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:33,377
We fell asleep.

1034
00:42:33,401 --> 00:42:35,845
It's almost midnight.

1035
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:39,049
Oh, man.

1036
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:40,817
What time does he get off work?

1037
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:42,474
In 10 minutes.

1038
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:48,842
Hey.

1039
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,878
Yeah?

1040
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,685
Why don't you stay?

1041
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,989
You know I can't.

1042
00:43:01,095 --> 00:43:02,095
I love you.

1043
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,170
I'll see you tomorrow.
