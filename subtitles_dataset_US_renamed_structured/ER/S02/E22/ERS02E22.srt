LOL, ALOC. Where
do you want her?

12
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,221
Curtain Area 3.
I'll be right there.

13
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,323

Have we got a deal?

19
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,072
I don't know, Mark.

20
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,874
If you don't think I
should be an Attending,

21
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:38,942
you should just say so.

22
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,143
I'm not comfortable
with this bargaining

23
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,244
on Susan Lewis' behalf.

24
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,378
It lacks dignity.

25
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,580
It's the way of the world.

26
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,781
Yeah, but whatever
happened to advancement

27
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,150
based solely on
merit and ability?

28
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,351
It went out with hoop skirts

29
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,352
and smoking jackets.

30
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,754
Damn it, Jerry! Turn it down.

31
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,955
So do we have a deal?

32
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,956
Jerry!

33
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,957
Hold on. Hold on.

34
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,458

Thank you.

41
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,675
Sorry, Dr. Weaver.
They made me do it.

42
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,578
That staff meeting
starts in four minutes.

43
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,079
So you really think

44
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,381
Susan Lewis would make
a good chief Resident?

45
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,449
Honestly?

46
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,150
Yes, I do.

47
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,741
Okay, then.

48
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,655
What was that all about?

49
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,958
I think I just sold
my soul to the devil.

50
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,258
What do you got?

51
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,527
LOL, vitals normal,
oriented times zero.

52
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,396
Lady Godiva, here,
was au de natural,

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,497
running around
Buckingham fountain,

54
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,032
singing songs from My Fair Lady.

55
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,433
Carousel.

56
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,435
"June Is Busting Out All Over"
is Rogers and Hammerstein,

57
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,570
not Lerner and Loewe.

58
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,771
Well, whatever. Just
keep her restrained,

59
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:42,973
or little old Junie, here,

60
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,674
is definitely gonna
be busting out all over.

61
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,909
It ain't pretty.

62
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,912
CBC, Chem-7, tox
screen, glucose,

63
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,081
non-contrast head CT.

64
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,816
Ma'am, do you know your name?

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,685
June. June.

66
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,487
June? June what?

67
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,840
Uh... Allyson. Allyson?

68
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:02,347
June Allyson? That's your name?

69
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,078
So do you know your real name?

70
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,313
Uh... uh...

71
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,331
Yes, I know my name.

72
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,233
It's... I do.

73
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,851
It's okay. Don't worry.
It's not important.

74
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,588
I... I... I know my
name. I know my name.

75
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,823
Probably Alzheimer's.
Call the police.

76
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,025
See if anyone's
reported her missing.

77
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,393
A family, a residential home.

78
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,646
She belongs somewhere.
She's too clean to be homeless.

79
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,048
I know. I know,

80
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,150
but, folks, if we can't
control our office supplies,

81
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,818
particularly paper expendables,

82
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,020
then Admin's gonna
come down here

83
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,087
and control them for us.

84
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,306
So please, tell your people,

85
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,908
no unnecessary Xeroxing, okay?

86
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:36,910
Okay?

87
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,044
Thank you. Next item.

88
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:42,248
Replacing Marty Cannon
as an Attending in the ER.

89
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,250
He's done a great job
for us. Thank you, Marty,

90
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,518
but he's leaving
for greener pastures

91
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:46,586
at the University of Iowa.

92
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,156
Godspeed.

93
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,192
Godspeed. Godspeed.

94
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,494
As to a replacement,

95
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:55,895
Kerry Weaver has everyone's vote

96
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,764
except for Mark.

97
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,281
You've been dragging
your feet on this.

98
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,885
Have you had a chance
to kick this around?

99
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,909
Come to your senses?

100
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,256
I think Kerry's
a terrific choice.

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,709
Oh.

102
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,777
Well, that's great.

103
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:14,347
So you no longer have
any qualms about this?

104
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:15,615
You'll be working together

105
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,118
every day, week after week,
pulling on the same oar.

106
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,603
Teammates. Partners.

107
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,954
Seriously, Mark,

108
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,156
if you're not
excited about this,

109
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,592
I don't see how it
can possibly work.

110
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:26,809
I'm looking
forward to it, really.

111
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,911
Oh, that's great.

112
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,080
Just great.

113
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,282
Good.

114
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,084
Well, case closed.

115
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,123
Uh, parking...

116
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,831
What are you still doing here?

117
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,265
Timing seemed a little off.

118
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,867
You're gonna miss
your appointment.

119
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,202
I'll reschedule.

120
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,837
No, you won't.

121
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,371
It's a bunch of crap, anyway.

122
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,740
I'm fine.

123
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,741
No, it's not.

124
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,476
You need to see somebody, Shep.

125
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,411
I don't need to see
no shrink, okay?

126
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,313
The hell you don't.

127
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,983
You're not sleeping,
you're losing weight.

128
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,985
God, I'm terrified to
get in a car with you.

129
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,987
I'm afraid if someone
cuts you off at the light,

130
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:11,988
you're gonna get out

131
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,790
and beat them to
death with a tire iron.

132
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,659
You're starting to
sound like Riley.

133
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,228
He's right.

134
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,896
What?

135
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,598
I lied for you to
that investigator guy.

136
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,433
You didn't lie for me.

137
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,468
Yeah, I did, and I'm
not gonna do it anymore.

138
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,655
No, you didn't lie for me,
and I'm not seeing a shrink.

139
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,257
Shep, you need help!

140
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,859
If you don't get it,

141
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,783
something awful's gonna happen!

142
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,799
Know what I need?

143
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:40,933
I need for everyone

144
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,069
to stop pushing at
me and pushing at me,

145
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,671
and telling me what to do.

146
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:46,406
I just need a little time, okay?

147
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,757
I mean, is that okay?!

148
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,893
Is that okay with you and
the whole city of Chicago?

149
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,629
Shep...

150
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,520
It's only because I
care about you. Shep!

151
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,359
Everybody's gonna be there...

152
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,160
My folks, both sets
of grandparents.

153
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,229
My sister flew in from Paris.

154
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,432
My godparents,
my aunts, my uncles

155
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,033
a whole bunch of my cousins,

156
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,903
Jeffrey, Jody, Rob,
Sarah, David, Keith,

157
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,872
Barry, Margaret, Susan...

158
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,573
Carter, Carter, okay, look,

159
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,008
I don't need a
whole family tree.

160
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,009
I get the picture, okay?

161
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,010
So I was hoping

162
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,012
that you were
maybe going to come.

163
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,213
What?

164
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,281
It's at 4:00,

165
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,283
and I was thinking
you could stop by

166
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,484
and meet everybody.

167
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,286
Carter, I didn't even go
to my own graduation.

168
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,287
Really?

169
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,422
Really.

170
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,823
They've heard a
awful lot about you.

171
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,857
Yeah. All good, right?

172
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:28,858
Absolutely.
Nothing but the best.

173
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:29,859
The very very best.

174
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,260
So if you can't
make the graduation,

175
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,862
my dad's throwing a
cocktail party for me

176
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,230
at 6:00 at the Drake.

177
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,732
Good food, great wine.

178
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,833
It's gonna be a bunch

179
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,234
of my mom and
dad's stuffy friends

180
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,335
from the club,

181
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,937
but the mayor's
supposed to come by, so...

182
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,104
Carter, you've got
your Residency.

183
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,774
I've turned in the
end-of-the-year evaluation.

184
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,875
Just relax.

185
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,076
You don't have to keep trying

186
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,478
to brown-nose me, okay?

187
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,822
I wasn't trying to
brown-nose you.

188
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,516
Well... I appreciate
your invitation,

189
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,801
but I'm not going
to your graduation,

190
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,404
and I'm not going to
some cocktail party

191
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:58,604
that daddy's
throwing at the Drake.

192
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:03,109
Look, Carter, you were
my assigned med student.

193
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,377
I was your assigned Resident.

194
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,835
You don't owe me anything, okay?

195
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,806
All right, what do we got?

196
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,288
Morning, Carol.

197
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,256
What's good about it?

198
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,059
Kerry, you got it.

199
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,627
Really? The Attending's job?

200
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:21,661
Yeah.

201
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:23,496
Oh, that's great.
Wh... When do I start?

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,798
Uh, I don't know.

203
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:26,399
I guess after Marty
Cannon leaves next month.

204
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,534
Is the salary fixed
or negotiable?

205
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,203
Uh, fixed, I guess. I
didn't negotiate mine.

206
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,271
There's usually a
little wiggle room.

207
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,673
Right, well, you'd
have to discuss that

208
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,674
with Morgenstern.

209
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:35,709
What about benefits?

210
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,710
Pension plan
through the hospital,

211
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,311
or can you set up your own 401k?

212
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,379
Uh, hospital, I
guess. I never asked.

213
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,581
You know, this is very exciting.

214
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,016
We'll finally be
able to facilitate

215
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,718
some real change around here.

216
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:46,720
Have you read "Managing
Through Example...

217
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,855
12 steps to a more
efficient workplace?"

218
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,223
No. I haven't.

219
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:51,390
I'll loan you my copy.

220
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,993
I've highlighted a
number of passages.

221
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,594
I hope you don't find
that too distracting.

222
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,629
I'm sure I won't.

223
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,998
Mark, paramedics
are four minutes out.

224
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:00,233
Male infant,
respiratory distress.

225
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:01,283
Kerry...

226
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,669
I do have your support

227
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,069
for Susan Lewis as chief, right?

228
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,306
Susan Lewis?

229
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,107
You know, Linda Martin
would be awfully good, too.

230
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,527
Kerry, we had a deal here.

231
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,129
Mark. I'm kidding.

232
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,273
Where's your sense of humor?

233
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,870
Ah, you wouldn't?

234
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:20,871
She isn't?

235
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,921
What are we talking about?

236
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,374
Weaver's the new Attending.

237
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,425
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,193
Guys, don't look
at me like that.

239
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,211
She's a good physician,

240
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,612
a terrific administrator,

241
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,430
and an excellent diagnostician.

242
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,433
It was the right choice.

243
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:35,051
I'm glad I made
it, and that's it.

244
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,854
Oh, man, it's gonna
be a long year.

245
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,088
It's forever.

246
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,491
Two-day-old male infant,
full-term vaginal delivery

247
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,327
found cyanotic in his crib.

248
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,929
Resps 50, heart rate 160.

249
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:46,930
When was he born?

250
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:47,931
Tuesday night.

251
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:48,932
Heel stick a glucose?

252
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,066
You bet.

253
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,667
When did he come
back from the hospital?

254
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,668
Yesterday morning.
Twelve hours later?

255
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,669
They said it was okay.

256
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,670
We wanted to stay longer.

257
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,539
He's in heart failure.

258
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,673
Where's Ross?

259
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,142
I'll find him.

260
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,543
I'm gonna put in
an umbilical line.

261
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,844
Prep 0.1 Dig.

262
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,262
Pulse ox 86.

263
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,647
Sinus tach at 150.

264
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,766
What's wrong with him?

265
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,000
His lungs are filled with fluid.

266
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,202
Conni, could you
please show them

267
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:10,637
to the waiting room.

268
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:11,937
No, I want to stay.

269
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:14,340
Come on, honey.

270
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,310
Dig 0.1. Lasix?

271
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,645
Yeah, four mgs.

272
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:23,449
ABG, CBC, Chem-7,
chest x-ray, and an EKG.

273
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:26,052
Temp's 98.2, glucose 110.

274
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,687
Paged Ross.

275
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,289
Somebody sent a
mother and a child home

276
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:30,289
after one night.

277
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:32,158
Yeah. Welcome to managed care.

278
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:34,227
Who gives a damn

279
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:35,295
what the insurance
company wants?

280
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:37,096
What kind of a hospital
sends a newborn home

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,097
after only one night?

282
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,098
Our kind.

283
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:40,366
Joseph Morgan Randall.

284
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,957
Delivered on the fifth
floor in OB two days ago.

285
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,294
Chuny, could you
do me a favor? What?

286
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,795
I need you to draw some blood.

287
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,980
I'm kind of busy right now.
You can't do it yourself?

288
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,849
I need you to draw
some of my blood.

289
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:57,884
Al?

290
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,641
Yeah. I've been putting it off.

291
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:03,355
Sure. Do you want
me to do it right now?

292
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,757
If you don't mind.
Nobody's in 4.

293
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:05,781
Yeah.

294
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:35,721
Dr. Davitch?

295
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:36,890
Yeah.

296
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:38,291
I'm John Carter.
I'm a med student.

297
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:39,492
I met you once last year.

298
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:40,493
I'm on rounds, Mr. Carter.

299
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,262
Yeah, I can see that.

300
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,330
Talia Lucas, the little
girl with biliary atresia.

301
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,132
I've sort of been
keeping an eye on her,

302
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:47,733
and you moved her
up here last night.

303
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:48,968
Yes, I did.

304
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:50,403
I thought she was
Dr. Berglass' patient?

305
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:51,404
He's attending his
daughter's wedding

306
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,405
in London.

307
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:53,472
I'm covering for him.

308
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,141
Her ascending
cholangitis worsened?

309
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,410
She's not responding
to the antibiotics.

310
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,912
I'm worried about pseudomonas,

311
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,181
so I moved her up to the ICU,

312
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,581
and I jumped her to Status 1

313
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,851
on the transplant list.

314
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,085
Do you know her parents?

315
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,086
Yeah.

316
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,121
They're in the waiting room.

317
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,422
Why don't you join me.

318
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:10,723
They don't know yet?

319
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:13,609
It's been a busy
morning, Mr. Carter.

320
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,129
Hey, everybody. Miss me?

321
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,196
Oh, a little one.

322
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,865
Two days. Cyanotic in the crib.

323
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,968
No detectable murmur, CHF.

324
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,704
He's had Dig and Lasix
with no improvement.

325
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:25,722
Pulse is up to 200.

326
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,423
Mother gave birth Tuesday night.

327
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,558
OB kicked her out
Wednesday morning.

328
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,793
Get an EKG?

329
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,528
Right axis deviation.

330
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,065
RAH, RVH, no Q-wave in V6.

331
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,166
Okay, hyperventilate him.

332
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,169
Get an amp of Prostin
VR down here now, please.

333
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,170
What the hell is it?

334
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,355
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

335
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,991
They sent the mom
home the next morning?

336
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,192
Yep. Wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

337
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:48,594
Damn it. All right,
let's get an echo.

338
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:51,297
Find out who's on call for
Pediatric Cardiology, please.

339
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:52,515
Is he gonna make it?

340
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,767
If we can keep the
ductus arteriosus open,

341
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,785
he's got a shot.

342
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,992
Son of a bitch.

343
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,892
Mr. and Mrs. Lucas?
Hi. I'm Dr. Davitch.

344
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,427
Dr. Berglass is
out of the country

345
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,528
for a few days.

346
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,930
You already know
Mr. Carter, I believe.

347
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:07,931
Jason, Annette.

348
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,031
They told us downstairs

349
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,617
T.C.'d been moved
to Intensive Care.

350
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:11,985
Well, unfortunately,

351
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,786
your daughter's condition
has worsened overnight.

352
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,355
She's not responding
to the antibiotics.

353
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,823
I don't have much confidence

354
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,894
that your daughter's liver's
gonna function much longer.

355
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:22,695
So we have moved
her from Status 2

356
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,159
to Status 1 on
the transplant list...

357
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,233
And we're gonna do
everything we can for her

358
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,601
while we wait.

359
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,203
So she'll be having the
transplant operation soon?

360
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,105
Well, that would
certainly be our hope.

361
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,306
How soon?

362
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,761
Mr. Carter, you're familiar
with the UNIS procedures,

363
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:39,762
aren't you?

364
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:40,863
Yeah, sure.

365
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,681
Mr. Carter will
answer your questions,

366
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,550
and then he'll take you back

367
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,674
to see your daughter, okay?

368
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:52,976
Why don't we take a seat?

369
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,167
D.A.'s open, so he's
still got a fighting chance.

370
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,482
I'm going to go
tell his parents.

371
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,506
This is unbelievable.

372
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,853
Now, there is an ugly,
vicious rumor going around.

373
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:04,988
Kerry Weaver...

374
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:05,989
Don't start with me.

375
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,156
So it's true.

376
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,557
I don't know what
everybody's upset about.

377
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,692
Kerry Weaver's not that bad.

378
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,893
She's great.

379
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:11,961
She grows on you.

380
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,396
You been hitting
the Prozac again?

381
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,430
I got a call

382
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,831
from a pharmacy
on the North Side

383
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,832
looking for you.

384
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,867
Mm-hmm.

385
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,835
You wrote a prescription
for 100 Percodan?

386
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,836
What?

387
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,171
Karen Hines.

388
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,572
Isn't that that redhead
you've been seeing.

389
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,773
Yeah, she's got a bad knee.

390
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,774
A hundred? Pretty bad knee.

391
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,976
She travels a lot.

392
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,777
Doesn't know when
she'll be able to get them.

393
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,579
Mark, I need you
in there. Rule out MI.

394
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,780
You tell them it was okay?

395
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,582
Yeah, but I told
them you'd call.

396
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,805
Yeah.

397
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,356
Hey, Jeanie...

398
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,391
Hi.

399
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,558
Hi.

400
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,926
How'd your appointment go?

401
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,728
They gave me a
bunch of stuff to read.

402
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,118
You should read it.

403
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,568
Uh, thanks for
staying last night.

404
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:56,873
Well, it's tough, that first
night home from the hospital.

405
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,242
My health plan gave me...

406
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,545
assigned me a doctor,
specializes in the disease...

407
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,113
A Dr. Arabian. You know him?

408
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,916
No, I can ask around.

409
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,251
Thanks.

410
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,753
He said that my...

411
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,224
my CD4 count is 450.

412
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,926
He sounded excited about that.

413
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,294
Yeah, that's good.

414
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,118
What's it supposed to be?

415
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,322
Fifteen hundred.

416
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:31,457
He gave me a... a lot of stuff.

417
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:34,126
Uh, AZT, something

418
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,563
called 3TC, and... Sacinaver...

419
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:38,731
Saquinavir.

420
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,900
Whatever. It's
gonna cost a fortune,

421
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,704
and, uh...

422
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,472
he gave me...

423
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:51,510
a couple of packets
of condoms too.

424
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,845
Kind of seems like

425
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,102
the horse is out of
the barn on that one.

426
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,518
It was a joke.

427
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,342
It wasn't funny.

428
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:07,460
You get tested yet?

429
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:08,527
Yeah.

430
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,284
And? Not back yet.

431
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,638
Doctor said I may
have been HIV positive

432
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,842
for as long as 10 years.

433
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,243
He wants me to make a list

434
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:27,446
of all my...

435
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,099
past sexual contacts.

436
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,734
Let them know.

437
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,935
It's gonna be quite a list.

438
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,738
It's not much to
be proud of now.

439
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,596
Wasn't much to be proud of then.

440
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,048
Well, I... I better go home.

441
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,239
I've got a lot of reading to do.

442
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,140
If that baby'd
stayed in the hospital

443
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,208
an extra day,

444
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,609
somebody would
have picked up on it.

445
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,411
Most babies are fine
going home the next day.

446
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,412
Well, a lot of problems

447
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,463
don't declare
themselves right away.

448
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,548
Intussusception,
pyloric stenosis.

449
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:04,549
People trust us.

450
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:05,884
The woman took her baby home

451
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:07,886
because we told her it
was safe, and it wasn't.

452
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,887
It's not a bottomless pit.

453
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,022
Every dollar we spend

454
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:11,406
on a perfectly healthy
postpartum mother

455
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,676
is another dollar we don't
have to help someone else.

Dr. Vucelich.

471
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,832
Congratulations on being named

472
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,800
Resident of the Year.

473
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,836
Thank you.

474
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,837
I understand

475
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,238
you were instrumental
in my selection.

476
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,007
I merely expressed my opinion.

477
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,441
I'm glad that others concurred.

478
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,847
I read your aortic
aneurism study.

479
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:28,517
Yes. Well, it's been
extremely well-received.

480
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,918
The drug company's pleased.

481
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,654
They granted the
hospital over $3 million

482
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,821
for phase-four trials,

483
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,891
additional research facilities.

484
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:40,129
You know, I, uh...

485
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,430
I couldn't help but
notice the inclusion

486
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,498
of the negative outcome patients

487
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,533
that we had discussed.

488
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,469
Mm-hmm.

489
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,806
It seemed the prudent course,
given the circumstances.

490
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,441
They weren't, however,
statistically significant

491
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,692
in the final analysis.

492
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,896
Well, I was glad to
see them there, anyway.

493
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,405
Yes, I'm sure you were.

494
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,388
Mm, Carter.

495
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,690
Ooh, Armani?

496
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:08,691
Hugo Boss.

497
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,893
Nice. Um...

498
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,795
The parents of that
kid with the liver failure

499
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,863
called down.

500
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:14,964
Said they had some questions.

501
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,164
Some more questions, you mean.

502
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,766
I spent an hour with
them this morning.

503
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,768
I'm supposed to meet my
folks at Trotters for lunch

504
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:20,769
in 20 minutes.

505
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:21,754
They called three times?

506
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:24,006
Five. I quit writing it down.

507
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,207
Okay, well, if they call again,

508
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,009
will you tell them
I'll be up there later.

509
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,443
My father hates
it when I'm late.

510
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,745
Mr. Carter, you got a minute?

511
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,846
I'm completing the assignments

512
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,380
for the first-year
surgical interns.

513
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,949
We're breaking all
the surgical residents

514
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,517
into teams next year.

515
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,820
Now, you indicated
on your application form

516
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,321
that you're
interested in Vascular,

517
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,555
Neurosurgery, and
Plastics rotation?

518
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,656
Absolutely.

519
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,858
Good. Good.

520
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,659
I've got one spot
left on the red team.

521
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,660
Really?

522
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,795
It will be primarily second

523
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,830
and third-year residents,

524
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,564
but seeing as you're our only

525
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,100
locally grown prodigy,

526
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,500
we'd give you the
home field advantage.

527
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,736
That would be great.

528
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,537
It'll be quite a leg
up on your peers.

529
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,638
Oh, I'd be honored.

530
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,774
Dr. Langdon will be
your supervising resident.

531
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,175
Do you know Nancy?

532
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,977
Oh, sure. Yeah, she's great.

533
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,912
So I won't be working
under Dr. Benton anymore?

534
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,047
Nope.

535
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,648
Dr. Benton will be
anchoring the blue team

536
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,649
next year.

537
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,517
General surgery,
the ER, proctology,

538
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,153
real meat-and-potatoes stuff.

539
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,789
Unless you'd rather
be with Benton.

540
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,590
No, no. I was hoping
for the red team.

541
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,025
Good. Excellent.

542
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,026
Dr. Morgenstern.

543
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,416
Peter...

544
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,698
Weaver's gonna
support you as chief.

545
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,100
Really? We should
talk about that.

546
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,869
Uh, Dr. Greene,
your wife called.

547
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:27,970
Ex-wife.

548
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,704
Right. She said
you're late for lunch.

549
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,306
She's mad as hell.

550
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,108
With Weaver on
board, I think it's a lock.

551
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,709
So do you want to
have dinner tonight

552
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,710
and celebrate.

553
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,780
I don't know.
Check with me later.

554
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:38,881
Mr. Brannigan?

555
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:39,882
Kenny, please.

556
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:40,983
Hi. I'm Dr. Lewis.

557
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,184
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

558
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,120
Yeah. Well, at least
she stopped singing.

559
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,554
So you've had a
persistent cough?

560
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,622
Couple of months now.

561
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,024
I haven't been able to shake it.

562
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,159
Coughing up any blood?

563
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,827
No, no... well, not much.

564
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,079
But some. Yeah, once or twice,

565
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:56,081
but it's no big deal.

566
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,815
I pour concrete for a living,

567
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,017
so stuff gets in your lungs.

568
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,018
Are you a smoker, Kenny?

569
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,103
Yeah.

570
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,639
You're not gonna lecture me?

571
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,975
Doesn't sound like I have to.

572
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,443
So how much do you smoke?

573
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,044
A couple of packs a day.

574
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,045
Sometimes more, sometimes less.

575
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,713
120/80.

576
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,020
When was the last time
you had a tuberculosis test?

577
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,986
I don't go to doctors much.

578
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,126
Ah. All that lecturing,
I guess, huh?

579
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:27,179
Sorry I'm late.

580
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,814
Like old times.

581
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:30,782
Nice to see you, too.

582
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:31,817
Look, if this is about

583
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:32,818
getting Rachel this weekend,

584
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:33,852
you can forget it, okay,

585
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,253
because I got
tickets for the Cubbies

586
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:36,254
on Saturday.

587
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:38,156
Rachel hates baseball.

588
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,713
That's not true.

589
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,862
This weekend's fine,
Mark. That's... that's fine.

590
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,832
You gonna finish those fries?

591
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:49,034
Go right ahead.

592
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,235
I can't eat this food.

593
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:51,536
This place should
have been cited

594
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,504
and shut down by the
health department years ago.

595
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:54,706
Hospital fights to keep it open.

596
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,730
It's good for business.

597
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,544
Food poisoning, stomach pumping,

598
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,578
gastroenteritis.

599
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,831
This joint's a gold mine.

600
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,255
Craig and I are getting married.

601
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,936
What?

602
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,844
In September.

603
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:12,313
You're kidding.

604
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,127
I didn't want you to
hear it from Rachel.

605
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,797
Rachel knows?

606
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:19,898
She's excited.

607
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,967
She's helping me
pick out a dress.

608
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:24,111
Something non-traditional,
I hope. Perhaps in red.

609
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,007
Look, I knew you weren't
gonna be happy about this,

610
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,264
but I thought I should
be the one to tell you.

611
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,485
You should have kept the goatee.

612
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:40,589
It made you look dangerous.

613
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,670
Hey!

614
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,738
Hey, yourself!

615
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:02,474
School let out early?

616
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:03,875
Well, I was on all night.

617
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:04,942
It looks like

618
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,378
you're still gainfully employed.

619
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:07,912
Well, I'm on probation.

620
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,080
I lose another 250 grand,

621
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:10,882
it's back to
card-counting in Vegas.

622
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,116
Really? You did that?

623
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,286
In a previous lifetime.
Yeah. Don't ask.

624
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,088
So how's your knee?

625
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,291
It's, uh, okay.

626
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,326
How's yours?

627
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:26,030
The prescription
that I wrote out

628
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:27,165
for the Percodan?

629
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,233
Yeah?

630
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:29,867
Was for 10 tablets.

631
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,869
You know, I wondered about that.

632
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:33,271
Those damn things
cost me a fortune.

633
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:36,341
So you didn't change it to 100?

634
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:37,365
No, I didn't.

635
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:45,250
Prescription pads for
narcotics, they come in triplicate.

636
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:46,274
I can check my copy.

637
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:48,937
Well, maybe you should do that.

638
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,829
Maybe I should.

639
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,083
Count them, boyfriend.

640
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,140
They're all there.

641
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,188
I don't need to count them.

642
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,212
Sure, you do.

643
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,337
Mr. Brannigan,
sorry it took so long.

644
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:25,040
Do you have a
personal physician?

645
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,064
No.

646
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,317
You have a density
in your left lung.

647
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:32,981
Tuberculosis?

648
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:36,050
I don't think so.

649
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,051
Cancer.

650
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,252
We'll need to run more tests

651
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,387
to rule that out.

652
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,024
How much are these
tests of yours gonna cost?

653
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,164
Do you have insurance?

654
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:47,613
No. I work construction

655
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:48,813
for a lot of different
companies.

656
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,148
No benefits.

657
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,366
Maybe you qualify for Medicaid?

658
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,169
When my last kid
was born, we didn't.

659
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,137
It cost me, uh, a
couple of grand.

660
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,689
I'm still trying
to pay that off.

661
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:01,210
Well, I can't tell you exactly
how much the tests will cost.

662
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,044
We could get someone
down from Admitting

663
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,946
if you have any questions.

664
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,381
I, uh, got a couple of kids

665
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,049
and a mortgage,

666
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,901
and I'm just scraping
by as it is, huh?

667
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,537
You have a potentially
serious condition

668
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,912
for which you need
immediate evaluation.

669
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,800
Mr. Brannigan, you
really need to stay here.

670
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,133
Mark, Loretta's back.

671
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,667
Oh, no. What this time?

672
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,336
Oh, I think she's just
frightened and overwhelmed

673
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,337
by the surgery.

674
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,438
They only released
her yesterday.

675
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,007
I started an IV. She's in 4.

676
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,509
Well, tell her I'll be down
there as soon as I can,

677
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,710
and make sure that
she's comfortable.

678
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,312
So we're just going
to let him leave?

679
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,314
Well, what do you want
to do, tackle the guy?

680
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,515
He said he can't afford it.

681
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,117
Who am I to say that he can?

682
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,385
A full course of chemotherapy

683
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,387
and radiation'll cost
him minimum 50 grand.

684
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,122
I don't understand what
we're arguing about.

685
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,390
You let the hospital bill him.

686
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:49,991
He can declare
bankruptcy if he has to.

687
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,143
And if he dies and leaves
his wife and children

688
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,145
in bankruptcy?

689
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:54,479
At least he wouldn't be dead.

690
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:56,280
I advised him to stay,
he chose to leave.

691
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,605
That's his prerogative.

692
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,548
What are you doing out here?

693
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,750
Oh, just enjoying the fresh air

694
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,151
and the sunshine.

695
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,753
The last few months,
whenever I can,

696
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,756
I like to get outside.

697
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,058
It's about time
you gave those up.

698
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,828
My last vice.

699
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,663
So they sent you home yesterday.

700
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah. I don't think I was ready.

701
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,034
You been able to eat anything?

702
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,898
I haven't been able
to keep anything down.

703
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:36,972
How are the kids?

704
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,696
Hell on wheels.

705
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,144
I wanted to ask you something.

706
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,745
Shoot.

707
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,082
I was wondering if

708
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,650
you'd be guardian to my kids.

709
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,652
Not that anything bad's

710
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,720
ever gonna happen to me.

711
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,523
It's just that they
don't have anybody.

712
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:57,492
My folks are dead.
They like you.

713
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,461
I know it's a lot to ask,

714
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,762
but they're really good kids.

715
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,337
What about their father?

716
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:11,272
Fathers. Plural.

717
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,524
Good luck.

718
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,660
I never could quite
figure that one out.

719
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:16,861
You don't have to answer now.

720
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,863
I have time...

721
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:21,054
at least, a little bit, I think.

722
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:26,955
I'm honored you'd ask...

723
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,890
But you can't.

724
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:29,891
No.

725
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,943
I can't.

726
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:32,967
I'm sorry.

727
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,814
Besides, you're gonna make it.

728
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,242
Damn right, I am.

729
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,865
Hey, you're up. How you feeling?

730
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,132
Kind of tired.

731
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,167
Where are your folks?

732
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:57,702
They were looking
for me earlier.

733
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,437
They went downstairs
to get something to eat.

734
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:02,024
In the cafeteria? Big mistake.

735
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:05,860
My mom just kept crying.

736
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,128
I think my dad was worried

737
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,580
she was gonna scare me.

738
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,182
Well, tell them
that I stopped by.

739
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:12,517
I gotta go.

740
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,569
I'm graduating in a half
an hour, and I'm late.

741
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:18,506
Everybody in here
looks pretty sick.

742
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,074
Yeah, well...

743
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,243
they get better.

744
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,244
It just takes time.

745
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,079
The boy who was in that bed?

746
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:28,138
I don't think he got better.

747
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:32,759
Am I gonna die?

748
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:40,062
You're very sick, T.C..

749
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,530
My mom says I'm Status 1.

750
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,881
What does that mean?

751
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,750
That means that as soon
as the next liver's available,

752
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:46,935
you get first dibs.

753
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:50,439
Somebody has to die, right?

754
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,373
Yeah.

755
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,641
Kind of weird.

756
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:58,213
Some kid's out there,
and they're okay,

757
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,414
and I'm here

758
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,015
waiting for something
bad to happen to them.

759
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,224
You're not making
that bad thing happen.

760
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:11,009
I gotta go.

761
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,410
I'll see you later.

762
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,234
How long till I
have an operation?

763
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,983
Could be a week, could be two,

764
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,685
could be less.

765
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,954
Could be anytime.

766
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:26,141
But what if nothing bad
happens to anybody this week?

767
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,960
It will.

768
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,094
Unfortunately,

769
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,030
something bad is always
happening to somebody...

770
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:33,130
somewhere.

771
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:36,173
Like what's
happening to me, right?

772
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:44,726
Want me to stay
for a little while

773
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,728
till your folks come back?

774
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:50,098
Yeah, that'd be
great, if it's okay.

775
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,071
Sure. I can be a
couple minutes late.

776
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,872
Oh, man, this day just
gets worse and worse.

777
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,907
Hey, Mark, Linda Martin?

778
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,108
What was she, the only choice?

779
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,510
I think she's kind of a bitch.

780
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,511
For what?

781
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,512
Chief Resident.

782
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,880
She is kind of a bitch.

783
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,715
Look, Linda Martin's not
going to be chief Resident,

784
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,716
so don't worry about it.

785
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,917
She is going to be chief.

786
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,986
It's on the memo.

787
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,109
Damn it.

788
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,925
Jerry, where the hell is Weaver?

789
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,048
Uh, Trauma 1.

790
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,369
You said you were going
to support Susan for chief?

791
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,672
Julius Cadena, meet Mark Greene.

792
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:33,774
Mr. Cadena's small intestine
seems to be eviscerated.

793
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,909
IV's wide open.

794
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,077
We had a deal.

795
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,279
Rapid infuse four
units of O-neg.

796
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,048
I offered it to her,
she turned it down.

797
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,417
She what?

798
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,085
Ask her yourself.

799
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,153
Gram of cefoxitin IV.

800
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,154
Alert the O.R.,

801
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,898
page Benton to get down here...

802
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:01,986
Hey, Peter.

803
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,721
Hey...

804
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:04,722
Got a minute?

805
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:05,878
Sure.

806
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,402
Al's got AIDS.

807
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,717
I...

808
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,385
Conni, give us a
moment, will you?

809
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,819
I'm just after some coffee.

810
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,177
Yeah, I'll bring you a cup
in a few minutes, all right?

811
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,459
Sure.

812
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,867
Cream, no sugar.

813
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:33,902
I got tested today, but
I don't have the results.

814
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,636
I know what you're thinking,

815
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,539
because I was where you
are now a few days ago.

816
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,125
You want to feel
concerned for me,

817
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,894
but you're wondering,
"What about me?"

818
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,529
Al and I barely had sex,

819
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:46,581
much less a marriage
these last few years.

820
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,050
You and I were careful,

821
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,074
but not that careful.

822
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:54,294
Get tested. I'm sorry.

823
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,348
12-year-old girl hit by a bus

824
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:05,650
while riding her bicycle.

825
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,818
Pain in the left ankle.

826
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,586
Obvious deformed fracture.

827
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,521
Good distal pulses.
No head or chest pain.

828
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:11,689
She was wearing a helmet.

829
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:13,141
Gently now.

830
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,177
IV, saline, TKO,
0.25 liters cannula.

831
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,962
Three milligrams
morphine in the field.

832
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,230
Name's Monique.

833
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:20,298
It hurts!

834
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,233
I know it does. I
know it does, honey.

835
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:23,234
Now, does your neck hurt?

836
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:24,302
No!

837
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:25,303
Any tenderness?

838
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:27,438
No! No, just my leg!

839
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,639
You were wearing
your helmet, Monique.

840
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:29,807
That's really good.

841
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:31,909
Monique, do your
parents know you're here?

842
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,011
No.

843
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,629
Well, if you give me
your phone number,

844
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,696
I can call them,

845
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,698
so they can come down
and be with you, okay?

846
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,334
Good dorsalis pedis

847
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:42,403
and posterior tibial pulses.

848
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,771
BP's 90 over 60.

849
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,306
Pulse ox 99.

850
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,875
Let's get an ice pack, an H & H,

851
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,060
and dip a urine for blood.

852
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,014
My sister's gonna
be so mad at me.

853
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,999
I bet she's just gonna
be happy that you're okay.

854
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:56,000
No!

855
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,064
Sure she will, sweetheart.

856
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,655
Let's get a left ankle
and tib-fib films,

857
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,625
and give her another three
of morphine for the pain.

858
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,030
<i>Dr. Randa Jane Berkowitz.</i>

859
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:23,650
Dr. John Truman Carter.

860
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,137
Dr. Carter?

861
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:34,972
Well...

862
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,244
I think Dr. Carter must
have found a facial laceration

863
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,878
to practice a z-plasty on.

864
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,524
Dr. Ming Wu Chang.

865
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,009
Two, three, flip.

866
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,511
You taking them off the top?

867
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,845
Yes, I am.

868
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,979
Go.

869
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,614
Okay, one more
time. Two out of three.

870
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,782
You've already lost five times.

871
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:02,884
Yeah, but I'm getting better.

872
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,102
She always wins.

873
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,755
Thanks for staying with her.

874
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,224
How's she doing?

875
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,625
I'm okay.

876
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,876
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

877
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,112
I hope you didn't
have to be anywhere.

878
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,797
Nope. Not anymore.

879
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,066
I'm gonna go,

880
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,401
and then I'm gonna come back,

881
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,525
make sure you're not
getting into too much trouble.

882
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,028
Thanks.

883
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,398
Hi, sweetheart.

884
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,881
Comminuted
trimalleolar ankle fracture.

885
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,882
What a mess.

886
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,084
Definitely unstable.

887
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,384
Yeah. Gonna need surgery.

888
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,385
Are her parents here yet?

889
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,486
In the waiting room.

890
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,922
Monique was right
about her sister.

891
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,389
She was mad about her bike.

892
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,457
So splint her leg,

893
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,059
and I'll call an
ambulance to move her.

894
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,660
Mover her? Move her where?

895
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,895
Her insurance company
wants her transferred

896
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,896
to Midway

897
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,897
for orthopedic admission.

898
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,099
I can't apply a plaster splint

899
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,100
without moving the ankle.

900
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,101
It's gonna hurt like hell!

901
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,135
We'll medicate her.

902
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,369
Do her parents know about this?

903
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,838
I'm going to tell them now.

904
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,572
Mark, we're gonna splint
an unstable ankle fracture,

905
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,108
send a 12-year-old
girl across town

906
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,675
for an operation
we can do upstairs?

907
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,677
Look, I don't like this,
any more than you do,

908
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,079
but that's what her
insurance wants done.

909
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,181
I thought you were the doctor.

910
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,716
I am the doctor,

911
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,852
but if I admit her here,
her very nice parents

912
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,553
are gonna get slapped
with a surgical bill

913
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,889
for tens of
thousands of dollars.

914
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:16,124
I quit.

915
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,258
What?

916
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,982
I quit!

917
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,864
You can't just leave.

918
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,522
Watch me.

919
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,703
We sent a newborn home
with a congenital heart problem.

920
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,507
A guy comes in with lung cancer

921
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:33,892
and he can't afford
the treatment,

922
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,326
and now, we're
shipping kids across town

923
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,578
with unstable fractures.

924
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,245
Don't give me that
holier-than-thou crap.

925
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,981
We also treated a couple
hundred other people

926
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,120
who had nowhere else to go.

927
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,984
You're gonna feel
stupid about this

928
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,353
in the morning.

929
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,677
I'm gonna feel great
about this in the morning.

930
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,738
You okay, Dr. Benton?

931
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,307
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

932
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,308
Have you seen Dr. Morgenstern?

933
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,509
He left a message for me

934
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,110
saying he wanted to talk to me.

935
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,245
He started a ruptured appendix

936
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,781
about a half hour ago.

937
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,317
Well, I'll catch up
to him tomorrow.

938
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,353
Hey, how was
your cocktail party?

939
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,821
I missed it.

940
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,905
You missed your own party?

941
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,840
Yeah.

942
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:25,410
My parents had a
good time, anyway.

943
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,312
It was mostly their friends.

944
00:36:27,336 --> 00:36:28,379
I missed my graduation too.

945
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,381
Oh, really?

946
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,271
Yeah. You missed yours, right?

947
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,004
What were you doing?

948
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:39,012
An emergency hemorrhoidectomy.

949
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,461
What were you doing?

950
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:46,780
I was playing cards
with a scared little kid.

951
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,517
T.C., that little girl
with liver failure.

952
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,386
They moved her up to Status 1.

953
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,586
I was just keeping her company

954
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,050
while her folks
talked to the doctor.

955
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,983
Now you're the doctor.

956
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,117
You graduated, right?

957
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:12,690
Yeah... that's right, I am.

958
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:13,691
It's kind of weird.

959
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:17,561
I, uh...

960
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:18,595
I don't know any more

961
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:22,399
than I knew this morning.

962
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:24,035
I really wanted to graduate too.

963
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:25,091
Oh, well.

964
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,515
Anyway...

965
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:42,475
Take care of yourself, Carter.

966
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,702
Right.

967
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,002
Hey...

968
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,303
Hey, yourself.

969
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,472
Carol Hathaway just quit.

970
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,540
I know. I heard.

971
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,541
What was that all about?

972
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,065
You got me.

973
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,368
You turned down chief?

974
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,503
Yes, I did.

975
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,985
I agreed to support
Kerry Weaver as Attending

976
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,209
because she agreed
to support you as chief.

977
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,708
I didn't ask you to do that.

978
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,710
No, you didn't.

979
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,545
You know, my whole life,

980
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,715
I've always done what
everyone else wanted me to do.

981
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,517
Today, I had this guy
come in with a cough.

982
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:49,420
Lung cancer, 46 years old.

983
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,522
I get one of these cases
every couple of months.

984
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,524
Children, husbands, wives,

985
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:56,360
their faces all start to
blend together, but it hit me...

986
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:57,462
How long do we have?

987
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:59,897
Any of us?

988
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,921
And how are we
gonna fill that time?

989
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:08,339
I had something. Little Susie.

990
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:09,390
And now I don't.

991
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,541
All I have is this.

992
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,243
Work.

993
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,366
You know what, Mark?

994
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:18,070
It's not enough.

995
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,768
What are you doing here?

996
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,369
Waiting for you.

997
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:42,840
You don't have your keys?

998
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:45,576
Why are you still
wearing your scrubs?

999
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,744
I quit.

1000
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:47,912
You're kidding.

1001
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:49,279
Nah, to hell with them.

1002
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,382
You can't quit.

1003
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:53,417
You're great at it.

1004
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,085
I'm sick of it.

1005
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:56,286
They kept cutting
back my shifts,

1006
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,521
making me work more nights.

1007
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:00,913
I'll make more doing
home care or per diem.

1008
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:06,706
You're never gonna
see that shrink, are you?

1009
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,573
Ugh...

1010
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:18,163
Why couldn't we just keep
going the way we were?

1011
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:21,433
I was happy.

1012
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,081
Weren't you happy?

1013
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:26,784
Things changed.

1014
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:31,321
It's not my fault.
It's not your fault.

1015
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,591
Raul died. It a terrible thing,

1016
00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:36,460
but something
happened to you, Shep.

1017
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:37,484
You know it's true.

1018
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,731
Man, you gotta deal with it.

1019
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm doing okay.

1020
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:44,456
No, you're not.

1021
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,302
I can't do this, Shep.

1022
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,721
I have finally gotten
my life together.

1023
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:04,877
It's taken me a long time.

1024
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,019
You need help.

1025
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:19,102
I love you, but you need help,

1026
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:23,607
and if you can't get it
together to get that help...

1027
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:24,631
I can't be with you.

1028
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,007
I can't.

1029
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:14,892
Jennifer's getting
married again.

1030
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:15,893
Really? That was quick.

1031
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:16,894
No kidding.

1032
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,495
I was hoping to be the first one

1033
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,496
to get remarried

1034
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,698
or at least living
with somebody.

1035
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:22,499
I mean, it makes me
seem kind of pathetic,

1036
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:23,500
don't you think?

1037
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:24,534
She's planning a guest list,

1038
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:25,569
and I'm still fumbling around

1039
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:27,270
with pick-up lines
in singles bars.

1040
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,505
It gets you off the hook

1041
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:29,506
with the alimony, though.

1042
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,507
I wasn't paying any.

1043
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:32,442
She makes more money than I do.

1044
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,111
You know, I never
really liked her.

1045
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,112
What do you mean?

1046
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,146
You acted like you did.

1047
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,948
I just did that to
make you feel better.

1048
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,349
I never cared for her.

1049
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:42,853
Unsupportive, controlling
and manipulative...

1050
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,688
Do you want me
to go on with this?

1051
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:45,789
Yeah, please. I'm enjoying it.

1052
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,658
All right, demanding,
skinny legs...

1053
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:48,692
Wait, what were you doing

1054
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:49,693
looking at my wife's legs?

1055
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:50,894
I'm your buddy, I'm not dead.

1056
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:52,295
I'm just saying you
could do better...

1057
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,296
much better.

1058
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,898
Thanks. Thank you.

1059
00:42:54,922 --> 00:42:56,066
All right, listen to this,

1060
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,302
I talked to Karen
about the Percodan.

1061
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,971
You didn't prescribe that many?

1062
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,205
The prescription was for 10.

1063
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:03,206
What did she say?

1064
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,274
She denied it.

1065
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:06,276
She said that it was
some kind of a mix-up,

1066
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,711
and she gave them back to me...

1067
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:09,113
Actually, she threw
them back at me.

1068
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:10,114
Yeah? Do you believe her?

1069
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:11,548
I don't know.

1070
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:12,549
Get away from her, Doug.

1071
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:13,550
She sounds like trouble.

1072
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:14,551
Yeah, I know. You're right.

1073
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:15,619
I probably should.

1074
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:17,254
But you're not going to?

1075
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:18,922
She's kind of cute.

1076
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:20,924
She's got great legs.

1077
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:22,325
You were looking at
my girlfriend's legs?

1078
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,895
Look, I'm your
friend, I'm not dead.

1079
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:26,664
So what else did
you notice about her?

1080
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,665
You want a list?

1081
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,899
Yeah. I want a list.

1082
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:36,206
Dr. Morgenstern,

1083
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,274
you were looking for me?

1084
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:38,708
Yeah, we missed
you at graduation.

1085
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:39,709
Where were you?

1086
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:40,710
With a patient.

1087
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:42,346
How was the ceremony?

1088
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,181
Oh, one of the best
we've had in years.

1089
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,016
Pomp, circumstance,
all the trimmings.

1090
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,918
If you'll excuse
me, it's very late,

1091
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:49,886
and I'm finally on my way home.

1092
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,488
Hey, I was wondering
if it's too late

1093
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:53,490
to change my choice for
Surgical team next year.

1094
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:55,526
I was hoping to sign
up for the blue team.

1095
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,527
Once you switch your selection,

1096
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,528
there's no going back.

1097
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,529
Yes, sir, I know.

1098
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,631
I was... still hoping
for the blue team.

1099
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm sure Dr. Benton
will be very pleased

1100
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:05,235
to have you on his team.

1101
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:06,437
See you in a few months.

1102
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:07,637
Right. Thanks.

1103
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:08,838
Hey, Carter...

1104
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:10,862
Dr. Benton left something
down here for you.

1105
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:20,951
Hey, Carter, what
do you call the person

1106
00:44:20,975 --> 00:44:22,152
who graduates
last in their class

1107
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:23,153
from medical school?

1108
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:24,154
What?

1109
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:25,222
Doctor.

1110
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,623
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

1111
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:28,492
Oh, just hanging out.

1112
00:44:28,516 --> 00:44:31,128
Well, want to try out
that new white coat?

1113
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:33,663
MVA, drunk driver
hit a carload of kids

1114
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:34,864
on the way to the prom.

1115
00:44:34,888 --> 00:44:36,166
The units are just pulling in.

1116
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,102
Sure.

1117
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:39,503
17-year-old male, head trauma

1118
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:42,723
GCS eight, BP 120
over 60, pulse 60,

1119
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:44,374
probable fractures
of the left femur,

1120
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:46,160
right tib-fib.

1121
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,361
Dr. Carter!

1122
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:48,562
Okay, Trauma 2. Notify the O.R.,

1123
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,498
and see who's on call for Ortho.

1124
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,849
Dr. Carter?

1125
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:54,285
We've got three
more on the scene.

1126
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:55,886
Guy in a pickup
came up the off-ramp

1127
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,087
on the Kennedy.

1128
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,151
Clipped four cars before
he t-boned the prom kids...
