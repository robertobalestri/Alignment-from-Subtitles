00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,452
Station 134, Unit

00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,921
<i>Roger, 47, this is Dispatch.</i>

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,090
We're heading back to quarters

4
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,157
from Mercy for relief.

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,525
ETA is seven minutes.

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,560
<i>Roger, 47. What
is your location?</i>

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,296
Northbound on
Racine and Webster.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,298
<i>Uh, roger, 47. Stand by, please.</i>

9
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,133
Buy you breakfast?

10
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,535
Wiener Circle?

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,520
For breakfast?

12
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,821
Come on.

13
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:29,689
Char dog, extra
peppers, cheese...

14
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,957

Dispatch, this is 47.

We're deadheading
back to Station 134.

20
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,033
Any other units who can fill?

21
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:43,303
<i>Multiple units
are requested, 47.</i>

22
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:47,691
I can use the overtime.

23
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,561
Unit 47, responding
to the scene.

24
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,097
<i>That's 47 to the scene at 6:18.</i>

25
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,832
Hey, it's a fire.

26
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,589
At least we'll be warm.

27
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:23,209
Yeah, thanks for
letting Aunt Susie sleep.

28
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,243
You're so good.

29
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:28,014
Oh, yes, you are.

30
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,683
Oh, yes.

31
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:30,717
Oh, and you're wet.

32
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,887
Yeah, okay. I know.

33
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:36,656
Yeah, today's the big day.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,293
Just me and you.

35
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,295
You nervous?

36
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,864
Are you nervous?

37
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,699
Are you?

38
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:47,233
Well, I'm a wreck.

39
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,703
Yeah, you'll be great.

40
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:51,538
I'll probably blow
the whole thing.

41
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:53,974
You want to go
take a bath together?

42
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,709
Huh? A nice warm bath?

43
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,243
Yeah.

44
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,078
Dispatch, this is Unit 47.

45
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,079
We're first on scene

46
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,114
at Ravenswood and Nelson.

47
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,215
Third story occupied.

48
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,519
Heavy fire showing second floor.

49
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,470
<i>Three engines,
Truck 58, Truck 82,</i>

50
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,294
<i>and Battalion 6 are rolling.</i>

51
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,046
Hey, everybody out of there?

52
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,281
I didn't see anybody come out,

53
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,515
but there was
this big explosion.

54
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,617
Just went "Boom!"

55
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,818
about two or three minutes ago.

56
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,120
People living in there?

57
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,022
Yeah, they're coming
and going all the time.

58
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,166
I think they selling drugs
in there or something.

59
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,249
Everybody, move back!

60
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:37,473
Move back, everybody! Come on!

61
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:41,543
Move back, everybody! Hey!

62
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,335
Is anybody else in there?

63
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,092
Is there anybody in there?

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,959
Help me!

65
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:03,960
Shep!

66
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,116
Help me!

67
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,804
Get his legs! Get his legs!

68
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,994
Damn it!

69
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,192
Roll him! Roll him!

70
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,378
Help me, somebody!

71
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,863
Please!

72
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,382
Get away from the
building now! Come on.

73
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,801
No! No! My babies are in there!

74
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:29,802
How many?

75
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,004
Three. Please!

76
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:32,005
Where are they?

77
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,006
Where are they?

78
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,008
On the second floor in the back.

79
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,009
Okay, all right, listen...

80
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,010
Please get them!

81
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,344
Go over there with your child.

82
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,545
The ambulance is on the way.

83
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,835
Go, go!

84
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:43,950
Raul, we got
three kids up there.

85
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,751
Trucks are on their way.

86
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,553
Call it in. They're gonna
be here in seconds.

87
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:48,554
Second floor in the back.

88
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:49,555
Shep! Damn it, Shep, don't...

89
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,042
Shep! Shep!

90
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,310
Dispatch, Unit 47
at Ravenswood fire.

91
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,945
Three kids, second
floor in the rear.

92
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,580
We're going in for
a rescue attempt.

93
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,516
Have the first due
engine back us up.

94
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,683
<i>Roger, 47.</i>

95
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,978
I just feel funny
about taking it off.

96
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,012
She filed for divorce,

97
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,214
and she's living
with another guy.

98
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,215
Morning.

99
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,382
Morning.

100
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,318
I guarantee you,
she's not wearing hers

101
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,719
while she's digging post holes

102
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,920
in bed with what's-his-name.

103
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:11,921
You know what?

104
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,323
I don't need any
more mental images

105
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:14,457
of Jennifer's new sex life.

106
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,758
My imagination

107
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,160
is already working overtime.

108
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,427
You asked me

109
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,829
why women don't
seem interested in you,

110
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,298
and I said that women
do not respond well

111
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,699
to guys who come on to them

112
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,901
while they're wearing
their wedding ring.

113
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,902
It just doesn't...

114
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:26,903
Randi. Okay.

115
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,704
You meet a cute
guy for the first time.

116
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,873
What do you do?

117
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,341
Run a credit check.

118
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,976
Normal women check on rings.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,977
That's right, Mark,

120
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,178
and if he's not wearing one,

121
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,279
you look for that I'm-married-

122
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,613
but-it's-in-my-pocket
indentation.

123
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,215
I'm telling you.
Throw it in the river.

124
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,816
Throw the ring in the river.

125
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,651
Doug... Yeah.

126
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,853
6-year-old with
the flu, Curtain 3.

127
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,921
Okay.

128
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,122
You going to have
dinner tonight?

129
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,656
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,459
Here I am, pouring out my
heart about how I can't get a date,

131
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,061
and you're probably
going to go have dinner

132
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,263
with the entire KLM flight crew.

133
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,398
Bulls game with my dad.

134
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,499
Since when

135
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,901
did he and his dad get close?

136
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,002
They aren't.

137
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,603
They've seen each
other a couple of times.

138
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,604
Doug's trying, though.

139
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,906
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

140
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,673
They cut my shifts back again.

141
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,376
I may as well work part-time.

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,777
I'm down to eight
shifts a month.

143
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,979
Been moonlighting as a
per diem for a temp agency.

144
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,148
Better money, anyway. Really?

145
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,849
Oh, yeah. Overtime,
no paperwork...

146
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,984
Where's Susan?

147
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,219
She hasn't signed in yet.

148
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,353
Uh-huh.

149
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,388
Appointment. She called

150
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,989
and said she was
going to be late.

151
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,493
Appointment? What
kind of appointment?

152
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,893
This is County. Go ahead.

153
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:24,961
<i>This is Unit 92.</i>

154
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,129
<i>We're en route</i>

155
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,363
<i>from a residential building fire</i>

<i>with a 20-year-old male.</i>

<i>Extensive second-
and third-degree burns.</i>

158
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,867
<i>Couldn't get a line or intubate,</i>

159
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,169
<i>so we scooped and ran.</i>

160
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,203
<i>Multiple victims at scene.</i>

161
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,271
What do we got?

162
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,272
Crispy critters.

163
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,473
How many?

164
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,975
<i>Three majors,
two minors, so far.</i>

165
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,743
So far?

166
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,111
<i>Still pulling them out.</i>

167
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,512
<i>All coming your way, County.</i>

168
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,780
<i>Our ETA's four minutes.</i>

169
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,515
We'll be waiting.

170
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,550
Randi, page Susan.

171
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,952
Tell her to get here soon.

172
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,054
Notify the Burn
Unit and find Benton.

173
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,688
Lydia, make sure that we have

174
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,712
plenty of Silvadene
and Ringer's lactate.

175
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,328
Man, I hate burn cases.

176
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,997
Sorry. I know it's
here somewhere.

177
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:02,999
Need to use the phone?

178
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,166
Uh, no.

179
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,169
It's just my work
trying to find me.

180
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,387
So, you were saying
about the visit?

181
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:10,140
Your home visit went very well.

182
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,241
Ms. Pearline's
expressed a concern

183
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,626
about the hours
you're required to work

184
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,660
during your Residency...

185
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,796
Yeah, I'm trying to cut back.

186
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,030
But biological
relation adoptions

187
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,565
are simple procedures.

188
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:20,633
Frankly, short of finding you

189
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,035
in the midst of
an animal sacrifice

190
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:23,653
I doubt anything could
have slowed your petition.

191
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,356
That's good news.

192
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,940
Have you had any
luck locating your sister?

193
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,643
Um, I got a Christmas card
postmarked from Flagstaff.

194
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,978
No return address,

195
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:35,148
and the phone company
doesn't have a listing.

196
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,799
It's been five months?

197
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,784
What about the father?

198
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,218
I put ads in the paper.

199
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,787
Well, the judge

200
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,421
will terminate
their birthrights,

201
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,040
and then your attorney

202
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,375
can have the
adoption order entered.

203
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,526
That's it?

204
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,661
Except for a lifetime
of homework projects

205
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,785
and boyfriends, yes.

206
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,850
Approximately 20-year-old male,

207
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,385
ran from building
with clothes on fire.

208
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,069
Extensive second-
and third-degree burns,

209
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,304
Trauma 1. Singed nasal hair.

210
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,906
Unable to start
an IV or take BP.

211
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,575
Third-degree burns
to all extremities.

212
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,010
Weak carotid pulse at 150.

213
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:05,544
Carol, get Susan down here.

214
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,913
She won't answer her page.

215
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,047
Building caught on fire.

216
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,348
Just blew up. Meth lab.

217
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,283
Pieces of pressure cookers
and chemical burners

218
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,585
just blew up.

219
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,120
Carter. Six engines,
three truck companies.

220
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,454
We grabbed this guy and ran.

221
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,156
Easy now...

222
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,925
and go.

223
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,129
All right, let's get a
blood gas and a CO level.

224
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,581
CBC, Chem-20, portable chest.

225
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,415
Oh, God.

226
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,617
Two cut down
trays. Carter. Doug.

227
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,918
Cut down where?

228
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,286
Femorally. You take the right.

229
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,937
Number 10 blade, Curved Kelly.

230
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,806
I'm going to do an RSI.

231
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,942
Pulse ox is 65 percent
on 100 percent O-2.

232
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,477
Pulse 144, weak and thready.

233
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,561
Versed.

234
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,762
Don't forget the catheter.

235
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,397
Incise it and thread the IV in.

236
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,765
Directly into the vein?

237
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,400
A bunch of children
were in that building.

238
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,602
Adults ran, left them in there.

239
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,803
How many kids? At least three.

240
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,620
47 got there before
the engine companies.

241
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:49,822
They went in there after them.

242
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,173
Veck, 10 migs. Unit 47?

243
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,508
Veck! Second floor collapsed.

244
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,310
We're headed back. Lots
of firemen are in trouble.

245
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,945
7.5. Apply cricoid pressure.

246
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,113
Did they get out? Who?

247
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,949
47. Lydia, 7.5, please.

248
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,534
I think one of
them did. Oh, God.

249
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,002
Who's 47? Shepard and Melendez.

250
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,521
Got it.

251
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,123
Another one. 8-year-old.

252
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,958
I'll finish up here.
Doug, you take it. Okay.

253
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,960
Somebody ought
to tell Carol. I will.

254
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:11,961
8-year-old girl,

255
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:12,962
18 percent second-degree

256
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:13,963
arms, back, and leg,

257
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:14,997
third-degree, lateral thigh.

258
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,198
How's the airway?

259
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,199
Singed nasal hair,
nonproductive cough,

260
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,484
denied shortness of breath.

261
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:21,554
BP 110/70, pulse 112, resps 24.

262
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,605
Two IVs going, normal saline.

263
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,107
O-2 10 liters by mask.

264
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,209
It hurts! It hurts!

265
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,343
You're gonna be
okay, sweetheart.

266
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,511
I want my mommy!

267
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,912
Do we know where
her parents are?

268
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,214
Not a clue.

269
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,281
All right, here we go.

270
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,949
On my count.

271
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,353
Ready? Here we
go. One, two, three.

272
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,988
Blood gas with
carbon monoxide level,

273
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:44,059
CBC, PT, PTT,
Chem-20, chest x-ray,

274
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,295
urinalysis, and urine myoglobin.

275
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,498
Carol, Shep and Raul may
have got caught in the fire.

276
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,900
What?

277
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,484
47 was the first
responder on the scene.

278
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,685
They went in after some kids.

279
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,304
One of them might have
gotten caught inside.

280
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,140
Well, which one? I don't know.

281
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,524
We may have a
laryngeal burn here.

282
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,726
Get me a fiber-optic
laryngoscope.

283
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,895
A couple of paramedics
from Station 134, drive 47,

284
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,896
you know them?

285
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,497
They the ones that
pulled out the kids?

286
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,033
I don't know. Maybe.
Are they okay?

287
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:08,534
We scooped and
ran, it was chaos,

288
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:10,636
but units behind us might know.

289
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,738
Another run, ETA three minutes.

290
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:13,940
Carol, did you find Susan?

291
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,107
I beeped her 911.

292
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,708
Run down Benton, okay?

293
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:19,878
Because we are in over
our heads down here already.

294
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:21,447
PH 7.14, PO-2 60,

295
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,349
PCO-2 80, CO level 20.

296
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,583
He's going bradycardic.

297
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,918
Rate's 40. No palpable BP.

298
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,586
No pulse.

299
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,921
Hyperventilate him. Carter, CPR.

300
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,390
One amp epi, atropine one mig.

301
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:33,525
They're here, Dr. Greene.

302
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,794
Malik, why don't you
help them down front?

303
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,596
Lily, find out if
Doug's done next door.

304
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,198
Where the hell is Benton?

305
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,000
Hold still. We have to
look down your throat

306
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:42,201
to make sure it's not burned.

307
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,202
Doug, more coming in.

308
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,004
Mark wants to know
if you can take them.

309
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,172
Not yet.

310
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:47,773
Triage new arrivals
and give us a breakdown.

311
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:50,142
Lily, I'll do it. You
stay with Doug.

312
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,244
Carol, they're
going to be just fine.

313
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:54,768
Versed? Milligram IV.

314
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,652
Where do you want him?

315
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,554
Trauma 3.

316
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,789
12-year-old boy,
smoke inhalation.

317
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:04,857
Name's Max.

318
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,492
All right, Jerry,
take Max to Exam 1

319
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,694
and tell the nurses to put
him on 100 percent O-2,

320
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:09,862
and get Benton down here.

321
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,263
I've been trying.
He's still in surgery.

322
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,264
Well, get him out.

323
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:13,265
What else have you got?

324
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:14,266
Fireman,

325
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,267
first- and second-degree burns

326
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,369
of trunk and arm.

327
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:17,569
Vitals normal.
He's in some pain.

328
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,571
Okay, uh, Malik, I want
him in Curtain Area 2,

329
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,140
and get him an
order for Demerol.

330
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,542
Did you see a couple of
guys from 47 at the scene?

331
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,743
Radio said they got one out.

332
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,745
He should be in one
of the units behind us.

333
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,946
All right, what do we got?

334
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,947
Second- and third-degree burns.

335
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:29,948
Go, go, go.

336
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:30,949
Which one?

337
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,119
I don't know.

338
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,654
Um, Randi, what's the next ETA?

339
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:36,722
Less than a minute,

340
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:37,923
and they're loading two more up

341
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,191
on the scene.

342
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:42,055
Coming through! Coming through!

343
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,466
Jerry, what the
hell is going on?

344
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,667
There's a fire. A big one.

345
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:22,868
Susan, Mark's
been yelling for you.

346
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,069
We need help in Trauma.

347
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,271
Okay, well, I've got to
get Susie up to daycare.

348
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:27,473
I'll take her. I'll take her.

349
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,474
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

350
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,710
Go, go!

351
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,244
Now, Wendy's going
to take you upstairs.

352
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,046
I'll check in on you,
all right, darling?

353
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,247
Do you need a hand?

354
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,049
No. Why don't you
check with Mark in 1?

355
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:38,116
Have you seen Carol?

356
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,184
Yeah, she's still out back.

357
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,787
All right, you got her?

358
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:42,927
Excuse me.

359
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:45,257
What can I do?

360
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,260
Not much now.
Asystole. How long?

361
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,062
22 minutes.

362
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,680
Okay, Carter. That's it.

363
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,931
Call it.

364
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,084
Pronounced 8:20.

365
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,085
Where have you been?

366
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,486
I had an appointment.
It ran over.

367
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,554
You were on at seven.

368
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,890
I told Weaver I'd
be here at eight.

369
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,124
Yeah? It's 8:30.

370
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,392
It's 8:20.

371
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,828
Cover him up.

372
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,513
Take him to Holding.
We need the room.

373
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,514
Mark, I'm sorry.

374
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,515
It was really important.

375
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,671
So's your job.

376
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,342
Did you hear anything yet?

377
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,443
No.

378
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,146
Is this him? I don't know.

379
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,213
Altered level of consciousness,

380
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,481
coughing, second-degree
burns to the hands,

381
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,482
vitals normal, BP's 110/80.

382
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,483
It hurts!

383
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,951
Pulse is 142,
respiratory rate 36.

384
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,086
We'll fix you right up.

385
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,287
Did you hear about Unit 47?

386
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,621
Yeah, one saved this kid's life.

387
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,756
He's in 92, behind us.

388
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,124
Go, go.

389
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,182
On this side!

390
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,797
Pulled two kids out.

391
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,799
Went in again for the last one.

392
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:43,800
The floor gave away.

393
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,768
He fell 10 feet,
landed on his legs,

394
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,970
dragged himself to
the front of the building,

395
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,205
still had the kid with him.

396
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,807
Soft tissue
swelling, right knee.

397
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,808
Which one is it?

398
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:52,809
Shepard.

399
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,810
Where's Melendez?

400
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,944
They haven't found him yet.

401
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,345
It's okay. You're
going to be okay.

402
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,413
What do you got?

403
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,547
Paramedic, fell 10 feet.

404
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,548
Complaining of pain, right ribs,

405
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,549
lower extremities.

406
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,650
Mild shortness of breath,

407
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,419
partial thickness burns
on right arm and hand.

408
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,553
No LOC, C-spine precautions.

409
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,422
IV of saline, O-2, 15 liters.

410
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,590
Vitals stable.

411
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,808
Morphine IV for pain.

412
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,231
We're heading to Trauma 2.

413
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,532
They find Raul?

414
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,533
Not yet.

415
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,534
Any shortness of breath?

416
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,069
No, I'm okay.

417
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,904
The floor went
out from under us.

418
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,639
You've got to keep that mask on.

419
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,375
I had hold of that kid.

420
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,344
The mask.

421
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,847
Raul was right behind me.

422
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,049
They got to find him.

423
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,065
Okay, okay.

424
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,789
All right, let's go.

425
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,606
O-2, 15 liters.

426
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,007
Pulse is 132.

427
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,008
No sign of trauma.

428
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,610
You say that he fell
through the floor?

429
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,777
Yeah, but I think

430
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,845
the paramedic broke his fall.

431
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:47,864
Pulse ox 75.

432
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,332
CBC, Chem-20,

433
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,967
coag panel, chest x-ray,

434
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,769
UA, urine myoglobin, and ABGs.

435
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,587
BP's low. 80/50.

436
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:56,589
He's not breathing.

437
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:57,590
Nail beds are cherry-red.

438
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:58,690
Intubation tray.

439
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:00,092
Jerry, call Respiratory.

440
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,193
Get a ventilator down here.

441
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:02,661
Multi-focal PVCs.

442
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:05,097
Lidocaine 50, IV
push and then drip

443
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,049
at one milligram a minute.

444
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,450
Here we go. Lido in.

445
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,603
Bag! Give me the bag!

446
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:12,143
Let's go, buddy.

447
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,540
Okay, there we go. I'm in.

448
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:16,675
Hyperventilate him.

449
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,728
Ventilator flying in.

450
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,396
V-tach. Faint pulse.

451
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,397
All right, cardiovert him.

452
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,898
Hit the synch switch at 50.

453
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,450
Give me that. Okay.

454
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:26,551
Clear!

455
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:27,586
Clear.

456
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,739
Move it, Reilly. Move it.

457
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:30,856
Nope.

458
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,575
Again 100. Clear.

459
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,476
Clear.

460
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,578
Now he's in fib.

461
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,246
Off synch. Defibrillate at 200.

462
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,313
Clear. Move.

463
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,915
Clear.

464
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,683
No pulse.

465
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,835
300. Come on, buddy.

466
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,637
Reilly, get the hell
out of the way. Move.

467
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,654
Clear.

468
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,456
Neck hurt?

469
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,791
No. The kid's okay?

470
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,892
Any pain?

471
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,261
Yeah, my ribs hurt a little.

472
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,313
Tell X-ray to run a
spine and get a chest.

473
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:55,448
Those three kids okay?

474
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:56,849
We're taking care
of them right now.

475
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,050
Raul was right behind me.

476
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,585
We were on the second floor.

477
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:01,821
Stop moving your head.

478
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,322
The last kid was in a closet.

479
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:04,923
We'd almost given up,
then Raul found him.

480
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,925
We just wanted to
get the hell out of there.

481
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:07,943
Any pain?

482
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,944
Yeah.

483
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,179
What about here?

484
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,547
No, no, I'm okay, all right?

485
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,849
I thought we could
make it down the stairs.

486
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:14,933
The hall was going up.

487
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,535
I'm touching you
here. Do you feel this?

488
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,154
Yeah. Okay, wiggle your toes.

489
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,522
He was right there.

490
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,823
I was looking at him,
then there was a big noise,

491
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,342
and then I'm
falling with the kid.

492
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:24,961
Dorsalis pedis Okay. Shh.

493
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,463
And posterior tibial
pulses are intact.

494
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,065
They got to find
Raul. They're trying.

495
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,000
He was right behind
me. He's right there.

496
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,635
Okay, they're trying. Shh.

497
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,903
ABG with
carboxyhemoglobin level.

498
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,622
CBC, Chem-20, coags.

499
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:37,623
UA and myoglobin?

500
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:38,707
Yeah.

501
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,525
Dr. Greene, they found Raul.

502
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,360
Is he okay?

503
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:43,813
Is he okay?

504
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,315
Bringing him in now.

505
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,869
They found him!

506
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:52,204
That's great!

507
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,357
That's great.

508
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,091
They found him.

509
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,543
Oh, that's good.

510
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,544
Short of breath?

511
00:16:58,568 --> 00:16:59,611
No.

512
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:00,612
Coughing?

513
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:01,613
A little.

514
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:02,681
Is he hacking anything up?

515
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,099
Yeah, but it's pretty clear.

516
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,084
Portable chest,

517
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,952
blood gas with CO level.

518
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,871
100 percent oxygen
by nonrebreather mask.

519
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:09,872
You're gonna be fine.

520
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:10,889
They found Melendez.

521
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,875
He was on the second floor.

522
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:13,947
Second floor?

523
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,346
Yeah, those, uh...

524
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,181
Those paramedics
didn't have any gear.

525
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,450
They went in anyway.

526
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,141
Every one of those
kids would be dead.

527
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,022
ABG's back.

528
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,357
Carbon monoxide's high.

529
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,025
40 percent. PH 7.15.

530
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,026
He's seizing.

531
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,261
Bite block. Damn it.

532
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,497
What the hell else can
go wrong with this kid?

533
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,698
Ativan, 1 milligram IV push.

534
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,099
How much do you think he weighs?

535
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,534
30, 35 kilos.

536
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,168
Dilantin, 50 per kilo.

537
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,037
Load him with 450.

538
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,105
Who has a hyperbaric chamber?

539
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,440
University of Chicago.

540
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,875
Call Ira Blumen.

541
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,482
Tell him to get his damn
chopper down here now!

542
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,648
Found him trapped inside, ALOC.

543
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:53,833
Extensive partial and
full-thickness burns

544
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:55,897
to the chest, back,
and all extremities.

545
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,621
We've got you now, Raul.

546
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,090
LOC improved on
15 liters O-2 by mask.

547
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,292
No singed nasal or
facial hair. Shivering.

548
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,527
Complaining of severe pain.

549
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,727
Not able to get an IV.

550
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,728
No place for BP cuff.

551
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,729
Faint carotid pulse at 160,

552
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,864
resps 40 and labored.

553
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,400
Nice and gentle.
One, two, three.

554
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,102
Blood gas with CO level.

555
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,104
CBC, PT, PTT.

556
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,057
Portable chest. Put in a Foley.
Get a UA and a urine myoglobin.

557
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:19,258
It hurts. It hurts a lot.

558
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:20,443
Yeah, I know it does.

559
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,660
That's what we're
working on now.

560
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,195
Can you do a cut down?

561
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:24,663
Neck's not burned.

562
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,798
All right, internal jugular.

563
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:26,999
Let's go.

564
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,600
Let's get those
moist dressings on.

565
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:29,902
Gentlemen,

566
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:31,520
you're going to have
to wait outside, okay?

567
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,854
Doc! Mark.

568
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,806
How bad?

569
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,675
It's too early to say.

570
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,849
Please.

571
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,954
It's bad.

572
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:46,602
Shep okay?

573
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,471
He broke a couple of ribs.

574
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,488
He's mad as hell.

575
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,274
Morphine five, IV push.

576
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,642
Let's get that Ringer's going.

577
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,186
X-ray flying in.

578
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,782
What the hell's going on?

579
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,783
They're examining him.

580
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,684
Is he okay?

581
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,768
I can't tell from here.

582
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,003
Shooting.

583
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:07,077
What was that?
They're taking an x-ray.

584
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,326
You got to get me
off this backboard.

585
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,327
I want to see.

586
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,928
You also want
to be able to walk.

587
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,497
Take it off! Hey, hey, hey!

588
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,497
Take it off! Okay,

589
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,732
you could have a broken neck.

590
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,901
You do that one more
time, I put you in restraints.

591
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,621
CO level's normal.
PO-2 112, PCO-2 32.

592
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,790
Okay. Let's move
him to Radiology.

593
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:26,292
No, I want to stay.

594
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:27,393
No, you're going.

595
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,244
No, please, I want to stay.

596
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,495
Carol. Carol. Please.

597
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,297
There's nothing you
can do to help him now,

598
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,183
and we've got to
make sure you're okay.

599
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:37,758
Carol, I need to know.

600
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,073
Will you stay with him? You bet.

601
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,859
All right, I'll go
find out, okay?

602
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,323
You'll come right
back? I promise.

603
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,914
Tell him that I thought
he was right behind me.

604
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,766
Tell him I didn't
leave him there!

605
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,957
Tell him I didn't
leave him there!

606
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,026
Excuse me, guys.

607
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,549
Guys...

608
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,568
Grab an ABG while
you're down there.

609
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,555
Hook it up to the transducer.

610
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,622
Got it.

611
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,690
Good. We're in business.

612
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,091
BP 70/30.

613
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,693
Open it wide.

614
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,727
Is he conscious?

615
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,162
Yeah.

616
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,114
Hey, Raul.

617
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,700
Hi.

618
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,901
It's Carol.

619
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,476
How you doing?

620
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:37,495
How extensive are the burns?

621
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,989
85 to 90 percent,
mostly third-degree.

622
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:48,262
Oh, my God.

623
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:56,503
Malik, let's do laryngoscopy.

624
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,254
Excuse me.

625
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,255
How's he doing?

626
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,256
Not so good.

627
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,647
Coming through!

628
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,496
Anything I can do to help?

629
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,832
PH 7.10.

630
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,200
PO-2 55.

631
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,685
PCO-2 50 on 15 liters.

632
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,187
Respiratory rate 40 and rising.

633
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,639
No edema. That's good, Raul.

634
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,623
His breathing's labored.

635
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,241
He has circumferential
burn of the chest.

636
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,528
He needs an escharotomy.
Where are the Burn Unit guys?

637
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,762
Finishing up a little girl.

638
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:45,764
All right, Carter and
I can do it. Come on.

639
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:46,965
Prep and drape.

640
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:48,989
Number 10 blade.
Let's go, Carter. Move.

641
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:52,871
How are the kids?

642
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,172
One was touch-and-go.

643
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:55,974
I sent him over to the
University of Chicago

644
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,876
for some hyperbaric
oxygen therapy.

645
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,310
The other two are okay.

646
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,712
The little girl's gonna
need some grafts.

647
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,331
Any parents yet?

648
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,132
A mother left the scene
with an injured toddler.

649
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,367
The police have out APBs,

650
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,168
but she hasn't shown
up at a hospital yet.

651
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,237
I'm gonna keep Raul
company. How's Shep?

652
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,822
Multiple rib fractures,
knee sprain, burns.

653
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:12,323
He's up in Ortho.

654
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:13,759
Dr. Greene,

655
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:15,961
there's a bunch of guys out
here asking about giving blood.

656
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:17,830
Send them up to the blood bank.

657
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:18,854
Okay.

658
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,917
Mother was going
to let her children

659
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,051
burn to death.

660
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,686
Same mother who was
cooking methamphetamine

661
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,630
five feet away from where
her kids were sleeping.

662
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,008
Okay, Raul,

663
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,043
your burns are constricting
and shrinking your chest,

664
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:33,345
so Peter's gonna
relieve pressure

665
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:34,563
so you can breathe, Carter...

666
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,898
all right?

667
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,066
All right,

668
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,618
let's get these dressings off.

669
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:42,571
Whew. God.

670
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,606
Let's start with two
lateral incisions.

671
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,709
Cut longitudinally

672
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,510
down the midaxillary line.

673
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,495
BP's still 80/50.

674
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,119
Give him a 500 cc bolus.

675
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:54,216
Pulse is thready.

676
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,884
I don't know if I can do this.

677
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,040
Come on, Carter. Just focus.

678
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,309
No, really.

679
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,311
Carter, deepen your incision
until you hit fresh tissue.

680
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:09,670
Come on. You can do it.

681
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,037
Uh...

682
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,305
I'm sorry. I can't.

683
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,444
I got it.

684
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,692
Dr. Ross, the boy's
back from Radiology

685
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,293
and the police
want to talk to him.

686
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,294
Okay. All right.

687
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,918
Will you let me know
if anything changes?

688
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,789
Okay, that's it. Better?

689
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,956
Burn guys are here.

690
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,457
Quite the crowd.

691
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,859
Morning, Mark. What have we got?

692
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,211
Hey, kiddo. How's it going?

693
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,546
His arm hurts.

694
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,615
Yeah? Well, you
got first-degree burns.

695
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:44,750
You know what those are?

696
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:45,950
No.

697
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:47,819
Like a bad sunburn.

698
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,721
Hurts really bad, but there's
no permanent damage.

699
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:50,822
How's his sputum?

700
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,123
Clear in the last hour.

701
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,042
Max, you like baseball?

702
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:58,463
You'll be back at
spring training in no time.

703
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,715
Where's my mom?

704
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,133
Well, we don't know.

705
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:03,635
Somebody saw
her outside the fire

706
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,054
and then she just disappeared.

707
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,539
Is Jessica okay?

708
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,741
Jessica, your sister, she
went to a different hospital,

709
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:11,476
but she's gonna be fine too.

710
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,978
And Jamie?

711
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,412
That's the baby?

712
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:16,414
He was with your mom.

713
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:19,089
You have any idea
where we can find them?

714
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,238
There's a police detective
here. He wants to talk to you.

715
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,976
Okay?

716
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,178
Let's get him up
to the Burn Unit.

717
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,647
He a friend of yours? Yeah.

718
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,915
He have a family?

719
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,017
I called them already.

720
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,318
Who's going to tell Raul?

721
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,787
I will.

722
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,288
No, I will. He's a fireman.

723
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,224
He already knows.

724
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,365
Give us room, guys.

725
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,782
Hang in there, Melendez.

726
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:51,983
You're gonna be okay, bro.

727
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,685
Stay up.

728
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,887
We're all pulling for you, man.

729
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,673
Hang tough, Raul.

730
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:00,542
You take care, now.

731
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:01,999
God bless.

732
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,614
Excuse me.

733
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,362
E.R.

734
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,363
Excuse me.

735
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,565
Hang on. I'm on the phone.

736
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,933
Uh, no, you need
Media Relations.

737
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,301
Yeah. They'll fill you in.

738
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,203
Right.

739
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,571
Can I help you?

740
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,539
Is Dr. Lewis around?

741
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,041
Uh, no. She's busy right now.

742
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,176
Well, if you see her,

743
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,577
tell her up I'm in
daycare, okay?

744
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,412
I'm her sister, Chloe.

745
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,936
Okay.

746
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:47,839
You doing all right?

747
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:49,174
Is Raul okay?

748
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,608
He's in pain. Doesn't
want the Vicodin.

749
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,210
How's he doing?
What's happening?

750
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,228
Repeat gas is normal.

751
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,918
Hey, what the hell is going on?

752
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,406
Jeanie, can you
give us a minute?

753
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,548
No.

754
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,451
Oh, no!

755
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:20,343
No! No!

756
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,541
Dr. Benton?

757
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,476
What is it, Carter?

758
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,112
I don't know what happened.

759
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,980
I thought I'd seen
a lot of things

760
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,649
since I've been
here, but that, um...

761
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:48,983
You have to focus, Carter.

762
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,120
I know. I tried.

763
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,155
They announce the matches

764
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,390
in a couple of weeks

765
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:58,126
and I want to be a
surgeon, but that...

766
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,683
I don't know if I can do that.

767
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,254
You can.

768
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,058
Carter.

769
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,944
It doesn't get worse than that.

770
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,380
You stayed on your feet.

771
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,671
That says something.

772
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,659
Lily, get Dr. Ross!
I think he's dying!

773
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,661
Jerry, what's open? Trauma 2.

774
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,464
He was fine, and
then, all of a sudden,

775
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,965
he just started

776
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,033
having trouble breathing.

777
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,234
Airway obstruction!

778
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,585
Come on in here.

779
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:44,272
Pediatric intubation tray!

780
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,590
Soot in his airway.

781
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:48,726
CBC, Chem-20, PTT, PT.

782
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,962
Get a blood gas with a CO level,

783
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,363
portable chest,

784
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:54,216
cath urine. Stick
him for a glucose.

785
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,284
I fixed up those
burns on his arms

786
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,620
and I thought he was okay.

787
00:27:58,644 --> 00:27:59,738
Epiglottal edema.

788
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:00,905
Think you can get in?

789
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,258
Pulse ox 65. Cyanotic nail beds.

790
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,360
Faint pulse at 32.

791
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,778
I don't think I can get in.

792
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:07,863
Oh, my God!

793
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,064
What is it?

794
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,034
Airway obstruction
from laryngeal burns.

795
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,735
Can't get the tube in.

796
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,587
I'm going to have
to needle crike him.

797
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,589
Please don't let my baby die.

798
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,823
Give me the scope.

799
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,425
Throat's swollen shut.

800
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,261
Prep for a crike.
I'll keep trying.

801
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,595
14-gauge angiocath.

802
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,097
Please don't let him die.

803
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,365
Come on.

804
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:28,617
Oh, my God, please don't...

805
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:30,808
Go on, Doug, I'm...
I'm almost in. Hang on.

806
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:33,438
Come on.

807
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,628
There. Okay, I
got it. Go. Bag him.

808
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:38,243
Good breath sounds.

809
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:39,510
Thank you.

810
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:43,315
Thank you so much.

811
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:44,983
I'm so sorry.

812
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,651
I'm sorry.

813
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:48,603
I'm sorry, baby.

814
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,105
Is that the mother
from the fire?

815
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,823
Yeah. I think so.

816
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,391
Should have been her airway.

817
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:55,182
I would have let her suffocate.

818
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,985
Thank you.

819
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,755
I'm so sorry.

820
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,245
Thank you.

821
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,778
His BP's unstable,

822
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:15,680
serum myoglobin is climbing,

823
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:18,149
there's evidence
of rhabdomyolysis

824
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,851
and impending renal failure,

825
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,019
respiratory function
is deteriorating,

826
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,155
but he's conscious and alert.

827
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,493
He won't make it till morning.

828
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,295
His family here yet?

829
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,264
In the lobby.

830
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:34,966
One brother's on vacation.

831
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,668
He's flying in from
Florida tonight.

832
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,760
Hope his flight's on time.

833
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,013
How's he doing?

834
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,082
He's okay. Sedated.

835
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:52,384
Burns were mostly first-degree.

836
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:53,851
The cops come for the mother?

837
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,687
She's in with the
Homicide-Arson guys now.

838
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,021
The dad's flying
in from Florida...

839
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,423
Get the kids.

840
00:29:58,447 --> 00:29:59,591
And you should get going.

841
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:00,925
For what?

842
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,327
The Bulls game
starts in an hour.

843
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:04,962
Oh, no. I got to wait
for Pedes to come down.

844
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,764
I want to check on
the other kids, and...

845
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:07,765
I'll do it. It's okay.

846
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:08,766
You should go, Doug.

847
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,967
I mean, you've gotten this far.

848
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,135
You should see it through.

849
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,226
No, I'm okay.

850
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,177
Hey, Mark?

851
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,979
Pedes was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

852
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:24,082
Why don't you give them a call?

853
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:27,491
Say hello to Benny
the Bull for me.

854
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:36,661
Hi.

855
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,098
Your family's here.

856
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:42,200
They're waiting outside.

857
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:45,570
Take my mask off, please.

858
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,462
Please.

859
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,384
How bad?

860
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:01,858
Over 90 percent third-degree.

861
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:07,759
Don't let them put
me on a ventilator.

862
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,427
It'll make you breathe easier.

863
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,251
No!

864
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,900
Okay.

865
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:21,857
Here, put your mask back on.

866
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,330
Uh-uh.

867
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,579
Are those kids gonna make it?

868
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,614
Yeah, thanks to you.

869
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,699
No.

870
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,201
It was Shep.

871
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,441
Balls of steel.

872
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,207
They gonna let him
come up and see me?

873
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,565
I don't see how they'd
be able to keep him away.

874
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,734
Carol, I'm scared.

875
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:53,521
I know.

876
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,289
I'm really scared.

877
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,880
I know.

878
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,252
Lydia?

879
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,853
Are you okay?

880
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,189
Yeah.

881
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,525
Ah, damn it, I hate to cry.

882
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,461
No damn privacy
around this place.

883
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,447
Yeah. Sorry.

884
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,471
Oh, no, no, it's
not your fault. It's...

885
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:43,388
It's just, some days...

886
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:45,190
I don't know what
to do with it all,

887
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,214
you know?

888
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,651
Jamie Nielsen's being
admitted to Pediatrics.

889
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,653
Can you find his x-rays
and have them sent up?

890
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,954
They weren't with the charts.

891
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,223
Raul's up in the Burn Ward?

892
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,757
Yeah. His family's
up there right now.

893
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,493
You guys want to
get something to eat?

894
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,893
I don't feel much
like going home.

895
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:40,995
Yeah, I'm in.

896
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,697
Yeah, sure.

897
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,733
Jerry, why are they still here?

898
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,102
Uh, those are the off-duty guys

899
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,203
from Station 134,

900
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,538
where Shep and Raul work.

901
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,672
They've been here for hours.

902
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,840
I don't think they know

903
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,041
what to do with themselves.

904
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,165
I hear that.

905
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,613
Hey.

906
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,549
Um...

907
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,950
you guys still waiting, huh?

908
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,084
Yeah.

909
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,553
Anybody hungry?

910
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,720
I don't know.

911
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,322
Listen, we're gonna
go across the street

912
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,424
and get something.

913
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:10,630
You want to come?

914
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,345
Hey, Dr. Lewis,

915
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:15,480
did your sister find you?

916
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:16,781
She's been here for hours.

917
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,416
She said she'd be up in daycare.

918
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,917
Oh, my God.

919
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,541
What?

920
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,072
Oh, my God. Valerie,
did she take her?

921
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,140
Where is she? What? No.

922
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:00,174
Where is she?

923
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,208
There.

924
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,171
Oh, my God.

925
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,973
Susie...

926
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:18,443
she is so...

927
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:21,612
beautiful.

928
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:24,849
Yes. Yes.

929
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,484
Yes.

930
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:31,177
Susie.

931
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,336
Shep?

932
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,953
You ready to go see him?

933
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,289
I can't.

934
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,457
Sure, you can.

935
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,559
We didn't have to go in.

936
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:56,864
Engine companies
were on their way.

937
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,433
We could hear them coming.

938
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,685
It's not your fault, Shep.

939
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,286
He only went in
there because of me.

940
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,088
You both did what you
were supposed to do.

941
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:06,424
We didn't even
have the right gear.

942
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:08,226
He knew it.

943
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,460
He looked at the fire,

944
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:10,662
then he looked at me,

945
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:12,597
and he knew it.

946
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:14,721
He followed me in anyway.

947
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,060
You have to go see him.

948
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,214
Your friend is lying up
there waiting for you,

949
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:32,083
and if you don't go,

950
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,524
you're gonna regret this
for the rest of your life.

951
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,609
The guy tells me,

952
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,944
"I showed her this morning

953
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,178
before the opening bell,"

954
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,312
and I said, "Well,

955
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,582
that was two hours ago."

956
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,249
Here you go, you son of a bitch.

957
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,417
Here you go.

958
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,819
Doug?

959
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,989
Who the hell was that?

960
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,657
My son.

961
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,147
Karen, excuse me.

962
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:04,181
Doug! Doug!

963
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:05,450
Doug, wait a minute!

964
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,318
Doug, listen to me!

965
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,387
Listen, I called the
hospital hours ago.

966
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:10,788
I left you a message!
Right. Right.

967
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,590
It was a meeting.
Yeah, it was a meeting.

968
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:15,360
What was her name? Was it
Barbara or Anne? Was it Dottie?

969
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:16,961
Wasn't that the name of the girl

970
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,230
that I caught you with
in the front of Mom's car?

971
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:20,565
I can't remember.
I get confused.

972
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:22,032
It's my boss.
Oh, it's your boss.

973
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:23,234
I thought you owned the joint.

974
00:37:23,258 --> 00:37:24,269
It's complicated, Doug. I...

975
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:25,536
Yeah, it's complicated.

976
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,537
Complicated.

977
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:27,605
Damn it! For God's sake,

978
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:29,440
I would have been
there if I could have!

979
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:30,508
You know that!

980
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:33,244
Look, I left you a message.

981
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:34,345
I'm sorry.

982
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,846
Son, come on.

983
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,149
Come on.

984
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,851
Hey, I'll get tickets
for next week's game.

985
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,353
We'll sit courtside, all right?

986
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:44,589
Hmm? Please.

987
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:45,823
Come on.

988
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,825
I'm freezing my ass
off. Let's go back inside.

989
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,226
It's always about
you, isn't it, Ray?

990
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,428
It's always about what you want.

991
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:51,829
Never anybody else. Just you.

992
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,230
Just what It was
business! You want.

993
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:54,231
It was business?

994
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:55,366
I was standing there, Ray.

995
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,568
It was 7:30, and you
were supposed to be there.

996
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:58,969
I was standing there.
Where were you?

997
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:00,237
You know where...
You were exactly

998
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,439
where you have always been

999
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:02,807
your entire life, Ray.

1000
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:03,974
Someplace else.

1001
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:06,944
That's where you were.

1002
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,579
Now, look.

1003
00:38:08,603 --> 00:38:11,816
I cannot change

1004
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,618
what happened to you
when you were a kid.

1005
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:16,887
I can't.

1006
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:19,490
You did a good
number on me, Ray.

1007
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:21,481
You did a good job.

1008
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:26,864
I never committed to anything

1009
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,584
in my entire life.

1010
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:32,186
I've never been with a
woman for more than...

1011
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,254
six months,

1012
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,457
and most of the
time, it's six days.

1013
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,893
Find a job where I see people

1014
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,294
for a couple of minutes.

1015
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,696
I fix them as best I can.

1016
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,964
I send them on their way.

1017
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,665
No mess, no fuss.

1018
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,034
No messy details.

1019
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,003
That's what you
taught me, right?

1020
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,204
Isn't it?

1021
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,472
That's your trick?

1022
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,575
Well, here I am...

1023
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,001
Dad.

1024
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:03,272
I'm you.

1025
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,894
What happened to you as
a child I'm responsible for.

1026
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,198
You're 34 years old.

1027
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:21,690
How you live your
life is your decision.

1028
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,996
I'm going inside.

1029
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,328
So the woman is buck-naked,
hanging over Shep's shoulder,

1030
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,196
right? And Raul, he's
running behind her

1031
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,865
with the damn poodle.

1032
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,032
Now, the whole time,

1033
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,334
the drunk husband's chasing him

1034
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:54,535
with a butcher knife,

1035
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,738
screaming how he's
gonna kill all of them.

1036
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,482
"I'm gonna kill
you, you bastards!"

1037
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,095
Shep's afraid of heights.
Did you know that?

1038
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,120
A fireman afraid of heights?

1039
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,767
Hey, it's true. He is.

1040
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,802
Raul is always

1041
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,203
making him go up the fire escape

1042
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:13,337
or pull the jumpers

1043
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:14,705
off the tops of buildings,

1044
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:16,557
stuff like that.

1045
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,781
Raul gave Shep skydiving
lessons for Christmas.

1046
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,830
He ever play "La
Bamba" for you guys?

1047
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,532
Hell, yes. I like "La Bamba."

1048
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,933
You wouldn't if you
worked with him.

1049
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,935
When I rode with him
a couple of years back,

1050
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,837
he had it on tape.

1051
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,238
Played the thing
over and over again.

1052
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,540
Enough to make
you kill yourself.

1053
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,163
Or him.

1054
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:37,995
You guys remember
that little baby

1055
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,914
they brought in
about a year ago?

1056
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,348
Found it in a garbage bag

1057
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,250
down on the South Side.

1058
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,985
I remember.

1059
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,086
Yeah.

1060
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,087
It had been dead

1061
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,589
at least three or four hours,

1062
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,559
but those boys brought her in
doing CPR and mouth-to-mouth.

1063
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,995
The child was cold, but
they wouldn't give up.

1064
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,898
Yelled at us

1065
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,600
when we told them
it was hopeless.

1066
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,602
Then they both cried

1067
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,271
like it was their own kid.

1068
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,274
Hell, I cried.

1069
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,197
Me too.

1070
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,939
Hey, partner.

1071
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:42,276
Hey, partner.

1072
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,133
Okay.

1073
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,447
Guess I missed

1074
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,438
that free breakfast, huh?

1075
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,789
Oh, man...

1076
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,245
Hey, hey.

1077
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,630
You gotta hang in there, okay?

1078
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,665
I can't do it, bro.

1079
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,534
You got to.

1080
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,820
I heard those kids
are doing great.

1081
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:25,586
You saved them, buddy.

1082
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,605
No, I didn't.

1083
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,612
You did.

1084
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,373
I'm sorry.

1085
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,143
I'm sorry, buddy.

1086
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,001
I'm sorry.

1087
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,753
I'm sorry.

1088
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,289
I'm sorry.

1089
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:08,117
I'm sorry.
