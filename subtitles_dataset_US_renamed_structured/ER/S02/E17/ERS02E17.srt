Ah.

16

Jerry, I feel like
a Hell's Angel.

17
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,341
I hate to break
it to you, Dr. G,

18
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,710
but an Angel wouldn't
be caught dead

19
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:52,212
on a rice burner.

20
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:53,346
Goat's coming in nice.

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,748
What's it been?
A couple of days?

22
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:56,315
A week.

23
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,484

Oh, uh, Mark,
we're short-staffed.

26
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,743
Malik and Wendy are out sick.

27
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,211
Call the nurses temp agency

28
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,912
and get some
per diems to fill in.

29
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,881
Are you wearing contacts?

30
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,550
Yeah, I thought
I'd try them out.

31
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,251
Why the big makeover?

32
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,386
No reason.

33
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,987
Hey, fuzzy. We
still on for The Mint?

34
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,088
Yeah, sure.

35
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,557
Jazz club.

36
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,725
Meat market.

37
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:22,826
Hot date?

38
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,060
Just a couple of single guys

39

00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,162
So, leave around eight o'clock

41
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,397
for a nine o'clock set?

42
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,366
You know, I'm not
doing anything tonight.

43
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,633
Really, Jerry?

44
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,792
Good, because there's
a great game on TV.

45
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,742
Have you seen this
month's<i> Journal?</i>

46
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,109
No.

47
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,912
Vucelich published his study.

48
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,981
Hmm.

49
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,149
It's tough your name
couldn't be on it.

50
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,753
I wouldn't want my
name to be on it.

51
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,487
The whole study's a sham.

52
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,374
Sour grapes is one thing, Peter,

53
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:55,909
but to slander a colleague

54
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,043
is offensive.

55
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,445
Look, it's not
slander. It's the truth.

56
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,681
Are you prepared
to back that up?

57
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,139
Take it to the Ethics Committee?

58
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:09,277
Well, then keep your mouth shut.

59
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,130
You think it was
the ham and eggs?

60
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:19,899
Because I had two helpings.

61
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,134
Thanks for the concern,

62
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,470
but I don't think it
was my breakfast.

63
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:25,272
It's the match.

64
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:28,107
My entire future's
stuffed in an envelope.

65
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,943
I know I'm not
going to get in here.

66
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:33,112
Well, I hope you
do, because if not,

67
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:34,414
I'm gonna have to start looking

68
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,082
for a new boyfriend.

69
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,450
Better start looking.

70
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:38,785
They hand out the envelopes

71
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:39,986
at nine sharp.

72
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,454
What time is it?

73
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,512
8:15. Oh, God!

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,479
Hey.

75
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,814
Thanks for coming.

76
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,982
I've got five minutes.

77
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,316
Oh, you didn't bring her.

78
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,450
No.

79
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,652
Hi. What can I get you?

80
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,752
Nothing.

81
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,294
Okay.

82
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,044
Uh, I don't blame
you for hating me.

83
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,831
When I left last year,

84
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,165
I was so screwed up.

85
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,401
I was either
going to kill myself

86
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,237
or turn it around.

87
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,955
What kept me going

88
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,225
was thinking about Susie.

89
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,149
Yeah, right.

90
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,564
It's different this time.

91
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:26,432
I... I, uh...

92
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,519
I got into a program

93
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,953
and I've been clean
for five months...

94
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,239
I bet. And...

95
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:33,539
I got engaged.

96
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,585
He's a great guy, Susan.

97
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,830
Congratulations.

98
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,131
I should get to work.

99
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,455
What is it you wanted?

100
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:52,931
I want to be a mother
to my daughter.

101
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,065
Well, that's too damn bad,

102
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:01,885
because you
abandoned your child,

103
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,426
and that's the best thing
that ever happened to her.

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,391
Susie, wait!

105
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,927
Susie, please. Come on.

106
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,561
You can't keep her away from me.

107
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,531
She's my baby!

108
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,690
Don't say a word.

109
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,858
About what?

110
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,427
Temp agency makes us wear them.

111
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,861
You're the temp?

112
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,296
Well, they cut my hours in half

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,299
and I have a mortgage to pay,
so what am I supposed to do?

114
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,134
The earthworms didn't pan out?

115
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,257
Ha. They croaked.

116
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,906
What's this?

117
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,275
Oh, uh, Jeanie was made
Employee of the Month.

118
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,477
Uck.

119
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,511
Does anyone have an aspirin?

120
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,712
Carol, can you start a Foley

121
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,814
on a guy in 3?

122
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,348
I'm on in two minutes.

123
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,572
Ask the Employee of the Month.

124
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,323
You know what she looks like?

125
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,324
Yes.

126
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,325
And the other workers?

127
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,326
We all know Chloe.

128
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,527
You know, if she comes here...

129
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,129
I mean, if she's
peeking in that window,

130
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,731
I want you to page
me. Of course.

131
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,732
You don't know my sister.

132
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:56,733
I'm just afraid

133
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:57,767
she might try something crazy.

134
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,319
Security's right down the hall.

135
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:00,804
I'll talk to them.

136
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,222
I already have.

137
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,757
Yeah, but she still...

138
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,526
We're covered, Susan.

139
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,494
Go to work.

140
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:11,481
Yeah.

141
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,482
Bye.

142
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,551
Come here.

143
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,252
Come here, my cutie.

144
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,420
Yeah. Say goodbye.

145
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,688
Say goodbye.

146
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,756
Wave bye-bye to Mommy.

147
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,824
Bye-bye.

148
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,692
Bye-bye.

149
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,160
That's right.

150
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,029
That's right, little girl.

151
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,014
Come on.

152
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:29,149
Are you on any medications,

153
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:30,716
Mr. Bartoli?

154
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,018
I can't understand it.

155
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,720
I was feeling like a
million bucks, you know?

156
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:37,890
I was in the sack, actually,
with this knockout postmistress.

157
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,292
It's amazing how well you can do

158
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,094
just hanging
around a post office,

159
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:43,396
and then, bam, you know,

160
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,198
right in the chest.

161
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,367
Any medications, Mr. Bartoli?

162
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:52,138
Well, I got this ointment from
one of those, uh, catalogs.

163
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,475
Dr. Joe's Prolonging Cream?

164
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,711
Keeps me going all night, and...

165
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,646
How much did you use?

166
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,615
The whole tube.

167
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,451
Mr. Bartoli, this is digitalis.

168
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,252
It can cause a heart arrhythmia.

169
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:08,154
You got to stop using it.

170
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,256
Cold turkey? Yeah.

171
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,259
Doesn't this stuff

172
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,661
make you completely numb?

173
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,912
An unfortunate side effect.

174
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,299
Nevertheless, it
helps guys like us,

175
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:21,600
you know, make the grade.

176
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,386
"Guys like us"?

177
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,570
Bald guys.

178
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:28,741
Babes know we have
more testosterone.

179
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,876
They expect more.

180
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,302
Am I right?

181
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:44,924
Oh, no.

182
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,826
Bad news?

183
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,093
No news.

184
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,462
Hicks is late.

185
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:50,863
Should I grab an emesis basin?

186
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,498
No, I'm all right.

187
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,834
Resigned myself
to the painful truth.

188
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,436
What are you talking about?

189
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,653
I don't deserve to match here.

190
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,338
I don't.

191
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:02,041
I've been so wrapped
up in the competition

192
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,109
that I lost sight of
what it's all about.

193
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,545
I've become

194
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,947
this brown-nosing procedure...

195
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,949
whore,

196
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,784
treating patients
like guinea pigs.

197
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,486
I've been dishonest.

198
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,787
I've been arrogant. I've been...

199
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,955
Jump in if you disagree.

200
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,640
No, you've been a real schmuck.

201
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,664
I know...

202
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,778
but no more.

203
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,246
From now on,

204
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,480
the patients come first.

205
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,648
Trauma coming through!

206
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,150
Grandfather brought
him to the main entrance.

207
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,617
Paramedics bringing in two more.

208
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,652
I'll get Dr. Greene.

209
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,820
What happened?

210
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,821
On our way to school,

211
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,889
guy ran a red light.

212
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,890
Where's it hurt?

213
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:34,874
My leg.

214
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,075
Will he be okay?

215
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,076
Dr. Benton's the best.

216
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,110
What can I do?

217
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,445
Check Mr. Bowman's vitals.

218
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,631
I'm fine. I want to
stay with my grandson.

219
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,615
No, no, no, no. We
have to check you out.

220
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,817
It's okay. Carter, take him.

221
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,761
Why don't you come
with me, Mr. Bowman?

222
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,672
It's okay.

223
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,347
We'll take good care of him.

224
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,229
Freddie Robinson, 19, jackass.

225
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,830
Took out three cars
at Racine and Polk.

226
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,165
There's one fatality
on the scene.

227
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:00,266
We've pumped him

228
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,301
with two liters of saline

229
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,302
in the field.

230
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:03,369
Vitals?

231
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,505
Uh, BP 140, resp 22.

232
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:06,573
24.

233
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:09,342
BP's 140/100, pulse is 90.

234
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,376
It hurts.

235
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,611
Any meds?

236
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,613
Yeah, we found some
in the car. You got it?

237
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,814
I left them in the rig.

238
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:17,667
Well, why don't you go get them?

239
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,768
New guy, huh?

240
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,386
Hey, I'm a baby-sitter,
not a fireman.

241
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,888
I'm going to die.

242
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:23,238
One, two,

243
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,307
three.

244
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,875
I'll get him.

245
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,950
Let's get that O-neg down here.

246
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,115
Mr. Bowman,

247
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,716
you're not letting me finish
my physical examination.

248
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,151
I'm going to see my grandson.

249
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,886
Hey, Lydia, need any help?

250
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,087
Sure.

251
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,555
Take Mr. Phelps
to the bathroom...

252
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,723
and check the board!

253
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,659
My pleasure. Hi.
I'm John Carter.

254
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,827
All right, let's get
his clothes off.

255
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:45,828
Where is everybody?

256
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,829
Short-handed. Just us.

257
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:47,830
Here. Start cutting.

258
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,231
Well, it's hard to do my job

259
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,633
when I have to do
everybody else's.

260
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,868
So, you have noticed

261
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,069
that we do something
around here.

262
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,236
How is he?

263
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,672
Uh, did Carter check you out?

264
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,339
I'm fine. How's my boy?

265
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,741
I'm okay, Grandpa.

266
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,376
Sir, could you
wait outside for us?

267
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,744
I'm staying with my grandson.

268
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,779
It's okay.

269
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:03,779
How you doing, buddy?

270
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,965
My leg hurts so bad.

271
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:07,934
We'll get you something
as soon as we can.

272
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,886
Hurt that same knee

273
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,953
four months ago

274
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,388
playing basketball.

275
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,923
Jeanie, call up his old chart.

276
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,291
C-spine, chest and AP pelvis?

277
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,709
That's right.

278
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:17,710
Better add a femur film.

279
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,028
He's got a fracture.

280
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,262
Soft-tissue swelling.

281
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,364
He's got a big ecchymosis

282
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,032
of the left thigh.

283
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,633
I don't feel a fracture
but you're right.

284
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,634
It could be broken.

285
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,170
Doug, need your help.

286
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,404
Let's give him Toradol

287
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,228
after we clear the C-spine.

288
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,093
Barry Meeks, 8-years-old,

289
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:35,327
restrained in the back seat.

290
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,696
Car was T-boned.

291
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,497
Used the Jaws of
Life to cut him out.

292
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,665
BP's 60 palp.

293
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,233
Difficult airway.
Can't get a line.

294
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,734
I'll do a saphenous cut down.

295
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,269
He's bradycardic, 40.

296
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,038
.5 atropine. Get that
O-neg down here.

297
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,273
What's happening?

298
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,641
Nicole. Nicole, can you take her

299
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:49,876
to the waiting room?

300
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,977
Abdomen's rigid.

301
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,578
Damn. Could be
a ruptured spleen.

302
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,280
Lily, cut down tray,
Number 15 blade,

303
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:55,831
and a Kelly, please.

304
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,450
Need a cut down tray.

305
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,251
Check next door.

306
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,653
It hurts!

307
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:01,654
Hold still. Hold still.

308
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,789
What are you doing?

309
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:05,190
Is he the guy who got T-boned?

310
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,258
No, he's the T-boner.

311
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,560
Ran a red, decapitated
a pedestrian,

312
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,127
and smashed up our
other two customers.

313
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,128
Yeah, a real prince.

314
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,230
DPL's positive.

315
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,832
Okay, we'll take him to the O.R.

316
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,433
as soon as I do a central line.

317
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:15,434
Heart rate's up to 130.

318
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,518
It hurts!

319
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,620
Are you on any drugs?

320
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:18,821
No. I'm clean.

321
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,190
Track marks on the left arm.

322
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,059
Oh, here too.

323
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,327
I'm clean. I swear.

324
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,445
Yeah, right.

325
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:28,131
Okay, give him Narcan,
two migs, IV push.

326
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,898
I'm going to try
a straight blade.

327
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,901
Give me cricoid pressure.

328
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,470
How you doing, Doug?

329
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,471
Almost there.

330
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,140
Lily, give me an O-silk tie

331
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,941
and a 14-gauge
angiocath, please.

332
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,543
Here you go.

333
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,677
Are you in?

334
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,161
Yes.

335
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,313
I'll bag him.

336
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,614
Uh, Mark, guy's crashing in 2.

337
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,049
Doug, you okay?

338
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,250
Yeah, he's out of the woods.

339
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,652
Dropped his pressure,

340
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,953
just tubed him,

341
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,122
pumping in the O-neg.

342
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,757
How's it going?

343
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,225
Uh, swell.

344
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,594
First, coffee with Chloe, now
chest trauma with Freddie.

345
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,996
Sounds like a nice way

346
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,164
to start the day.

347
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,765
Oh, yeah.

348
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,100
I don't feel a pulse.

349
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,668
These chest films just came in.

350
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,970
Damn. Widened mediastinum.

351
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,710
Probably ruptured his aorta.

352
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:12,591
10 blade.

353
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,493
Oh, labs came back.

354
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,062
Coked up, blood alcohol .322.

355
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,264
Rib spreader.

356
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,383
Looks like Freddie had a party,

357
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,851
maybe his last.

358
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,253
Suction.

359
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,454
Man, that's a lot of blood.

360
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,706
Okay, I've got the aorta.

361
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,929
Clamp.

362
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,729
Two more units O-neg.

363
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,064
Got it?

364
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,566
Yeah.

365
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,117
Nice work, Susan.

366
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:39,885
Yeah, great.

367
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:42,360
I just saved the
life of a murderer.

368
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,009
And take a deep breath.

369
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,411
Um, you know what?

370
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,812
Um, I've had enough of this.

371
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,046
I've got a deposition.

372
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,247
I still hear wheezes.

373
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,916
I'd like to take a full history.

374
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,885
Well, okay, but if you can do it

375
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,887
in the time that it takes
me to get dressed,

376
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,121
you can be my guest.

377
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,423
Does asthma run in your family?

378
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,824
No.

379
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,209
Have you ever had
any other symptoms?

380
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,660
Coughing, difficulty breathing,

381
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,744
fatigue, weight loss?

382
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,246
Yeah, fatigue, you know?

383
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,899
But I mean, I've been up for
two days preparing for this brief.

384
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm concerned
about these attacks.

385
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,687
Look, um, I am up
for partner, okay?

386
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,740
One screw-up now, I'm finished.

387
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,575
You're here now. Why
don't you let me run

388
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,576
a couple of quick tests,

389
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,133
so you don't have
to come back, huh?

390
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,114
How long?

391
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,115
45 minutes.

392
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,483
Ugh. Uh...

393
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,685
I wouldn't feel right
about letting you walk out.

394
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,455
Okay, well, make
it snappy, okay?

395
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,556
We're lucky

396
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,824
the Bowman kid came in.

397
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,358
Why? What's he got?

398
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,626
No fracture.

399
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,961
What's that?

400
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,063
Looks like an osteosarcoma.

401
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,465
You have his old
chart and films?

402
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,956
Yeah. Here.

403
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,271
Mm-hmm.

404
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,506
There it is.

405
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,607
What?

406
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,975
The beginnings of a tumor.

407
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,376
No mention of it in his chart.

408
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,578
When was he brought in here?

409
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,912
November 20th.

410
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,113
No, they should
have caught this.

411
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,281
Who was the doctor?

412
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,606
Doug Ross.

413
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,890
There it is, right there.

414
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,158
Periosteal reaction.
He missed it.

415
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,559
Couple of millimeters.
Easy to miss.

416
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,994
We both see it.

417
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,195
Sure.

418
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,830
Today's x-ray tells
us where to look.

419
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,232
Okay, but you
can't change the fact

420
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,800
that he misdiagnosed the kid.

421
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:18,968
I'll talk to Doug.

422
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,169
Have you told the family?

423
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,170
No, not yet.

424
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,171
Good. Don't.

425
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,995
I'll take it from here.

426
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,310
John Carter?

427
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,334
In the drug lockup.

428
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,924
I'm in! I'm in! I'm in!

429
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:42,925
I knew you'd make it.

430
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,726
Yes! Are you off?

431
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,727
Yep. Come with me.

432
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,728
But you're not off.

433
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,796
We're going to celebrate.

434
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,598
I got one more
patient to get rid of

435
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,799
and then I can take lunch.

436
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,800
Where did you match, Carter?

437
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,801
Here.

438
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,802
Congratulations.

439
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,870
Labs on your asthma guy.

440
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,005
Uh-huh.

441
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,073
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

442
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,107
Damn.

443
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,141
Bad?

444
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,542
Ah, he's just gonna
need more tests.

445
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,743
I should do a blood smear.

446
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,279
I'll turf him to Hematology.

447
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,280
Give me five minutes.

448
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,647
Coming through!

449
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,816
Coming through!

450
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,918
Look out, we're coming through.

451
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,454
Ah...

452
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,088
Hugo's back for spring cleaning.

453
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,139
Oh, man!

454
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,140
Sores are infected.

455
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,441
Carol, I think it's your turn.

456
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:17,843
Uh-uh. I took that
crazy rabbit guy.

457
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:18,861
Haleh?

458
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,696
No way. I took the
guy with the maggots

459
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,930
last week.

460
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,415
Well, don't look at me.

461
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,550
Girls, girls,

462
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:26,218
there's plenty of
me to go around.

463
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,987
There's only one
way to settle this.

464
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,989
Ready?

465
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,890
One, two, three.

466
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:33,725
Best out of three?

467
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,544
Come on, guys.

468
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,346
Hey, Jeanie.

469
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,547
Yeah?

470
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,948
Hugo here needs
to be cleaned up,

471
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,216
and we're really busy down here.

472
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,973
Can you do it? No.
That's a nurse's job.

473
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:49,992
My mother was a nurse.

474
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,649
Great. That's great.

475
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,530
Ah, Dr. Lewis.

476
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,531
Yes?

477
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:56,732
Can you talk to that lady?

478
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,767
Who is she?

479
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,884
The mother of the junkie

480
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,419
that ran the red light.

481
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:01,621
Ma'am...

482
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,188
I'm Dr. Lewis.

483
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,491
Oh. You worked on my son?

484
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:06,792
Yes, I did.

485
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,261
They told me you saved his life.

486
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,463
Thank you.

487
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:12,664
Did they tell you what happened?

488
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,834
Yeah. Some idiot
crashed into him.

489
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,802
No. He ran a red light.

490
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:18,804
There were eyewitnesses.

491
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:20,873
Your son was under the
influence of alcohol and cocaine.

492
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,741
My son doesn't use drugs.

493
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,710
Tell it to the police.

494
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,744
The police?

495
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,380
Yeah. His tox
screen was positive.

496
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,765
You reported him?

497
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,400
It's required by the law.

498
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,968
The test was wrong.

499
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,169
Your son was drunk,

500
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,304
coked out of his mind,

501
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,572
got behind the wheel,

502
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,773
put three people
in the hospital,

503
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:38,846
and killed a little girl.

504
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,139
Dad, did you hear what I said?

505
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,173
Dad?

506
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,843
Oh, I'm losing
you. I'm losing you.

507
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,311
Can you hear me?

508
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:03,370
All right, well, you've got to
call me when you dock, okay?

509
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,653
A hematologist is gonna be down

510
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:09,054
in a few minutes.

511
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:10,656
He's gonna want to
run some more tests.

512
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,657
A hematologist? Yeah.

513
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:12,825
What is that?

514
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,993
It's a blood doctor.

515
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,611
Why do I have to see him?

516
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,848
You are severely anemic,
and we need to find out why.

517
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,498
I'm not understanding you.

518
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,501
Well, Dr. Berenson is
gonna explain it all to you

519
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,003
when he gets here.

520
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:26,622
All right. What is the
treatment for anemia?

521
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,674
I really couldn't tell you
without doing more tests.

522
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:31,160
Hold on a second.
How serious is this?

523
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,594
I wouldn't even hazard a guess.

524
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,763
Dr. Berenson is gonna
explain all this to you

525
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,964
when he gets here.

526
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,166
I've got another patient.

527
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,656
Excuse me.

528
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,103
All set?

529
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,104
Where are we going?

530
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,474
Surprise.

531
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,509
He came in for a sore knee.

532
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,979
Anyone could have missed that.

533
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:50,980
He could lose his leg.

534
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,481
Dr. Greene?

535
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,083
Dr. Ross?

536
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,650
Kathy Snyder, hospital counsel.

537
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,119
I asked her to come down.

538
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,587
So I guess I'm looking

539
00:17:58,611 --> 00:17:59,754
at my first malpractice suit.

540
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,956
Not necessarily.

541
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,057
It's my understanding

542
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,658
that the patient and his family

543
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,693
are unaware that the tumor

544
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,894
was visible on
the earlier x-ray.

545
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,895
Yes.

546
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,896
There's no legal obligation

547
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,186
to make them aware of it.

548
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,001
So we don't say anything?

549
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,135
What good will it do?

550
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,336
Will it change the treatment?

551
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,637
No.

552
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,572
You comfortable with that?

553
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,575
I don't see any
advantage in telling them.

554
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,683
There is none.

555
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,265
So, where's the kid?

556
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,067
He's been moved to Exam 4.

557
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,469
Does the grandfather
know about the cancer?

558
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,736
I haven't told them yet.

559
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,239
I'll do it.

560
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,273
That's not a good idea.

561
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:35,474
You should disengage
from the case.

562
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:37,193
Kathy's right,
Doug. I'll handle it.

563
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,450
My case, my responsibility.

564
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,600

00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:53,409

571
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,237
Oh, man.

572
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,889
Use a lot of soap down there.

573
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,124
I'm a mess.

574
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,093
Yes, you are. Scrub really hard.

575
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,895
When you're done,

576
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,496
we're gonna get you
some clean clothes.

577
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,448
Can I keep my lucky shoes?

578
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:19,317
If you use more shampoo.

579
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:20,519
We need a nurse in 2.

580
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:21,609
Aah!

581
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,759
Oh, I am so sorry.

582
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:30,128
They need the beds changed.

583
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:31,351
I'll be right there.

584
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,805
Hey. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

585
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:40,806
Yeah, I'm hiding out.

586
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,807
You want some juice?

587
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:42,808
Sure.

588
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:44,476
I hear you got in a slap fight

589
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,577
with a patient.

590
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,479
And lost.

591
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:48,480
Oh, man,

592
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:49,982
I just want this morning to end.

593
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,550
What happened with Chloe?

594
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:52,951
Oh, she wants to
play Mommy again.

595
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,019
I called my lawyer

596
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:55,804
and the police. Police?

597
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,639
Yeah. What if she
tries to take her?

598
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,708
I don't know. Maybe
I can buy her off.

599
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,677
Does she know that
you're adopting her?

600
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,278
No, and I'm not
going to tell her.

601
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,480
Wait a minute.

602
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,316
What?

603
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,384
I thought your eyes were brown.

604
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,686
Oh.

605
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,654
For 15 extra bucks,
they can be blue.

606
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,124
Does it look dumb?

607
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,177
No.

608
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:20,045
I like blue eyes.

609
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,514
Now what?

610
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:23,682
Oh, my God.

611
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,106
Call security to daycare.

612
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,121
Looking good, Hugo.

613
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,122
We'll call you a cab,

614
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,523
and they'll take
you to a shelter.

615
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:32,524
What about my shoes?

616
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:33,525
What about them?

617
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,592
I need some tape.

618
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:36,528
Oh. Here.

619
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,030
Patient in 3 needs a nurse.

620
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:39,364
I'm busy.

621
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:40,432
Excuse me. I need scissors.

622
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,466
This particular patient

623
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,500
is puking his guts out.

624
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,502
Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

625
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,104
Why don't you get
him an emesis basin?

626
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:47,105
That's a nurse's job.

627
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:48,307
Well, can you
find another nurse?

628
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,308
Excuse me. They're all busy.

629
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,375
Excuse me. What?

630
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:51,609
I cut my finger.

631
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:54,512
Oh, Hugo, you're
gonna need stitches.

632
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:55,836
That's a P.A. job.

633
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,321
Oh. Jeanie, Hugo. Hugo, Jeanie.

634
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,558
Watch it! Watch it!

635
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:08,827
Sir! Sir, please!

636
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,417
I need your help. Come on!

637
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,755
Where's Susie?

638
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,022
Calm down, Dr. Lewis...

639
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,825
Don't tell me to calm
down. Where is she?

640
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,115
She's taking her first steps.

641
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,899
I didn't want you to miss it.

642
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,684
Oh, yeah.

643
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,686
Susie.

644
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,354
Yeah.

645
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,591
Oh, yes!

646
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:40,792
Oh, yeah!

647
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,427
Oh! Oh!

648
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:44,796
Oh, that's my girl.

649
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,889
Oh, yeah, that's my big girl.

650
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,306
Mr. Bowman?

651
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,130
Can I see you out here, please?

652
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:01,580
Oh.

653
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,748
Dr. Ross, right?

654
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:04,550
You're the same one
who took care of Brett

655
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,352
when he was in here
a few months ago.

656
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:07,686
That's right. Yes, sir.

657
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,287
Uh, I'm afraid that
the news isn't good.

658
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,489
His leg is broken?

659
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:12,090
No. His injury alerted us

660
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:13,459
to a much more serious problem.

661
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,394
He has an osteosarcoma.

662
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,729
It's a bone tumor

663
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,964
in his leg, above his knee.

664
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,649
A tumor?

665
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,522
It's a form of cancer.

666
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,896
Oh.

667
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:37,816
Uh, how bad is it?

668
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,918
Well, we need to determine that.

669
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,754
There's an oncologist
on his way down here.

670
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,221
He's a friend of mine.

671
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,823
He's one of the
best in the country,

672
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:48,315
and he's had great success
with these kind of cases.

673
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,076
My boy has cancer.

674
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:12,784
We'll be leaving

675
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,386
as soon as we talk
to the oncologist.

676
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,809
Thank you.

677
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,000
Mr. Bowman.

678
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,715
Hi.

679
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,882
Did, uh...

680
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,218
Dr. Greene talk to you?

681
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,135
No. Dr. Ross.

682
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,438
Oh. So, um...

683
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,340
he explained the situation.

684
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:38,009
He did, but I don't understand.

685
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:40,378
Brett was in here
four months ago.

686
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:41,964
He was okay.

687
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:45,133
This cropped up so fast.

688
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,534
I'm sorry.

689
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,487
Um, what exactly
did Dr. Ross tell you?

690
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,529
That my boy has got cancer.

691
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,875
That is what we're
talking about, isn't it?

692
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,117
Yeah. Yeah.

693
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,841
Excuse me.

694
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,311
What's happening
with the Bowman case?

695
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,746
Excuse us.

696
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,915
Doug's handling it.

697
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,016
Well, I just got finished

698
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,083
talking to the
kid's grandfather.

699
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:20,218
Doug didn't tell him

700
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,286
that he missed the diagnosis.

701
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,754
Hospital counsel
advised against it.

702
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:24,389
You're not going to
tell them the truth?

703
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:25,857
It's not going to change

704
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,091
the boy's diagnosis,

705
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:28,326
and we're under
no legal obligation.

706
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,861
What about an
ethical obligation?

707
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,262
Peter, you are not
the original physician

708
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:32,764
on the case,

709
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:33,982
and you're not on it now.

710
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,184
They have a right to know.

711
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,318
It's none of your business.

712
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,258
We made a
decision. That's final.

713
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,356
Lucky the kid came in.

714
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,357
Can you take him, Frank?

715
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,424
I'd like to,

716
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,625
but they don't have insurance.

717
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,827
Why? Are they friends of yours?

718
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,028
No, they just need a break.

719
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,629
Well, sorry. There's
not much I can do.

720
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,664
Okay, well, I guess

721
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,266
I'm going to have
to send my referrals

722
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,600
elsewhere, then.

723
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,402
Doug, I didn't say I
didn't want to help.

724
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,603
How about waiving
your professional fee?

725
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:56,704
I could do that,

726
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,705
but the chemotherapy's
expensive.

727
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,706
Ballpark. How much?

728
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,975
12,000.

729
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,243
That doesn't cover surgery.

730
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,677
Okay, how about I give you 5000,

731
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,512
I work in your clinic
on my days off?

732
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,580
If you do this

733
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,982
for every patient
who needs a break...

734
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,683
Would you do it?
Would you do it?

735
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,886
Okay. One day a week.

736
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,953
Four to five months

737
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,288
ought to just about cover it.

738
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,858
Deal. Okay. Thanks.

739
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,459
Jerry, have you seen Susan?

740
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,626
Not for a while.

741
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,890
Hope nothing happened upstairs.

742
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,331
What's so funny?

743
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,833
Right after Jeanie
stitched up Hugo's finger,

744
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,201
he tripped on the way out.

745
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:27,435
Yeah?

746
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,460
Well, now she's got
to stitch up his head.

747
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,375
Susan...

748
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,843
is everything all right?

749
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,844
It's great.

750
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:36,845
What happened?

751
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:37,846
It's amazing.

752
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,981
What?

753
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,648
Susie took her first steps!

754
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,484
Two little steps!

755
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,807
Oh, you have crumbs.

756
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,445
Hazards of the hirsute.

757
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,938
Dr. Benton?

758
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,073
Yes?

759
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,508
I want to thank
you for everything

760
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:07,842
you've done for my grandson.

761
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,077
We'll be leaving

762
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,313
as soon as we talk
to the oncologist.

763
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,749
Well, good luck.

764
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,706
Thank you very much.

765
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,620
Mr. Bowman...

766
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,045
I think there's something
you should know.

767
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,194
Just follow my finger.

768
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:44,196
Okay.

769
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,764
Yep.

770
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:49,234
Extraocular
movements are intact.

771
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:51,036
We were dollying
in for a close-up

772
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,738
when we hit a sandbag.

773
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:55,741
Eyepiece smashed
right into my eye.

774
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:57,042
Oh, so you're a cameraman...

775
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,643
woman?

776
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,311
Director and producer
of infomercials.

777
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:01,713
You ever see

778
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,414
"30 Days to a Tighter Butt"?

779
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:06,140
No. Uh, missed that.

780
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:09,721
Hey, uh, can you
raise your eyebrows?

781
00:27:09,745 --> 00:27:11,356
Smile.

782
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,080
Nice teeth.

783
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:16,978
Cranial nerves are intact.

784
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,848
You ever do any modeling?

785
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,150
Me? No.

786
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,401
Been on camera?

787
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:26,121
You made that teaching
video a few years back.

788
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,556
Yeah, well, I'm, uh...

789
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,025
the star of "How to Intubate."

790
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:33,928
So, you do have
on-camera experience.

791
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,085
Oh...

792
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,965
I'll just take a quick look

793
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,923
at the other side here.

794
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,140
Where in the hell is he?

795
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,341
Who?

796
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,775
Who? The damn medical student.

797
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,776
Carter.

798
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,777
Yeah, Carter.

799
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,979
He has kept me waiting here

800
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,014
for two hours.

801
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,415
Now, I would like
my test results.

802
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,749
Okay. Please calm down.

803
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:55,950
I'll page Dr. Carter.

804
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,286
Fax this to my office.

805
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,610
The number is on the top.

806
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,322
Dr. Ross?

807
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:19,090
Oh, yeah. Good news.

808
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,309
I spoke to the oncologist.
He can take care of Brett.

809
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,493
You missed it

810
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:24,437
and didn't have the
decency to tell us.

811
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,058
I'm sorry.

812
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,559
No, you're not.

813
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:41,985
You're trying to cover your ass.

814
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,470
At least let me

815
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,655
set the oncologist
up with Brett.

816
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,313
I don't want you near my boy.

817
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,829
Hi.

818
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,798
Sorry, I don't have
anything on me right now.

819
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,355
Uh, catch you later?

820
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,821
Your CT looks normal.

821
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:40,988
Ooh.

822
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,557
Ooh, is that my brain?

823
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,591
Yes, it is.

824
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,626
How's it look?

825
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,760
Perfect.

826
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,196
So, have you thought
about my offer?

827
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,548
Yes, and your project
sounds intriguing.

828
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:52,650
Well, we'll discuss
it over dinner.

829
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:54,469
What do I have to do?

830
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,737
Just be yourself.

831
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,141
You'll be a spokesperson
for a new FDA-approved drug.

832
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,475
What sort of drug?

833
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,177
A more potent
version of minoxidil.

834
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,345
For high blood pressure?

835
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,379
Yeah, that's the one,

836
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,530
but we're more interested

837
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,404
in promoting it for
male pattern baldness.

838
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,219
I see. Uh...

839
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,854
You know, I thought...

840
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,255
I mean, I read somewhere

841
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,725
that women find
baldness a sign of virility.

842
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:17,908
Oh.

843
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,110
Who told you that?

844
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,183
Some bald guy?

845
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,501
Hugo needs a ride
back to the shelter.

846
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,769
Call him a cab.

847
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,103
Jerry's got vouchers.

848
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,171
That's a nurse's job.

849
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,573
I'm on a break.

850
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:32,874
Hugo will wait.

851
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,375
The nurse will
be right with you.

852
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,581
I wait here the whole damn day

853
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,183
and all you can
say is you're sorry?

854
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:42,217
I have your tests.

855
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:43,552
I called in a hematologist...

856
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:44,886
See, now, that is exactly

857
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,088
what the damn
medical student said

858
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,473
three hours ago.

859
00:30:48,497 --> 00:30:50,341
Now, this had better
be worse than anemia.

860
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:51,476
I'm afraid it is.

861
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,911
Mr. Ledbetter,

862
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:56,203
your blood smear shows evidence
of acute myelogenous leukemia.

863
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,718
What?

864
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,904
We need to admit
you to run more tests.

865
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,639
Is there anyone I should call?

866
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,408
Excuse me. Mr. Ledbetter?

867
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,465
Your office just
faxed this over.

868
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,424
To the future.

869
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,892
To surgery.

870
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,782
To my future in surgery!

871
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,065
Ah.

872
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,200
Do you realize

873
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,536
that you're taking a bath

874
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,170
with one of the most
sought-after residents

875
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,205
in the country?

876
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,441
I have goose bumps.

877
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:40,542
So I see.

878
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:42,977
Is that you?

879
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,078
Not me.

880
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,515
Oop...

881
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,172
Oops.

882
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,124
Where is it?

883
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,558
10-year-old girl,

884
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,727
fell off a balance beam

885
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,894
and hit her neck.

886
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,429
Her throat's too
swollen to tube her.

887
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,863
Vitals? Get them right.

888
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,582
BP's 70/50.

889
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:05,816
Pulse thready at 180.

890
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,884
Cyanotic.

891
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:07,885
How's the air exchange?

892
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:08,886
Bad. She's hard to ventilate.

893
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,904
Damn it, her IV's infiltrated!

894
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,905
I thought you got it!

895
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,274
I did!

896
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,875
Gonna need an
airway. I'll tube her.

897
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:14,876
All right.

898
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,316
What do we got?

899
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:19,497
One, two...

900
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,099
Buckle my shoe and kiss my ass.

901
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:22,516
Haleh, get me a
pertrach kit, please.

902
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,719
Why don't you move over
and let the nurse do that?

903
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:25,703
I can get it.

904
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:27,121
I said, let the nurse do it.

905
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,155
Take your beef outside.

906
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,391
Why don't you go with him?

907
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,759
I've done more of these.

908
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,195
Sterile gloves, please.

909
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,914
You hand him
those sterile gloves,

910
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,248
and you're both out of here.

911
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:38,883
Give me that.

912
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,240
Thank you.

913
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:45,707
Okay. You ready?

914
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,510
Trach tube introducer.

915
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,978
Okay. Bag her.

916
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,562
Look, the family
had a right to know.

917
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:52,814
You're right, Peter.

918
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:53,881
Look, you made a mistake.

919
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,483
Why don't you just own up to it?

920
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,419
Why don't you just
get out? Settle down.

921
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,821
Peter, Doug can handle this.

922
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:00,845
Go on.

923
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,180
Go on.

924
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,441
Jerry...

925
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:22,109
I think I was paged.

926
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,812
Mm-hmm. Indeed you were.

927
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,680
Four times from Dr. Lewis,

928
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,449
twice from Dr. Hicks,

929
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,450
and twice from Hematology,

930
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,218
and from Morgenstern,

931
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,321
a congratulatory
basket of muffins. Oh.

932
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,990
Dr. Morgenstern leave a note?

933
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,124
Carter!

934
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,326
Where the hell have you been?

935
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,394
Lunch.

936
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:40,595
For three hours?

937
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,296
Long lunch.

938
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,132
Well, you left
Mr. Ledbetter waiting.

939
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:45,116
I'll go see him now.

940
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,151
Don't bother.

941
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:47,385
I admitted him
upstairs with leukemia.

942
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:48,553
Leukemia?

943
00:33:48,577 --> 00:33:49,970
I didn't think it
was that serious.

944
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,189
Yeah? What are you, first year?

945
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:52,374
He had low crit

946
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:53,374
and fatigue,

947
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,575
and you didn't work him up?

948
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,411
Is that alcohol on your breath?

949
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,746
It's champagne.

950
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,748
From your mom and big Roland.

951
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,133
Carter, I've been paging you

952
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:04,335
for the last three
hours. Sorry, Dr. Hicks.

953
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,587
Well, you're in luck.

954
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,421
I have an emergency
appendectomy in 10 minutes.

955
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,661
Kindly scrub in.

956
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,095
Dr. Hicks.

957
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,230
Dr. Hicks.

958
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:16,797
Dr. Hicks,

959
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,366
I better think I not...

960
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,567
I think I, uh, better not.

961
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,568
Why?

962
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,769
Well, I went out to lunch

963
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,837
to celebrate

964
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,372
and had a little champagne.

965
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,907
You drank during rotation hours?

966
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,076
Uh, yeah.

967
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,512
It's bad enough you failed
to answer your pages,

968
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,848
but the use of alcohol on call

969
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:34,932
is inexcusable.

970
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:36,201
I'm sorry.

971
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:38,787
It's grounds for expulsion.

972
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:40,855
But...

973
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,330
But I just matched!

974
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,032
Another basket of treats

975
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,401
for our fallen med student?

976
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,769
I'm afraid so.

977
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,571
Look, I'm gonna have
to beg off for tonight.

978
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,839
Our friendly in-house attorney

979
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,640
wants me to file
an incident report.

980
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,242
I was thinking
about canceling too.

981
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,444
No, don't. You go.
Have a good time.

982
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,228
Don't let that
goatee go to waste.

983
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,949
Did you hear about
him and Benton?

984
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:09,984
Hear about it?

985
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,419
I saw them
practically duke it out

986
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,420
in the Trauma Room.

987
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,688
Benton's right.

988
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:16,056
If it were my kid,
I'd want to know.

989
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,825
Thanks.

990
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,894
Carter?

991
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,429
You got another basket.

992
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,097
Leave it outside.

993
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,766
Hmm. What have we got?

994
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,034
Paté, smoked oysters,

995
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,771
pickled quail eggs...

996
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,324
You all right?

997
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:36,399
I really screwed up.

998
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,631
I neglected my patient,
got really out of control.

999
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:42,167
What you did was
incredibly stupid

1000
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:44,318
and you're in big trouble,

1001
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,837
but Hicks can't expel you

1002
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:47,371
without an
administrative hearing.

1003
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,723
Will I lose my match?

1004
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,658
I don't know.

1005
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,682
Oh, God!

1006
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:55,513
I'll see what I can do.

1007
00:35:57,172 --> 00:35:59,917
The note says, "Love,
Nana and Poopie."

1008
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,473
Hey, Carol.

1009
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,474
Yeah?

1010
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,475
I need some help.

1011
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,676
What is it?

1012
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,077
My partner backed over a bum

1013
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,601
in the parking lot.

1014
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,350
Are you okay, sir?

1015
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,484
I didn't see you.

1016
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,785
I'm sorry. Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1017
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,287
Hugo, are you all right?

1018
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,355
What happened?

1019
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,889
I was fixing my shoe.

1020
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,658
You forgot to call me a cab.

1021
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,825
Oh, God.

1022
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,026
He was sitting on the curb

1023
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,094
and I didn't see him.

1024
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,163
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1025
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,498
Listen, just stay out here

1026
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,966
and don't hurt anyone else.

1027
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,167
Cut the kid some slack, Shep.

1028
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,191
Come on.

1029
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,269
It looks like a
fractured tib-fib.

1030
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,438
My friends were right.

1031
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:11,672
This is a dangerous place.

1032
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,040
Oh, Hugo, I am so sorry.

1033
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,241
Me too. It's our fault.

1034
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,576
Go check on your partner.

1035
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,745
We'll take care of Hugo.

1036
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,636
Hey, and go easy on him.

1037
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,255
I told you not to say anything.

1038
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,757
Yeah, well, I didn't
agree with that.

1039
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:30,958
No, you took it upon yourself

1040
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,059
to tell the family,

1041
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,260
the ramifications of which

1042
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,261
affect Doug, me,
your colleagues,

1043
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,329
and the entire hospital.

1044
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,398
Look, if Ross had
caught it four months ago,

1045
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,999
that kid might not
be losing his leg.

1046
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,200
Now, don't you think the family

1047
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,385
had a right to know that?

1048
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:42,936
That wasn't your
decision to make.

1049
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,522
Oh, so I tell the truth and
what, break some kind of code?

1050
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,825
This isn't about truth
or any kind of code.

1051
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,777
This is about your
guilty conscience.

1052
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,061
You didn't have the guts

1053
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:52,380
to speak up about Vucelich,

1054
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,803
so you blow the whistle on Doug.

1055
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,601
The truth is a
lot easier to tell

1056
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,665
when it's not your
own career on the line.

1057
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,208
Hey, where's your partner?

1058
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,177
The moron?

1059
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,413
He's upstairs drinking cocoa.

1060
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,781
You really shouldn't
ride him so hard.

1061
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,385
The department
throws me a rookie.

1062
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,253
I guess it's their
way of punishing me.

1063
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,990
They giving you a hard time?

1064
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,258
They say

1065
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,860
they would have
done the same thing.

1066
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,194
You don't believe them?

1067
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,463
What are they supposed to say?

1068
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,353
Nobody blames you, Shep.

1069
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,669
I led Raul into that fire.

1070
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,138
You saved three kids.

1071
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,628
And I killed my best friend.

1072
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,607
Hey. How's it going?

1073
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,188
Uh...

1074
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,757
I saw 48 kids that day.

1075
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,292
That's about 12 minutes a kid.

1076
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,661
I only gave the Bowman kid

1077
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,129
about 10.

1078
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,720
I guess I should have
given him a couple more.

1079
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:20,968
Benton was out of line.

1080
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,838
He just told the truth.

1081
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,262
Now you have to pay for it.

1082
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,500
No, it's the kid who
has to pay for it.

1083
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,658
How you doing?

1084
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:07,698
Oh.

1085
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:08,832
Excuse me.

1086
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:10,034
I'm sorry.

1087
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:11,269
I think I lost my contact.

1088
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:12,370
Dr. Greene?

1089
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:14,072
Kathy?

1090
00:40:14,096 --> 00:40:15,773
What are you doing here?

1091
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:16,874
Uh...

1092
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:18,642
same as you, I suspect.

1093
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,311
Hi.

1094
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,680
Here, let me help you.

1095
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,282
Don't move.

1096
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:26,784
Are you sure it's
not still in your eye?

1097
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:28,052
Uh, I don't know.

1098
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,542
Open wide.

1099
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,796
You have one blue
eye and one brown.

1100
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,445
Yeah, well, for 15 bucks,
they throw in the tinted pair.

1101
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,414
I need my glasses

1102
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,016
if I'm going to find this.

1103
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,851
Um, do you have lens insurance?

1104
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,452
No.

1105
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,210
Well, then, we'd
better keep looking.

1106
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,960
This is so embarrassing.

1107
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,116
Wait. Don't move.

1108
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,622
It was caught in your goatee.

1109
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,703
Yeah.

1110
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,705
Thank you.

1111
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,776
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

1112
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,544
You want some smooshed carrots?

1113
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,580
I have to talk to you.

1114
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,748
There's nothing more to say.

1115
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:15,950
Can't I just look at her,

1116
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,350
please?

1117
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,886
Stay away from us.

1118
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,121
Oh, she's so beautiful.

1119
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,322
She's so big.

1120
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,824
Is she crawling yet, or...

1121
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,092
Chloe, I mean it.

1122
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,493
I know I can't change
what's happened,

1123
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,096
but let's not fight, okay?

1124
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,798
I saw a lawyer today.

1125
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,089
She said I could file
for visitation rights.

1126
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,305
I'm adopting her.

1127
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,962
No...

1128
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,761
She is my baby, Susan,

1129
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:46,330
and I want her back.

1130
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,016
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1131
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,135
Hi. Hi.

1132
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,336
Soup of the day to go.

1133
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,793
Sure thing.

1134
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,975
Hey, Peter.

1135
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,745
Hey.

1136
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,479
Rough day.

1137
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,016
You did the right thing.

1138
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,350
Yeah, well,

1139
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,619
not according to everybody else.

1140
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,856
I broke the code.

1141
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,392
You okay?

1142
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,651
It's kind of like that
Boys Club camp.

1143
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,369
Did my mother tell you
everything about me?

1144
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,393
You were what, 12?

1145
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,041
10.

1146
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,542
Yes, 10.

1147
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,111
She said a kid ripped
off the equipment fund,

1148
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,546
showed you the money,

1149
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,048
you turned him in...

1150
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,449
Yeah, and nobody spoke to
me for the rest of the summer.

1151
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,907
I thought they broke your nose.

1152
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,855
I told her I took a curve ball.

1153
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,013
She knew.

1154
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:13,790
Yeah, well, I guess
you never learn.

1155
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,111
"Good night, room.

1156
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:27,915
"Good night, moon.

1157
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,382
"Good night,

1158
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:33,187
"cow jumping over the moon.

1159
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:37,390
"Good night, air.

1160
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:41,862
"Good night, bears.

1161
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:46,233
"Good night, chairs.

1162
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:50,170
"Good night, stars.

1163
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:54,230
Good night, noises everywhere."
