1
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,618
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:26,519
Grab a bite. He's not here yet.

3
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,521
Of course not. Why
would Ross be on time?

4
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:29,656
Neal...

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,858
He puts a kid in an
unsecured news chopper,

6
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:34,261
and the hospital's going
to give him an award.

7
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,362
Neal, face it.

8
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:36,696
Ross is a bona fide hero.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,065
He's brought terrific
press to the hospital,

10
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,268
and the board wants
to acknowledge that.

11
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,869
Well, why don't
they ask him to stay?

12
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,271
Why do I have to do it?

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,905
Because you're the
one who fired him,

14
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,707
a fact the board is
none too happy about.

15
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:49,291
Is there any more cream cheese?

16
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,245
Sorry I'm late.

17
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:54,948
Please. Sorry to
drag you out so early.

18
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,316
Um, juice? Bagel?

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,717
No, I just ate.

20
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,975
Have a seat.

21
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,725
Got your tux ready for tonight?

22
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,861
I'm renting one.
Mine's still drying out.

23
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:09,996
It's going to be quite a gala.

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,531
We've got two aldermen coming,

25
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,333
so be prepared for pictures.

26
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:14,968
I've asked Mark
to be the presenter.

27
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,136
Demi Moore wasn't available?

28
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,657
You jest, but the truth is

29
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,415
we're all proud of you, Doug.

30
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,897
All of us.

31
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,297
Yes.

32
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,068
So much so, we want
to extend your fellowship

33
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,136
for another year.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,638
Uh, well, who would
be my supervisor?

35
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,473
Him.

36
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,862
Hope you'll stay, Doug. We'd
hate to lose you in the ER.

37
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,230
Well, uh, thanks,

38
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:46,733
but being as I
thought that I was fired,

39
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:49,836
I have taken another
position at a private practice.

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,537
I know. We'd like you

41
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:53,322
to reconsider that decision.

42
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,690
Wouldn't we, Neal?

43
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,093
Yes, indeed, we would.

44
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,353
You going to stay?

45
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,554
You need to know now?

46
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,589
Pretty soon.

47
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,790
Well, can I have

48
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,326
four extra attending
shifts a month?

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,128
I could use the extra dough.

50
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,196
Possibly.

51
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,831
How about Saturday nights off?

52
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,232
Don't push your luck, pal.

53
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:10,700
You think I'm kidding.

54
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,002
Ah, mail, from your
newfound fans...

55
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,205
Mostly female,
by the handwriting.

56
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,873
Ah, the wages of heroism.

57
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,242
And we got a marriage
proposal on the fax.

58
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,311
Does it include a
bank statement?

59
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,196
Morning. I'm Dr. Carter.

60
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,398
You must be... Ramiro.

61
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,767
Uh, Wilbur. That's
my American name.

62
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,768
I pick it.

63
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:29,870
Interesting choice.

64
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:32,088
I understand your
face feels funny.

65
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,489
The right side.

66
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,458
Yeah? Can you
show me your teeth?

67
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,459
How about those?

68
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,827
I can't.

69
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,978
No?

70
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,147
Can you squeeze
your eyes really tight

71
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,782
for me like that?

72
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,252
What was that?

73
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:49,155
She, uh, thinks you're
too young to be a doctor.

74
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,289
Ah, thank you.

75
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,308
You speak English?

76
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,476
She don't, but I do.

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,744
Okay.

78
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,564
You have an inflammation
of the facial nerve,

79
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,749
also known as Bell's Palsy.

80
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,150
It's not serious.

81
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,319
<i>No es serioso.</i>

82
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:09,241
Uh, she still doesn't
think you're a doctor.

83
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,249
Well, tell her in four
months, I will be.

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,823
We want to see a real doctor.

85
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,875
I haven't seen the schedule.
Am I working Thanksgiving?

86
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,876
No.

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,978
Cool.

88
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,645
But I need you to
work tomorrow night.

89
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,247
Uh, I haven't found
a night nanny yet.

90
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,116
I can't keep covering
nights for you.

91
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,717
I did four in a row last week.

92
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,819
Yeah, you're right.
You've been great.

93
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,820
I appreciate it.

94
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,689
I'll figure something out.

95
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,790
Peter?

96
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,214
Yeah?

97
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,929
I thought Zeidenberg
was covering the ER today.

98
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,930
Schedule change. Why?

99
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,131
I'm supposed to spend the day

100
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,933
with the surgeon on call
to practice my suturing.

101
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,535
If it's a problem...

102
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,921
It's not a problem for me.
Is it a problem for you?

103
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:55,938
No. All right.

104
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,562
Knee lac in bed 5.

105
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,462
Hey, Hathaway.

106
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,031
Hey, what do you got?

107
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,666
Apparent suicide attempt.

108
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,869
Brother found her next to
an empty bottle of Tylenol.

109
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,070
What's her name?

110
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,338
Julia.

111
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,572
Okay.

112
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,842
Hey, Jerry, could you
go find Greene, please?

113
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,843
Vitals?

114
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,210
She's normal.

115
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,514
Hey, listen. I got the
number of that roofer for you.

116
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:22,882
Oh, great. Thanks.

117
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,118
I hear you bought yourself
a real money pit, Hathaway.

118
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:26,385
Yeah? Where did you hear that?

119
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,054
Tylenol OD? Yeah.

120
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,457
How much did you
take, Julia? Huh?

121
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,960
When did you
take it, sweetheart?

122
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,561
She hasn't said a word.

123
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,814
We need an acetaminophen
level, liver-function tests,

124
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,984
gastric lavage, 50
grams activated charcoal.

125
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,252
Coming up.

126
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,455
Is she going to live?

127
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,456
Yeah.

128
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,458
Haleh?

129
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:49,492
Come on, hon.

130
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,616
You want something to eat?

131
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,598
♪ Rule, Britannia ♪

132
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,100
♪ Britannia rules the waves ♪

133
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,912
Good morning.

134
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,080
Oh!

135
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,316
I see you're making
yourself at home.

136
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,550
I hope you don't mind.

137
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,519
I find having a few
knickknacks around

138
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,053
makes a room more cheerful.

139
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,756
So, you're feeling fatigued?

140
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,757
Uh-huh.

141
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,758
Aah.

142
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,493
A bit fatigued, I'm afraid.

143
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,995
I was hoping you
could give me something

144
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,697
to put me back on my feet.

145
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,831
Any fevers? Colds?

146
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,099
Hmm-mm, neither one.

147
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,934
Any headaches? Vomiting?

148
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,935
Oh, um, no.

149
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,937
A bit short of breath.

150
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,739
Are you on any medication?

151
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,240
No. No, not a drop.

152
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,778
Oh, listen to that
poor little lamb.

153
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,281
Hmm...

154
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,283
I want to x-ray your chest

155
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:51,370
to rule out pneumonia,
and do a blood test, okay?

156
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:54,774
Ah, tea time, is it?

157
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:57,293
Well past, I'm afraid.

158
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,733
Set up an albuterol nebulizer.
Let's get a pulse ox right away.

159
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,867
What do you got?

160
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:05,868
Asthma attack.

161
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,053
He can't breathe.

162
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,054
Respiration's 40.

163
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,055
Dusky nailbeds.

164
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,156
He's cyanotic.

165
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,325
Let's start a low flow O-2.

166
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,126
I got him here
as fast as I could,

167
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,744
but he got worse on the bus.

168
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,746
What's his name?

169
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,730
Alan.

170
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:18,831
All right, Alan. Here, buddy.

171
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,166
Now, I need you to take
a deep breath on this.

172
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,201
It's okay. It's all right.

173
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,905
This medicine is going
to help you breathe.

174
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:27,072
Okay? Here we go.
Take deep breaths.

175
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,073
What's the pulse ox?

176
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,075
87.

177
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,075
Is that bad?

178
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,677
About what I expected.

179
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,479
There you go. There you go.

180
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:37,249
Nice and slow. Slow,
slow deep breaths.

181
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:40,519
Mrs. Corvalan, I
spoke to a doctor,

182
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,956
and he agreed
with my evaluation.

183
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,540
This is a prescription.

184
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,543
Follow up in the
clinic in five days.

185
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,935
You're welcome.

186
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,369
It's not going in.

187
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,604
She's biting the tube.

188
00:07:58,628 --> 00:07:59,872
Julia, you can't bite the tube.

189
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,890
We need to put

190
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,008
the charcoal in your belly

191
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:04,643
to clean out your
stomach... oh! Oh!

192
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,446
All right, that's it.
Restraints! That's it.

193
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,847
Settle down. Don't
make it even harder.

194
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:08,848
Tie her hands down.

195
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,016
Julia, if you don't stop,

196
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,234
I'm going to have to put
a tube down your nose,

197
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,836
and you're really
not going to like it.

198
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,037
Ow! She's pulling the tube out.

199
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,022
Damn it!

200
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,407
All right, nasogastric tube.

201
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,271
More charcoal? Good idea.

202
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:22,628
I know.

203
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,980
I'm sorry I have to do this.

204
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,132
I know.

205
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,167
Malik, come hold her head down.

206
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,136
I need a new cath-tip syringe.

207
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,972
Here you go.

208
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:33,973
We're in.

209
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:35,091
50 grams.

210
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,227
Do we have a washcloth?

211
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,762
All right. Okay.

212
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,364
It's okay.

213
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,466
The worst is over. I know.

214
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,568
God, I hate this.

215
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,637
It's okay.

216
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,093
Shh...

217
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,260
Hey, Hathaway, I
love your new scrubs.

218
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,494
Yeah, right.

219
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,730
Let me know when
her level comes back.

220
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:58,731
Okay.

221
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,033
She put up a fight, huh?

222
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:01,567
Yeah, she was really serious.

223
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,985
That's really the
exception, you know?

224
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,188
Most of these girls, they're
just looking for some attention.

225
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,241
Yeah, they have a
fight with their folks

226
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,659
or their boyfriend,

227
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:10,860
swallow five pills
instead of two,

228
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,844
and then call 911.

229
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:12,845
Yeah. I mean, come on.

230
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,247
If you really want
to kill yourself,

231
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:15,264
forget about pills.

232
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,133
Get yourself a straight razor.

233
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,135
You find that artery.
You slice right on up.

234
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,803
You'll be dead in a minute.

235
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,239
Pills are for people
who don't really mean it.

236
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,074
I really meant it.

237
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,165
Yeah, right.

238
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,458
She's kidding, right?

239
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,246
Mom, it's not a
money kind of favor.

240
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,448
I was hoping you and Dad

241
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:51,517
could look after
Susie tomorrow night.

242
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,185
Uh, about 8:00 a.m.

243
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,021
Yes, it would mean she
would have to sleep there.

244
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,390
Jerry, we get an
acetaminophen level

245
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,025
on that suicide attempt?

246
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,360
No, I'll call the lab.

247
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:04,029
I need to get on there
when you're done.

248
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,531
I'm... done.

249
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:06,866
Yeah? Thanks.

250
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,034
What time you
getting off tonight?

251
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,369
About 6:00.

252
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,204
Do you want to have dinner?

253
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,405
Oh, I got a presentation.

254
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,574
It's not till next week,

255
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,241
but I haven't even
started preparing for it...

256
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,409
Hey, Carter,

257
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,211
did you work up this
kid with facial paralysis?

258
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,396
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

259
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,564
No. See ya.

260
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,900
Bye. Uh, yes, I did.

261
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,602
Kid had Bell's Palsy.
Classic presentation.

262
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,737
Okay. No vesicles
or sores in his ears?

263
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,906
I don't think so.

264
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,990
You're not sure?

265
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,792
I'm pretty sure. Why?

266
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:35,495
Well, The vesicles indicate
Ramsay Hunt syndrome,

267
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,296
which could infect the brain.

268
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,165
I wasn't looking for vesicles.

269
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:42,068
If you think you missed
him, I would call his folks,

270
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:44,053
get him in here, and make sure.

271
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,555
Yeah. Mom, yeah.

272
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:46,722
I know how you are

273
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,724
when you don't get enough sleep.

274
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,059
Okay, okay. Bye.

275
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,261
So much for Ozzie and Harriet.

276
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,596
Any other ideas?

277
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,264
Uh, call in sick.

278
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,632
I'm kidding.

279
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,117
Just kidding.

280
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,752
Here, Julia. If
you need anything,

281
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:01,454
you just press
this button, okay?

282
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:04,089
Carol?

283
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,424
Level's back?

284
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,260
480.

285
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:09,928
Wow. She must have
swallowed two bottles.

286
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:12,331
She could be in
line for a new liver.

287
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:15,100
Start Mucomyst. 12
grams through the nose.

288
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,436
Let me know when
her LFTs come in.

289
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,771
Contact her folks?

290
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,973
Don't have a number,
and she won't talk.

291
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,441
Have you seen her brother?

292
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:23,598
Not I.

293
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,164
Open your mouth. There you go.

294
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,499
Now you're getting
the hang of it.

295
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,135
Pulse ox is up to 98.

296
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,303
You had me scared
there for a while.

297
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,972
Any idea how this happened?

298
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,473
Granny's got a collie.

299
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,808
Let me see this.

300
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,309
Okay, Mrs. Almont.

301
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,911
Alan's going to be fine.

302
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,378
Does he live with you?

303
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,515
No. Just visiting for the week
while his folks are out of town.

304
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,118
Well, if he's going to
be staying with you,

305
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,320
then you're going to
have to get rid of the dog.

306
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,922
You're the doctor
who was on the TV.

307
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:53,923
Yes. That's me.

308
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,625
You gonna be okay, sugar.

309
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,960
That's the doctor

310
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,778
from the TV.

311
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,797
Doug?

312
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,998
I talked to the boy's HMO.

313
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,000
They want him to go
to their Urgent Care.

314
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,001
Where?

315
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,235
Oak Park.

316
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,703
That's ridiculous.

317
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,105
This kid was in acute
respiratory distress.

318
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,307
I'm not going to send him
all the way across town.

319
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,925
His pulse ox is up to 98.

320
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,661
And I want to make
sure it stays that way.

321
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:16,662
There.

322
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:17,997
"Pulse ox 89?"

323
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,499
Tell his HMO that,
they'll let him stay.

324
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:23,703
What's going on?

325
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,905
Dr. Ross, I'm not going to
fudge with my nursing notes.

326
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:26,906
Nobody's asking you to.

327
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,307
When this chart
comes up for review,

328
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,508
there's going to
be a discrepancy.

329
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,866
I'm not sending him out.

330
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,469
Do you know why she did it?

331
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,473
My mom died in a
car accident last May.

332
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,142
Might have
something to do with it.

333
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,126
She and Julia were close?

334
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,361
Not really.

335
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:52,048
Does Julia get along
with your dad okay?

336
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,650
He ain't around.

337
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,318
Works a lot?

338
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,820
He just can't deal with stuff.

339
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,490
I don't think he likes
being in the house.

340
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,568
Do you have a
phone number for him?

341
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:14,709
Yeah.

342
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:22,461
Somewhere.

343
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,832
No, no, no, no, señor,
señor. Es muy importante, uh,

344
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:28,167
por tu wife telefono mio.

345
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,003
Dr. Carter, County ken-e-ral.

346
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:33,172
Oka..? Hello? Hola?

347
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:34,173
Hel...

348
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,942
No, no, no, no, no.

349
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:37,476
What was that all about?

350
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,445
Oh, I might have missed
a diagnosis. Ramsay Hunt.

351
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:40,746
You forget to check the ears?

352
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,748
No, no, I checked, but I
wasn't thinking Ramsay Hunt,

353
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,150
so I didn't really look for it.

354
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:45,151
Pretty big miss.

355
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:46,652
Bring him back and make sure.

356
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:47,987
A lady with chest pain,

357
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,989
history of lupus
and renal failure.

358
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,724
Benton said you should take it.

359
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,748
Don't miss anything.

360
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,532
Oh.

361
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,534
Your x-rays are back.

362
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:04,092
Shh.

363
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,373
Poor dear was exhausted.

364
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:08,791
Your lungs look fine.

365
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,177
Oh, would you?

366
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,495
Oh, uh, sure.

367
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,580
Thank you, love.

368
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,415
Oh, yeah.

369
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,250
I have another cup.

370
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,753
Oh, no. I'm fine. Thank you.

371
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,427
Do you work with children?

372
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,096
Yes.

373
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,266
I raised three right
here in Chicago.

374
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,270
Of course, they grew up
and made me obsolete.

375
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,273
Are you looking for work?

376
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,008
Well, yes, actually.

377
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,193
Work nights?

378
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,528
Mm-hmm.

379
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,063
Pour it through the
strainer, if you would, please.

380
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,087
Oh.

381
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,389
Chuny, can I not
read your writing,

382
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:57,723
or is that a "98"?

383
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,157
That's a "98."

384
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,192
So you wrote down

385
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,561
this asthmatic
kid's pulse ox as 98,

386
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,431
and five minutes later,
Doug noted it "89."

387
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:06,932
Did he crash?

388
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,434
He didn't crash.

389
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,236
Could this be a case
of numerical inversion

390
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,905
due to temporary dyslexia?

391
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,774
I don't know, I'm just a nurse.

392
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,341
So I'm correct in deducing

393
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:18,444
that there's an
inconsistency here?

394
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:19,445
Looks that way.

395
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:20,979
Someone made a mistake?

396
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,421
I didn't make a mistake.

397
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,007
Thank you.

398
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,457
Give me a sec.

399
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:32,625
Carol.

400
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:33,793
Yeah?

401
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,294
Look, I'm really sorry

402
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,597
for being a jerk
back there before.

403
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:38,965
I mean, I didn't know.

404
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:41,467
Look, it's no big deal.
Don't worry about it, really.

405
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:42,702
No, it is to me.

406
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,536
Can we get together later

407
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,371
and have dinner, go
to a movie, something?

408
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,830
Look, I'm busy, but
I'll call you, okay?

409
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,743
I don't hear anything unusual.

410
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,078
Temp's normal.

411
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:56,081
Mrs. Briggs, sit tight.
We'll be right back.

412
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:59,985
Let's order a CBC,
Chem-7, ABG, EKG,

413
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,489
chest film, abdominal series,
uh, anti-DNA, anticentromere,

414
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,326
antiphospholipid
antibody, cryoglobulins...

415
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,494
Whoa! That's going
to be $2,000 right there.

416
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,330
Mm-hmm. I don't
want to miss anything.

417
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,332
Because she's
Vucelich's patient?

418
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:15,000
She's Vucelich's patient?

419
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:18,003
Better get a cardiac
echo too. And a CT.

420
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,005
260? Good job, Alan.

421
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,340
Doug?

422
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:23,608
Let's get one more
neb treatment,

423
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:26,145
and then I'll okay
him for transfer. Okay?

424
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,314
Doctor? Thank you so very much.

425
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:29,648
You're very welcome.

426
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,483
You want to fill me in?

427
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,252
The kid had a bad asthma attack,

428
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,619
and his HMO wanted
him transferred.

429
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:36,555
So you falsified his
chart to keep him here?

430
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,556
That sounds about right. Yes.

431
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,623
It's illegal.

432
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,960
Well, should I put him
on a bus to Oak Park?

433
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:42,361
No. You should have come to me.

434
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:43,562
I could have called his HMO

435
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,864
and backed you up,

436
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:48,451
But now when they see
this, they're not going to pay.

437
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,836
There's no way
I can justify a lie

438
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,421
on a medical record.

439
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,022
We're just going
to have to eat it.

440
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,291
Good. Eat it.

441
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,626
You know, I can't
keep banging heads

442
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,295
with you every other day.

443
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,597
It's just too much work.

444
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,832
If you're going to stay
here and work for me,

445
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,884
this cowboy crap
has got to stop.

446
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,721
Stay here and work for you...

447
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,690
Now, there is an
attractive prospect.

448
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,758
Is that what this is all about?

449
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,728
You can't take the
fact that I'm your boss?

450
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,129
That's typically
narcissistic of you, Mark.

451
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:20,955
I can't take the fact
that anyone is my boss.

452
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,964
I need to speak to
your sister alone.

453
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,301
Okay.

454
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,590
How are you feeling?

455
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:45,925
Okay.

456
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:47,982
These have to stay on?

457
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,156
We took some new tests.

458
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:04,109
One of them was
a pregnancy test.

459
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:08,681
It came back positive.

460
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:10,004
You knew that.

461
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,109
Did that have something
to do with taking the pills?

462
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:19,641
You know, sometimes
keeping things inside

463
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,978
makes them seem worse
than they actually are.

464
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,769
You don't know.

465
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,154
I know about wanting to die.

466
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,945
I took a bunch of
pills a year ago.

467
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:48,654
I loved my mom.

468
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:54,660
When she died, it's like
everything fell apart...

469
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:58,063
and Kyle was a mess.

470
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,633
At night, I'd hear him crying,

471
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:08,340
like when he was little...

472
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,245
We never meant for it to happen.

473
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:18,584
I only went in to hold him
until he stopped crying,

474
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,508
and now I'm pregnant.

475
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,076
It's okay.

476
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,411
Hmm-mm.

477
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:43,842
Man, if I'd had
recommendations this strong,

478
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,977
I could have gone to
an Ivy League school.

479
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,078
Recommendations?

480
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,880
Yeah. This patient of
mine. She's a nanny.

481
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,116
Her agency just faxed them over.

482
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,817
Her name's not Ransom, is it?

483
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:53,818
Yeah.

484
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:54,819
Ooh. I wouldn't be counting

485
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,788
on any long-term commitments.

486
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:57,789
Oh, no!

487
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,057
Oh, no.

488
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:00,058
Heads up.

489
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,060
I got it.

490
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,629
51-year-old male, vitals normal.

491
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,731
Involved in a Civil
War re-enactment of...

492
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,165
Battle of Malvern Hill.

493
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,900
Took on Lee,
Magruder, and Stonewall.

494
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,102
Two-ton cannon broke
loose, rolled over his toe.

495
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,605
Damn artillery sergeant.
Ought to be court-martialed.

496
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,275
Let me take a
look. Oh... oh, yeah.

497
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,176
That is pretty smushed up.

498
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,444
What's open?

499
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,679
Trauma 1.

500
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:23,047
It was musket butt to
bayonet all morning.

501
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:27,252
The damn rebels were thicker
than fleas on a dog's back.

502
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:29,488
Hi.

503
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,207
She told you.

504
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,509
Kyle, whatever your sister
told me is confidential.

505
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,710
I'm not free to discuss it.

506
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,112
She told me she told you.

507
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,049
We're going to do everything
we can to help you guys, okay?

508
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,167
Oh, man, she did tell you!

509
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:43,501
Kyle...

510
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,904
When my dad finds
out, he's going to kill me!

511
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,173
I mean kill me, man!
He carries a gun!

512
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,208
Kyle, I'm not going to
tell your father anything

513
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:52,010
you and your sister
don't want him to know.

514
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,411
I'm not waiting
around to find out,

515
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:54,512
you know what I'm saying?

516
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,048
Kyle!

517
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,332
Ay-yi-yi.

518
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,868
You wanted to
practice your suturing?

519
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:00,969
Here's your man.

520
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,404
Turned 25 years old today.

521
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,873
Celebrated by drinking
himself into a stupor

522
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,208
and walking through
a plate-glass window.

523
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,177
It's a two-man
job. Carter will help.

524
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,579
Okay, let's get
the chest films first,

525
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,880
and then the echocardiogram.

526
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,682
I'll have Carter meet
you in the suture room.

527
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,868
I got a heart and a spleen
waiting for me upstairs.

528
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:17,269
Can you give me
two minutes, please?

529
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:18,270
Carter? What?

530
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:19,488
What the hell are you doing?

531
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,489
Nothing.

532
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:21,690
She came in with a history

533
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:22,691
of lupus and renal failure

534
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,159
and complained of chest pains.

535
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,811
I'm working her up.

536
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,034
Carter, come.

537
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,469
Excuse me.

538
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,939
Carter, only an idiot
would order that many tests

539
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,274
for chest pain.

540
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,709
I'm trying to be thorough.

541
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,078
She's Dr. Vucelich's patient.

542
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,079
You're kidding.

543
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,080
No.

544
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,081
Oh, damn.

545
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,082
Dr. Benton...

546
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,350
Oh, God.

547
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,653
Tell me, did you order
these labs on my patient?

548
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,154
Dr. Vucelich, I apologize.

549
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,023
I left my student
unsupervised...

550
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,925
No, no, I take
full responsibility.

551
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,961
Dr. Benton had absolutely
nothing to do with this.

552
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,497
Fine. Then you're
the one I should thank.

553
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:02,931
Thank?

554
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,701
The test for anti-phospholipid
antibodies was positive.

555
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,703
Miss Briggs has a very
serious blood disease,

556
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,771
and we need to put her
on heparin right away

557
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,006
and get her upstairs.

558
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,042
So, tell me, what was
your thinking, son?

559
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,777
Actually, there was very little.

560
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,913
Miss Briggs has a
very complex history,

561
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,115
so I took a... shotgun approach.

562
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,182
Come on.

563
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,183
Don't underestimate
yourself, mister...?

564
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,184
Carter.

565
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,185
Carter. Yes. That's right.

566
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,286
Given the circumstances,

567
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,055
your approach was
valid, more than valid.

568
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,057
Not that I advocate
indiscriminate testing.

569
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,425
No need to run Chem-20s

570
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,360
on every runny nose
that walks in, right?

571
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,497
But... when someone has
a constellation of problems,

572
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,732
you can't hold back.

573
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,133
Remember that, Benton.

574
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,134
Good work, son.

575
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,468
Thank you. Thank you.

576
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,872
Oh, by the way, I'm
doing a fem-pop bypass.

577
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,707
You want to assist?

578
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,509
Go, Carter.

579
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,811
So you're familiar
with the procedure?

580
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:50,846
Fem-pop bypass?

581
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,614
Yeah. How many have you done?

582
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,450
Mrs. Ransom?

583
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,186
Oh...

584
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,189
I must have drifted off.

585
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,109
Oh, did you get my references?

586
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,477
Oh, yes. Yes.

587
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:08,363
Very, very impressive.

588
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,032
Oh, thank you.

589
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,035
Uh, you know, I was
thinking that, um...

590
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,636
I could drop around tonight

591
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,873
and make it a little less
intrusive on the little one.

592
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,993
Mrs. Ransom, we need to
talk about your blood tests.

593
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:22,894
Your red and white cells

594
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,530
and platelet count
are extremely low,

595
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:29,001
which is suggestive
of aplastic anemia,

596
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,336
which is very serious.

597
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,309
Perhaps you could,
um... give me a few pills.

598
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,094
You know, pep me up.

599
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,182
Mrs. Ransom, your condition
is most likely terminal.

600
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:46,518
You need to be
admitted to the hospital

601
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:47,936
for a bone marrow biopsy.

602
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,203
Oh, pish-posh.

603
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,357
Not another one
of those. Hmm-mm.

604
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:53,642
You've had one?

605
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,127
Yes, months ago.

606
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:58,179
Most unpleasant.

607
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,265
Have you been
getting transfusions?

608
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:03,835
Oh, from their description,
they are simply ghastly.

609
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,072
No, no, no. I would rather
just carry on and, uh...

610
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:08,979
you know, hope for the best.

611
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:19,167
I, uh... I could come around
about, uh, 7:00 tonight if...

612
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,536
that's convenient with you.

613
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,440
Mrs. Ransom, your
disease has reached a stage

614
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,959
where you can't work anymore.

615
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:30,384
You need to be
admitted to the hospital.

616
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:35,100
I think, uh...

617
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:39,226
I'm the better judge
of that, don't you?

618
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,347
Hmm?

619
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:58,523
Oh, man, that smarts.

620
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,192
You've avulsed most of the skin

621
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:01,693
off the top of your big toe.

622
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:04,029
Just saw it off and
throw it in the basket.

623
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:05,831
I need to get back to the field.

624
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:08,566
Amputation isn't necessary.

625
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,452
I just launched a countercharge
at Jackson's center.

626
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,121
Damn cannon came off the blocks.

627
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,289
Are you General Grant?

628
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,458
No. Grant wasn't
at Malvern Hill.

629
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,360
Major General Fitz-John Porter,

630
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,778
tactical genius...

631
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:24,282
Used the 5th Corps to
outflank two rebel divisions

632
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,668
and drive them back
across the Chickahominy.

633
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,287
I'm going to have
to rongeur the bone.

634
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:30,221
Let's get Mr. Richter
some lidocaine.

635
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:31,590
Oh, no, no, no. Ether.

636
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:35,893
That's all Porter had
when they cut off his leg.

637
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,695
Mr. Richter, we
haven't used ether

638
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,531
as an anesthetic
in over 40 years.

639
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:41,517
Lidocaine, two
percent digital block.

640
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,151
Just give me a
bullet to bite on.

641
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,553
We may be out.

642
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,021
I got it.

643
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,178
Psst.

644
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,678
Can we send out a private
to round up some bourbon?

645
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,480
Mr. Richter, we're fresh out

646
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:56,848
of privates as well.

647
00:25:56,872 --> 00:26:00,184
I'm about to use this tool

648
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:03,021
to grind down the
bone in your toe.

649
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:06,858
I highly recommend that
you take the lidocaine.

650
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:09,961
Not as long as I'm in command.

651
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:14,388
Go to it, surgeon.
Do your stuff.

652
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,519
Saw your sister
Jackie last week,

653
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:35,921
near the State
of Illinois building.

654
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:39,257
She was buying a
Polish dog from a vendor.

655
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:43,295
Don't think she saw me.

656
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,297
She's supposed to be on a diet.

657
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:47,949
Uh-oh, busted.

658
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,183
She works near there.

659
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,818
Thought she worked at
the Botanical Gardens.

660
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,354
Used to.

661
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:56,958
Always wanted to work outdoors.

662
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,727
She's allergic to pollen.

663
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,061
You're kidding.

664
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,298
So they put her in

665
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,233
this little room
with no windows.

666
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,623
And a plastic plant.

667
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:10,777
Probably.

668
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,849
She told me she saw you.

669
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,806
Didn't tell me about
the hot dog, though.

670
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,393
I'm Richard Kazlaw.

671
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,230
I was told you have
my daughter Julia here.

672
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,999
Mr. Kazlaw, I'm Dr. Greene.

673
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:38,834
Julia tried to kill herself.

674
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,335
The good news is she's okay.

675
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,586
Where is she?

676
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,872
She's actually in with the
social worker right now,

677
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,591
and you can see her
when they're done.

678
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:49,428
Um, if you could just
fill out this paperwork.

679
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:52,580
Consent form,
that sort of thing.

680
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,432
High-speed motorcycle collision.

681
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,767
Victim 1 complains
of abdominal pain.

682
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,403
BP in the field of 80/50.

683
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,637
Repeat BPs came up with...

684
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:01,672
Head trauma,
non-responsive, GCS seven,

685
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:03,108
possible tib-fib fracture.

686
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,109
Wearing a helmet?

687
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,343
No. Neither of them.

688
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:08,146
Let's get a CBC,
dip a urine for blood,

689
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,849
get X-ray to run the spine...
Cervical, thoracic and lumbar.

690
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:14,786
Chuny, see if he's oriented.

691
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,787
What's your name?

692
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:17,155
Tom Spagnoli.

693
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:18,323
What's the date?

694
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:20,925
November something.
My stomach's killing me.

695
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,244
He's got a tire track
on his belly here.

696
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,412
Bowel sounds hypoactive.

697
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,780
Possible intra-abdominal
hemorrhage.

698
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,781
DPL?

699
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:27,832
No, he's got a scar.

700
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:29,634
I had an operation
when I was a kid.

701
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:30,635
Laparotomy?

702
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:31,853
Okay, we can't lavage him.

703
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,322
Let's call CT. Tell
them to hold a table.

704
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,323
Let's get a Foley in.

705
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,324
He opened his eyes.

706
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,159
All right, Jimmy,
can you hear me?

707
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,894
Do you know where you are?

708
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,162
Responds to pain. Otoscope.

709
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,964
Moves extremities times four.

710
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,466
No obvious paralysis.

711
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,385
Get C-ray, cross table C-spine.
He's got blood in the canals.

712
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,403
Ross has X-ray.

713
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,072
Fundi normal.

714
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,907
Disks are flat.

715
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,090
Maybe it's just skull fracture?

716
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:54,692
I'm worried about
the blood in his ears.

717
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:56,294
Call CT. Tell them
to hold a table.

718
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,718
Dr. Ross is holding already.

719
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:02,400
What do you got?

720
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,069
Tire mark across the
belly, bruising, tenderness.

721
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,205
He's got a lap scar,
so I can't DPL him.

722
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:08,206
I'm sending him to CT.

723
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,207
Rebound, guarding?

724
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,375
Little bit.

725
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,843
My kid's got blood in the canal.

726
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,044
He's sicker, so he'll go first.

727
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:15,046
Hold on. This kid could
have a ruptured spleen.

728
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,047
What's his crit?

729
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,048
Forty-two.

730
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:20,351
It's normal. He can wait.

731
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:25,256
Lateral C-spine is
next. Set up suction.

732
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,681
Ophthalmoscope.

733
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,399
Pupils are fine. No papilledema.

734
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:35,466
There's blood in the canal.

735
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,535
Otoscope.

736
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,136
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

737
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,337
This kid has a skull fracture,

738
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,639
not an intercranial bleed.

739
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:42,840
You're way out of line,
Doug. Go back to your patient.

740
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,042
My patient is going to CT.

741
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,043
No, he's not.

742
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,444
This kid is going to CT now.

743
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,046
Fine. Then mine's
going to the O.R.

744
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,047
for an exploratory lap.

745
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:50,148
Like hell he is.

746
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:51,949
You are not putting a
patient under the knife

747
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,552
just to try and win
a pissing contest.

748
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:54,752
You're damn right I'm not.

749
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,354
I'm doing it so he
doesn't bleed out

750
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,372
while you tie up the
CT for a skull fracture.

751
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,540
Go home!

752
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,042
What?

753
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,544
I'm taking over your patient
and writing you up. Go home!

754
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,746
Let's get a portable
ultrasound in here.

755
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,882
Check out the belly.
Let's go! Come on!

756
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,685
So that's why she
swallowed two bottle of pills.

757
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,020
Yeah. Awful.

758
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,722
He was forcing
himself on his sister?

759
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,157
No. The way she tells it,

760
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,893
it came out of grief
over losing their mother.

761
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,228
She went in to comfort him,

762
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,080
and they ended up
sleeping together.

763
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,981
And now she's pregnant. Ooh.

764
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,451
Can I help you?

765
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:27,590
Sir?

766
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:33,357
What?

767
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:38,196
The name on the consent.

768
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,753
Oh, God.

769
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,736
It appears that your
father may have overheard

770
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,272
two of our staff members
discussing your case.

771
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:51,008
Oh, man.

772
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,144
He's going to kill me.

773
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:55,413
Do you really think
that he might hurt you?

774
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,948
Yeah.

775
00:30:56,972 --> 00:31:00,017
Someone's going to
stay with you at all times.

776
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,620
I'm afraid that we didn't
handle this very well,

777
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:05,657
but we're going to make
sure you guys are okay.

778
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,492
Tony's going to stay with you.

779
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,427
Lydia, Carol...

780
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:13,453
You have no idea how sorry I am.

781
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,787
It's stupid to talk
about it out in the open.

782
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:19,954
Really stupid.

783
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,856
Let's put protecting
patient confidentiality

784
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,958
on the agenda for
tomorrow's staff meeting.

785
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,559
Right. I got the
girl an ICU bed.

786
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,061
We should move her upstairs.

787
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,297
Alert security just in
case there's trouble.

788
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,298
Okay.

789
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,699
Hey, Dr. Ross, your tux came in.

790
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,201
Oh, great, Jerry, thanks.

791
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,036
Uh, wait, that's Dr. Greene's.

792
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,037
Okay.

793
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,405
Ready for your big award?

794
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,640
Yeah, I can't wait.

795
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:39,641
Doug, you got a sec?

796
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:40,997
No.

797
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,012
Hey, Dr. Ross. Phone for you.

798
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,013
Who is it?

799
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,014
Your father.

800
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,181
Who?

801
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,650
He said he was your dad.

802
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:52,220
Hello?

803
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,476
Uh-huh.

804
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,223
Fine.

805
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,060
No, you...

806
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:03,765
yeah, this isn't a good
time, so... yeah, I got to go.

807
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,734
Mm-hmm, yeah, here's fine.

808
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,857
Bye.

809
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,809
I thought he and his
father didn't speak.

810
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,211
As far as I know, he hasn't
seen or heard from him

811
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,479
since he was 12.

812
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,665
This is going to be
an interesting evening.

813
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,416
One more.

814
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,753
All right, last one.

815
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,254
Nice.

816
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,589
Fun.

817
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,591
I like the staple gun.

818
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,592
Hey, hey.

819
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,927
Hey, guys.

820
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,095
Carter, how was surgery?

821
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,930
Incredible. Watching
Carl anastomose

822
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,565
is truly a humbling experience,

823
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,167
and I got to hold
the bulldog clamp,

824
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,769
and I got it on tape in
case you want to see it.

825
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,770
Pass.

826
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,139
No? No.

827
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,474
I'll get some Xeroform
dressings for our birthday boy.

828
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,578
Bye. Bye.

829
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:51,128
Hmm...

830
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,263
very attractive.

831
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:53,264
Carter...

832
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:54,298
And smart, too.

833
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:55,533
And available.

834
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,534
She's married. No, she's not.

835
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,735
Yes, she is. No, she's not.

836
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,753
What are you talking about?

837
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,937
She told me she was divorced.

838
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:04,142
So, listen, if it's okay,

839
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,594
I finished my notes
on your patients.

840
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,029
I'd like to take off.

841
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,764
Is that okay?

842
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,483
Yeah, yeah, Carter, go.

843
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:14,023
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

844
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,011
How's it going, huh?

845
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,413
Yeah.

846
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,586
That's right.

847
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:33,337
Please tell me he's your father.

848
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,338
He's my father.

849
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,573
Thank God.

850
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,177
He showed me an
expired driver's license.

851
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:41,512
Dad, what are you doing here?

852
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,347
Oh, I was in the neighborhood.

853
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,683
You were?

854
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:46,785
Your mother and I had
a slight disagreement

855
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,253
about the responsibilities
of being a grandparent.

856
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,521
I'm here to apply

857
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,423
for the job of night nanny.

858
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:55,176
What did Mom say?

859
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,511
Use your imagination.

860
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,114
I'd have to come
to your apartment.

861
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,681
I mean, I will...

862
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,218
If you want me to.

863
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,886
Really? You'd do that?

864
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,446
I should have done
it a long time ago.

865
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:17,064
Uh,<i> veinte,</i> 20,<i> veinte minutos.</i>

866
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,733
Right, okay.

867
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:19,900
You taking off?

868
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,069
Yeah. I got to make
a run to Humbolt Park.

869
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,171
Yeah? What for?

870
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,972
I had a kid this morning
with facial paralysis

871
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,374
which I diagnosed
as Bell's Palsy,

872
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,676
but might have missed
vesicles in his ears

873
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,044
that suggest Ramsay Hunt,

874
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,712
and it's been driving
me crazy all day.

875
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,115
So I guess this is a no,
then, to my dinner offer?

876
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,952
Uh, well, would you be
paying for this dinner?

877
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,143
Actually, I thought I'd
be cooking this dinner.

878
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,959
Know your way
around Humbolt Park?

879
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,016
I can read a map.

880
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,011
Mr. Kazlaw?

881
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:02,014
Mr. Kazlaw?

882
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:07,098
I took care of your
daughter today, Mr. Kazlaw,

883
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:11,202
and I feel terrible because
you overheard something

884
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:14,605
you didn't want or
need to hear right now.

885
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,774
I'm so very sorry.

886
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:19,444
I don't know what to do.

887
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:21,045
There are people
here who can help you.

888
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,109
You should talk to some...

889
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:29,109
Take this, please.

890
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:44,068
No sign of him?

891
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:45,236
Nope.

892
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,239
Isn't this dandy?

893
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:49,807
Give him five more minutes.

894
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:50,875
If he doesn't show,

895
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,777
we'll make some
sort of an excuse.

896
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,512
Say he's out scouring the sewers

897
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:57,537
for lost kids and stray pets.

898
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:01,440
Are you Dr. Greene?

899
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:17,434
You're missing a really
bad chicken dinner.

900
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,937
Shh, I'm shooting.

901
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:22,095
Nah, now you see? You jinxed me.

902
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:26,126
Hey, Mark. You want
to hear my speech?

903
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,599
Ladies and gentlemen,

904
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:36,537
thank you all very much
for this tremendous honor.

905
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,007
I want to take this opportunity

906
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,809
to acknowledge
some of my colleagues.

907
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:47,848
First, David Morgenstern
for his stalwart support.

908
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,318
One minute he's stamping
my walking papers,

909
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:54,055
and the next, he has
his face so far up my butt

910
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,160
if he had a mustache,
it would tickle my throat.

911
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,362
Let's not forget Neal Bernstein,

912
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,265
Neal, proof that any
idiot who can nod his head

913
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,802
can rise right to the
middle of pediatric medicine,

914
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:10,338
and last, and
definitely not least,

915
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,362
Mark Greene...

916
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:20,982
Mark the self-righteous
shall-inherit-the-ER Greene.

917
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:28,795
Mark the I-am-behind-you-110%
but-you-are-out-of-here Greene.

918
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:38,349
Thank you, kiss my ass,
good night, God bless.

919
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:39,550
What do you think?

920
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:41,385
This how you want
to end your career?

921
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:45,523
Can you think of a better way?

922
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:47,358
What'd your father want?

923
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:49,026
You got me.

924
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,561
I'll tell you something, though.

925
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:51,862
I bet he'll get a kick

926
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:53,531
out of what I'm about to do.

927
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:57,368
Don't do it, Doug.
It's a big mistake.

928
00:37:57,392 --> 00:38:00,337
Well, you know what
my father always said?

929
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,673
If you're going to
make a mistake,

930
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,398
make it a big one.

931
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:11,282
Still sewing.

932
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:14,207
Thanks for teaching
me the staple gun.

933
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:19,212
Well, good night.

934
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:25,918
Why didn't you tell
me you were divorced?

935
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:32,769
Separated.

936
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:36,073
We haven't had many
conversations lately,

937
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,298
at least not civil ones.

938
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:46,417
Peter...

939
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:48,719
Al and I had a lot of problems

940
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,445
that had nothing to
do with you and me.

941
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,720
Good night.

942
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:11,775
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

943
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:16,280
I had no idea you
were this neurotic.

944
00:39:16,304 --> 00:39:18,983
Coming all the way out
here to check a kid's ears?

945
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,885
Listen, I thought you
came out to support me,

946
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:21,952
not to ridicule me.

947
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:23,954
Yeah, but ridiculing
you is so much more fun.

948
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:25,912
This is it, 218.

949
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:31,295
Hey, your first house call.

950
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:34,999
Hi, hi... hey, Wilbur,
how's it going?

951
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:36,534
You messed up, huh?

952
00:39:36,558 --> 00:39:38,808
Well, we'll soon find
out. Let's take a look.

953
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:42,028
That's one down.

954
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:45,076
Two down.

955
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,077
All clear?

956
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:47,211
All clear.

957
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:48,479
You done?

958
00:39:48,503 --> 00:39:50,414
I'm done. Thank you,
and I'm really, really sorry

959
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,322
to bother you at home.

960
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,940
It was no surprise to me
to see Doug Ross on TV

961
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,176
sloshing around in
the freezing water

962
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,311
trying to save a kid in trouble,

963
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,681
because, in a way, that's
what he does every day.

964
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:12,286
I don't know any doctor who
cares more for his patients.

965
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,355
I'm proud to present this award

966
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,524
for outstanding
community service

967
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:24,187
to a great pediatrician and
a great friend, Doug Ross.

968
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,699
Thank you.

969
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,184
Uh, I'd like to take this
opportunity to single out

970
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:47,588
a few people who have
influenced my career

971
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,924
for better or worse...

972
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,727
but I guess you all
know who you are

973
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,230
and how I really feel about you,

974
00:40:56,254 --> 00:41:00,367
so perhaps the
less said, the better.

975
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,470
I...

976
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,672
thank you for this.

977
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,061
Thank you.

978
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,465
It's scary to think
that in four months,

979
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:15,766
I'm going to be a doctor.

980
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,967
I'm not going to have Residents

981
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,337
looking over my shoulder,
checking my mistakes.

982
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,838
It's an awesome responsibility,

983
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:22,673
if you think about it.

984
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,342
Do we have to talk shop?

985
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:25,376
What?

986
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,377
I'm sorry.

987
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,545
I just hate to think

988
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,347
that medicine's all
we can talk about.

989
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:31,182
No, we can talk
about something else.

990
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:32,517
Good.

991
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,685
Great. You first.

992
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,809
No, you go first.

993
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:46,430
Did you do that

994
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:48,454
because you couldn't
think of anything?

995
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,236
Well, at least take your hands

996
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,180
out of your pockets
and do it right.

997
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:14,291
Not thinking about doing
anything rash, are you?

998
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:15,592
You mean like this?

999
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,362
Whoa, what are you, crazy?

1000
00:42:18,386 --> 00:42:21,231
Those awards really bounce.

1001
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:22,454
Must be acrylic.

1002
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:26,236
Thanks for the speech.

1003
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,239
Thanks for not
giving your first draft.

1004
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:31,375
Oh...

1005
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:33,711
I'm an idiot.

1006
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:35,680
You have your moments.

1007
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:39,016
You know why my old
man called me today?

1008
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,617
Because he saw me on TV.

1009
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:46,023
I haven't heard that
voice in 22 years.

1010
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:47,847
Son of a bitch.

1011
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:53,064
The scary thing is

1012
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:54,765
I'm doing a pretty
good imitation.

1013
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:57,068
He never kept a job
more than two years.

1014
00:42:57,092 --> 00:43:01,238
Most of the time,
it was two weeks.

1015
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,708
He had a nasty
habit of getting drunk

1016
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:06,543
and punching out his boss.

1017
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,946
Maybe it's just me,

1018
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,184
but I take a dim view of
that particular approach.

1019
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,626
Yeah... yeah.

1020
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,295
So I still have a job?

1021
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:26,853
If you still want it.

1022
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:34,171
Damn it! Aw, damn!

1023
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:38,642
Damn it!

1024
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,310
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

1025
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,713
What are you doing up there?

1026
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:44,849
I'm destroying your roof.

1027
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,852
Oh, that's great.
That's just what I need.

1028
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,988
No, seriously, I saw
some of these rotting tiles,

1029
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:53,590
and I figured I'd
start pulling them off,

1030
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,493
and I sincerely think
I've ruined your roof.

1031
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,550
Well, stop.

1032
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:01,365
Oh, my God.

1033
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,601
I know, I know.
This is horrible.

1034
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:07,204
I figured I could save you
some money on roofing.

1035
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,405
I'm sorry.

1036
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:10,007
About what?

1037
00:44:10,031 --> 00:44:13,232
Putting a really
big hole in my roof?

1038
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:17,714
The roof, the mouth...

1039
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,852
whatever odious behavior
I'm about to commit.

1040
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:24,188
All of it.

1041
00:44:24,212 --> 00:44:25,577
I'm sorry.

1042
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:29,860
Ah, look, I shouldn't
have made you

1043
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:31,361
feel stupid this morning.

1044
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:33,530
Hey, I did that all on my own.

1045
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:37,367
No. I blindsided you.

1046
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:41,872
Well, that's true.

1047
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:45,876
Look, about what you said today.

1048
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,180
Actually... it doesn't
matter to me.

1049
00:44:49,204 --> 00:44:51,015
You know, I mean...

1050
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:53,505
I don't think any less of you.

1051
00:44:58,012 --> 00:45:01,058
Most of all...

1052
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:05,417
I'm really glad
that it didn't work.

1053
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:11,991
Me too.
