1
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,164
Yeah.

2
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,765
Uh-huh.

3
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,501
Yeah, that's not a problem.

4
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,502
We'll take care of it.

5
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,636
What's your ETA?

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,904
Okay. No problem.

7
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:28,905
Have you seen Dr. Lewis?

8
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:29,972
Suture Room.

9
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,341
Baby coming in,
respiratory arrest.

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,298
They're five minutes out.

11
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,690
Susan...

12
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,714
Susan.

13
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,844
Oh. Uh...

14
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,779
turn off the
overheads, would you?

15
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,381
We've got an infant on
the way. Unresponsive.

16
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:55,382
The lights.

17
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:56,583
They'll be here soon.

18
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,584
Okay.

19
00:00:57,608 --> 00:00:58,585
You up?

20
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,603
Mm-hmm.

21
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:00,604
You sure?

22
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,572
Yeah.

23
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,908
Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,710
Susan?

25
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,978
Yeah. I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

26
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,402
Oh...

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,319
<i>top on, lock it in again,</i>

28
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,887
<i>and open this. You see this?</i>

29
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,471
<i>Top of the key...</i>

30
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:53,495
<i>He shoots and he...</i>

31
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,061
<i>This is Melody. Melody?</i>

32
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,097
<i>Those Indians,</i>

33
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,164
<i>were they pretty
close behind you?</i>

34
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,633
<i>No. You're wrong, Dr. Welby.</i>

35
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,602
<i>Nadine's going to recover.</i>

36
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,936
<i>Yes, she will recover,</i>

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,538
<i>but you must be
aware of the fact</i>

38
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:09,806
<i>that there was damage.</i>

39
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,023
<i>Damage can be corrected.</i>

40
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,425
<i>Nadine is strong.
She always has been.</i>

41
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,444
<i>I know what she can do.</i>

42
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,979
<i>She's going to
make a full recovery.</i>

43
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,136
<i>I'll make sure of that.</i>

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,664
You used to like her.

45
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:35,832
No, I didn't.

46
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:36,967
Yeah, you did.

47
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,134
Before Rodman

48
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,336
you used to talk about her

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,470
all the time.

50
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,938
What have you got for us, Sarge?

51
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,706
Responded to a
domestic violence call.

52
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,141
Boog was out in the street

53
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,078
buck naked, waving
a gun, screaming.

54
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,080
We're going to need a light.

55
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,081
He shoot someone?

56
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,382
Nah, he ran inside,

57
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,584
slipped on the stairs, and
passed out drunk as a skunk.

58
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,619
Man...

59
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,820
you better not have dragged us

60
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,022
out of a nice, warm firehouse

61
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,756
for a booking check
on a drunk, Sarge.

62
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,015
Bunch of jelly-doughnut-
eating<i> pendejos.</i>

63
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:05,996
Hey!

64
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,530
Dumb and Dumber.

65
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,732
Nobody got you out of bed

66
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,650
for that piece of crap.

67
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,237
We got you out of bed for them.

68
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,295
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

69
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,974
Welcome to Calcutta.

70
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,602
Twenty-two children,

71
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:36,603
ages six months

72
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:37,803
to nine and a half years,

73
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,405
found in a single
apartment on Calumet.

74
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,508
Malnutrition, suspect marasmus,

75
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,676
kwashiorkor, who
knows what else.

76
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,911
Northwestern took
four, Mercy took three,

77
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:46,912
and we got the rest.

78
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:47,913
Where are their parents?

79
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:48,914
Nobody knows.

80
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:49,949
Children and Family Services?

81
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:50,950
Yeah, they're on their way.

82
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,352
The cops took
custody of the kids.

83
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,353
They arrested some guy

84
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,554
who claims to be the uncle.

85
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:56,156
Yeah, so he says.
Of all of them?

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,757
I've got a toddler in 2.

87
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,159
How many you seen so far, Doug?

88
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:00,293
Four of them.

89
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:03,095
Thrush, chronic
otitis media, ringworm,

90
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,697
diarrhea, malnutrition,

91
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,366
electrolyte imbalances...

92
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,934
let's get CBC, Chem-20,

93
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,572
protein, albumen, transferrin,

94
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:14,541
globulins, iron, UA,

95
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,775
and a folate level.

96
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,743
Doug, that baby's
refusing formula.

97
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,279
You can drop a feeding tube,

98
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,846
about 13 pounds,
maybe a year old.

99
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,048
Okay.

100
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,349
Who's this?

101
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,484
Can't get a name.

102
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:25,951
Says she's three years old.

103
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,420
You're three, sweetheart?

104
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:29,389
Okay. What's your name, darling?

105
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,257
Come on. What's your name?

106
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,226
All right.

107
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,527
Let's get these
sores cleaned up.

108
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,262
Start her on Keflex, 250 mgs.

109
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,097
That looks like impetigo.

110
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:41,084
Let's hope the others
haven't caught it.

111
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,635
Chem-20, CBC, UA?

112
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,204
Yeah, and let's
get height, weight,

113
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:46,438
head and arm circumferences.

114
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,207
I'm gonna go make myself useful.

115
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,431
Okay.

116
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,081
Last three.

117
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,248
We've got the beds?

118
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,349
Suture Room.

119
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,985
Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.
What's your name?

120
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,186
Ty.

121
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,355
Listen, are these your
brothers and sisters?

122
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,539
Uh-huh. Some.

123
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,524
Who are the others?

124
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,875
I don't know. Cousins.

125
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,981
Do you know their names?

126
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,362
You know a few?

127
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:10,363
Some.

128
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:13,165
Right. Some.

129
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,001
Lydia, why don't
you find Ty a bed?

130
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:18,126
Come on, Ty.

131
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,758
Where's his shoes?

132
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,825
Couldn't find them.

133
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,493
Looked over the whole place.

134
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,728
There's only enough clothes

135
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,347
for half the kids there.

136
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:28,714
Rubadoux.

137
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:30,416
Would you excuse
us for a moment,

138
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,684
Mr. Rubadoux?

139
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,752
Sure.

140
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:33,975
Thank you.

141
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:38,858
Dr. Benton?

142
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,026
Post-op, day nine.

143
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,027
Patient was presented

144
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:42,228
with a type A aortic dissection,

145
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,981
which was repaired using
the clamp-and-run procedure.

146
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,415
Patient's surgical course

147
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,550
was unremarkable,

148
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,952
though there is evidence
of partial paraplegia

149
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:49,953
of the lower extremities.

150
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,354
And this morning?

151
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,890
Echo shows ejection
fraction of 15%.

152
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,924
BUN is 45.

153
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,075
Creatinine, 2.

154
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,760
BP's 180/110.

155
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,978
Suggesting what?

156
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,513
Congestive heart
failure, renal insufficiency.

157
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:01,914
None of this attributable

158
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,783
to our recent, life-saving

159
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,168
aortic-aneurysm surgery.

160
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,170
Well, I am worried
about her paraplegia.

161
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,172
Well, it's too soon to determine
whether it's not temporary.

162
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,306
Course of action?

163
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,940
Increase her cardiac output

164
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,009
so we can transfer her
to a long-term facility.

165
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,078
Get her off of our
service. Exactly.

166
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,180
How?

167
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,247
Well, given her condition,

168
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,248
I'd suggest a dobutamine IV.

169
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,249
They wouldn't accept her

170
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,651
in a nursing home with an IV,

171
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,635
would they?

172
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,636
Anybody else?

173
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,637
Um...

174
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,055
Mr. Carter. A thought?

175
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,423
If we put her on dobutamine,

176
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,025
she might get
better for a few days,

177
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,326
but she's likely to decompensate
and bounce back here.

178
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,562
Why not try an ACE inhibitor?

179
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,230
We could do that,
couldn't we, Dr. Benton?

180
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,231
It worsens her renal problem.

181
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,215
Carter?

182
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,216
Nitrates.

183
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,284
Decreases her preload.

184
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:39,285
Digoxin. Kidneys can't clear it.

185
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:40,302
Diuretics.

186
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,038
Decreases cardiac output.

187
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,206
Quite the conundrum.

188
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,406
Well, I'm sure
there's a solution.

189
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,209
A pinch of this,
a touch of that.

190
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,546
We have to use
our clinical judgment.

191
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,217
How many are you
currently carrying, Mr. Carter?

192
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,118
Five, but I can handle
another one, no problem.

193
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,504
Well, in that case,
why don't you

194
00:07:57,528 --> 00:07:58,804
show us what you can do

195
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,573
without resorting to
Dr. Benton's dobutamine?

196
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:01,608
Amaze us.

197
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,209
Impress us.

198
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,432
Work miracles.

199
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,920
Bad case of ringworm.
Well, with kerion.

200
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:17,724
Let's get him on
oral griseofulvin.

201
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,725
Open up.

202
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,159
Yeah.

203
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:21,360
Ty, you had enough to eat?

204
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:22,361
Yeah.

205
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,730
Yeah? Like what?

206
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,097
We eat stuff.

207
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,834
Fruits? Vegetables? Meat?

208
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,269
Sometimes.

209
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,504
What about the babies?

210
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:32,839
They get formula?

211
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:35,041
My mom gives me the stamps
when she don't need them

212
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,143
and I get us stuff.

213
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,861
Milk for the babies,
bologna, bread.

214
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,246
Your mom gives
you the food stamps

215
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,247
and you do the shopping?

216
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,281
I'm good at it.

217
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,699
Trey okay?

218
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,684
He one of your brothers?

219
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,185
I looked after him. He's sick.

220
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,620
How sick?

221
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:48,854
Cerebral palsy.

222
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:50,306
He has cerebral palsy?

223
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,440
He's in Trauma 1.

224
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,575
Doug's checking him out.

225
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,145
CBC, Chem-20, protein studies,

226
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,746
transferrin, iron, and a UA.

227
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,215
Let's call a dental school

228
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,617
and get some of those
students over here

229
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,486
to take a look a these kids.

230
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,754
Now I'm going to go see
how your brother Trey's doing,

231
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,844
okay?

232
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,361
Where's Doug?

233
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,429
Trauma 1.

234
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,530
How's she doing?

235
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,798
Anemia,

236
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,850
neutropenic, thrush,
chronic otitis media,

237
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:18,918
and pediculosis.

238
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,519
Lice.

239
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:21,921
You betcha, and
if she's got them...

240
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:22,922
They've all got them.

241
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:23,923
Jeanie, grab a basin

242
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,524
and enough RID to go around

243
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:26,525
and start shampooing.

244
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,526
All of them?

245
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,678
It's great to be

246
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,262
the new kid on
the block, isn't it?

247
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,464
Susan, weren't you off at seven?

248
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,732
Yeah. Jeanie too.

249
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:34,133
I've got a performance
review this afternoon.

250
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,334
I might as well stick around.

251
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,335
Come on, Jeanie.

252
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,336
Lice patrol.

253
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,337
Isn't that a nurse's job?

254
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:39,539
No, not today, it isn't.

255
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:40,940
Susan, why don't
you finish this one

256
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:41,941
and then go home?

257
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:42,942
We've got it.

258
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,176
You know, I signed them in.

259
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,178
I want to make sure
they're okay before I go.

260
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,196
Ah.

261
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,865
Ah.

262
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:49,932
Ah.

263
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,534
Ah.

264
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,436
Is this the kid with CP? Ah.

265
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,006
Yeah. Five years
old, weighs 28 pounds.

266
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,774
Lethargic.

267
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,225
Slight abdominal edema.

268
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:01,360
Kid's starving to death.

269
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,428
Take a look at this.

270
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:05,014
Look at that.

271
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,204
Cigarette burns.
Yeah. Welts too.

272
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,155
You're...

273
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,756
You're going to
have to bring him in

274
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,358
if he won't go down
to the ambulance.

275
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,160
Who the hell just paged
me down from rounds?

276
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,361
Hey, if I got shot

277
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,962
I'd want to come
in to the hospital.

278
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,996
This had better be important.

279
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,997
No. Look, lady,

280
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,399
I'm not going to talk to him.

281
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,667
I'm a clerk, not a priest.

282
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,369
Call 911 or get on the damn bus.

283
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,370
The page?

284
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,404
How should I know?

285
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,439
Ask around.

286
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,123
Benton? What?

287
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,931
Al Boulet, Jeanie's husband.

288
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,245
Oh, yeah. Hey. How you doing?

289
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,914
I've been better.
Have you seen her?

290
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,065
No. Is she working?

291
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,899
Well, she was supposed
to be off at seven.

292
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,317
She was gonna
meet me for breakfast.

293
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,803
Do me a favor.

294
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:45,988
If you see her, tell
her I'm looking for her,

295
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,757
okay? Yeah.

296
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,775
Find out who's paging me

297
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,843
and tell them

298
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,244
they damn well
better be down here

299
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:54,414
the next time I come.

300
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,081
What was that all about?

301
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:58,851
Dr. Personality? Who knows?

302
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,754
Any of you seen a
DCFS around here?

303
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:02,838
Mark Greene?

304
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,174
Dr. Mark Greene?

305
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,193
You Child Services?

306
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,343
Sorry, no.

307
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,345
Process server.

308
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,547
Sign here, please.

309
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,648
What for?

310
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,766
Summons.

311
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,923
Third line, please.

312
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:22,641
Have a nice day.

313
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:25,645
Right.

314
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:26,979
Patient?

315
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:28,269
Hope not.

316
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:33,886
Jennifer's suing me for divorce.

317
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,123
Oh, no.

318
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:38,441
You Dr. Greene?

319
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,943
Not if you want
me to sign anything.

320
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,111
What?

321
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,196
I'm Mark Greene.

322
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,330
Pete Tuteur,

323
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,531
Department of Child
and Family Services.

324
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,538
I understand you
got some kids for us.

325
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,214
We need more water.

326
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,397
Okay.

327
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,732
Now, see, that
wasn't so bad, was it?

328
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,168
All right.

329
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,635
Got another one for you.

330
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,938
Alrighty.

331
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,773
Hi, there, sweet pea.

332
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:11,941
I'm Jeanie.

333
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,442
Do you have a name?

334
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,811
That one doesn't talk.

335
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,613
Okay.

336
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:21,250
We're going to shampoo your
hair and make it look all beautiful.

337
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,335
Is that too hot?

338
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:26,823
Is that too cold?

339
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,491
Must be just right, then.

340
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,859
How many more we got?

341
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:30,926
We've already done eight, right?

342
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,127
Nine, I think.

343
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,395
Mommy.

344
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,047
What's that, sweetie?
Did you say something?

345
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:36,715
I didn't hear what you said.

346
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,084
I was talking to my friends.

347
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:43,044
Will you be my mommy?

348
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,086
Where's the husband?

349
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,521
Cafeteria.

350
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,156
Renal or Cardiology been up yet?

351
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,290
Oh, yeah.

352
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,559
And?

353
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,860
Renal wants to use hydralazine.

354
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,294
Cardiology wants
an ACE inhibitor.

355
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,496
Ah, the Renal-Cardiology
push-and-pull.

356
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,065
What about Pulmonary?

357
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,082
Oh, they sent over

358
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,368
an incentive spirometer.

359
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:12,502
Yeah, right.

360
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,704
Well, that should solve
all of her problems.

361
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,048
Partial paraplegia?
Still present.

362
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:20,627
You know, your
beeper's going off.

363
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,095
Yeah, I'm not deaf, Carter.

364
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:25,081
All right. Well, hurry
up. Do something.

365
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,633
Time's wasting.

366
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:29,902
40 milligrams IV
push of Lasix, please.

367
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,771
Won't that volume deplete her?

368
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:33,339
Just do it, please.

369
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:35,230
Okay? Sorry, but...

370
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:42,799
Three of the girls
aren't even supposed

371
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,267
to be living with the mother.

372
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,268
The court awarded custody

373
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,436
to a grandmother.

374
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,470
God knows where she is.

375
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,872
Why were they all
in one apartment?

376
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:52,742
22 AFDC Payments.

377
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,612
Uncle's on disability.
The rent is maybe 300.

378
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:58,415
Hell, they're netting four
grand a month for crack.

379
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,450
Your tax dollars at work.

380
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:01,551
Sounds like a press release

381
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,819
for welfare reform.

382
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,320
Yeah, that's all we need.

383
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,222
Less money trickling down

384
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,157
to keep these kids
from starving to death.

385
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,560
Look, as soon as you
get these kids cleaned up,

386
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,595
I'll take them over to
Columbus/Maryville.

387
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,697
These kids are
malnourished, dehydrated,

388
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,099
their electrolytes
are screwed up,

389
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,133
and they've got infections.

390
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,301
No one's leaving here

391
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,602
until I'm satisfied
they're okay.

392
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,438
Fine. I mean, it's not as if

393
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:22,638
we have anyplace to put them.

394
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,639
Have you seen Benton?

395
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:24,640
I keep paging him.

396
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,641
Oh, he's around.

397
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,076
You ever get the feeling

398
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,811
that the system isn't working?

399
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,914
Ah, you're just
figuring that one out?

400
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,516
One of the boys
has an inguinal mass.

401
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,517
He needs a surgical consult.

402
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,751
Reducible?

403
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,386
Yeah, but it's there
when he's crying

404
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,821
and he's crying a lot.

405
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,222
I don't think any of these kids

406
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,457
have ever seen doctors.

407
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,658
She had me served at work.

408
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:43,693
Jennifer?

409
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,695
Yeah. I was hoping we
were going to be able

410
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,497
to handle this amicably.

411
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,499
I guess this blows
that one to hell.

412
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,967
I'm going to need
a good attorney.

413
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,301
Why don't you come over tonight,

414
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,503
and we'll order in a pizza?

415
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,104
You can watch me
give Susie a bath,

416
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,490
and if you're really nice, I
might let you change a diaper.

417
00:14:57,514 --> 00:15:00,209
I'm just going to go home
and wallow in self-pity.

418
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,649
Any time.

419
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,731
Hey, they find homes
for those kids yet?

420
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:06,866
Not yet.

421
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,467
The DCFS took
some of the older ones

422
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,869
to the emergency shelter,

423
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,204
and we admitted three.

424
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:12,438
You want anything
from the machine?

425
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:13,839
Yeah, how about
some of those, uh,

426
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:14,858
peanut butter crackers?

427
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,759
Got it.

428
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,427
He's cute.

429
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,528
Raul?

430
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,563
Mm-hmm.

431
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,564
Uh, you're not his type.

432
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,765
Really?

433
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,250
You ever dress up
like a lumberjack?

434
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:27,069
Longshoreman?

435
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,220
Greco-Roman wrestler?

436
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:30,890
He's gay.

437
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,680
Really?

438
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,561
Randi, who's paging me?

439
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:35,562
Not a clue.

440
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,846
Well, isn't that your job?

441
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,147
No, it's not.

442
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,350
Check the board and the charts.

443
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,284
You should have seen this place.

444
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,703
Twenty kids, no refrigerator,

445
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,122
no heat, roaches everywhere.

446
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,557
Only thing in the kitchen
was a can of SpaghettiOs.

447
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,693
You really got to wonder
about these mothers,

448
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,695
and then you got to think,
what about the families?

449
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,129
You know, their neighbors?

450
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,316
I mean, can't these people
take care of their own kids?

451
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,917
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

452
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:58,918
What does what mean?

453
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:00,953
"These" people. Come on.

454
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,188
Yo, partner. Catch.

455
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,255
Why can't these black folks

456
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,657
take care of their kids,

457
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:05,792
right?

458
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:06,892
He didn't say that.

459
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,528
Yeah, well, that's
what he meant.

460
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,930
Hey, if that's what I meant,
that's what I would have said.

461
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,014
What's going on, guys?

462
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,232
David Duke here
is enlightening us.

463
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,251
Oh, Malik, that's not fair.

464
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,652
Do you think those kids deserved

465
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,237
to be living like that?

466
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:19,805
Whatever happened to
personal responsibility?

467
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:21,424
You think it's equal?

468
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,893
He's the surgeon.
I'm the fireman.

469
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,695
Yeah, well, you would
find it that simple, huh?

470
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,398
Because we all know the system
works the same for everybody.

471
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,600
The system seems to be
working pretty well for you, Doc.

472
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:31,935
Let me tell you something.

473
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,120
You don't know a damn
thing about what works for me.

474
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,921
Peter, where have you
been? I've been paging you.

475
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:37,078
Trauma 2.

476
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,078
What the hell
was that all about?

477
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,435
You, man. That's what.

478
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:48,934
Loretta?

479
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,236
Yeah, it's one of her kids.

480
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,837
Sore throat. Temp's 101.

481
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:53,172
Where's Ross?

482
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,174
Still tied up with those kids.

483
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,309
Loretta, how you been?

484
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,377
Good.

485
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,178
Uh, this is Annie.
This is my Jimmy.

486
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,679
His throat's sore.

487
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,181
Oh, yeah?

488
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,849
Well, let me take a
look there, Jimmy.

489
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:06,685
Great.

490
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,354
Jimmy, can you just
open your mouth?

491
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,823
Stick out your tongue.
That's good. "Ah."

492
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:11,824
Ah.

493
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:12,825
Uh-huh. Ooh.

494
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,526
Does that hurt when you swallow?

495
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,195
That hurts, too, huh?

496
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,663
Glands are swollen.

497
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,616
He still has his tonsils.

498
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,618
Yeah, well, you got a little
strep throat there, Jimmy,

499
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,719
but don't worry.

500
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,220
We can clear that right up.

501
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,521
How about you, Annie?

502
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,705
Is your throat sore at all?

503
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:27,724
No, I'm okay.

504
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:29,892
Okay, and Mom,
how are you doing?

505
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,794
I'm doing really good.

506
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,496
I still got that office job,

507
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,897
and we moved into a new house.

508
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,132
The PID hasn't flared up?

509
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,800
I get a little
bleeding sometimes.

510
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,067
Yeah?

511
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,771
Lydia, why don't you
take the kids outside

512
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:42,972
and I can talk to Mom.

513
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:43,973
It's no big deal.

514
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,108
Come on, guys.

515
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,909
I think we got some videos
around here someplace.

516
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,110
You seen<i> The Lion King?</i> No.

517
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,094
Yes, you have.

518
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,396
Go on.

519
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,017
I'll be out in a minute. Go on.

520
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,618
So, uh...

521
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,922
how long have you been bleeding?

522
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,791
All right, what do we have?

523
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,260
Seven-year-old male.

524
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,394
Small, reducible,

525
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,412
right-sided inguinal mass.

526
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:07,780
It's all right, Michael.

527
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,031
This is Peter. He's a doctor.

528
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,055
He's going to help
you feel better, okay?

529
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,905
Did you page me
this morning too?

530
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:16,922
Yeah. Where were you?

531
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:18,057
On surgical rounds,

532
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:19,692
which you pulled
me off of for nothing.

533
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:20,793
Oh, excuse me.

534
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,411
I thought you were
assigned to the ER.

535
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,413
No, no, no, no. I'm assigned
to the surgical service.

536
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,414
I cover the ER,

537
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,415
and when I'm paged,

538
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,017
I expect somebody
to be waiting for me

539
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,284
when I come down.

540
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,148
Well, we've been a little
busy down here today.

541
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,890
Almost over, Michael. Almost.

542
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,258
There's no hernia.

543
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,759
Check him again.

544
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,932
You're wasting my time.

545
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,046
Peter.

546
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,447
It's not there.
The hell it isn't.

547
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:42,471
Check him again.

548
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,371
It's still reducible.

549
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,773
I'll put him on the
surgical schedule.

550
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,841
Operate tomorrow.

551
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:52,980
Draw pre-op labs.

552
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:01,567
Peter, what is the
matter with you?

553
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:02,835
If you're angry with me,

554
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,603
you take it out on me,
not on some little boy.

555
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:05,604
What?

556
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:06,694
Give us a minute, Connie.

557
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,560
That little boy in there

558
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,161
is scared to death,

559
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,363
and you're poking around on
him like you're stuffing a turkey,

560
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,315
telling him how
he needs surgery?

561
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:17,767
He's never even seen a doctor.

562
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,401
Is that it?

563
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,770
No, that's not it.

564
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,704
Peter, if this is
about you and me,

565
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,940
get over it.

566
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,308
If it's about something else,

567
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,909
get over that
too. I'm sick of it.

568
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,677
Don't you turn your back on me.

569
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:29,845
That little boy in there

570
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:30,979
needs compassion.

571
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,081
If you can't find
that in yourself,

572
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,538
get out of medicine.

573
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:51,016
69-year-old male, history of MI,

574
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,251
experienced sudden onset

575
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,319
of chest pain.

576
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:55,153
Took a nitro tab,
called his son.

577
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,523
Paramedics found
him unconscious.

578
00:19:57,547 --> 00:19:58,924
One, two, three.

579
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,626
They tubed him.

580
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,895
He's hypotensive. 40 palp.

581
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,830
O-2, 100 percent.

582
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:06,732
Let's get a 12-lead.

583
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,867
Pulse ox, chest x-ray,

584
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,136
CBC, Chem-7, cardiac enzymes,

585
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,570
and grab a blood gas.

586
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:13,772
You the son?

587
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:14,773
Yes.

588
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,974
He's had a heart attack before?

589
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:17,009
Yeah, about two years ago.

590
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,077
He's hypoxic.

591
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:22,147
Rales bilaterally.

592
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,548
Jugular venous distension.

593
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,250
Haleh, let's get an echo.

594
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:26,318
Dopamine?

595
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,920
Yeah, 200 mics per minute.

596
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,154
Call Cardiology.

597
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:31,689
Hi, I'm Dr. Greene,
and you're Mister...

598
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:32,708
Mills. Howard Mills.

599
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,276
Your father's in heart failure,

600
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,277
and it's too early

601
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,278
to know exactly what's happened,

602
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,546
but we're running tests.

603
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,548
And we'll let you know
as soon as we know.

604
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,749
Can't I stay with him?

605
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,950
Why don't you get some coffee

606
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,151
and let us do our work?

607
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,386
When your father's stabilized

608
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,688
I'll come get you, okay?

609
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,311
Okay.

610
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,528
Bobby. Sorry I'm late.

611
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:53,862
No problem.

612
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,230
How about a cup of coffee?

613
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,598
It's only about a week old.

614
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,733
No, thanks.

615
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,401
I'm already on
my 10th cup or so.

616
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,435
I was on all night.

617
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,537
How's it been going?

618
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,272
Okay.

619
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,173
I'm a little concerned

620
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,880
about your first
student evaluation.

621
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,698
"Pleasant, helpful,
lacks assertiveness.

622
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:16,051
"needs to take control

623
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,252
"if she's going to be useful.

624
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,253
"Good skills,

625
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,788
"but may not be well-suited

626
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,223
"for work in the
Emergency Department."

627
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:24,593
Uh-huh.

628
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,995
Is that from a Peter Benton?

629
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,230
Who?

630
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,231
Dr. Peter Benton,
surgical Resident?

631
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,582
No.

632
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,935
Residents don't evaluate
physician assistant students.

633
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,987
No, this is from...

634
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:37,990
Carol Hathaway, RN, MS.

635
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,809
I didn't realize the
nurses evaluated us.

636
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,429
Look, I realize

637
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:47,232
that putting PAs into settings
where nurses had a monopoly

638
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:48,801
can cause problems,

639
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:51,736
but liked or disliked,

640
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,456
we have to do a better job,

641
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,858
so I need to know,

642
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,360
can you cut it?

643
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,028
Because if you can't,

644
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,497
I can't afford to have
you fail down there.

645
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,933
I can cut it.

646
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,001
Are you sure?

647
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,520
Yeah, I'm sure.

648
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,955
Mark? Jennifer
filed for divorce?

649
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:12,257
Word travels fast.

650
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,458
I knew you were breaking up.

651
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:14,560
I just always figured

652
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,562
that you would find a
way to hold it together.

653
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,564
Trying to make me feel worse?

654
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,831
No, it's just

655
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:21,232
if you can't make
a marriage work

656
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,101
how the hell am I going to?

657
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,302
What are you still doing here?

658
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,370
Home away from home.

659
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:26,504
Mark, Cardiology's
here on your MI.

660
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,123
I want you out of here by five.

661
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,425
Excuse me. Can
someone help me, please?

662
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,426
Uh, Randi? Randi.

663
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,928
Can I help you?

664
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,863
Yes, I'm looking for
my grandchildren.

665
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,064
They were living in an apartment

666
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,166
down on Calumet.

667
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,183
Police say they
brought them here.

668
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:40,619
The name's Proulx.

669
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,977
The littlest one, Trey,
has got cerebral palsy.

670
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:48,259
What are her I's and O's?

671
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,829
150cc's in, 800cc's out.

672
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:51,997
Pressure?

673
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:54,099
Down. 80/40.

674
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,500
Down? Why didn't you call me?

675
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:58,203
You didn't put
it in your orders.

676
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,072
Give her a 300cc bolus

677
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,407
and monitor her
pressure, please.

678
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:03,942
How's our girl doing, Doc?

679
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,077
Oh,

680
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:08,046
not much improvement
yet, Mr. Rubadoux.

681
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,881
Oh, Ruby, please. Call me Ruby.

682
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,316
Coffee?

683
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,534
Come on. I bought an extra.

684
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,836
Oh, no, thanks.

685
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,372
Oh, come on. A
little cup of hot joe.

686
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,547
You look like you could
stand a little pick-me-up.

687
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:26,031
Mm.

688
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:27,704
Now, that's good coffee.

689
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,142
You should have seen her

690
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,227
50 years ago.

691
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:42,631
Backstage at the Majestic.

692
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,850
Great gams.

693
00:23:44,874 --> 00:23:46,735
Hell of a looker.

694
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,604
<i>Pal Joey,</i>

695
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:49,738
<i>Way to the Forum,</i>

696
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,573
<i>How to Succeed.</i>

697
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,076

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,410
you name it.

699
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,844
Huh.

700
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,247
I did a couple musicals myself,

701
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,582
back in school.

702
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,749

Oh, yeah. Good shows.

00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,121
Yeah, bet you were wonderful.

706
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,639
Not really.

707
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,457
I don't believe that.
I bet you were great.

708
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,126
Mr. Carter...

709
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,910
Uh, mostly I embarrassed myself.

710
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,437
Doctor?

711
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:25,296
I'm not ready to let her go yet.

712
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,164
Carol.

713
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:33,598
Can I talk to you?

714
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:35,667
Sure. What's up?

715
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,135
I just had my student evaluation

716
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,004
with my program coordinator.

717
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,672
You've been
unhappy with my work.

718
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:44,076
I think you're
competent but timid.

719
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,276
If you want to be down here,

720
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,477
you need to be more aggressive.

721
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:47,846
I've been trying.

722
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,214
Look, the ER
isn't for everybody.

723
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,415
You know, don't feel bad

724
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:53,251
if you're not
comfortable down here.

725
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:56,254
Have I done something
to offend you in some way?

726
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:58,090
This isn't
personal. It's just...

727
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:00,258
you're always waiting

728
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:01,893
for somebody to
tell you what to do.

729
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,128
It's like this conversation.

730
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:04,796
I tell you I need you
to be more aggressive

731
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,347
and you want to stand
here and discuss it.

732
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,932
I don't have time to
hold people's hands.

733
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:09,134
You've just got to do it.

734
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:10,502
So it's not a PA thing?

735
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:12,804
No, it's not, but hey,

736
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,806
I've got nurses who have
been here for 20 years.

737
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,042
Physician assistants
go to school

738
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,644
for a couple of months,
and they have the right

739
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:19,844
to tell us what to
do? Two years.

740
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:21,463
Two years of training.

741
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,864
Two years of internship.

742
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,466
I went nights while
I worked full time,

743
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,135
so my training
took me four years.

744
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,604
If you want to stay in the ER,

745
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,189
stop looking for validation

746
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,057
and start doing the job.

747
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:36,416
You do that, and
we'll get along fine.

748
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,465
Please make sure
that everybody's ready

749
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,768
for Wednesday's
dog and pony show

750
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,102
for the trustees.

751
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,904
I don't want a repeat
of last fall's disaster.

752
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:46,905
Dr. Vucelich,

753
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:48,339
you were looking for me?

754
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:49,775
Yes, I was, Benton.

755
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,009
Have you met my
assistant, Claire?

756
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,210
No. Hi.

757
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,512
Hello.

758
00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:55,414
So, is Mrs. Rubadoux's
paralysis subsiding?

759
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,081
No.

760
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,283
Don't be so disappointed.

761
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,285
It was an emergent situation.

762
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,920
What was our other
choice? Death?

763
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:04,589
Besides, the woman
was a bad risk.

764
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,525
Pulmonary disease,
history of hypertension.

765
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,593
I'm concerned her
condition might be my fault.

766
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:09,928
I performed the procedure.

767
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:12,196
Oh, please. Don't
be so melodramatic.

768
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,865
Your technique
was letter perfect.

769
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:16,635
We'll have to exclude
her from the study.

770
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,720
She was never an
appropriate candidate.

771
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,955
I think it's time

772
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,291
we made Dr. Benton an
official member of the team,

773
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,594
don't you think, Claire?

774
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,895
Research associate?

775
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:27,962
Yes.

776
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,097
Claire will make sure

777
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,131
you have everything you need.

778
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,951
I don't know what to say.

779
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,286
"Thank you" will suffice.

780
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,659
Yeah. Yeah.

781
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,076
Mr. Mills?

782
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,378
Howard, please.

783
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,179
Uh, Howard,

784
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,681
we suspect that your father

785
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,717
had a right
ventricle infarction.

786
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,385
Another heart attack.

787
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,386
Yes.

788
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,054
We're going to send him

789
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,756
up to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit.

790
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,325
They'll place a
Swan-Ganz catheter

791
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,928
to better monitor the
pressure in his heart and lungs,

792
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,631
and they'll do an echo

793
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:06,401
to confirm the diagnosis.

794
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,258
It doesn't look good.

795
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,394
I think...

796
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:17,628
he wants to go.

797
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:20,799
My mother died last year.

798
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:22,284
Breast cancer.

799
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,859
They were married 50 years.

800
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,864
This is you.

801
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,884
Coffee's in the lounge.

802
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,818
Bathroom's past the elevators.

803
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,820
Research staff
meets every Tuesday,

804
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,655
8:15 sharp.

805
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,791
Fill this out

806
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:49,527
and get it back to me
as soon as possible.

807
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:51,062
You have an assigned
parking space?

808
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,998
No, I park in the
Residents' lot.

809
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:54,832
Not anymore, you don't.

810
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:56,902
AW4?

811
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,371
All research associates
receive a stipend,

812
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:02,974
and your first referral payment.

813
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:05,743
I'm Carl's secretary, not yours.

814
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:07,913
You want your phone answered,

815
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,480
get a machine.

816
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:10,982
Anything else,

817
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,018
I'm at the end of the hall.

818
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:14,107
Yeah.

819
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,396
Hey, Trey, how are you doing?

820
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,031
He's doing better now.

821
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,100
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

822
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,668
Mrs. Proulx, may
I speak with you

823
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:32,070
for a moment, please?

824
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:33,171
I'll take the little girl.

825
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:34,172
Oh, that's okay.

826
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:35,373
Ty, can you come over here

827
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,197
and look after your
sister for Nana?

828
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,031
Mrs. Proulx, Trey's well enough

829
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,365
to be released to the DCFS.

830
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,867
This is Mr. Tuteur.

831
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,369
We'll be taking him over
to Columbus/Maryville.

832
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,372
It's an emergency shelter.
Do you know what that is?

833
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,374
Yes, I've been there before.

834
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,176
So, you're not going
to let me keep them?

835
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,344
The department's been
granted temporary custody.

836
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,745
There'll be a court
hearing next week.

837
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,747
Well, they were with
me till a month ago,

838
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,850
then their mother came
and got them again.

839
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:02,917
I told her

840
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,186
they should be with me.

841
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,989
They all have their own rooms
and their own beds in my place,

842
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,091
and they like it there.

843
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:10,108
Mrs. Proulx, I'm sorry,

844
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:11,710
but why did you
keep the kids there?

845
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:13,712
You have custody.
They're your responsibility.

846
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,647
Well, she said she
was doing better,

847
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,282
and children should
be with their mother.

848
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,951
You know, she
wasn't always like this.

849
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,820
She loved those babies.

850
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,254
She loved them a lot,

851
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:25,328
but you know, it's the drugs.

852
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:28,910
Are these jackets for them?

853
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:29,934
Mm-hmm.

854
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,823
Okay, children.

855
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,192
Let's put these coats on now.

856
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:49,314
Ty, help your brother
on with his coat, sugar.

857
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:51,449
You be a good girl,
now, you hear, okay?

858
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,167
Okay.

859
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,453
How we doing?

860
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:56,721
All ready? Come
here, sweetheart.

861
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:59,757
Now, you take care
of little Trey, now, Ty.

862
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:01,092
Yes, ma'am.

863
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:03,278
Come on, sweetheart.
Come with me.

864
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,613
Here we go. Got you, sweetie.

865
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,332
Okay. We ready?

866
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:08,721
Let's go.

867
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,757
Ty...

868
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:16,958
now, you take good care

869
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,460
of little Trey, you hear?

870
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,134
Yes, ma'am.

871
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:01,570
51-year-old woman,

872
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:02,604
abdominal pain and cramps.

873
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,205
Thinks she ate too
much on New Year's.

874
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,239
Got to weigh 300 pounds.

875
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,641
Is this day ever going to end?

876
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:10,512
So, Mrs., uh, Saunders,

877
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,547
did you have a little
too much holiday cheer?

878
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,749
She's been in pain for days,

879
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:15,350
and I still had to drag her in.

880
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,152
When did the cramps start?

881
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,821
New Year's Day, after dinner.

882
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:20,856
Any pain here?

883
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,257
Mm-mm.

884
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,375
Vomiting?

885
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:24,376
I've been nauseous.

886
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,461
Diarrhea? No.

887
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,663
What did you have to eat?

888
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:29,264
Usual holiday stuff.

889
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:33,902
Potato salad, ham, cheesecake,

890
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,887
pumpkin pie, some sushi.

891
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:38,390
Jeanie, get a stool culture,

892
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:39,725
Rule out salmonella,

893
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:41,293
and a rectal.

894
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,317
Chuny will help you.

895
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,197
I doubt if it's appendicitis.

896
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:47,399
It's probably viral
gastroenteritis

897
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,101
or a touch of food poisoning.

898
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,387
Let's get a surgical consult.

899
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,889
CBC, Chem-7, UA,

900
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,090
abdominal series.

901
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,834
Set up for a pelvic
and find Benton.

902
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,612
7-3-5-2-9-0-1.

903
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:02,848
Date of admission, 12-26-95.

904
00:32:02,872 --> 00:32:04,237
Dictating...

905
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:07,719
Dr. Vucelich, can I
interrupt you for a minute?

906
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:09,971
Well, you already have.

907
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,690
Uh...

908
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:13,792
Mrs. Rubadoux isn't improving.

909
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:17,161
I've tried Lasix,
nitrates, pressors.

910
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,415
She just keeps
seesawing back and forth.

911
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,749
Either she's volume depleted

912
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,150
and her pressure's dropping

913
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,152
or her pressure's up and
her pulse ox is dropping.

914
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,153
Put her on dobutamine?

915
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,354
Uh, you told me not to.

916
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,624
So, do you always
follow instructions

917
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:31,159
even when you've surmised
that they're incorrect?

918
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:34,162
Mrs. Rubadoux is a sinking ship

919
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,164
and you spent all day
rearranging her deck chairs.

920
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,667
You're probably right.

921
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:41,603
Once we've buffed her
up and bundled her off,

922
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,971
she will decompensate

923
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,340
and end up right
here in the hospital,

924
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:47,476
but she will not
be on our service

925
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,244
and she won't be your problem.

926
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:52,681
Um, let's see...

927
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,950
Dictating discharge summary
on patient David Piscuscus...

928
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,518
Did I make her worse

929
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,141
today?

930
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,890
She's dying, Mr. Carter.

931
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:06,127
Nothing you did is
going to change that.

932
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,964
Date of admission, 12-26-95.

933
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:12,534
Date of discharge, 1-8-96.

934
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,002
Patient presented
with claudication

935
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,637
of the right lower extremity...

936
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,971
Marcus Miller?

937
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,072
Bill Evans?

938
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,441
Wynton Marsalis?

939
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,143
You got to know Marsalis.

940
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,360
The Jay Leno show?

941
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,634
Hold up a second, will you?

942
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:27,766
Excuse me.

943
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,534
It's Malik, right?

944
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:30,869
Yeah, that's right.

945
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:33,404
Look, about
earlier, I just, uh...

946
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,141
I hope you didn't misunderstand
what I was trying to say.

947
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:38,110
Nah, man, I didn't
misunderstand.

948
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:39,945
Hey, Shep, come on.
I've only got 10 minutes.

949
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:41,179
It's just, you know,

950
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:42,981
I think that, you know,
we're all doing okay,

951
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:45,784
and nobody owes
anybody anything.

952
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:48,653
Let's get on with our
lives, and do what we can.

953
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:49,654
Sure. Whatever, man.

954
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:50,855
Hey, Shep. Let's go.

955
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,424
Yeah, hold up.

956
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:55,126
Hey, I was just
trying to be nice...

957
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,728
What do you want me to say, man?

958
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:58,864
That I don't think
you're a bigot?

959
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:00,548
Fine.

960
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,550
I don't think you're a bigot.

961
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:03,574
Shep, God. Please.

962
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:18,233
I'm not a racist.

963
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,701
You think I'm a racist?

964
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,537
Okay, you know what?
Just drink your coffee.

965
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,605
I ride with Raul
60 hours a week.

966
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:26,207
My sister dated a
black guy for two years.

967
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,444
Raul and I go to the Y
twice a week and play ball.

968
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,913
I'm the only white guy there.

969
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:32,036
I'm the only one.

970
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,289
I'm not a racist!

971
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,457
I'm not.

972
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:44,292
What do we have?

973
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,194
51-year-old with abdominal pain.

974
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,596
Mark figures it's
gastroenteritis,

975
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,764
but wants you

976
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,399
to rule out appendicitis.

977
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,066
The pain's getting worse.

978
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,735
Does it hurt here?

979
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,069
How about here?

980
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,405
No. Oh, God!

981
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,306
What's happening?

982
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,808
When did the pain
become this severe?

983
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,543
I don't know. I just walked in.

984
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,844
There. Better.

985
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:03,828
Chart back yet?

986
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:04,846
Chuny went to get them.

987
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,264
Keeps coming in waves.

988
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:07,932
How often?

989
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:08,934
About every minute.

990
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,219
Anybody do a pelvic exam?

991
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,237
Not yet.

992
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:13,639
Mrs. Saunders, when
was your last period?

993
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:14,906
Year and a half.

994
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,408
Oh, God! Here it comes again.

995
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:19,077
Okay, okay, look,
just put your legs up.

996
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:20,078
Her leg, grab her leg.

997
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:21,146
45 seconds apart.

998
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,769
Uh-huh.

999
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,151
She's fully dilated.
She's crowning.

1000
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,168
She's what?

1001
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,237
Get OB-GYN.
Somebody find Greene.

1002
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:30,272
Don't push, okay?

1003
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,740
Don't push. What's going on?

1004
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:32,940
Get Mark fast. B.O.A.

1005
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,059
Dr. Greene!

1006
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,510
Dr. Greene! What's
happening to me?

1007
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,346
You're not overeating, Mrs.
Saunders. You're in labor.

1008
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,681
She's having a baby?

1009
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,083
Where the hell is
everybody? Let's move!

1010
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,752
She already went
through menopause.

1011
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:46,288
Carla, honey, call Daddy. Oh!

1012
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,957
Oh, God! Here it comes again.

1013
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,325
Don't push.

1014
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,998
No, don't push!

1015
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:56,981
I haven't delivered a
baby since med school.

1016
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:58,517
They showed us
a video in school.

1017
00:35:58,541 --> 00:35:59,601
Just guide the head.

1018
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,003
Okay. First time
for everything, huh?

1019
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:05,189
Okay. All right, Mrs.
Saunders. Okay, good girl.

1020
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,114
Okay, breathe. Blow
through your mouth.

1021
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:12,453
Okay, good. Okay, good.

1022
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:17,769
She's doing better.

1023
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,938
Guess I'm going to have to start

1024
00:36:19,962 --> 00:36:23,174
watching myself
around those nurses.

1025
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:25,632
Yeah, we put her on dobutamine.

1026
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,147
Hi. How are you feeling?

1027
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:31,682
Very tired.

1028
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:36,688
Dr. Carter is going to have you
back again dancing in no time.

1029
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:38,456
But for now,

1030
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,075
why don't you just try and
get some more rest, okay?

1031
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,294
And you too, Ruby.

1032
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:44,111
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

1033
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,613
Oh, I...

1034
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,848
I promised Helen I'd stay

1035
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,672
until she could
come home with me.

1036
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,475
Uh, Ruby, I think you should

1037
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:58,893
at least consider
the possibility

1038
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,135
that your wife may
need long-term care.

1039
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,054
You don't know my Helen.

1040
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:12,390
She's a real trouper.

1041
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:16,378
A real trouper.

1042
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,880
Right, sweetheart?

1043
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,516
Uh...

1044
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,985
this is my...

1045
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,219
my beeper number.

1046
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,388
If you need anything,

1047
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:29,223
tonight or whenever, just...

1048
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,609
give me a call.

1049
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:33,333
Okay?

1050
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:37,715
You're the only
person around here

1051
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:38,739
who gives a damn.

1052
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:43,555
Thank you,

1053
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:44,894
for both of us.

1054
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:54,732
Mark, you missed all the fun.

1055
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:56,301
That fat lady had twins.

1056
00:37:56,325 --> 00:37:57,502
My abdominal pain?

1057
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,836
In Curtain Area 3 over there.

1058
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,772
You should have
seen Benton's face.

1059
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:01,806
Benton?

1060
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,041
That's why I was paging you.

1061
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:04,242
We moved them up to Postpartum.

1062
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,843
Mom is fine and
the babies are too.

1063
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,412
Boy and a girl.

1064
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:08,746
Loretta Sweet.

1065
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,081
Biopsy came back.

1066
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,249
Really?

1067
00:38:11,273 --> 00:38:12,417
Damn.

1068
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:13,918
Stage 1B carcinoma.

1069
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:16,087
Missed those annual pap smears.

1070
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,422
She still around?

1071
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:19,257
Left with her kids hours ago.

1072
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:20,925
Call her. Get her back.

1073
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,026
Already tried.

1074
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,311
Number's disconnected.

1075
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,281
Want me to send out a
social worker to round her up?

1076
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,083
No.

1077
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:30,518
You know her address?

1078
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,502
1604...

1079
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:32,954
North Sedgewick.

1080
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,290
Out by Cabrini-Green somewhere.

1081
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:38,126
Cervical cancer. That's tough.

1082
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,460
Couple of kids.

1083
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,797
Want me to give
you a ride out there?

1084
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:42,998
No. I drove in today. Thanks.

1085
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:44,232
Okay.

1086
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:47,324
'96 is going to be a
hell of a year, huh?

1087
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:57,846
Hi.

1088
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,870
Hey.

1089
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:05,844
Thanks.

1090
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:12,493
I got you some pecan pie.

1091
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,829
Looks good.

1092
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:14,996
I don't like pecan pie.

1093
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,420
Since when? Since never.

1094
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,836
Thanks for meeting me.

1095
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,337
You said it was important.

1096
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,074
How's work going?

1097
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:28,143
Uh, fine.

1098
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,410
Your folks? They fine?

1099
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,913
Yeah, they're fine too.

1100
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:32,981
Look, Al, um...

1101
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:35,083
I've been on my feet

1102
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,384
since four o'clock
yesterday afternoon,

1103
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:39,154
so if it's just the
same with you,

1104
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:40,188
can we just...

1105
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,892
Let's just do this
some other time.

1106
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,728
Maybe we should
give it another try.

1107
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:52,067
Maybe we should
give us another try.

1108
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,435
I'll have kids

1109
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,004
if you really want them.

1110
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:58,240
I've been thinking about
it, and kids would be okay.

1111
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:01,076
Great.

1112
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,244
Isn't that what you wanted?

1113
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:04,034
Yeah, it was. I got to go.

1114
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,083
I'm sorry.

1115
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:11,686
I'm ready now.

1116
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,389
Kids, being home...

1117
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:18,726
No more playing around,

1118
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,061
no more lies.

1119
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,652
I got to go.

1120
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:21,239
Michael, right?

1121
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:23,441
Hey, I'm Dr. Benton.

1122
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:24,442
We met earlier this morning,

1123
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:25,498
remember?

1124
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,164
Michael,

1125
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,599
you're going to have
an operation tomorrow

1126
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:32,733
for a hernia.

1127
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,135
Do you know what a hernia is?

1128
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,486
No.

1129
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,124
It's when you have a balloon
poking out in your groin

1130
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:40,442
below your belly button.

1131
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:42,844
A balloon?

1132
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,229
Well, not a real balloon,

1133
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:48,733
but the part of your insides
that look like a balloon.

1134
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:52,303
If we don't fix it,
you can get sick.

1135
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,138
Will it hurt?

1136
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:55,457
Nah, you'll be asleep.

1137
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:57,547
But I'm scared.

1138
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,497
That's all right.

1139
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,499
It's okay to be scared.

1140
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:05,566
You'll be fine.

1141
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,968
I'm going to be
doing the operation.

1142
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:08,019
You will?

1143
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:10,088
Mm-hmm. It's no big deal.

1144
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:11,645
A lot of kids have had it done.

1145
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,887
Will you stay with
me for a while?

1146
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,021
Yeah.

1147
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,178
Sure.

1148
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,433
Hi.

1149
00:42:55,457 --> 00:42:57,935
Did I wake you up?

1150
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:00,705
Oh, uh, well, I
was on last night.

1151
00:43:00,729 --> 00:43:01,906
I'm sorry. I should have called.

1152
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,474
No, no, that's okay.

1153
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,475
Uh, Susie went down early,

1154
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,076
so I just sacked
out on the couch.

1155
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,967
I brought pizza and beer.

1156
00:43:09,304 --> 00:43:10,281
I should have called.

1157
00:43:10,305 --> 00:43:11,949
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

1158
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:13,083
What kind of pizza?

1159
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:15,553
Meat.

1160
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:16,621
Lots of meat.

1161
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:18,623
Pepperoni?

1162
00:43:18,647 --> 00:43:20,287
Probably some in there.

1163
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,394
You have any
diapers left to change?

1164
00:43:23,418 --> 00:43:24,418
Always.

1165
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:04,035
<i>Hello?</i>

1166
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:05,303
Hello. This is John Carter.

1167
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:06,604
Somebody beeped
me from this number?

1168
00:44:06,628 --> 00:44:08,873
<i>Mr. Carter, this is Ruby.</i>

1169
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,341
<i>Mr. Rubadoux.</i>

1170
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:12,276
Hi, Ruby.

1171
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,978
How's she doing?

1172
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:15,279
<i>It's so late.</i>

1173
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:16,280
<i>I'm sorry about the call.</i>

1174
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:17,781
<i>Is it okay?</i>

1175
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:20,184
No, no, no. It's all right.
I told you you could call.

1176
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,285
<i>She's having trouble...</i>

1177
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:22,487
She's what?

1178
00:44:22,511 --> 00:44:23,821
<i>She's having trouble breathing.</i>

1179
00:44:23,845 --> 00:44:28,126
Oh, that's... that's...
that's normal.

1180
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,151
Yeah, that's going to happen.

1181
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,536
Yeah, I'll talk to the nurse.

1182
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,038
Hi. This is Carter.

1183
00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:41,945
What's her pressure?
