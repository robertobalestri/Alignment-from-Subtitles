1
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:10,519
Rach. Rachel.

2
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,157
Come on, honey. Time to get up.

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,559
Rachel.

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,295
Uppy, uppy, squeezer.

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,965
Daddy, I'm not a squeezer.

6
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,399
Oh, yeah?

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,869
Well, I made you
"eggs in the window."

8
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,928
Come on.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,527
Hello?

10
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:35,962
Hey, Jen.

11
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,798
She slept great.

12
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:43,236
She read<i> Winnie the Pooh</i>
and did her homework.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,439
Okay, 2:00 will be fine.

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,443
Look, I am not signing
anything until my lawyer comes...

15
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,944
There she is. She's up.

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,046
Hey, Rach.

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,570
Mom wants to talk to you.

18
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,920
Hello.

19
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:03,373
Okay.

20
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,709
I guess.

21
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,377
No.

22
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,567
Here's Daddy.

23
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,216
Yeah?

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,918
Nothing. She just got up.

25
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,554
Look, I am not bad-mouthing you.

26
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,857
Her breakfast is getting cold.

27
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,826
I'll see you at 2.

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,828
Your mom's going to come

29
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,130
pick you up later, okay?

30
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,100
How long are you
going to stay here?

31
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,467
A while,

32
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,936
so it would be great

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,137
if you could draw some pictures

34
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,193
for the walls.

35
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,574
Window's too big.

36
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,009
It still tastes good.

37
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,444
It's okay.

38
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,613
I don't like eggs.

39
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,314
Since when?

40
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,684
If Mommy said she was sorry,
would you stop being mad at her?

41
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,286
Oh, I'm not mad at Mommy.

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,255
Are you going to move
back to Milwaukee?

43
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,757
Um...

44
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,758
maybe.

45
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,825
We'll have to see.

46
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,961
When you move back home

47
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,195
can we put the fish tank

48
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,730
in my room?

49
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,831
Yeah. Sure, we can.

50
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,432
And you'll help
me take care of it

51
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,723
every day?

52
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,807
Let's go to Lou Mitchell's
and get pancakes

53
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,843
and after I drop
some stuff off at work,

54
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,178
we can go ice skating.

55
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,881
You don't know how to
skate very well, Daddy.

56
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,471
Well, then, you can teach me.

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,223
Easy, easy.

58
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,392
That's precious cargo.

59
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,994
Honey, it's okay.

60
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,262
Sign here...

61
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,130
and here...

62
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,599
and here.

63
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,733
BP is great.

64
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,801
Hmm.

65
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,203
So you finally got
a normal reading?

66
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,371
Yep. Three.

67
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,839
Good for you.

68
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,707
She's just going
to decompensate.

69
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,741
Maybe, but not here.

70
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:46,742
The nursing home

71
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,311
is all the way up in Evanston.

72
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,002
All right, let's go.

73
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,632
So Tompkins is the next patient,

74
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:54,033
and if you remember,
last time we...

75
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:56,535
Well, you're looking
much better, I see.

76
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,637
Says who?

77
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,038
Why don't you pull
Tompkins' CVP line,

78
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,039
please.

79
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,141
Doctor,

80
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,942
when is she going
to be able to walk?

81
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,410
Mr. Carter is going
to accompany you

82
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,411
downstairs,

83
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,412
and you can address

84
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,814
any further concerns
you have with him.

85
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:08,982
Please, Carter.

86
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,817
Peter, may I see you
for a minute, please?

87
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:11,918
Oh, and Carter,

88
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,319
Dr. Benton needs
some coded data sheets

89
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:14,320
for the Investigation
Review Board.

90
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:15,521
Peter, I want you to come

91
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:16,923
to a dinner party
I'm having tonight

92
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,924
for some colleagues.

93
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,259
It's 8:30 sharp.

94
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,594
We have Dean Adelstein-Fields
from Johns Hopkins...

95
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,796
Gaylord Fields?

96
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,863
Sorry about such late notice,

97
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:24,931
but you see...

98
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:25,965
what is it, Carter?

99
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,829
Just the transfer authorization.

100
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,837
Bye, Carter.

101
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,038
So that's you and a guest,

102
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:33,239
and Peter, please,

103
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,559
don't be late.

104
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,482
Well, Mrs. Tompkins...

105
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,199
Hey, we thought
we'd lost you, doc.

106
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,200
No, I'm here. Hey, Jeanie.

107
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,235
Good morning.

108
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,070
She doesn't seem to have

109
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,071
much of an appetite yet.

110
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,088
Well, Mr. Rubadoux, she...

111
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:50,423
Please. Ruby.

112
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,858
Ruby, she just had
a major surgery.

113
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,548
It takes time to recover.

114
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,879
Stop pestering the young man.

115
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,862
Who's pestering?

116
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,431
He's the only doctor

117
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,051
worth a damn in my book.

118
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,819
Uh-huh. Coughing still.

119
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,255
You know, I think the
pneumonia is back.

120
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,256
She's on powerful,

121
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,257
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

122
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,591
She's fine.

123
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,560
The convalescent home
is too far from the hospital.

124
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,761
Ruby, we've been all over this.

125
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:12,795
She looks good,

126
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,996
she's responded
well to the medication.

127
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,265
It's time for her to go.

128
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,066
You spoke to Dr. Chung
at the convalescent home,

129
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,067
and he concurs.

130
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,068
Mm. Dr. Chung.

131
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,603
Egg rolls, they
know, but medicine?

132
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,412
Jules, enough.

133
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,828
She just won't have
to stay in bed, will she?

134
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,431
Oh, she's gonna be back on
her feet in no time. I promise.

135
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:32,532
Are you sure

136
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:34,134
she shouldn't have
stayed a few more days?

137
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:36,036
Ruby, she looks great.
She's doing great.

138
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,370
Goodbye, Mrs. Rubadoux.

139
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,872
Well, God bless, Dr. Carter.

140
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,697
What a boy. What a boy.

141
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:56,006
Yes.

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,009
February's Residents' schedule.

143
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,310
ACI is done.

144
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,912
Just needs a
fever control sheet.

145
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,079
Thanks.

146
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,447
Hi, Rach. I love your outfit.

147
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,149
Carol's talking to you, honey.

148
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,784
Aunt Bubble Butt gave it to me.

149
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,152
Rach...

150
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,320
That's what you call her.

151
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:01,755
That's nice, Mark.
Aunt Bubble Butt.

152
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,123
Hey. Hey.

153
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,157
Hey.

154
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:05,425
Susie! Can I hold her?

155
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,027
Oh, yeah,

156
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:08,328
if you're really,
really careful, though.

157
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:11,532
Use both hands, honey, okay?

158
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:12,566
Oh...

159
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,300
Hey, Susie-woozie-woozie.

160
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:18,322
That's the first smile
I've seen all morning.

161
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,956
Oh. Rough couple of days?

162
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,374
You have no idea.

163
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:23,277
Aren't you supposed
to be on a swing shift?

164
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,313
Yeah, I just came by
to catch up on dictations.

165
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:28,498
I think you should
go skating instead.

166
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,717
I have so much paperwork.

167
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,485
Susie, she'd love it,

168
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,355
and, uh, you know,
it'd help me out.

169
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,328
I'm really behind.

170
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,026
Oh, what the hell. Okay.

171
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,962
Excellent.

172
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,496
Guess who's coming
skating with us?

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,865
Susie. Susie's coming.

174
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,568
Yes, as soon as I
get her all bundled up.

175
00:06:47,592 --> 00:06:48,936
Thank you.

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,937
Her too?

177
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:50,938
Of course, her too.

178
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:52,105
She's a really good skater.

179
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,907
Yeah, I'll teach you
how to do a spin.

180
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,308
I know how to do a spin.

181
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,110
Do you want to put
little Susie's cap on?

182
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,745
She'll be fine.

183
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,213
Okay.

184
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,682
Just say no to colic.

185
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:02,683
Doug, your dad's called

186
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:03,684
three times since last night.

187
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,885
If you don't call him back,

188
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,186
he's gonna keep bugging us.

189
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,188
I don't have anything
I want to say to him.

190
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:09,189
Well, his number's right there.

191
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:10,457
He's staying at the Hotel Dupre.

192
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,292
That's one step up
from a refrigerator box.

193
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,626
Carter, where you been?

194
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,095
I've been seeing patients.

195
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,496
Ah. Vucelich's data sheets.

196
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,664
Tomorrow morning before rounds.

197
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,832
Right.

198
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,833
Rubadoux's discharge summary?

199
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,034
Oh, that is in your box.

200
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,568
I finally, finally turfed her.

201
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,037
Husband drove you nuts?

202
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,638
You have no idea.

203
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,673
So...

204
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,674
who are you taking tonight?

205
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,741
What?

206
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:29,742
To Vucelich's big dinner party?

207
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:30,777
Nobody.

208
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,978
Nobody? You got
to take somebody.

209
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:32,979
No, I don't.

210
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:33,980
Yeah, you do.

211
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:34,981
He said, "Bring a guest,"

212
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,482
and that sounded like an order.

213
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:37,684
I don't know.

214
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,785
I was thinking maybe Jackie.

215
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,187
Your sister?

216
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,422
You're kidding, right?

217
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:43,756
You can't take your sister.

218
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,192
Why not?

219
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,392
Well, it just seems kind of...

220
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,393
Kind of what?

221
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,394
Pathetic.

222
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:49,896
What about, uh...

223
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,199
Carter,

224
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,599
I can find my own damn dates.

225
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:54,767
Okay, fine.

226
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,369
It's going to be a
bunch of surgeons

227
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,570
and their trophy
wives and you...

228
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:59,772
with your sister.

229
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,551
The boy with
inguinal hernia repair

230
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,252
was discharged yesterday.

231
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,987
Kids recover fast.

232
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,078
Yeah.

233
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,927
They seem to be keeping you

234
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:22,562
pretty busy down here.

235
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,896
Aerobic medicine.

236
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,265
You should see me
crawl home every night.

237
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:27,767
Yeah, well, um...

238
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,402
if you're not too tired tonight,

239
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,670
Dr. Vucelich,

240
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:32,372
this vascular surgeon
I've been assisting...

241
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:34,774
I know who Dr. Vucelich is.

242
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,576
Well, anyway, he's
having some colleagues

243
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,961
over to his house for dinner.

244
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,029
It's not a social thing.

245
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,631
It's mostly surgeons.

246
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,433
Peter, are you
asking me to dinner?

247
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,002
It's a hospital function.

248
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,172
As opposed to a date.

249
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,475
What time do we
need to be there?

250
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,042
It starts at eight.

251
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,243
He lives on North Lake Shore.

252
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,846
I can pick you up at 7:30.

253
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,380
I'll meet you there.

254
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,637
It's not a date.

255
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:05,906
We need some help lifting.

256
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,957
Wow!

257
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,224
What the hell is that?

258
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,392
Guardrail.

259
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,576
Pinned him to the car seat.

260
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,577
All right, page Benton

261
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:12,979
and call Engineering
for a metal saw.

262
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:14,597
These seats are
from a '67 GTO, right?

263
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,732
The car is toast.

264
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,000
Damn! What a waste.

265
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,201
Rollover TC on the Ike,

266
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,202
two fatalities.

267
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,203
Guy's car flipped

268
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,204
and hit the pipe guardrail.

269
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,205
Came through the windshield

270
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,206
and nailed him.

271
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,041
Absent breath
sounds on the left.

272
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,843
Chest tube tray.

273
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,545
BP is 100/60, pulse 120.

274
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:33,550
O-2 at 10 liters.
1500 cc's saline in.

275
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,618
C-spined the best we could.

276
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,520
A hell of an extrication.

277
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:37,587
BP 110 palp.

278
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,389
CBC, type and cross 10 units.

279
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,090
Get four units
O-neg, just in case.

280
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,059
How the hell am I
supposed to tube him?

281
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,293
Somebody call for a metal saw?

282
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,695
Ew.

283
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,248
Get up here and cut between
the chair and his back, now.

284
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:49,833
Gown him! Me?

285
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,033
Wow!

286
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,569
There she goes.

287
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,870
Whoa, whoa. That's a nice one.

288
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:54,871
Yeah.

289
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:55,872
I'm going to get sick.

290
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,474
Hey, you want to
show me your spin?

291
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,242
No.

292
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,910
Sorry.

293
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:01,978
So, how's she taking

294
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,179
you two getting divorced?

295
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,381
We haven't told her yet.

296
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:05,382
She's still

297
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:06,416
getting used to the separation.

298
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,017
Yeah, why don't you
Let me take Susie,

299
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,218
so you can skate with her?

300
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,253
You kidding?

301
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,554
This is what's holding me up.

302
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,424
Yes.

303
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,493
Come on, Miss Munchkin.

304
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,595
Oh, you are so funny.

305
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,413
Are you ready?

306
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:21,581
Here comes Dad!

307
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:22,582
Whoo!

308
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,417
Why do you stick
your butt out so far?

309
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,453
I just got to tuck it in here.

310
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:28,220
Is that what... Whoa!

311
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:31,057
Oh-ho! Nice!

312
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,425
Half a grundoolie.

313
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,861
I give it a 6.5.

314
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:35,862
Oh, hey, Rachel,

315
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,063
you want me to show you

316
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,465
a special way to tie your skates

317
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:39,583
really tight

318
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:40,917
so your ankles stay straight?

319
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,053
I want to tie my skates
like Mommy does.

320
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,320
Rachel... It's okay.

321
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,728
I don't want her
touching my skates.

322
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:48,942
Sorry.

323
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,686
Maybe this was a bad idea.

324
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,630
Rach.

325
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,434
Rach!

326
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,437
Rachel.

327
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,171
Gown me.

328
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,006
My first medical consult.

329
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,875
O.R.'s ready.

330
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:06,876
Carter, Vucelich's charts

331
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,144
been done for those data sheets?

332
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,646
Uh, almost.

333
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,047
What do you want me to do?

334
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,049
Throw in a left chest tube.

335
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,684
36 French.

336
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,087
BP's fallen, 50 systolic.

337
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,457
Uh...

338
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:21,491
10 blade.

339
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,492
Okay, crank up the saline.

340
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,493
Two more units

341
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,061
packed cells on the infuser.

342
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,095
Bullet.

343
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,129
High-speed impalement injury,

344
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,148
hypovolemic shock.

345
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:29,816
Widened mediastinum.

346
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,102
Maybe a traumatic
rupture of the aorta.

347
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,803
Somebody call Vucelich.

348
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,804
Thora-Seal's filling.

349
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,105
Let's get him upstairs.

350
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,707
We'll do a trans-esophageal
echo before we prep.

351
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,708
Carter, where are you going?

352
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,709
To the O.R.

353
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,311
Uh-uh, not when
you have work to do.

354
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,313
Dr. Benton, I think he
ought to see this case.

355
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,214
Oh, there he is. Dr. Carter.

356
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,248
She said her chest hurt,

357
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,249
then she passed out.

358
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,651
They tried to go
to another hospital,

359
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:49,652
but I insisted

360
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,253
that they bring her
back here to you.

361
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,254
Okay, people. Let's move.

362
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,289
Carter, tend to your patient.

363
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,291
I want to go to
the O.R. with you.

364
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,292
Not anymore, you're not.

365
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,493
Don't make a career of her.

366
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,512
You've got things to do. Move!

367
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,636
Dr. Carter, please.

368
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,955
Well, day care time.

369
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,758
Say goodbye to Rachel.

370
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,826
Bye-bye, Rachel.

371
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,161
Say bye, Rach.

372
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,729
Dr. Greene,

373
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:17,797
your wife called.

374
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,798
Her doctor's appointment

375
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,932
got changed.

376
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,668
Why you working behind
the counter, E-Ray?

377
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,169
Jerry got the flu.

378
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:24,270
I thought I might supplement

379
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,605
my meager nurse trainee stipend

380
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,239
with an occasional
clerking shift.

381
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,941
Does personnel know about this?

382
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:29,975
Oh, yes.

383
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,143
I'm over-qualified, actually.

384
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,979
120 words per minute,
shorthand, IBM, Mac,

385
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,980
four kinds of word processing,

386
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,981
spreadsheets.

387
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:36,982
Yeah, did she say

388
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,384
when she was going to get here?

389
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,385
As soon as she can.

390
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:40,453
Right.

391
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:41,454
Okay, Rach,

392
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,055
let's get you set
up in the lounge.

393
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,557
Mark, we need you in Trauma 2.

394
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,225
Uh, I'll take her.

395
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:50,080
Licensed Illinois
day care worker.

396
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,669
All right, easy now.

397
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,810
Tie that bleeder off.

398
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,493
All right. We have exposure.

399
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,495
Finally, we can do some work.

400
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,796
The arch has been grazed.

401
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,830
It could blow.

402
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,599
We're gonna have to bypass him.

403
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,401
Let's take this nice and slow.

404
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,703
Set up the roller pump
and call in the Tech.

405
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,021
We should clamp and run.

406
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,039
No, there's more damage
than the echo showed pre-op.

407
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,309
He's unstable and
this aorta could blow

408
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,476
any second.

409
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,261
If we bypass him,
we've got a safety net.

410
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:24,347
By the time we
set up for a bypass,

411
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,548
we could clamp
proximally and distally,

412
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,684
pull out the rail,
and sew in a graft.

413
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,369
How long will that take?

414
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,121
I'll be out in 35 minutes.

415
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,022
Get me an ETA on Vucelich.

416
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,357
At least half an hour.

417
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,958
We could be closing
when he gets here.

418
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,092
It's too risky.

419
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,795
I've assisted on
five of these things.

420
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,796
I've done two myself.

421
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
I can do this.

422
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,651
You heard the man.

423
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:46,970
Let's do it.

424
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,804
Statinsky.

425
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,140
Found at Louie's
Ribs, passed out drunk.

426
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,808
Acute respiratory distress.

427
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,477
She won't give us her name.

428
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,179
Is that bourbon or Scotch?

429
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,813
BP 70/50, pulse 120,

430
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,515
GCS, eight.

431
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,850
I gave her glucose, Narcan,

432
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,352
and 40 of Lasix.

433
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,652
Okay, let's move her.

434
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,457
Ready? Set?

435
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,481
Go.

436
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,394
Really cyanotic.

437
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,030
Pulse ox 72.

438
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,865
She's in pulmonary edema.

439
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,372
Intubation tray, ET tube 7.0.

440
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,754
I'm gonna have to put a
tube down your windpipe

441
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,722
to allow you to breathe, okay?

442
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:25,208
So just try... try
and relax, okay?

443
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,725
Rapid sequence induction?

444
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:29,262
Oh, definitely bourbon.

445
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,381
Let's try two of Versed first,

446
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:34,217
and get a blood
gas, CBC, Chem-7,

447
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,618
enzymes,

448
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,702
portable chest,

449
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:38,104
check for I.D.

450
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,439
BP's 80/50.

451
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,706
Dopamine drip?

452
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,058
Yeah.

453
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,476
All right, I'm in.

454
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,644
Inflate the cuff.

455
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:45,812
V-fib.

456
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,246
Charging to 200.

457
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,270
Everybody off.

458
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,309
Just a sec.

459
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:55,972
Okay.

460
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,095
Clear.

461
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,045
Sinus tach. Faint pulse.

462
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,714
Lidocaine, 100 IV Push.

463
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,983
Hang a drip, two
milligrams a minute.

464
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,319
Shoot a chest, get a
gas, and call Respiratory.

465
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,788
Lidocaine 2 grams.

466
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,055
Name's Barbara Dean.

467
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,657
Wow.

468
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:15,859
Wow what?

469
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,060
Today's her 50th birthday.

470
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,061
No kidding.

471
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,062
Nope.

472
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,466
She looks pretty old for 50.

473
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,703
Looks like she did all
her partying up front.

474
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:27,686
Sylvie.

475
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,687
I'm getting good returns.

476
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:29,688
Sylvie?

477
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:30,890
She needs a Foley.

478
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:34,060
Come on, honey. I'm
right here, sweetheart.

479
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:37,964
Sylvie, please...
She's not responding.

480
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:39,415
She may have had a small stroke.

481
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,666
Stroke?

482
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,352
Can you be careful
of the sterile field?

483
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,753
She had a stroke?

484
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,855
It's really too
early to tell that.

485
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,792
She was fine until I took
her to the nursing home.

486
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:50,359
Ruby, give us room to work.

487
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,710
What happened, Dr. Carter?

488
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,213
Did she leave the
hospital too soon?

489
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,716
I'll be back in a minute.

490
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,918
Stroke?

491
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:02,544
We are going to take
very good care of her.

492
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:06,993
Eww!

493
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,695
E-Ray, what is that?

494
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,829
Skin lesions.

495
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:11,597
This is nightmare material.

496
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:13,032
On the contrary, Dr. Greene.

497
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,868
Children greatly benefit
from confronting their fears

498
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,104
in a supportive and
nurturing environment.

499
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:19,638
It's cool, Daddy.

500
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,541
We're going to go finish
<i>The Little Mermaid,</i> okay?

501
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,344
Yes, Mrs. Hardy, we need
you to sign some papers.

502
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:26,746
Yes. She was.

503
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,048
Well, she's extremely ill...

504
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,518
I understand, but your
mother's in grave condition.

505
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,619
Old records on Barbara Dean.

506
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:34,620
She hung up.

507
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:38,057
Detox twice, D.T.'s,
fractured wrist,

508
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,994
collarbone, seizures,
end-stage liver disease,

509
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:43,029
and cardiomyopathy.

510
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:45,664
Well, her daughter
won't come in.

511
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,066
Said she's had enough.

512
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,103
Mrs. Dean seems to
have had enough too.

513
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,105
Dr. Ross, it's
your father again.

514
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:53,206
Tell him I died.

515
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,241
Beautiful funeral,
everybody cried.

516
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,509
You are not going
to believe this one.

517
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,711
Oh, yeah? Try us.

518
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:00,747
Guess who's in the suture room.

519
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:01,748
Come on, guess.

520
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,082
We don't want to guess.

521
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,052
He's wearing a Catholic
schoolgirl's outfit...

522
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,302
Plaid skirt,

523
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,739
ballet slippers, frilly blouse.

524
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:13,731
David Morgenstern ring a bell?

525
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,579
Our David Morgenstern?

526
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:17,646
Knee socks too.

527
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,782
Somebody get a camera.

528
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,534
Let's go.

529
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:22,902
This aorta's shredded.

530
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:25,037
It's not holding
the sutures. Damn.

531
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,823
He's had 14 units
of blood, two of FFP,

532
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,925
and six of platelets.

533
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,594
He's got to be chewing
up clotting factors.

534
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,961
Retract this way. I can't see.

535
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:33,962
Where is Vucelich?

536
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,964
He's scrubbing in.

537
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,132
BP's crashing.

538
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,933
If only I could... if I
could just... damn!

539
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,669
Suction! Suction. Let's move.

540
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,906
I've got an angle
on it. Give it here.

541
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,458
Gown me.

542
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,526
Traumatic dissection
of the aorta.

543
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,329
We elected to clamp and
run rather than bypass.

544
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:51,998
What have you been
débriding with, Benton?

545
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:53,632
Garden shears?

546
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,052
It's... it's hard to
appreciate the degree of...

547
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,437
I went the wrong way with this.

548
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:58,838
All right, let me
in there, Benton.

549
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,127
Get out of the way.

550
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,693
Side clamp.

551
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:08,698
The dissection's high
in the arch and posterior.

552
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:11,450
2.0 Prolene, 24
inches, retract caudally.

553
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:13,418
Shall we go on bypass?

554
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:14,487
No.

555
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,822
No. I think we're okay now, huh?

556
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,090
It's my fault.

557
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:21,577
I allowed Benton's enthusiasm
to cloud my judgment.

558
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,946
All right, tie it off here.

559
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,315
No, no. It's too long.

560
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,349
Yes. Yes.

561
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,417
Adson.

562
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,252
Bovie there.

563
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,520
Hmm. Good.

564
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,557
Got it.

565
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,959
Okay, Bovie that.

566
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:40,729
Mosquito. No, tie that off.

567
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,054
Okay, let's dissect this.

568
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:47,753
Hey, Jeanie.

569
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:48,954
Uh, is he still hanging around?

570
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:49,955
Yeah.

571
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:53,359
Dr. Carter. She's
not responding.

572
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,394
H-how long is she
going to stay down here?

573
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:56,996
Believe me, nobody
wants to get her admitted

574
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,997
more than I do.

575
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,131
Carter, I need you.

576
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,699
Her heart monitor beeped.

577
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,101
Yeah, that's what
it's supposed to do.

578
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,802
Ruby, I got another patient.

579
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,204
Hey, Ruby, let's go take a look

580
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,207
to make sure everything's okay.

581
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,442
Yeah. Another adolescent
fantasy shot to hell.

582
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:12,744
Nice knees.

583
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:13,745
Hey, you guys,

584
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,147
we get an 8 x 10 glossy,

585
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:17,171
none of us'll ever
work holidays again.

586
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,186
Doug, two boys
playing in the street

587
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,254
hit by a car.

588
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:23,822
Paramedics are two minutes out.

589
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:26,291
Man, I miss all the fun
stuff. Come on, Carol.

590
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,459
Why me?

591
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,561
I don't get to see,
you don't get to see.

592
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,629
That's not fair.

593
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,097
Care to join me, Dr. Lewis?

594
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,999
Oh, I'd be delighted,
Dr. Greene.

595
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:37,569
Mark, Susan, thank God.
I'm feeling a bit foolish.

596
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,071
No doubt.

597
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,472
What seems to be the problem?

598
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:43,275
Oh, showing off
tossing the caber.

599
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,110
I clunked myself,
the buffet table,

600
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:48,480
and my Great Aunt Jean Ferguson.

601
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:49,481
The caber?

602
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,483
Big telephone pole thing.

603
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:55,871
You pick it up, and you...
and it's not light, mind you,

604
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,105
and you...

605
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,142
flip it upside down,
or you, you try to.

606
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,178
The Highland
Games. Burns' supper.

607
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,880
My leg's killing me.

608
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,148
So...

609
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,217
that's a kilt?

610
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,854
Well, of course it's
a... what else would it..?

611
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,824
I see what you're saying.

612
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,093
Well, that would
be embarrassing.

613
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,479
Russian Jew on my father's side.

614
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:23,565
Full-blooded Highland
Scot on my mother's.

615
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,799
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

616
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,902
Oh, yeah, it's probably broken.

617
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,237
Oh, damn.

618
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,304
Hey, Jeanie.

619
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,040
Look, I, uh, hope you haven't

620
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,208
gone through a lot
of trouble tonight,

621
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,276
but dinner's off.

622
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,045
Really? They canceled this late?

623
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,146
No, no, no, no.

624
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,347
I, um, I got a post-op

625
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,881
with a lot of complications.

626
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,484
I'm going to be hung
up here all night. Sorry.

627
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,219
Guess I'll cancel my makeover.

628
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,554
That was a joke.

629
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,688
Some other time.

630
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,174
Yeah.

631
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:50,575
Twofer. Brothers.

632
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,644
Noah's nine, Kenny's
seven. Skitching behind a bus.

633
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,013
Kenny fell off, Noah let
go, and a car hit them.

634
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,715
Kenny's hurt real bad.

635
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,616
All right, hang in there, Noah.

636
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,918
Skitching?

637
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,720
When you grab the
bumper of a moving car,

638
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:03,121
and it drags you along the ice.

639
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:04,355
Seven-year-old's
dinged pretty badly.

640
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:09,360
Head trauma, ALOC. GCS
10, BP 60/40, pulse 144,

641
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,662
probably femur fracture,

642
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,664
and he's got a tire track
across his abdomen.

643
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,799
And what about Noah?

644
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:15,767
Stable, good vitals,
couple of cuts,

645
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,902
maybe a fractured wrist.

646
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:19,104
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

647
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,972
All right, let's
get X-ray in here.

648
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,608
Portable C-spine, CBC,
type and cross six units.

649
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,043
Babinski's downgoing.

650
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,244
BP's down, 50 palp.

651
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:27,679
Pulse 150.

652
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,115
Get two of O-negative
down here stat.

653
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,317
Absent bowel
sounds, belly's rigid.

654
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:33,384
Intubation tray.

655
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,753
Excuse me.

656
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:37,355
Uncuffed number five ET tube.

657
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,157
Stabilize his neck for me.

658
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,658
Head CT, non-contrast?

659
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:42,160
Here we go.

660
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:45,563
I'll order a C-spine,
chest, pelvis, right femur.

661
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,200
Set up for a peritoneal
lavage, please.

662
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:52,570
Uh-huh. I'll be next door.

663
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:53,839
Who's on Pediatric surgery?

664
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:55,073
Kenny! Kenny!

665
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:56,674
Calm down, Noah.
You're going to be fine.

666
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:59,111
What about Kenny?
Is he going to be okay?

667
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:00,245
Is he going to die?

668
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,247
Taking care of him, Noah.

669
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,982
It's my fault.

670
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:04,983
How is he? He's lucky.

671
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,169
Just a couple lacerations,

672
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,437
road rash, left wrist fracture.

673
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,622
Kenny! Kenny!

674
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:12,240
Noah, you're going
to have to calm down.

675
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,725
Kenny's going to
have to have surgery,

676
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,927
and we need to know
where your parents are.

677
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,396
He is going to die, isn't he?

678
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,864
Where are your parents?

679
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:21,488
I don't know where my mom
is, and my dad's not around.

680
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,768
I recognize this kid.

681
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,021
Noah, you've been
in here before, right?

682
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,438
Don't let him die, please, okay?

683
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,007
We're prepped for the DPL.

684
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,976
Listen, Noah, you
need to calm down

685
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,529
and try to remember
where your dad is, okay?

686
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,731
Parents are nowhere to be found.

687
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,615
We got to do this
without their consent.

688
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:38,616
Here's the blood.

689
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,717
All right, notify O.R.

690
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,737
and the Pediatric
surgeon on call, please.

691
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,305
O-neg at 20 per kilogram.

692
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,606
I figure 500 cc's.

693
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,941
Sounds about right.

694
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,348
Mm-hmm. Okay.

695
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,797
Tap's positive.

696
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,335
Dr. Carter, could you explain

697
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,704
what's going on with my Sylvie

698
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:00,939
to Dr. Goldstein?

699
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,307
Dr. Goldstein?

700
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:03,675
Carter?

701
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,361
He's the upstairs neighbor
of my sister in Miami.

702
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,696
Carter.

703
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,082
Uh, just get a number for
me and I'll call him back.

704
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:11,083
Carter!

705
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:13,736
Where are Vucelich's
data sheets?

706
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,371
Uh, I'm not quite
done with them yet.

707
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,105
Carter, what the hell
have you been doing?

708
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,375
I've been trying to get
Mrs. Rubadoux readmitted.

709
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,376
Cardiology won't take her

710
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,744
because there's no confirmed MI.

711
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,379
Renal won't take her
because she's in failure.

712
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,381
Carter, she's one patient. One.

713
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,215
Get her admitted and finish
Vucelich's data sheets, okay?

714
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,034
Okay.

715
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,502
Mrs. Dean?

716
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:32,104
I'm Dr. Lewis.

717
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:35,507
Lily tells me you took
your intubation tube out.

718
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:38,110
We don't usually
encourage that here,

719
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:41,947
but I'll take it as a sign
that you're feeling better?

720
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:43,182
Like a million bucks.

721
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,820
In your records, there's a
Do Not Resuscitate order.

722
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,822
I'd like to remove it.

723
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:53,442
No. Leave it.

724
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:56,211
You're in impending
respiratory failure.

725
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,414
It's treatable,

726
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,671
but we need to put
you on a respirator.

727
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:08,012
Mrs. Dean, you're
only 50 years old.

728
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,461
Leave it.

729
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,379
Leave it.

730
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:22,354
Well, it's not an emergency.

731
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,155
I just wanted to tell them,

732
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,925
that I'm not coming
to the dinner tonight.

733
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,527
Dr. Benton, are you ill?

734
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,830
And by that, I mean do
you have a terminal disease

735
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:34,866
to which you will succumb
before 11:00 tonight?

736
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,603
Then I suggest you
arrive promptly at 8:00

737
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:39,771
and enjoy your evening.

738
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,640
Well, I'm not sure
he wants me to come.

739
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:43,141
Of course he wants you.

740
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:46,678
You're filling in for a
last-minute cancellation.

741
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,213
Marian doesn't like empty chairs

742
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,048
at her dinner parties.

743
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,450
Think of it this way:

744
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,751
his dinners are
like his surgeries.

745
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:55,454
When your presence is requested,

746
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:56,593
you don't decline.

747
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:02,394
Any word from my wife yet?

748
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,761
On her way.

749
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,831
Is someone poking
out a cat's eye in there?

750
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:08,815
I told him it was
okay to practice.

751
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,509
It looks like you have
a non-displaced fracture

752
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:18,776
of the distal fibula.

753
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,811
Damn!

754
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,513
You're going to need a cast.

755
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:23,248
I'm going to miss the haggis.

756
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,649
Boys'll be disappointed.

757
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:26,118
Uh-huh. I'll call Ortho.

758
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:27,652
I was supposed to cut it.

759
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,020
Great honor.

760
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:32,324
Nephews were going to
pipe me in and everything.

761
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:35,293
Even memorized Robbie
Burns' "To a Haggis."

762
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,129
Uh-huh.

763
00:25:37,153 --> 00:25:38,130
<i>His knife</i>

764
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:40,048
<i>See rustic labour dight</i>

765
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,967
<i>And cut you up
with ready sight...</i>

766
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:44,853
Yeah, this is Greene in the ER.

767
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,821
<i>Your burde, like a distant hill,</i>

768
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,857
<i>Your pin wad help to mend a mill</i>

769
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,125
<i>In time of need</i>

770
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,476
<i>While through your pores</i>

771
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,985
<i>The dews distill like amber bead</i>

772
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,532
Dinner's back on.

773
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,767
Excuse me?

774
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,603
I can make it after
all, if it's cool with you.

775
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,526
Uh, sure. Yeah.
I'll see you later.

776
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,444
Hey, Rach. How's it going?

777
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,545
Okay.

778
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,215
Your mom's going
to be here real soon

779
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,549
to pick you up.

780
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,718
So, who's winning?

781
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,121
She is. Good, too.

782
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,889
Thanks for watching her, Malik.

783
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,058
Hey, no problem.
I had four sisters.

784
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,026
Mark, can I steal
you for a consult?

785
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,562
Sure. I'll be back in a sec.

786
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,030
No, you won't.

787
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,935
I'll be back as soon as I can.

788
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,702
I finally remembered him.

789
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,038
The father was in last Fall

790
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,872
with respiratory
and liver problems.

791
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,308
Passed out in his own vomit.

792
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:40,809
Noah called 911 and saved him.

793
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,277
Father of the Year candidate.

794
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,813
Yup. He's been in six
times in the past two years.

795
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,415
He's a real mess.
The DCFS guy's here.

796
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,283
Dad's a drunk, kids
are playing in the street

797
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,018
in the middle of a school day,

798
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,619
and who says the
American family's in decline?

799
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,620
How are you doing?

800
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,822
So, what's wrong with you guys?

801
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,023
How long's it going to take

802
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,008
for you to get these
kids out of the home?

803
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,845
Dave Donovan.
Nice to meet you too.

804
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,880
Got a long history with
the Krawcyzk family.

805
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:03,882
Mother's MIA. Dad's been
on a bender for three years,

806
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,917
but he's cleaned
up pretty well now...

807
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:06,935
AA, job...

808
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,570
How's Kenny?

809
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:09,738
Uh, ruptured spleen,

810
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,372
concussion,
fracture of the thigh.

811
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,356
He's up in surgery.

812
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,358
He's going to be okay.

813
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,726
And Noah?

814
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,980
We're going to admit him
until you find him a placement.

815
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,547
Not looking for one.

816
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,748
Father's on his way in.

817
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,850
So what?

818
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,585
Father lets his kids run wild.

819
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,154
They're boys. Screwed
up. They played hookey.

820
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,156
No, no, no. The
father screwed up.

821
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,524
Yeah, maybe, maybe not.

822
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,625
So that's it?

823
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,194
That's all you're going to do?

824
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:34,429
Look, let's just wait and see.

825
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,464
Okay.

826
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,465
John, hold on.

827
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,566
I'm in a hurry.

828
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,934
This will only take a sec.

829
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:39,968
Rubadoux. You haven't told him

830
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,169
how serious his
wife's condition is.

831
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,370
Yeah, I tried to,

832
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,005
but I couldn't get a
word in edgewise.

833
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,807
He needs to know so
he can say goodbye,

834
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,808
get their affairs in order.

835
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,209
Why does it have to be me?

836
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,210
He trusts you.

837
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,211
I have to go.

838
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,212
Just do it?

839
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,213
Yeah.

840
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,314
Karen Hardy.

841
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,517
She's been there
for about 20 minutes.

842
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,452
Her mother signed a DNR order.

843
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,387
She hasn't budged
from that spot.

844
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,657
I'm afraid she may
challenge the order.

845
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,026
Mrs. Hardy, this is Dr. Greene.

846
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,361
She's been in and
out all afternoon.

847
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,596
This would be a good
time to go and see her.

848
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,664
No, thanks.

849
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,934
This glass between
us is just fine.

850
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,569
Your mother's
condition is very grave.

851
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,855
We can't be sure that
she's going to pull through.

852
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,078
Did she ask to see me?

853
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,532
No.

854
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:25,363
No, the only thing she's
ever really wanted to see

855
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:27,315
is the bottom of
a bottle of booze.

856
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,117
Your mother's dying,
and she's asked

857
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,652
that no heroic measures
be taken to save her life.

858
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,254
You understand the implications

859
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,338
of her request?

860
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,074
She wants to die.

861
00:28:36,098 --> 00:28:38,477
She can't face the truth,

862
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,378
that she's an alcoholic.

863
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,113
She'd never admit that.

864
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,649
I don't know why
parents lie to their kids.

865
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:47,040
Children know.

866
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:49,621
Always.

867
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,789
If there's a chance
to make peace,

868
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,325
you should talk to her.

869
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:55,660
I don't want to see her.

870
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:57,562
I believe you, but you have

871
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,952
been standing
here for 20 minutes.

872
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,836
You said there were some
papers that I should sign?

873
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,663
Yeah. They're at the desk.

874
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:16,597
Rheumatology,
no. Orthopedics, no.

875
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,099
What are you doing?

876
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,468
Oh, I'm trying to find a study

877
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,603
that'll take Mrs. Rubadoux.

878
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,105
Neurology... bingo.

879
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,508
Dr. Carter?

880
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,977
Yeah, this is Carter in the ER.

881
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,913
I've got a patient for your
nerve stimulation study.

882
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,514
Post-op ischemic myelopathy.

883
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,016
You'll see her?

884
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,451
Well, you're going
to have to hurry,

885
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,888
because Cardiology's
interested too.

886
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:42,190
All right, I'll save
her for you. Okay.

887
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,892
She's admitted, Ruby. Neurology.

888
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,060
They're on their way
down to see her now.

889
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,329
You'll still be her
doctor too, right?

890
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,563
Oh, I'll visit, but, uh...

891
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,565
I'm assigned to
the surgical service.

892
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,967
B-but the Neurology people,

893
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,936
they're the ones
to help her, right?

894
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,404
That's right.

895
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,706
And... and she's
going to be okay?

896
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,508
They're the people to see.

897
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,833
Neuro. Bye, now. God bless.

898
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,199
A-ha-ha.

899
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,400
Thanks, Malik.

900
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:10,068
I've got a couple minutes.

901
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:11,725
Hey, no problem.

902
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:18,743
Rach, you and
I, we need to talk.

903
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:25,983
You know... that you will
always have a mom and a dad

904
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,419
who love you very much.

905
00:30:27,443 --> 00:30:30,205
See my fish?

906
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,774
When you move back home,

907
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,376
can we get

908
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,262
another angel fish to
keep Moby company?

909
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:41,654
Yes. Moby can
have a new friend...

910
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,926
but Daddy's not
moving back home.

911
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:53,428
The truth is, you are
going to have two homes

912
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,730
from now on...

913
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,598
One with Mommy, one with me.

914
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:02,959
Mommy and Daddy aren't
going to live together anymore.

915
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:09,678
I know you're
sad... and angry...

916
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:16,106
but I want you to talk to
me about anything, okay?

917
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,776
Believe me, Daddy wishes

918
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,979
it could be any
other way than this.

919
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:30,415
It's just...

920
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,750
Hey, Jen.

921
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,952
Rach and I, we were
just having a talk.

922
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,120
That's good, Mark.

923
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,856
Hey, bananafish,
I'm sorry I'm late.

924
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,392
Mommy got her cast off today.

925
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:43,861
Come on, let's start
packing up your stuff.

926
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:44,862
We're going to go.

927
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:46,298
No!

928
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:47,799
Come on, honey.

929
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,217
You can do lanyards in the car.

930
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,218
Stop it!

931
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,219
Put your knapsack on.

932
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,221
Get away!

933
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,223
Oh, no. You don't talk
to your mother that way.

934
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,258
That's enough. Come on.

935
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,776
No way. I don't want to go! No!

936
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,262
I don't want to go.

937
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:05,266
Get away. Get away!

938
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,235
I don't want to go! No!

939
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,536
Let me alone!

940
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,770
Get away!

941
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,706
I don't want to go!

942
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,576
No!

943
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,799
Get away!

944
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,868
Hello.

945
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,102
Hi. I'm Peter Benton.

946
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,671
Peter, I'm Marian Vucelich.

947
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,172
Nice to meet you.

948
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,807
My guest should
be arriving soon.

949
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,009
She is already here.

950
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,544
Will you excuse me for a moment?

951
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,602
Oh, sure.

952
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,453
Thought your plans
changed again.

953
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,088
Yeah. Traffic was bad.

954
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,189
You look nice.

955
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,891
So do you.

956
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,426
Ladies and gentlemen...

957
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,262
it looks like everyone's
finally arrived, huh?

958
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,997
So...

959
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,199
dinner is served.

960
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,035
Mr. Krawcyzk, I'm Dr. Ross.

961
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,170
How's Kenny? When can I see him?

962
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,638
He's still in surgery.

963
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,473
But he's going to be all right.

964
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,175
Yes, he is. Can we have..?

965
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,777
Can I talk to you out here?

966
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:23,778
Sure.

967
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:24,934
Excuse us.

968
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,550
Why aren't these kids in school?

969
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,553
I already talked to the
social worker about that.

970
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,021
Indulge me, indulge me.

971
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,891
I usually drop them off,
but I got a new job this week,

972
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,843
and they're supposed
to take the bus.

973
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,661
And how did you
lose your old job?

974
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,129
I quit my old job

975
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,331
when they switched me to
nights, not that it's your business.

976
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,367
It's my business when these
boys are brought to the ER.

977
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:49,320
They ditched school,
so they'll be punished.

978
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:50,521
I believe they've
been punished enough.

979
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:51,538
What do you mean?

980
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:52,956
Doug...

981
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,559
I don't know what your game
is, doc, but me and my boys...

982
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,361
How many times have
you been in here drunk?

983
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:58,396
What?

984
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,164
Doug, what the
hell are you doing?

985
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,298
My job.

986
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:03,100
Look, the last time
this guy was in here,

987
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,468
he was circling the drain.

988
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:05,669
I think he's trying.

989
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,804
People don't
change. Sure they do.

990
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:10,007
You want to beat up on
a father, call your own.

991
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,631
This guy's doing the
best he can. All right?

992
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,131
How are you feeling?

993
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,365
Disappointed.

994
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,135
They'll be cutting
the haggis about now.

995
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,905
Do you hear that?

996
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,996
Yeah, I hear that.

997
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,168
My boys!

998
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,659
My nephews!

999
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,321
This is great!

1000
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,823
Those are his nephews?

1001
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,626
A Scotsman loves a
man who never gives up.

1002
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,027
"A man's a man for a' that,"

1003
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:04,044
says Robbie Burns.

1004
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,013
Here's to you, Uncle Davey.

1005
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,015
The haggis! Oh-ho!

1006
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,718
We couldn't do it
without you, Uncle Davey.

1007
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,220
You do the cutting.

1008
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,922
<i>His knife see rustic labor dight</i>

1009
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,692
<i>And cut you up with ready sight</i>

1010
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,194
<i>Trenching your
gushing entrails bright</i>

1011
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,428
<i>Like onie ditch</i>

1012
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,781
<i>And then, oh, what
a glorious sight</i>

1013
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,733
<i>Warm, reeking, rich</i>

1014
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,024
Let's eat.

1015
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,206
Oh, bless you.

1016
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,791
L'chaim!

1017
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,495
Long may your loom reek.

1018
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:40,197
What is this?

1019
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,166
Sheep's blood,
intestines, and testicles

1020
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,335
mixed in a gruel.

1021
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:45,359
L'chaim!

1022
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,422
Mrs. Hardy?

1023
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,446
Hi.

1024
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:55,696
Are you all right?

1025
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,666
I used to watch her
like this when I was little.

1026
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,103
Passed out on the sofa,

1027
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:04,138
kitchen floor, front steps.

1028
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,774
I never waited
around long enough

1029
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,475
for her to wake up.

1030
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,346
Too afraid when I was a child,

1031
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,817
too angry later on.

1032
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,419
I just don't seem
to have the energy

1033
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:22,656
for fear or anger.

1034
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,093
I can't decide if that's
a good sign or not.

1035
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,195
Well, here's to
arteriosclerosis...

1036
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,565
without which I could not
be offering you this exquisite

1037
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,667
'85 Corton-Charlemagne.

1038
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,168
Beware.

1039
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,504
The last time Carl
uncorked a bottle,

1040
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,507
I bought 5% of his
miracle drug, Lazerol,

1041
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,476
by the end of the evening.

1042
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,877
To Lazerol!

1043
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,345
I'm Anne Adelstein.

1044
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,847
I don't believe we've met.

1045
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,948
I'm Peter Benton.

1046
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,750
I've read your work on dialysis.

1047
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,118
It was very impressive.

1048
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,385
My husband, Martin.

1049
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:54,788
Troffle d'or?

1050
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,024
Are you the visiting
Ortho fellow?

1051
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,125
No, darling.

1052
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,027
He's Carl's newly anointed.

1053
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,130
Ah, yes. The chosen one.

1054
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,966
The heir apparent.

1055
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,755
Carl has an eye for talent.

1056
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,137
To the heir apparent.

1057
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,975
Not after this afternoon.

1058
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:14,976
Why, what happened?

1059
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,079
I made a fool out
of myself in surgery.

1060
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,081
Vucelich was just too polite

1061
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,682
to kick me off the
team before dinner.

1062
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,817
Ooh, I'm sorry.

1063
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,620
Jeanie?

1064
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,389
Hmm?

1065
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,979
Where's the truffle?

1066
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,119
You got me. Maybe there.

1067
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,351
Thanks again for
a lovely evening.

1068
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,418
Our pleasure.

1069
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,419
Bye.

1070
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,754
Thank you.

1071
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,544
Thanks.

1072
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:05,926
Quite the evening.

1073
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,829
Yeah, yeah. I had a good time.

1074
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,965
Yeah. Me too.

1075
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,867
Well, um...

1076
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:13,868
Peter?

1077
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16,470
Peter, do you have a moment?

1078
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,239
Of course.

1079
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,273
Good night.

1080
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,274
Good night.

1081
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,731
Good night.

1082
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,732
Dr. Lewis, please...

1083
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:30,556
there's something wrong.

1084
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,173
On 100% O2, her
pulse ox is down to 70.

1085
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:37,874
She's in respiratory failure.

1086
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,376
What's wrong?

1087
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,744
Heart rate's down to 40.

1088
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,012
Dobutamine, dopamine, Levofed...

1089
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:43,014
They're all maxed.

1090
00:38:43,038 --> 00:38:45,899
Do something.

1091
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,802
Your mother signed a
Do Not Resuscitate order.

1092
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,403
You have to help her!

1093
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:54,747
Her breathing's agonal,
no BP, pulse down to 30.

1094
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:58,078
Aren't you going to do anything?

1095
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,947
We have to respect her wishes.

1096
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,271
She was very clear.

1097
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,768
Brandy, or should
we have some port?

1098
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,936
Uh, no, I don't drink.

1099
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,303
Don't drink?

1100
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:41,772
Well, how in the world

1101
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,041
are you going to
enjoy your Cohiba?

1102
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:45,943
Castro's favorite.

1103
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,345
Rolled on the thighs of virgins.

1104
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,915
Um... I don't smoke, either.

1105
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:52,983
Please, Peter,
you're contributing

1106
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,686
to the appalling
demise of social ritual.

1107
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,021
I'll tell you what.

1108
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:59,823
Let me just put this beside you.

1109
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:06,664
It will make me feel
oh, so much better.

1110
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:09,066
I'm sorry about this
afternoon's surgery.

1111
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,869
I... I know it was
disappointing for you.

1112
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:13,136
It was for me.

1113
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,305
It was.

1114
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,741
Dr. Hicks was absolutely right.

1115
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:20,578
I did overstep my bounds.

1116
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:22,179
You did.

1117
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:24,832
That's exactly
what I expect of you.

1118
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,834
Angela Hicks is
a superb surgeon.

1119
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:30,670
I've never known her to
make a significant error.

1120
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,140
But the physician
that is useful to me

1121
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:37,144
is the one who has the vision
to keep one eye on the details

1122
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,413
while the other eye
roams the horizons.

1123
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,515
Peter, to me,
medicine is a challenge.

1124
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,651
It's full of highly
skilled drudgery.

1125
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,354
There are plenty of
talented surgeons out there,

1126
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,488
man and woman alike,

1127
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,707
who simply want to
perfect the practice

1128
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:52,576
of what's already
been accomplished.

1129
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,710
My interest lies

1130
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:54,945
in what's beyond that...

1131
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:57,164
The puzzles, the
impossibles, the risks.

1132
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,501
Well, that's why it's been
an honor to work with you.

1133
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,686
Is it? Really?

1134
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,856
Hmm. To tell you
the truth, Peter,

1135
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,274
I really haven't
been able to tell

1136
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,475
whether you like it or not.

1137
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,676
No, no, no, believe me,

1138
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,612
it's been the best
and hardest work

1139
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,780
I've ever done.

1140
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,247
Good. Good.

1141
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,349
That's music to my ears.

1142
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,519
I was beginning
to fear that I saw

1143
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,586
something in you

1144
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,754
that you didn't see

1145
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,222
in yourself.

1146
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,925
I want to see it.

1147
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,482
I'll drink to that.

1148
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,844
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

1149
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,128
Hey, what are you doing

1150
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,696
sitting here in the dark?

1151
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Don't ask.

1152
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,040
Mind if I join you?

1153
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:16,393
Tough day, guys?

1154
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,828
Don't ask. Don't ask.

1155
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:22,266
Would a little single
malt Glendronach help?

1156
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,368
I don't know.

1157
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:27,337
We could do a linear
regression analysis.

1158
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:32,609
Well, the regression
part's guaranteed.

1159
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,177
Do you have anything to eat?

1160
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,713
I think there's some
haggis left over.

1161
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:38,515
What's that?

1162
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:40,472
Don't ask.

1163
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:43,842
Cheers.

1164
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:50,427
Dr. Carter.

1165
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:52,195
I'm buried, Ruby.

1166
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:54,231
I've got all this
data to tabulate.

1167
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:56,633
I've got two pre-op
histories to dictate.

1168
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,492
I've got a.m. labs to order...

1169
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:07,277
You lied to me.

1170
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:08,678
What?

1171
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:12,015
The neurologist told me
she'll never leave the hospital.

1172
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:15,319
Well, uh...

1173
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,886
he's her doctor now.

1174
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,789
You should respect his opinion.

1175
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:20,957
You knew all along, didn't you?

1176
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:22,626
I got to get back to work.

1177
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,662
You were our
doctor and our friend!

1178
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,797
No, I was a fourth-year
medical student,

1179
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,632
who took care of your wife

1180
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,834
when she was on
the surgical service.

1181
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,104
You gave me hope,
because I thought you cared.

1182
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:36,373
You should've told me the truth.

1183
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:37,374
I tried.

1184
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:38,375
I'm not a kid.

1185
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:41,612
You should've told me.

1186
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:44,903
Did her leaving the hospital
today make her worse?

1187
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:49,320
I don't know.

1188
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:52,623
I trusted you.

1189
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,991
I spent two weeks

1190
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:56,577
treating her multiple
medical problems.

1191
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,778
I dealt with social services,

1192
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,346
I arranged for her
convalescent care,

1193
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,748
I fought with Cardiology,
Renal, and Neuro

1194
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:02,749
to get her admitted here.

1195
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:03,951
I did everything that I could.

1196
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,220
We're not just old people.

1197
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:07,487
We have lives.

1198
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,922
You look at my wife,

1199
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,308
and all you see is her problems.

1200
00:44:11,332 --> 00:44:14,578
I see a 20-year-old dancer.

1201
00:44:14,602 --> 00:44:17,948
27-year-old bride.
30-year-old mother.

1202
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:20,267
What do you want from me?

1203
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,268
The truth!

1204
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,402
She's dying, Ruby!

1205
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,471
Is that what you want to hear?

1206
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,007
She's dying, and she's
never going to leave

1207
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,176
this hospital.

1208
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,782
Thank you!

1209
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,798
I'm sorry, Ruby.

1210
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:37,690
Call me Mr. Rubadoux.
