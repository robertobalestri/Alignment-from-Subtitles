1
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,138
Good morning.

2
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,239
Good morning.

3
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,841
To what do I owe this?

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,976
It's been a great few days.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,778
I kind of wish it
wasn't going to end.

6
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,648
Ah, me neither.

7
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,684
The thought of
getting on that train...

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,523
You know, I was thinking...

9
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,592
Maybe I'd stay in
Chicago some nights

10
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,894
when I have to
work the next day.

11
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,396
Stay where?

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,332
I don't know, maybe Doug's.

13
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,867
Doug's?

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,970
You disapprove?

15
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,139
Well, it's just the thought
of all those pretty girls

16
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,241
padding around
in their underwear.

17
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,900
Yeah. Beats the YMCA.

18
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,772
You have nothing to worry about.

19
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,054
But it was my understanding
that a sub-internship

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,556
involved more responsibilities.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,358
What do you want to do, Carter,
Whipples? Trisegmentectomies?

22
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,159
I just I'd be following
my own patients around

23
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,160
instead of assisting on yours.

24
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,762
Uh-huh. What do
we got? This is Ed.

25
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,029
I'm thirsty, doc.

26
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,631
When we're finished,
I'll get you some water.

27
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,450
How about a Scotch
and water? Carter...

28
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:31,751
Patient experienced
shortness of breath

29
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:33,353
while sitting on his
stool at Molly's Saloon.

30
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:36,356
BP, 120/80. Pulse,
112. Respirations, 28.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,559
History of emphysema,
congestive heart failure,

32
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,595
pneumonia.

33
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,381
Upon auscultation, diminished
breath sounds were noted

34
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,966
at the base of the
patient's right lung.

35
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,284
Intrigued, I tested
vocal fremitus

36
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,769
per Bates, second edition,

37
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,637
leading me to a diagnosis
of pleural effusion

38
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:55,391
confirmed by this radiograph

39
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,866
which shows fluid
in the patient's right...

40
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:01,848
costophrenic sulcus.

41
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,165
Thank you, Professor Carter.

42
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,550
So what do you want to do?

43
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,885
Tap the fluid. Tap?

44
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,336
How many pleural
taps have you done?

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,855
Eight or nine.
Run the procedure.

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,007
Prep and drape in the
usual manner, anesthetize...

47
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,991
What's on tap?

48
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:13,460
Procure a 14-gauge needle...

49
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,862
All right, Carter. Call
me if you need me.

50
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:16,913
Oh, and, Carter,

51
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,188
consider Ed here your patient.

52
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,387
Uh, Harper,

53
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,251
have you ever
seen a pleural tap?

54
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,148
It's 2B, guys.

55
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,228
Getting tired of life in
the fast lane, Hathaway?

56
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,380
Just of your jokes, Shepherd.

57
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,097
Fifteen more
minutes, I'm recertified.

58
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,699
I won't have to
hear any of them.

59
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,700
Yoo-hoo. Up here.

60
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,357
Those were jokes?

61
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,809
Whoa!

62
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,077
Smells like he's gone already.

63
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,245

He hasn't paid his

I'm losing tenants
because of his smell.

69
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,940

70
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,358
How are we supposed to move him?

71
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,575
I brought a dolly.

72
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,295
Man, his BP's 220/130.

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,563
We'd better take him in.

74
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,832
Do I have to?

75
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,433
You don't want to
go to the hospital?

76
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,757
I'd rather stay here
with my rabbits.

77
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,889
All right, well, if he
doesn't want to go...

wait just a minute.

Hey, hey, lady, we don't run
an eviction service, all right?

81
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,346
You can't just leave him.

82
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,564
He doesn't want to come.

83
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:26,315
He's not competent
to make that decision.

84
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,400

Hey, Dr. Lewis.

Hello, little girl.

Hello. How's Chloe?

108
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,116
She's become disenchanted

Eight.

Morning, baby.

118
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,468
Kerry, I appreciate
the vote of confidence,

119
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,854
but I'm used to signing up
for patients one at a time.

120
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,305
Mark and I decided
residents should carry

121
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,306
at least four patients.

122
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,874
There's a memo in your email.

123
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,076
Jerry, are my labs ready?

124
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,412
I'm on a tight deadline,

125
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,846
so the interviews
have to be today.

126
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,381

00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,469
Could he have
swallowed something?

184
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:57,604
No, I don't think so.

185
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:58,771
Has he been sick? Yes.

186
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,172
Is he on any kind of medication?

187
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:01,474
Yes.

188
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:03,576
Bactrim, phenytoin, AZT...

189
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,812
AZT? He's got AIDS?

190
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:06,813
AIDS? Yes.

191
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,230
We've got Dilantin.

192
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,433
You have him on phenytoin
and Dilantin at the same time?

193
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,318
Yes. Yes.

194
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:13,736
It's the same thing.

195
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,154
He's OD'd on Dilantin.
He's not breathing.

196
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,956
All right, let's get an
intubation tray, damn it.

197
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,991
I give too much?

198
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,926
Yes, you gave too
much. Way too much.

199
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,094
What do you need, Doug?

200
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:23,246
CBC, Chem-7. Pull that
thing off. There we go.

201
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,547
Get a Dilantin level

202
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,148
and set up for a
gastric lavage kit.

203
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,100
We're going to have
to pump his stomach.

204
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,674
I'm holding the head.

205
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,457
Okay, here we go.

206
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,458
He's in.

207
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,459
All right, bag him.

208
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,110
Let's get that lavage.

209
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,701
Come on, little guy.

210
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:47,336
I need Cetacaine.

211
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,837
Grab some Surgilube

212
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,344
and 30 grams of charcoal.

213
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,042
You go in

214
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,378
right over the top
of rib number eight...

215
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,247
at the posterior axillary line,

216
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,116
advancing and
aspirating as you go.

217
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,652
I've got to call home.

218
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,853
Your wife?

219
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,421
Oh, no, not for me.

220
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,456
Why buy the cow

221
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,857
when you get the milk for free?

222
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,024
Take care to avoid

223
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,493
the neurovascular bundle.

224
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,895
I've got to call
Olaf, my roomie.

225
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,964
I left a half a
sandwich in the fridge,

226
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,799
and I don't want
anything to happen to it.

227
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,033
Now is not a good time,

228
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,802
because we're
about to draw fluid.

229
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,471
I'll bet he's over at Molly's.

230
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:22,588
Who's Molly?

231
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,406
She's a bar. My bar.

232
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,407
<i>Voila.</i>

233
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,709
Ah...

234
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,116
Oh, that's better.
That's better.

235
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,380
Oh...

236
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,215
Ah...

237
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,056
Why'd it stop?

238
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,693
Sometimes you hit an adhesion.

239
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,259
Damn.

240
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,260
Should I get Benton?

241
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,678
No.

242
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,465
Whoops!

243
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,116
What'd you do? What'd you do?

244
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,134
I'm gonna get Benton.

245
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,836
No, he's my patient.

246
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,894
Yeah, yeah. Get
him, get him, get him.

247
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,207
Dilantin level's 40.

248
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,808
Double dose. No surprise.

249
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:07,416
What's her name?

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,085
Ma'am, what's your name?

251
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,086
Mei-Sun.

252
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,571
What's your little boy's name?

253
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,706
Chia-Chia.

254
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,308
Let me tell you what
we're doing, okay?

255
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,076
Now, we've washed
all the medicine out,

256
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,227
and now we're putting charcoal

257
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,311
into Chia-Chia's stomach

258
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,880
to absorb what's left.

259
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,004
Doug? Hmm?

260
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,192
Hey. Hi, buddy.

261
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,158
Don't be scared, all right?

262
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,843
You got a little sick,

263
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,879
and your mom brought
you to the hospital.

264
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:37,880
She's right here.

265
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:38,904
Mm-hmm. Come on.

266
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:55,213
What happened?
I pushed it too far.

267
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,416
Oh, damn it, Carter, you
were supposed to tap his lung,

268
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,518
not biopsy his liver.

269
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,769
Let's get him up
to the O.R., now!

270
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,793
He needs a room. Move!

271
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,743
I don't believe this.

272
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,411
There goes next year's
surgical residency.

273
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,435
Carter!

274
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,071
I've known Mark Greene

275
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,240
since he was a
wet-behind-the-ears med student.

276
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,876
He had the most
beautiful curly blond hair,

277
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,594
and so polite.

278
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,595
All I'd do was ask,

279
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,296
and he would be
cleaning the bedpans

280
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,734
and changing the sheets, and...

281
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,569
he was the best
scut-puppy I ever had.

282
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,239
So would you say that back
then he was sort of green?

283
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,309
No, Wendy, I would
never say that.

284
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,595
Okay, retract
the liver inferiorly

285
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,280
and rotate the right lobe.

286
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,782
Oh, there she blows.

287
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,783
Hit the hepatic vein.

288
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,452
Nice shot, Carter. 5-O proline.

289
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,921
I'm really sorry, Dr. Hicks.

290
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,923
It's just that when I felt
resistance, it felt exactly

291
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,424
like an adhesion I'd
encountered before,

292
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,426
and with the patient's
history of emphysema,

293
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,727
I just figured that...

294
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,629
Oh, one-handed. Peter,
you've been practicing.

295
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,765
I'm really sorry...
Carter, it happens.

296
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,266
It's all right.

297
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,285
My best student once
did a sigmoidoscopy...

298
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,749
Punched through
and saw the appendix.

299
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,790
Sound familiar, Peter?

300
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,524
Metz.

301
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:13,725
What I'm more
concerned about now

302
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,728
is the condition
of this man's liver.

303
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:16,729
Feel that.

304
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,063
Hard as a rock,

305
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,931
and shriveled like an old shoe.

306
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:20,932
Gallon-a-day drinker.

307
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:22,318
At least.

308
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,454
Look at the size of
those mesenteric veins.

309
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,839
What does that
suggest to you, Carter?

310
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,140
Portal hypertension.

311
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,176
And what are the hallmarks
of portal hypertension?

312
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,211
Caput medusa,
esophageal varices,

313
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:33,779
hemorrhoids, ascites,

314
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:34,847
splenomegaly.

315
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,866
Good.

316
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,517
I wouldn't give this
liver three weeks.

317
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,036
NG's returning blood.

318
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,236
Varices are bleeding.

319
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,821
Lucky we're here to
do something about it.

320
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,989
Portal bypass?

321
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,426
We could, but with
a liver this oozy...

322
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,844
Have you ever done
a TIPS procedure?

323
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,746
No, but I'd like to.

324
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,980
I bet.

325
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,533
In fact, it's an excellent
case for teaching.

326
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:55,634
Sylvia...

327
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,152
round up all surgical residents

328
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,503
who aren't busy.

329
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,938
Tell them we're starting a TIPS.

330
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:00,962
Standing room only.

331
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,743
What do you know, Carter...

332
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,133
You did this guy a favor.

333
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,237
Mr. Holthouse?

334
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,150
Yes?

335
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,185
I'm Dr. Lewis. What is that?

336
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,304
Tibetan singing bowl.

337
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,338
I get anxious in hospitals.

338
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:34,673
It helps me to relax.

339
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:37,142
Oh. I understand you're
feeling dizzy this morning.

340
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,112
Yes, I've had these
spinning sensations

341
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,014
on and off all week.

342
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,565
Headaches?

343
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,534
No, some nausea, though.

344
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,919
Spots before your eyes?

345
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:48,771
No.

346
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,723
Say, you're under a
lot of stress right now,

347
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,241
aren't you?

348
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,375
Who isn't?

349
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,160
Yes, I can see the
tension in your face.

350
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,396
I could suggest some
relaxation techniques.

351
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,563
Thanks,

352
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,382
but I'm a lot more
relaxed than I look.

353
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,705
Open your mouth.

354
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,789
Hey, big guy.

355
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,924
Love the tie.

356
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,959
Thank you, Malik.

357
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,349
Thank you very much.

358
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,196
What's the occasion?

359
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,098
Well, since you asked,

360
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,333
I've been promoted.

361
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,767
To what?

362
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,203
Supervising
emergency-service coordinator.

363
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:25,007
Ah, more money, huh?

364
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,541
Uh, unfortunately, no.

365
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,742
Oh.

366
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,078
Better benefits?

367
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,346
No.

368
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,282
More responsibility.

369
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,084
No.

370
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,319
Well, congratulations.

371
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,543
Mark, that big guy,
Mitchell, he's seizing.

372
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,573
All right, make some room.

373
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,047
Bite block.

374
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,083
Point-five Ativan IV push.

375
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:52,100
Positive Babinski.

376
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,268
Pinpoint pupils.

377
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,187
Does not bode well.

378
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,189
Pressure's up, 250/140.

379
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,490
All right. Jack up the Nipride.

380
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,643
Let's load him up with
Dilantin. How much?

381
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:04,096
Uh, let's see. He's
about, uh, 400 pounds

382
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,764
divided by 2.2 is, uh...

383
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:06,848
181 kilograms.

384
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,434
Times 12 milligrams per kilogram

385
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,519
would be, uh...

386
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,821
Uh, 2,730.

387
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,505
I have a facility
for simple math.

388
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,825
All right, we'll
start with a gram,

389
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,143
and we'll titrate up.

390
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,796
Come on, Mitchell, stay with us.

391
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,540
Stay with us, Mitchell. Come on.

392
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,069
Vitals are coming
back to normal.

393
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,905
Let's get him to Pedes ICU, huh?

394
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,806
Hey, there, Chia-Chia,
how you doing?

395
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,193
I'm Doug.

396
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:35,861
He doesn't like doctors.

397
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:37,746
I'll bet he sees a lot of us.

398
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,814
Where do you take him?

399
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:42,434
The pediatric clinic upstairs.

400
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,653
Who's the doctor?
Always a different one.

401
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,505
Yeah, they're
pretty busy up there.

402
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:52,428
Yes. Very nice, but sometime,
we wait four, five hour.

403
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,534
It's hard for him.

404
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,149
Now, I have to make sure

405
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,918
that this medication problem
doesn't happen again,

406
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,620
so I have to ask you...
Can you read English?

407
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:02,670
Yes!

408
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:05,696
I follow direction.

409
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,396
This one from two week ago,

410
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,305
and this one from yesterday.

411
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,358
He gave you two
prescriptions for the same thing.

412
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:28,385
You did exactly what
they asked you to.

413
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,704
I'm sorry that I
was angry with you.

414
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,988
This is not your fault.

415
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:40,392
This is the doctors
at the clinic's fault.

416
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,978
Okay. All right.

417
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,381
Next time, you
bring Chia-Chia here.

418
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,750
You give this to
the nurse out front,

419
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,753
and she will bring you
straight back, no waiting.

420
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,443
Okay?

421
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,674
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

422
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:56,875
I thought he
didn't like doctors.

423
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,065
Chia-Chia, no.

424
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,445
That's okay.

425
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,247
He can hang on
to it for a while.

426
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,831
You can keep that.

427
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,671
Mr. Holthouse?

428
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,262
Over here.

429
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,978
I see you're
feeling much better.

430
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,314
Yeah, but I still have
that spinning feeling,

431
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,315
even upside-down.

432
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,383
Have a seat.

433
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,968
Tony will take you
for a CAT scan.

434
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,270
Doesn't that cause cancer?

435
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,477
Susan, a word, please?

436
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,011
Why are you ordering
a CT for vertigo?

437
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,279
Why are you
questioning my order?

438
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,614
Because it's a $1500 procedure.

439
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,015
I have to rule out
acoustic neuroma.

440
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,817
He's had five bouts
of dizziness in a week.

441
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,819
Well, you wouldn't know
that by looking at his chart.

442
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:42,821
I haven't had time to
write down my notes yet.

443
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:43,956
I've had other patients.

444
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,157
So do I, and I manage
to keep track of details.

445
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,559
So have I, on my note cards.

446
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,411
Well, I don't have
access to those, do I?

447
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,712
Here.

448
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,913
Put them on the chart,

449
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,777
and in the future, run
all procedures by me.

450
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,032
Hey, what happened?

451
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,737
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He went just like that.

452
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,104
What are you doing with him?

453
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,007
Landlady called animal control.

454
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,075
They were rounding them up.

455
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,076
It was awful.

456
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,745
This guy followed
me down the hall.

457
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,846
Is he clean?

458
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,381
Sure, he's clean,

459
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,716
and he's soft too.

460
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,018
Poor fat guy, he
never hurt anybody,

461
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,420
just sat around with his bunnies

462
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,289
singing that nutty song.

463
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,058

00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,894

Vienna.

Mona Lees?

473
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,256
No, he is a patient of
yours. Chia-Chia Loew.

474
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,458
He's a 4-year-old with AIDS?

475
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,127
Well, try to remember,
because you almost killed him

476
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,229
by giving him a
Dilantin prescription

477
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,232
when one of your cohorts
already had him on phenytoin.

478
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,157
Don't you people
talk to each other?

479
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,338
Making friends again?

480
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,439
Idiots at the Pedes clinic

481
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,940
doubled up a kid's prescription

482
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,310
and almost killed him.

483
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,711
Get her off my back.

484
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,979
Her? Weaver.

485
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,581
She just dressed me
down in the hallway

486
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,815
for ordering a CT.

487
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,084
Ah, we're getting a lot
of pressure from upstairs.

488
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,486
She scours my charts
looking for errors,

489
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,787
she treats me with disdain.

490
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,988
Want me to talk to her?

491
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,546
Yeah. Tell her to
cut me some slack.

492
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,784
See how Peter's
snaking the sheath

493
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,803
through the vena cava

494
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,576
to the right hepatic vein?

495
00:19:58,314 --> 00:19:59,891
I'm in.

496
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:02,260
Now comes the fun part.

497
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,862
Remove the guide wire.

498
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,714
Rotate the needle
counterclockwise

499
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,734
90 degrees. Pressure's
dropping, 80/60.

500
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,136
Give him pressors
and keep me posted.

501
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,971
Now, puncture
the cirrhotic tissue

502
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,923
and enter the portal vein,

503
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,808
creating a new pathway.

504
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,543
Balloon stent's in.

505
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,245
Expand the balloon...

506
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:21,647
slowly.

507
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:22,648
Easy...

508
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:23,982
We have circulation.

509
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,650
Portal pressure's coming down.

510
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,735
And the liver is reborn.

511
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,736
Hallelujah.

512
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,737
He's getting tachy. 180.

513
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,805
Well, we fixed his liver,

514
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,590
there's not much we
can do for his heart.

515
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,325
Run of five.

516
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,343
Get out of there, Peter.

517
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,427
All right, I'm getting out

518
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,163
He's fibrillating.

519
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:40,131
Carter, CPR.

520
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,616
Come on, Ed. Come on.

521
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,101
Charge it to 200.

522
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,102
Stand back.

523
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,870
Clear!

524
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,278
Hey, Kerry, how's it going?

525
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:54,313
Uh, pretty good.

526
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,613
Good.

527
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,649
But there's something
we need to talk about.

528
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,650
Oh?

529
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,718
Susan Lewis.

530
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:00,719
Oh.

531
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:01,853
This is a bit awkward.

532
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:03,488
I mean, I know
you two are friends,

533
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,957
but she seems to
resent my being here,

534
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,059
and it's creating some tension.

535
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,761
You know, I picked up on that.

536
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,963
I assure you, it has
nothing to do with her ability.

537
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,899
She's really quite competent,

538
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:15,667
but her attitude
is openly hostile.

539
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,086
It's probably a
communication thing.

540
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,656
I mean, you're very
authoritative, which is great,

541
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,857
but your assertiveness,

542
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,159
it might be off-putting to some.

543
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,378
Believe me, I'm aware of that.

544
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:28,079
That's why I've
bent over backwards

545
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,330
to be sensitive with Susan.

546
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,149
Uh-huh. I'd rather
you not say anything,

547
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:32,667
but I wanted to make you aware

548
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,152
that this is a potential
problem area.

549
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,154
Right. Thank you.

550
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,678
Uh-huh.

551
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,664
A picture-perfect
procedure, Benton.

552
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:48,333
Bev, save the tape, would
you? We'll share it at M&M.

553
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:52,136
Carter, you can present.
It'll be your first time.

554
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll tell him.

555
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:02,564
My first official patient.

556
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:05,150
Carter, the guy
was a train wreck.

557
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,318
He died of heart failure.

558
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:07,319
It had nothing to do

559
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:08,475
with you perfing his liver.

560
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:12,991
Come on, if the guy hadn't
been on the operating table...

561
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:14,259
Then his liver

562
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:16,383
would have failed him in
a month, maybe sooner.

563
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:19,514
I'll tell the family.

564
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,832
He didn't have any.

565
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,834
Carter...

566
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,702
It's how you learn.

567
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,726
It'll make you a better doctor.

568
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,813
What can I say about Mark
Greene that hasn't already been said?

569
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,148
I think everybody knows
how he overcame adversity

570
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,867
as a child of Quakers,

571
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,302
his years in exile,

572
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,637
his political writings
and limericks,

573
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:44,356
his mod period
with the turtlenecks,

574
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,108
his blue period,

575
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,043
and, of course his
ruthless march to power,

576
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:52,347
and the silencing of his rivals.

577
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,816
Dr. Ross?

578
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,967
Dr. Ross?

579
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:56,023
Hmm?

580
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:01,807
♪ I'm a doctor
Without a single pill... ♪

581
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,408
Which one do you think?

582
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:04,877
It's for the nursing newsletter?

583
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:06,244
Yeah. You think this one?

584
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:07,413
I'm looking for

585
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:09,515
the supervising emergency
service coordinator.

586
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,233
You've found him.

587
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,207
Oh, hi. I'm Randi.

588
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:15,104
I'm the new clerk.

589
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,372
I understand I'll be
working under you.

590
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,707
Uh... Right.

591
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,877
I, uh, I was expecting a
guy, because of the name.

592
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,679
Randi, right. Yeah,
I get that a lot.

593
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,664
Uh, personnel said
that you would have

594
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:27,265
some immunization
forms for me to fill out.

595
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,667
Right. Um...

596
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:30,435
you're going to need a rubella

597
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,204
and a Heptovax.

598
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:33,672
Lab's on the second floor.

599
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:35,540
And they said I would
need an employee physical,

600
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:37,242
and that somebody
here could do it.

601
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:39,261
Jerry, you got any charts
for me, any patients?

602
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,285
Anything?

603
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:52,413
All right. Well, I'll
be at Pedes ICU.

604
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,246
Carol, you've got to come quick.

605
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,680
What's up?

606
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,416
The 300-pound angel
duster broke out of restraints,

607
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,617
climbed on top of the ambulance.

608
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,851
What is this, crazy-fat-guy day?

609
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,453
Hey, I'm telling you.
This dude is mad.

610
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,922
Call security. Go
find Mark Greene.

611
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,124
The tests show there's
nothing seriously wrong.

612
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,225
I think your dizziness

613
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,827
is caused by labyrinthitis.

614
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:12,895
What's that?

615
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,130
Inflammation of the inner ear,

616
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:15,330
Very minor. Nothing serious.

617
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,666
Don't aggravate
it, it'll go away.

618
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,667
You swim?

619
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:18,734
No. I don't know how.

620
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,536
But I do spend a
lot of time floating

621
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,504
in my sensory deprivation tank.

622
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,089
Not for the next two
weeks, you don't.

623
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:25,173
Oh.

624
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,309
No standing on
your head, either.

625
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,178
Dr. Lewis?

626
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:30,996
I'd like for you to have this.

627
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,664
No, thanks.

628
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:33,899
Please. It's a spare.

629
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:36,001
It's not necessary, really.

630
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:38,087
I think it is.

631
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:39,877
Really.

632
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,896
Oh, God. Not another one.

633
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,364
Look out, Carol.

634
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,332
Relax. Hey, buddy, relax!

635
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,468
Take it easy.

636
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,803
Where's Mara? Mara!

637
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,538
Mara?

638
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:57,806
Mara?

639
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,141
Wait, wait, just
back off, there.

640
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,142
What's he on?

641
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,126
PCP.

642
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,299
I got him!

643
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,963
Get away from me!
Don't you touch me!

644
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,382
Are you all right? Are you okay?

645
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,050
Nobody touches me! He's cut.

646
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,052
Stay here. I'm taking
him in. Come on.

647
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,219
Mara!

648
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,487
Where the hell's security?

649
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,157
My God! I can't
see! Let's shoot him.

650
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,324
Let me talk to him.

651
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,560
Make it stop! Make it stop!

652
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,394
Fine.

653
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,629
Okay. Okay.

654
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,231
Hey, what you doing
up there, big guy?

655
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:23,498
Mara?

656
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,900
Yeah. Why don't
you come down here?

657
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,651
It's much safer, okay?

658
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:27,702
Mara!

659
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,138
Yes, babe, come on down.

660
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:30,205
Mara!

661
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:33,041
Where's Mara? Mara! Mara!

662
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,493
What are you doing?

663
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:35,494
Hey, what are you doing?

664
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:37,012
Hey, hey! No! No!

665
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,464
Oh, my God!

666
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,189
Hey!

667
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,820
Oh, Mark, did you
and you-know-who

668
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:45,921
have a you-know-what?

669
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:46,922
You bet.

670
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:47,946
Good.

671
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,327
And then, these extensions
are for internal use only.

672
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,328
Uh, Dr. Lewis?

673
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:54,396
Yeah?

674
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,597
Can you do an employee physical?

675
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:56,999
On? Randi?

676
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,384
Hi.

677
00:25:58,408 --> 00:25:59,857
Hi. Breathe in.

678
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,922
Breathe out.

679
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:04,146
You're fine. Where's the form?

680
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,156
Uh, do you have my roommate

681
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,323
as a patient?

682
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,992
Uh, Ed Menke?

683
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:25,761
Yes. Uh, you...
You must be Olaf?

684
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,329
Uh-huh.

685
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,364
Uh, I'm afraid I have some...

686
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,066
Some bad news about... about Ed.

687
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,434
Uh-huh.

688
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,637
He... Well, he had
fluid in his lungs,

689
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,472
and during the course
of trying to remove it,

690
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:41,443
we... I... accidentally
punctured his liver.

691
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,312
We took him to the O.R.

692
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:44,847
and successfully
stopped the bleeding,

693
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:46,248
and did some additional surgery,

694
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:52,454
but, um, uh, unfortunately
his heart gave out, and, uh...

695
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,790
he died on the table.

696
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:55,825
I'm very sorry.

697
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,726
Yeah, they told
me that upstairs.

698
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,016
They said you had his property.

699
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,232
Property?

700
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,800
Yeah. He took the
remote-control doohickey.

701
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,035
It's his TV,

702
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,870
and he's kind of
tightfisted about it,

703
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:10,361
but, uh, I don't think
he's gonna mind now.

704
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:15,610
Double dose of Haldol.

705
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,595
Well, it's about time.

706
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,330
I can't see! Make it stop!

707
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:20,532
Look, why don't you
try and, you know...

708
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,533
Right, right, right, right.

709
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,152
Hey! Hey...

710
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,987
Hey, big guy!

711
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,255
Hi!

712
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,213
Hi. So... Are you from Chicago?

713
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,411
Ah, Jeez.

714
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:34,346
Um...

715
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,347
Come on. Come on.

716
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,748
You can do better
than that, huh?

717
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:37,749
You weren't even close.

718
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,072
Come on.

719
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,254
Oh, God!

720
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:43,756
0 and 2, big guy.

721
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,358
Come on. Why don't you just
try to put some mustard on it.

722
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:47,359
That's it. That's it.

723
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:49,528
Yeah! Yes!

724
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:50,795
Bull's-eye.

725
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:55,600
Nice work.

726
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,192
With a regimen of
ultrasound and TENS,

727
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:04,293
it's possible

728
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:05,877
he could regain
the use of his legs...

729
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:06,978
Jeanie!

730
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:08,246
You get my message?

731
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,315
Yeah.

732
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,515
All right. 7:00.

733
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,168
Found him on the
floor of his jail cell,

734
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,169
spitting blood.

735
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,170
Swallowed a dozen razor blades.

736
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,171
Suicide try?

737
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,172
Who knows.

738
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,674
Maybe he wanted a field trip.

739
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:19,841
Set up for endoscopy?

740
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,976
Yeah, get a KUB.

741
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,578
I'll need a rat
tooth on the scope

742
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:24,512
so I can grab the
blades. Coming through!

743
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:29,685
Hey, Chloe, what are
you doing up here?

744
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,520
Oh, hi. Just talking to my baby.

745
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,690
Oh, hey, why don't you
listen to her breathing?

746
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,834
Sounds like she's got
pneumonia or something.

747
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,367
She's gurgling.

748
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,418
Oh.

749
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,821
Come here. Yeah.

750
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,606
You picking little Susie up?

751
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,642
What? You picking
little Susie up?

752
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,044
Oh, no. I'm just going to
take her for a little walk.

753
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,996
Big Susie know that you're here?

754
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,197
Uh...

755
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,166
You know, I'm going
to go wait outside.

756
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,068
You okay?

757
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:05,437
Yes, I'm just a
little tired, that's all.

758
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,027
Well, see you.

759
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,712
No bleeding in the
esophagus or antrum.

760
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,214
H & H back yet?

761
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:16,381
Normal. Fourteen and 42.

762
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:18,250
Ah, got one. Razor
blade coming up.

763
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:19,251
How's his pressure?

764
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,285
120/80.

765
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:21,486
Won't that slice up his throat?

766
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,689
Nope,

767
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:25,457
because he taped the blades.

768
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,991
So much for suicide.

769
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:27,992
What's this about, Curtis?

770
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,194
Not trying to escape, are you?

771
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:30,929
What's this?

772
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:31,981
Prisoner swallowed razor blades.

773
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:34,032
No blood in the gut? No.

774
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:35,617
You're done. Pull out the scope.

775
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,218
He's already tubed.
I'm not gonna stop now.

776
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,476
I told you, no procedures
without going through me.

777
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,799
Go get Mark.

778
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:47,880
Dr. Greene!

779
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,624
We need you in Trauma 1.

780
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,989
What's up, guys?

781
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,141
Prisoner swallowed taped razors.

782
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,342
I want to pull them out.

783
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,326
Kerry wants to leave them.

784
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,461
His gut's not bleeding.

785
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:04,163
It could. Hasn't yet.

786
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,019
I say, let them pass.

787
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:08,255
It's a judgment call, guys.

788
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,521
Well, if he bleeds, we
go in, we take them out.

789
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,113
For now, pull the scope out.

790
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,152
Excuse me.

791
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,611
Carter, you had a patient
named Menke, right?

792
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:37,763
Yeah. Why?

793
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:40,031
Dr. Hicks had pathology
take out his liver

794
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,333
for some cirrhosis study

795
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:42,634
at the Stendhal clinic.

796
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:45,370
She said you should
arrange to get it over there.

797
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:46,605
Ugh. Ugly little
thing, ain't it?

798
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:47,629
<i>Ay. Qué feo.</i>

799
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,971
An exciting case?

800
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,506
Here's one.

801
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,808
Guy comes in,
hypervolemic shock.

802
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,560
Defibrillated 10, 15 times.

803
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:09,827
We maxed out on lidocaine,

804
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,062
added bretylium.

805
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,498
Finally, shocked
him back to sinus.

806
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:14,899
He goes bradycardic.

807
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:17,868
So I float a transvenous
pacemaker, get capture,

808
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:18,903
he stops breathing.

809
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,471
I had to climb on

810
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:23,274
intubate him, cowboy-style,
right there on the table.

811
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,275
Wow.

812
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,276
Yeah.

813
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,883
What happened?

814
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:32,005
He died.

815
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:47,365
<i>Please enter</i>

816
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:48,816
<i>the patient's number
before proceeding.</i>

817
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,484
Jerry...

818
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,937
Dr. Weaver loaded
an audio program

819
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:53,972
onto the computer.

820
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,273
With her own voice!

821
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:57,325
Where's Greene?

822
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,849
He and Dr. Ross
went to the gift shop.

823
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,499
<i>Don't forget to log off.</i>

824
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,969
<i>Don't forget to log off.</i>

825
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,220
<i>Don't forget to log off.</i>

826
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,538
Are you sure you don't mind?

827
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,374
Are you kidding? Mark, anytime.

828
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,509
Yeah? Well, how about tonight?

829
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,711
Now, tonight, I may have company

830
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,079
depending on the
weather patterns

831
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,281
over Greenland.

832
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,282
What?

833
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,516
Dr. Ross? Hi, Neil.

834
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,851
Next time you get the
urge to pick up the phone

835
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,919
and start screaming

836
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,720
at one of my residents,
ask for me instead...

837
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,123
One of your
residents screwed up...

838
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,191
Well, you're not in a position
to make that judgment.

839
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,360
Your job is hanging by a thread,

840
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,229
and I'm the guy with the knife!

841
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,898
You pull this
prima-donna crap again,

842
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,499
and it'll take more
than your friend here

843
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,990
to save you.

844
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,139
Hey, didn't see
much of you today.

845
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,775
Whatever happened to old Ed?

846
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,776
Ed?

847
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,879
Yeah.

848
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:27,081
They transplanted him?

849
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,938
He died.

850
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:32,987
From the tap?

851
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,971
No.

852
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:37,263
Not directly.

853
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,978
So are they taking
away your sub-i?

854
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:43,264
Are you kidding? Hicks
and Benton were so excited

855
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,066
about getting to do
a TIPS on the guy,

856
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,673
they were glad I screwed up.

857
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:49,520
Thing is, I didn't
really care, either.

858
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:51,055
When I put the needle through,

859
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,106
all I thought was

860
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,392
"there goes my surgical career."

861
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,829
So here he is.

862
00:33:57,853 --> 00:33:59,452
What a way to go, huh?

863
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:07,855
Well, from the looks of things,
he knew how to have a good time.

864
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,108
What do you say we
give him a sendoff?

865
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,792
What?

866
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,482
Get your coat.

867
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,602
Hey...

868
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,204
Quite a day, huh?

869
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,305
I'm telling you.

870
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,306
Head okay?

871
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,874
Yeah.

872
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,660
Knock on wood.

873
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:30,845
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

874
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,581
Yeah.

875
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,217
Don't worry about it.

876
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,119
Hey, we were...

877
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:39,821
we were pretty
good out there today.

878
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,056
Not bad, huh?

879
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,147
Uh, we should go out.

880
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,384
Really? Definitely.

881
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:54,886
Well, right now's not a
really good time for me, but...

882
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,376
I've got your number.

883
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,294
You going to blow
me off just like that?

884
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:04,362
No.

885
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:08,733
Look, I'm just getting
over a relationship, so...

886
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:10,034
Good night.

887
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:12,058
You know what your
problem is, Hathaway?

888
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:15,673
You've gone out
with too many doctors.

889
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,597
You've been checking up on me?

890
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,478
I'm... I'm interested, so I ask.

891
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:22,179
You're shopping

892
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,348
in the wrong part of the store.

893
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,349
What?

894
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,685
You're lost among the Guccis.

895
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,044
And... And where should I be?

896
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,347
Automotive.

897
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,258
Shaw's, Friday night, 8:00?

898
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:47,839
Okay.

899
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:50,196
Okay.

900
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,139
Hey, buddy.

901
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,862
Hey...

902
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,514
Hey...

903
00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:07,018
What's the matter?

904
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:08,708
It's my fault.

905
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:13,190
No, it's not your fault.

906
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:16,127
I told you. It's the
doctors at the clinic.

907
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:23,267
No, it's my fault he has AIDS.

908
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,335
I gave it to him.

909
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,438
No, that's nobody's fault.

910
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:35,512
I gave it to him, and
now he's sick, and I'm not.

911
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:37,782
It is punishment.

912
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:42,909
No.

913
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,429
It's okay.

914
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,611
It's okay.

915
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:38,609
Peter, what are you doing here?

916
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,878
I waited 45 minutes.
Wait, just hold on...

917
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,880
No, no, you hold on.
You couldn't even call me?

918
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,082
I was gonna call. So now
you're even lying to me?

919
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:46,684
What?

920
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,485
I thought we had enough
respect... enough going on

921
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:50,287
that we could at least
talk to each other.

922
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,422
I needed time to think.

923
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:53,024
Time? How much time?
Two weeks? A month?

924
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:55,225
What was I supposed to do,
get a postcard or something?

925
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,796
Keep your voice down.
No, don't tell me what...

926
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,232
Hi.

927
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,435
It's easy for you, Peter.

928
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:06,971
I'm the one who's had to
go home to my husband.

929
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:10,997
You just hand out ultimatums.
You demand answers. I...

930
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:17,247
I knew your answer... last week.

931
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,415
Peter...

932
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,006
What?

933
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,445
I'm not ready to walk
out on my marriage.

934
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:31,428
Yeah, right.

935
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,565
You, uh...

936
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:37,023
you take care of
yourself, all right?

937
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,749
What about

938
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:53,017
the weather over Greenland?

939
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,019
There's this stewardess
that I've been seeing.

940
00:39:55,043 --> 00:39:56,386
Actually, I met her at work.

941
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,521
A patient?

942
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:58,990
Sort of. Put a cast on her.

943
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:00,424
Anyway, with her
flight schedule,

944
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:02,882
I never know when
she might show up.

945
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,631
Hmm.

946
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:07,965
Guess the weather was bad.

947
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,922
Well, it's just as well.

948
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:13,004
Is there a doctor in the house?

949
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:14,105
Hey...

950
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,107
Oh, hello.

951
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:19,710
Hulda, that's Mark.
Mark, that's Hulda.

952
00:40:19,734 --> 00:40:20,734
Hello.

953
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:24,331
You know, the, uh, Finns

954
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,600
are remarkably unselfconscious.

955
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,357
I see that.

956
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,538
I cooked you a lutefisk.

957
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,562
Great.

958
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,075
Set your bag down. Come on.

959
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,099
Yeah.

960
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,222
Now, we are out of here...

961
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,958
Susie! Hey, Susie!

962
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:51,959
Chloe?

963
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,382
Hey!

964
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,362
Who are you with?

965
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,830
Oh, that's my friend, Ruth.

966
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,787
Hi, Ruth!

967
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,035
Oh, God, you're loaded.

968
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,171
Oh, come on.

969
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,307
Chloe!

970
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,375
Look, hey, everything
is gonna be okay.

971
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,277
What are you on?

972
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,946
I'm going on a trip.

973
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,030
The hell you are.

974
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,298
The flea markets, Susie.

975
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:17,701
You can make a
fortune selling old stuff.

976
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,769
Just stay there, okay?

977
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:19,970
I'm gonna come
around, all right?

978
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:21,405
No, no, Susie, I can't.

979
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,440
We gotta go.

980
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:23,574
Damn it, Chloe,

981
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:24,892
You are not
abandoning this baby!

982
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,143
I'll be back.

983
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:28,946
I just gotta make us some
money, so I can buy us a house.

984
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,381
Chloe, what are you doing?

985
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,632
Don't! Don't do this.

986
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,301
I'm dying inside, Susie.

987
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,453
I gotta go.

988
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,472
No, I know. Chloe, it's fine.

989
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,557
Don't be mad. Please?

990
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,741
It is okay!

991
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,577
I just wanna do
something right, okay?

992
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,129
It's okay. No, I'm not...

993
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:46,730
I'm not... Chloe, it's okay!

994
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:51,034
Bye-bye, baby! Mama loves
you. No, Chloe, don't go. It's okay!

995
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:52,035
Chloe!

996
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,036
Bye-bye!

997
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,037
Chloe.

998
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,038
Chloe!

999
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,273
Chloe!

1000
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:57,674
It's okay.

1001
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,042
Bye-bye, baby!

1002
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:00,710
Chloe!

1003
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,968
This place is a lot
nicer than I expected.

1004
00:42:23,992 --> 00:42:26,336
Yeah, it's not bad.

1005
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,371
What's that?

1006
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:28,395
A liver.

1007
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:30,574
What'll it be?

1008
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:33,978
Whatever's on tap.

1009
00:42:34,002 --> 00:42:36,180
Cruel. Very cruel.

1010
00:42:36,204 --> 00:42:37,348
Two?

1011
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:39,439
Yes, please.

1012
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:41,986
Which stool's Ed's?

1013
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,003
Your boyfriend's sitting on it.

1014
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,206
You friends of his?

1015
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,442
Uh, we knew him.

1016
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,593
He's dead, you know.

1017
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:51,467
We know.

1018
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:00,254
To Ed.

1019
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:01,455
