1
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,245
Ha.

2
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,513
Ah.

3
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:55,649
Ah. I love it when
those endorphins kick in.

4
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:56,849
You're not on today, are you?

5
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:58,618
I thought I'd drop by,

6
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,920
ease up your
workload a little bit...

7
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:03,144
After I take a shower.

8
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:05,692
It's his day off?

9
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:06,893
That's dedication for you.

10
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:09,679
Dedication? Man, that's sad.

11
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,482
Don't move, Mrs. Zarian.

12
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:16,786
It's a little bit of glass,
and it's almost free.

13
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,588
Susan, were your ears burning?

14
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,056
Huh?

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,259
David Morgenstern and I
were just talking about you.

16
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,994
He feels you're
the top contender

17
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,496
for Chief Resident next year.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,315
Oh. Thanks.

19
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,983
This year's field

20
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,317
was pretty disappointing,

21
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,487
but we found your work
to be consistently solid.

22
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,922
Now, I know you're concerned
about the responsibilities

23
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:37,324
taking time away from the baby,

24
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,193
but that doesn't
have to be the case.

25
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:41,378
Keep the bevel facing out.

26
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,630
By applying
time-management techniques,

27
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:46,032
you can work more efficiently,

28
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:47,200
reduce on-the-job stress,

29
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:49,052
and get home at
a reasonable hour.

30
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,521
Mrs. Zarian...

31
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,623
I've got a book on the
subject if you're interested.

32
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,848
No pressure. I just want to let
you know how we're thinking.

33
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:01,514
Son of a bitch! What?

34
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,316
They cut me back
to three shifts a week.

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,685
They're cutting back on nurses?

36
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,387
Nurse managers, because
of our outrageous salaries.

37
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:09,856
Man, I still need $12,000
worth of work on my house.

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,159
Damn. They bumped
me up to six shifts a week.

39
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:13,360
So much for my weekend.

40
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,579
I know where you can
make some quick cash.

41
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,846
Talk to me.

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,247
I joined this guy
Alvin's investment club.

43
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,248
Yeah...

44
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,650
Put up a $2,000 membership fee,

45
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,453
and in a week to 10 days,
you collect $10,000 to $20,000.

46
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,788
From?

47
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,023
From the fees of the
new people who join.

48
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,625
It's called a pyramid
scam, and it's illegal.

49
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,093
What? That's not
what Alvin says.

50
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,129
Trust me. If you're not in
early, you lose your shirt.

51
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,687
When did you get in?

52
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,770
Hey.

53
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,973
Hey yourself.

54
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,641
All right, let's see
what we got here.

55
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,577
Where'd you learn
to do sub-q sutures?

56
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,912
From your med student.

57
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,615
Well, I obviously
taught him well, didn't I?

58
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,249
Benton.

59
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,250
I'll see you later.

60
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,652
Listen, I thought I
should warn you.

61
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,854
You might want to
invest in a new suit or two

62
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:58,855
or maybe some luggage.

63
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,856
See, you're going to Paris

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,057
to present our
clamp-and-run study

65
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,759
to the<i> Institut
Français de Chirurgie.</i>

66
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,060
Are you serious?

67
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,029
<i>Oui.</i> Simon did a chi-square
analysis of our results.

68
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,897
Our P-value is .06,

69
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,132
which means we're
one successful outcome

70
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,867
away from statistical
significance.

71
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,168
W-we can publish?

72
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,704
Soon. One more aneurysm will
burnish our numbers to a glow

73
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,239
that will blind the
most dubious skeptics.

74
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,241
And after that, MacGruder
and I head to D.C.

75
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,575
to play dog-and-pony
for the FDA.

76
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,177
Now, Simon doesn't
fly, so he stays here,

77
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,779
which makes you
the next natural choice

78
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,580
for Clamp-and Run
Ambassador to Europe.

79
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,182
Whoa, whoa. I don't
know what to say.

80
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,651
Look, okay, I-I'm honored...

81
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,485
Good. It's good practice
for the future. Don't worry.

82
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,087
Now, you've got to
find another patient soon

83
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,089
because some Norwegians
are doing a similar study,

84
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,457
and Peter,

85
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,149
we cannot let the Vikings
pillage our thunder.

86
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,899
Hey, Malik, you seen Carter?

87
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,500
Yeah. He called
and said he'd be late.

88
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,286
He should be coming any minute.

89
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:52,358
Oh! No, wait. Wait! Wait!

90
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:56,028
Oh! Oh! Yeah! Oh, God!

91
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:59,399
John, oh, God! Oh, God!

92
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,155
Oh! Ah! Ah!

93
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:08,207
Oh, baby.

94
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,209
Oh!

95
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,712
I think we broke my record.

96
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:15,181
Yeah?

97
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,350
Oh, John. What?

98
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:20,620
Your control is phenomenal.

99
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,388
Yeah?

100
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:23,856
Yeah.

101
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,990
Yeah. Thank you.

102
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,631
You know, uh, the
interesting thing?

103
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:33,032
You may find this
hard to believe,

104
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,701
but that wasn't
always the case. No?

105
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:37,236
It's hard to believe.
It's true, though.

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,938
But I find if I could
distract myself

107
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,940
and think about
the mundane things,

108
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,997
then I could delay
the inevitable.

109
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:48,247
Well, what kind of
things do you think about?

110
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:51,016
Um, let's see.

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,720
Sometimes, I, uh,
take a mental inventory

112
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:55,955
of the machines in the O.R...

113
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,124
Thoraseal, ventilators,
auto-infusers.

114
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:01,627
And then, as the degree
of difficulty increases,

115
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:02,795
I run the procedures...

116
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,330
Appendectomies, thyroidectomies,

117
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,432
bowel resections.

118
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:08,234
Yuck!

119
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,570
What?

120
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,637
While we're making love,

121
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,006
you're thinking about
bowel resections?

122
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,908
Well, given your
earlier testimonial,

123
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,377
I figured this is a classic case

124
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,345
of the ends justifying
the means. What?!

125
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:21,197
I'm kidding. I'm just
kidding. Ow! Get out!

126
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,317
So last night, I get a
letter from Jen's lawyer

127
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,619
politely informing me
that she's suing me

128
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,688
for full custody of Rachel.

129
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,190
Oh, no.

130
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,025
Yeah, it seems I've been a
"distant and absent father."

131
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,295
This, after commuting from
Milwaukee for half a year.

132
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,531
Well, it sounds like
a lot of lawyer BS.

133
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,467
I can't imagine she'd
actually go through with it.

134
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,569
I was climbing
the walls all night.

135
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,604
Oh, that's why you're here.

136
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,439
Tiny prick.

137
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,075
I beg your pardon?

138
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,932
I need a TB test too.

139
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,615
So I hear Morgenstern has
really turned up the pressure

140
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,618
on you becoming Chief Resident.

141
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,787
Yeah. It's a good opportunity,

142
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,789
but can I do it and
not work killer hours?

143
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:57,293
You know how well I managed
to balance work and family.

144
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,627
Guess that answers that.

145
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,463
You'll be able to work it out.

146
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,882
Take your paperwork home,
hours won't be that bad.

147
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:04,083
Ow.

148
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:05,802
You have to cut Kerry
Weaver some slack.

149
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,787
What do you mean?

150
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:10,289
You go out of your
way to avoid her,

151
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:12,091
and if she is going
to be training you,

152
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:15,227
you're going to have to
work together hand-in-hand.

153
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:16,462
Oh, there's an image.

154
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,264
What are you doing
here on your day off?

155
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:20,533
I went for a jog
and ended up here,

156
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:23,002
and I figured, "What the hell.
Might as well save some lives."

157
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,171
Another good
reason not to exercise.

158
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,739
32-year-old male, postductal.

159
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,340
Five-minute grand mal seizure.

160
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,076
All right. I'll take it.

161
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,410
Start a chart.

162
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:33,245
On his day off?

163
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,650
Those TPN orders
should have been called in

164
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:38,851
an hour ago. Sorry. I forgot.

165
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,653
I thought you wanted
a residency here. I do.

166
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:43,056
If you keep forgetting, you're
going to end up in North Dakota.

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,256
We've got six slots,
300 applications.

168
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,658
When do interviews start?

169
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,660
They already have. I'm on
my way upstairs. You stay.

170
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,261
Vucelich needs one more
aneurysm for his study.

171
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:51,385
Abdominal pains, chest
pains, traumas, call me.

172
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,217
How often do you get
dizzy spells, Mrs. Henry?

173
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,819
Oh, I get three or four a day,

174
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,088
usually when I'm
working in the shed.

175
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,423
You garden this time of year?

176
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,893
I'm a vermiculturist.
I raise earthworms.

177
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:04,894
Really? Mm-hmm.

178
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,562
Big ones from Belgium.

179
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,130
Finest castings in the world.

180
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,331
And by castings, you mean...?

181
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,316
Worm dung.

182
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,018
Black gold.

183
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,988
It's the best fertilizer
money can buy.

184
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:16,573
It fixes the
nitrogen in the soil.

185
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,991
And you sell the stuff?

186
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,497
Well, I sell the worms.

187
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,980
You're blood
pressure's a little high.

188
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,715
So it pays well?

189
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,221
Yeah. Six figures.

190
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,719
Huh.

191
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,088
Has he had a seizure before?

192
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,257
No. He's a health
nut. He runs every day.

193
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,659
We're going to have to
get a CAT scan of his head

194
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,044
to pinpoint the
cause of the seizure.

195
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,262
Alan.

196
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,847
Alan?

197
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:42,599
When's he going to come back?

198
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,018
It takes a little time to
recover from a seizure.

199
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:46,486
How long? Usually
about 30 minutes.

200
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,510
Multi-focal PVCs.

201
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,274
What?

202
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,041
His heart rhythm's a little off.

203
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,478
Probably oxygen
deprivation from the seizure.

204
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,364
Has he had a murmur before? No.

205
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:00,032
Ah, it's probably
nothing serious.

206
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,485
Let's get an echo of
his heart after the CT,

207
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,469
just to be safe.

208
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:04,470
Lidocaine bolus,

209
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:05,471
100 milligrams,

210
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,261
then start a drip.

211
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,143
No. Carter, John Carter.

212
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,578
I was calling just because

213
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:15,581
I thought maybe you were
trying to get in touch with me

214
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,450
to set up an interview
for the Residency.

215
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,551
No, huh?

216
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,119
Well, I am available any...

217
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,021
Uh-huh.

218
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:26,291
Okay. Right.

219
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,760
I hear Vucelich
doubled his finder's fee

220
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:28,761
for an aneurysm.

221
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:29,762
Could be.

222
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,998
A-ha. I made 1000 bucks.

223
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,667
Patient presented
with a history of ulcers,

224
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,435
but he says the pain's
different this time.

225
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:37,436
Rigid belly?

226
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,037
Hard to tell, he's so fat,

227
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,273
but you see the calcifications
on the descending aorta?

228
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,375
No. Where?

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,876
Here.

230
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,910
No, it's too lateral.

231
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,129
Probably just
schmutz on his lungs.

232
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,196
So I shouldn't call Vucelich?

233
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,797
Yeah, if you want
to get yelled at.

234
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,815
Harper?

235
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,617
I need you to
get this guy to CT.

236
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:52,752
Coming.

237
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,954
Do me a favor and return
this x-ray to his room?

238
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,321
Yeah. Which room? Six.

239
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,523
Are you done with that? Yes.

240
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:58,925
Wow. That's a mother
of an aneurysm.

241
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:02,611
How can you tell?

242
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,435
Calcification on the
descending aorta.

243
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,417
Yeah.

244
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,436
Yeah.

245
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,438
We're going to run a
CAT scan on his head

246
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:13,472
to rule out lesions

247
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,207
that could have
caused the seizure.

248
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,275
Uh-oh.

249
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,709
What's wrong?

250
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,578
He's in V-tach. Get
him to trauma. Haleh!

251
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:20,813
I'm here.

252
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,614
I got a pulse. What's
wrong with him?

253
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,050
His heart rhythm's gotten worse.

254
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,751
You sure he hasn't
taken any medication? No.

255
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,019
Non-prescription
drugs? No, never. He...

256
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,988
Okay, we're going to
get this under control.

257
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,789
Can someone take Mrs.
Wimbur to the waiting room?

258
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,592
But I just want to...
It's okay. Thank you.

259
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:34,159
Let's get another
50 of lidocaine,

260
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,160
IV push.

261
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,829
Heart's racing. 200.

262
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,497
Rhythm is all over the place.

263
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,800
Looks like Torsade de Pointes.

264
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,970
All right, Harper, get
lytes and a tox screen,

265
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:46,171
and check, see if we've
got any records on this guy,

266
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,373
anything that'll give us a
clue as to what's going on.

267
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,374
Lido's on board.

268
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,943
What's your gut say, Haleh?

269
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,010
Low potassium?

270
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:53,813
Lydia? Cocaine.

271
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:56,965
His wife says he's tox free.
We'll know soon enough.

272
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,484
Heart rate's up to 210.

273
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,119
All right, let's try
and cardiovert.

274
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,887
Paddles. Start him at 100.

275
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:04,957
Hands off. Clear.

276
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,059
Faint pulse.

277
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,461
There we go.
That's a nice rhythm.

278
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:09,478
He moved his head.

279
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,746
Rate's down to 160.

280
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,347
180. Whoops, here we go again.

281
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,883
All right, lidocaine's
not working.

282
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,184
Let's try bretylium,
500 IV push.

283
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,321
Prep transvenus
pacemaker. Charge to 200.

284
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,995
Hands off.

285
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,061
What makes you think
this is an aneurysm, Carter?

286
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,396
The calcium plaque
on the descending aorta.

287
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,931
Well, you just
saved this man's life

288
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,733
and made a group of Norwegian
surgeons very unhappy.

289
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,702
Good work. Thank you.

290
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,703
Where's the patient?

291
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,170
Uh... Room six.

292
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,572
To room six.

293
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,430
Hey, way to go, Carter.

294
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,912
Labs are back. Lytes are normal.

295
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,147
Tox screen's negative.

296
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,215
We were both wrong.

297
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,150
What the hell's
wrong with this guy?

298
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,152
Rate's up to 220. Faint pulse.

299
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,154
Pacer's in.

300
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,940
Let's overdrive him to 230.

301
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,058
Maximum gain. Got it.

302
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,927
See if I can grab
hold of this rhythm.

303
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:58,961
You're on. You've got capture.

304
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,030
Lovely. Let's take
it down slowly.

305
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,198
210...

306
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,199
200.

307
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,200
180.

308
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,719
It's jumping back up.

309
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,771
Lost capture.
V-fib! Lost the pulse.

310
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:09,772
Let's start CPR.

311
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,341
Add Pronestyl, 100 mgs, IV Push.

312
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,377
Paddles. Set them at 360.

313
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,279
What time is it? 0845.

314
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:19,286
Mark that time.
Hands off. Clear. Clear.

315
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,636
Wide complex tachycardia.

316
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,205
Still no pulse. Time?

317
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,206
9:05.

318
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,541
How long's he been down?

319
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:31,610
20 minutes. Tried the
pacer. He went into V-fib.

320
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:32,978
Shocked him 15, 20 times.

321
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,081
He keeps running
these chaotic rhythms.

322
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,748
Could he be hypocalcemic?

323
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:37,849
No, lytes are fine.

324
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,553
Cocaine? Tox screen's negative.

325
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:43,055
Acidotic? Good question.

326
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,745
Let's get another gas.

327
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,744
Time? 0922.

328
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,880
Another 100 of Pronestyl.

329
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,316
Got your blood gases
here. PH 7.24, PO-2's 110.

330
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,851
Still in fib.

331
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,254
He's going down.

332
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,821
You gone through all
the anti-arrhythmics?

333
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,023
Still got a few more.

334
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,625
Stand by with the amiodarone.

335
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,126
Back up. Clear.

336
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,294
Time? 0932.

337
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,932
Still no pulse. Try
magnesium sulfate.

338
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,251
Clear. Clear.

339
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,319
Time? 9:41.

340
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,588
High dose epi, five mgs. Clear.

341
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,608
Time? ROSS: 9:45.

342
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,610
Clear.

343
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,912
Clear.

344
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,621
32 years old.

345
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:39,100
Time of death... 9:55.

346
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,632
Why?

347
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,766
There was an
electrical disturbance

348
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,335
in your husband's heart

349
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,104
that caused it to beat
in an irregular way.

350
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:53,242
I wish I could tell you
what caused it to happen,

351
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,510
but the truth is, I don't know.

352
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,313
Well, that's not good enough.

353
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,417
I mean... We came in here,
and his heart was... okay,

354
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,286
and you said it wasn't
anything serious,

355
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,155
so somebody must
have screwed up.

356
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,807
No. How did you let this happen?

357
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:11,032
Mrs. Wimbur... What
did you do to him?

358
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,744
Uh, hello, Alvin.

359
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:32,814
Oh. Well, do you, uh...
have his new number?

360
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,883
So, Kerry...

361
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:35,951
One...

362
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,854
Second.

363
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,489
Yes, Susan?

364
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,124
I've been thinking about
your invitation this morning,

365
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,925
and I would like
to throw my hat in

366
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,261
for Chief Resident.

367
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,597
I'm glad. I look forward
to showing you the ropes.

368
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,499
Me too.

369
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:55,504
Nobody signed up for
the gallbladder in 2 yet.

370
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,539
I've got it.

371
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,974
How long does a CAT scan take?

372
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,375
Hopefully, not
more than an hour,

373
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,210
but sometimes there's a wait.

374
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,379
I'm a little concerned
about my worms in the truck.

375
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,148
You brought your worms with you?

376
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,282
Just one bin.

377
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,952
I was making a delivery
when the dizziness hit.

378
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,353
You think someone
will steal them?

379
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,721
No. They're locked up.

380
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,990
You don't leave $5000
worth of worms unsecured.

381
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,625
But they could freeze.

382
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,626
Uh-huh.

383
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,094
Listen, if I gave you my keys,

384
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,564
could you bring them
in out of the cold?

385
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,132
Oh, we can't have
animals in the hospital.

386
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,534
Oh, there's no danger.

387
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,170
You know, worms are the only
disease-free organisms on earth.

388
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,337
It's a fact.

389
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,505
I really shouldn't.

390
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,542
Oh, please. They're my worms.

391
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,543
All right.

392
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,544
Oh, thank you.

393
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,212
Oh, and could you
feed them, please?

394
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,647
What do they eat?

395
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,149
Uh, table scraps, as
long it's vegetarian.

396
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,250
Nothing too greasy,

397
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,086
because fat doesn't
sit well with worms.

398
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,690
Mrs. D'Angelo, I see
you've been with us before.

399
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,058
Gallstones flaring up again?

400
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,325
They're killing me.

401
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,794
I can't sleep, I can't eat,

402
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,229
and every three weeks,
I end up back here.

403
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,831
Pain pills didn't help?

404
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,900
I took twice as much,
didn't do anything.

405
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,068
Yeah, you shouldn't do that.

406
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,269
Please, doctor,

407
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,872
get a surgeon to take
these damn stones out.

408
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,742
It's been going on like
this for six months now.

409
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,977
Aah! Aah!

410
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,129
Okay. Sorry.

411
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,767
Okay. I'll get an ultrasound
to see if there's any blockage.

412
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,136
Unless your condition
is life-threatening,

413
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,438
any surgery would be considered
elective, and unfortunately...

414
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,274
It's an 18-month waiting list.

415
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:23,608
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

416
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,443
My neighbor got
hers out the next day.

417
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,412
Does your neighbor
have private insurance?

418
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,347
Is it my fault I'm on Medicaid?

419
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:32,384
Okay, we'll start
with the ultrasound

420
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,769
and see what we have.

421
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,459
Thank you.

422
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:39,791
His name is Alan Wimbur.
You guys just picked him up.

423
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,961
I was hoping you could
do the autopsy today.

424
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:43,295
Hey, Jerry, where's
the ultrasound?

425
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,596
You got me.

426
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,632
Well, let me know,
because I'd like to observe.

427
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:48,968
Autopsy?

428
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:51,337
I want to find out what
happened to his heart.

429
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:52,704
You should go home.

430
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,706
His wife accused
me of killing him.

431
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,542
She's probably going to sue.

432
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:59,478
People get upset, feel they
need to blame someone.

433
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,213
I heard a murmur on exam.

434
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,415
Before getting an echo,
I wanted to get a CT.

435
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,950
Yeah, don't even think about it.

436
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,619
A guy comes in with a seizure,
first thing you want's a CT.

437
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:08,988
Thanks. I was just checking.

438
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,323
Dr. Greene, Dr. Morgenstern's
office just called.

439
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:13,058
He'd like to see you upstairs.

440
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,344
Oh, word travels fast.

441
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,214
You're making
excellent time, Peter.

442
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,248
Suction!

443
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,582
Let Carter suction!

444
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,184
It's his reward for
having a hound-like ability

445
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,352
to hunt down an aneurysm.

446
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,154
I just feel privileged to
be given the opportunity.

447
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,555
Well, now that's
what I call suction.

448
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,539
Thank you. Thank you.

449
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:28,843
MacGruder, is this patient warm?

450
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:30,843
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot.

451
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,010
MacGruder!

452
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,278
Temp is 106.

453
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,114
He has malignant hypothermia.

454
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,515
Is he reacting to the
anesthesia? Yeah.

455
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,150
Give him dantrolene. Get
ice packs, cooling blankets.

456
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,201
Peter, get out.

457
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,903
If we don't get his temp down,

458
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,505
he's going to have
scrambled eggs for brains.

459
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,957
Who took this
patient's history? I did.

460
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,358
How could you miss

461
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:48,227
that he was intolerant
to fluorathane? I asked...

462
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:51,030
Damn it! I lay out a banquet,
and you crap all over my table!

463
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:52,548
He never had an
operation before!

464
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,532
Cooling blankets are here.

465
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:54,950
Well, lift him up,
get him under.

466
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,752
Peter, come on over
here. Come on, come on.

467
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:57,753
Evert the cortex.

468
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,706
Log-roll him over.
Suction, Peter.

469
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,809
Another 5.0 proline. More ice.

470
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,210
Tie that off, Peter.

471
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,012
So he never had an
operation before, huh? No.

472
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:08,814
Well, you're right. There
was no way of knowing.

473
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:09,815
My apologies.

474
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,839
Metz! Metz!

475
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,425
Are you free for lunch?

476
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,792
Susan... Yeah?

477
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:21,994
Medical Records
sent down the chart

478
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:22,995
on your gallstone lady.

479
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:23,996
Thanks.

480
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,297
I took a peek.

481
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,666
I know she's been
on cefoxitin. Yeah.

482
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,135
Cefotaxime has better
biliary penetration.

483
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,702
Okay.

484
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,904
I know it's hard memorizing
all the antibiotics out there.

485
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:35,907
But it's well worth
the time. Right.

486
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:38,110
Who's the ultrasound
for? Same lady.

487
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,945
Didn't she have one last month?

488
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,747
She's complaining of more pain.

489
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:44,283
I want to rule out
obstruction and cholangitis.

490
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:45,884
Remember Charcot's triad.

491
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,486
Cholangitis is indicated
by pain, fever and jaundice,

492
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,887
of which your
patient only has one.

493
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,289
I think you can rule her out

494
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,090
without the expense
of an ultrasound.

495
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,183
If you're going to be Chief,
you gotta watch the bottom line.

496
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,631
Mark.

497
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:01,267
I don't believe you've
met Kathy Snyder,

498
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,602
one of the hospital attorneys.

499
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,103
Hello. Hello.

500
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,673
So this is about
this cardiac arrest

501
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,041
who died this morning?

502
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,426
I haven't heard
anything. Have you?

503
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,161
Uh... No.

504
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,847
Kathy wanted to talk
about the O'Brien lawsuit.

505
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,932
Oh. Did we get a court date?

506
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,851
We've worked out a settlement
with Mr. O'Brien's attorney.

507
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,103
Hmm. I'm not sure
that I want to settle.

508
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,472
The hospital is sure.
It's a good thing, Mark.

509
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,474
Mr. O'Brien gets compensated
for the loss of his wife,

510
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,942
and you can put this behind you.

511
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,344
If I settle, this is gonna
follow me my entire career.

512
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,064
Every time I apply for a
staff job or insurance...

513
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,566
If it's a trial,

514
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,333
we could lose
two million easily.

515
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,153
You want to lug that
around your entire career?

516
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,888
I have been over
this 1000 times.

517
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,123
I didn't do anything wrong.

518
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,208
It was

519
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,659
a very complicated delivery.

520
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,462
I did as good a job as any
emergency physician could have.

521
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,763
Other emergency physicians

522
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,904
would, and have,
disagreed with you.

523
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,738
A pregnant woman
comes in with preeclampsia

524
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,675
and, for whatever reason,
you didn't pick up on it.

525
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,344
Her condition was masked
by a urinary infection.

526
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,013
Look, I don't want to argue
the details with you, Mark.

527
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,681
You make thousands
of diagnoses a year.

528
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,217
99% of them

529
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,218
are right on.

530
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,819
You made a
mistake, as we all do.

531
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,572
I don't accept
that. Mark, please...

532
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,757
No. This is my
reputation as a doctor.

533
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,110
I'm not going to settle.
Take my name off of it.

534
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,779
You can't separate
yourself from the suit.

535
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,937
Well, I'll hire my own
lawyer, and I'll fight it myself.

536
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,371
Ugh.

537
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,923
That's a lot of worms.

538
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:33,676
Hey, big fellow.

539
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,910
Woman says she makes
a fortune selling these.

540
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,179
To whom? Landscapers, farmers.

541
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,548
Could be a great sideline.

542
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,417
You're kidding, right?

543
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,602
No. These guys could
pay for the hole in my roof.

544
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:45,704
I cleaned the spoiled
food out of the fridge.

545
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:48,440
Veggie? That's
what you asked for.

546
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,575
They don't like grease.

547
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,119
How do they feel about yogurt?

548
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:55,297
I don't hear any complaining.

549
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,988
Eat up, little worms.

550
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,271
John.

551
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,305
Hi.

552
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,789
Told you it was an aneurysm.

553
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:05,791
You were right.

554
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,965
Did Vucelich know who I was?

555
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:15,584
Didn't you tell him about
me? That I found it?

556
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,637
I meant to. I mean,
I should have.

557
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,972
The whole thing
happened really fast.

558
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:25,416
I was going to say something,
and they just assumed that...

559
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,076
What are you doing in here?

560
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,246
The hospital decided
to settle the O'Brien suit.

561
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,616
Uh, isn't that good news?

562
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,785
Morgenstern thinks I'm at fault

563
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,120
for not picking up
the preeclampsia.

564
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,756
That's not fair. He
wasn't even there.

565
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
You were there.

566
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:59,294
It was as complicated
a case as I've ever seen.

567
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,796
You did everything you could.

568
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,348
You think I should have
caught the preeclampsia?

569
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:04,416
It was a difficult diagnosis.

570
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,385
Any one of us
could have missed it.

571
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,387
But if you were called
up on the witness stand

572
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,788
and asked, "Did Mark
Greene screw up,"

573
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:10,995
what would you say?

574
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:18,836
I'm sorry, Mark.

575
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,597
Come on, dude, be bold.

576
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,031
We start our own
investment club.

577
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,500
We collect right off the bat.

578
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,568
No, thanks, man.

579
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,869
Oh, what's to lose?

580
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,237
What did you lose? 2 grand?

581
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,472
Hey, Alvin's going
to come through.

582
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,640
Jerry, can you find out

583
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,241
why that worm lady
isn't back from CT?

584
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,242
Uh, she had palpitations,

585
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,610
so they're doing
a cardiac work-up.

586
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,812
Okay. Call me when
she comes down.

587
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,047
Jerry, did Medical Records
copy a chart for me?

588
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,349
Yeah. O'Brien, right?

589
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,506
Yep. Thanks.

590
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,488
Hey, what happened to
those worms in Radiology?

591
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,789
They're doing a consult.

592
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:01,856
No, no, no, those earthworms.

593
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,458
I put a bucket of
earthworms in there

594
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,593
and they're gone.

595
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,116
Well, I didn't take them.

596
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,613
Hey, Ray. I'm Dr. Ross.

597
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,882
I understand you've
been having headaches

598
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,200
and missing some school?

599
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,403
Yeah. They hurt pretty
bad. Mm-hmm. Okay.

600
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,538
Where in your head does it hurt?

601
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,973
Here.

602
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:22,961
How long you been having
these? About a month.

603
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,363
How often?

604
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:27,988
Um, all the time, I guess.

605
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:31,269
Do you feel dizzy? Uh, yeah.

606
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:32,804
Okay. Pull like that. Mm-hmm.

607
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,305
You play sports?

608
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,042
J.V. football, middle
linebacker. All right.

609
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:39,444
When I was a running back,
we used to hate you guys.

610
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:40,796
Squeeze my hand.

611
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,864
Mm-hmm. Okay, you ever
get headaches playing sports?

612
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,216
No.

613
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,418
No. Okay, well, we're
going to get you a CAT scan.

614
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:48,120
You know what that is? Um...

615
00:23:48,144 --> 00:23:51,156
No? It's when we take
a picture of your brain.

616
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,020
We want to make
sure it's still in there.

617
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:58,602
All right. I'll be
back in a minute.

618
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,625
Tradition holds

619
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,928
they serve olive and
walnuts with the drink.

620
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,997
Dr. Vucelich, Dr. Benton,
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

621
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,932
I misled you both earlier.

622
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,534
The finder's fee for the
aneurysm this morning

623
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,952
should go to Harper Tracy.

624
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,038
She's a third-year medical
student. She caught it.

625
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,674
Well, taking credit
for a colleague's work

626
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,960
is a very dangerous
precedent, Mr. Carter.

627
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:31,363
I can assure you that it
will never happen again.

628
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,966
Well, your reassurance
rings hollow just now.

629
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,467
One has to wonder

630
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,802
if this is a momentary
lapse of integrity on your part

631
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,938
or a sign of a fundamental
flaw in your character.

632
00:24:39,962 --> 00:24:41,723
Well, time will tell.

633
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,725
In any event, the patient's
secondary condition

634
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,612
means he's not an appropriate
candidate for the study,

635
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:48,147
so there will be
no finder's fee.

636
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,781
Is there anything else?

637
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:51,972
No.

638
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,910
Strange boy.

639
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,743
The patient is being excluded?

640
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,978
What's that? Oh, yes.

641
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,314
It seems that he
has a history of,

642
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,717
excuse me,
neurological problems,

643
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,320
which exceed the
parameters of the protocol, so...

644
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,989
What were we
talking about, Peter?

645
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,924
Oh, I remember. George Cinq.

646
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,092
Walnuts, olives.

647
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,945
Actually, I was an<i> habitué</i>

648
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,680
of this bistro called
"L'Amie Louis,"

649
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:22,848
and there was a...

650
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,983
Mrs. D'Angelo,
feeling any better?

651
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,319
No. Are you going
to do that test?

652
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,987
I consulted with another doctor,

653
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:31,256
and we feel that the
ultrasound is unnecessary.

654
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,991
You don't have any new symptoms.

655
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:34,826
You're not even going to check?

656
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,229
Given that you
don't have a fever

657
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:38,629
or any other symptoms,

658
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:40,932
there's no way I can
justify the expense.

659
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,769
The expense. I see.

660
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,005
I can take it from here.

661
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:48,673
I know the routine.

662
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:52,810
Ow. The nurse gives me
a few pills that don't work,

663
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,180
and I'm pushed out the door.

664
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,648
I checked the elective
surgery waiting list,

665
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:59,051
and they can get you
in by the end of the year.

666
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,408
It's February 1st.

667
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,507
Help!

668
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,541
What happened?

669
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,909
They were out by the trash.

670
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,094
Must have been there an hour.

671
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:10,912
Wendy, I want you to get
some warming blankets.

672
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:11,913
Heat up some saline.

673
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,115
We'll do a warm water lavage.

674
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,916
We could get a few of
those warming lamps

675
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,384
they use on newborns.

676
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,176
Great. Great idea. Go up to
OB, see if they'll lend us some.

677
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,224
All right... Oh, damn it!

678
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,225
The lid's frozen.

679
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,426
Oh, God. All right.

680
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,862
Rib spreader, rib spreader.

681
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,030
W-what are you doing?

682
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,631
I'm gonna knock
it loose, like a jar.

683
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,566
What do you got?
Hypothermia, earthworms.

684
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,801
5 grand worth.

685
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,119
Earthworms? Yeah.
They're Belgian.

686
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:37,121
They don't take kindly to cold.

687
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,690
Got it, got it!

688
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:40,875
Oh, no! Oh, it's frozen solid.

689
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,178
Oh! Well, maybe they're
still alive underneath.

690
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,212
Surgical mallet.

691
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,315
Reflex hammer.

692
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,383
Thanks.

693
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,087
All right, all right.

694
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,611
Oh, no. What am I
going to tell Mrs. Henry?

695
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,326
Good news, buddy.

696
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,428
Your brain's right
where it should be.

697
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,764
All right. Let's
talk about school.

698
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,899
Why?

699
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,701
Well, because school
can cause stress,

700
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,368
and stress can cause headaches.

701
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,837
Are you having any trouble

702
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,339
with your classes or students
or teachers or anything like that?

703
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,874
No.

704
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,693
No? All right. What about
your girlfriend? Any problems?

705
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:15,710
Which one?

706
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,778
There's a problem right there.

707
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,847
How many girlfriends
do you have?

708
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,815
A few. I don't know.

709
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,684
Mm-hmm. All right.

710
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,519
You're not doing drugs,
are you? Smoking pot?

711
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:25,687
No.

712
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,911
No? No... No.

713
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,610
You okay?

714
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:33,967
Yeah, I'm fine. Mm-hmm.

715
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:38,922
What's the matter?

716
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,456
I can't. I can't...

717
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,375
What?

718
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,711
There's something
wrong with me. Mm-hmm?

719
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,646
Okay.

720
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,648
All guys who are your age,

721
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,533
they think that there's
something wrong with them.

722
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,635
No.

723
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,137
I'm different.

724
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,645
How are you different?

725
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,818
The girls at school...

726
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,836
I...

727
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,745
I don't feel anything
when I'm around them.

728
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:25,018
I think I'm gay.

729
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:29,622
I know I am.

730
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,522
I mean, what am I
supposed to tell my dad?

731
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,862
My brothers?

732
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:45,154
I am just sick of... of
being this fake person.

733
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,603
Haleh, will you call psych?

734
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,204
See if we can get
a Resident down

735
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,007
to take a look at the kid in 1,

736
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,908
preferably somebody
from Adolescent Medicine.

737
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,043
What's the problem?

738
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,310
Kid thinks he's gay.

739
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,312
He needs somebody to talk to.

740
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,003
I'm going to lunch.

741
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,986
I'll check the charts.

742
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,889
Try and make yourself
useful, huh? Okay.

743
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,026
Good catch this
morning on the aneurysm.

744
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,427
Harper, Carter, give me a hand.

745
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,829
What happened?

746
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,064
She collapsed in the lobby.

747
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,732
Acute shortness of
breath, chest pain.

748
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,000
Pulse is high.

749
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,557
Carter, start her
on an oxygen mask.

750
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,638
Harper, what do we order?

751
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:27,041
Oh, EKG, chest film,
blood gas, Chem-7,

752
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,709
CBC, cardiac enzymes.

753
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,345
And...?

754
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,613
Myoglobin. Myoglobin.

755
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:32,847
Do it!

756
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,249
She has neck-vein distension.

757
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,250
Temp's 101.

758
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,251
Susan!

759
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,318
Chief complaint?

760
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,053
Shortness of
breath, chest pains.

761
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,256
She has a history
of renal failure.

762
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,625
What's the differential? Susan?

763
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,260
Harper.

764
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,196
Acute MI, pulmonary embolism,
pneumonia, pericarditis,

765
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,364
congestive heart failure...

766
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,816
Pleural effusion. Pleural
effusion. Stop that!

767
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,417
Do I hear prompting
from the peanut gallery?

768
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:55,787
Let's get a gas cooking
and get an EKG.

769
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:57,589
See how her heart's doing.

770
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:58,613
After you.

771
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:11,436
Whoo! Hell of a way
to spend your day off.

772
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,238
Yeah. I wish I never
would have come in,

773
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:15,273
believe me.

774
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:16,608
Jody O'Brien?

775
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:19,377
It's the first time
I've looked at that

776
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,612
since the big day.

777
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:22,397
She had two high
BPs, proteinuria.

778
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,366
I missed the preeclampsia.

779
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,666
If I hadn't, she'd be alive.

780
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,853
It could have happened
to any of us at any day.

781
00:30:27,877 --> 00:30:30,822
Not supposed to happen to
me. Well, you are arrogant.

782
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:32,557
Arrogant?

783
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,326
It's like there's
you and the Pope.

784
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,227
You guys are infallible.

785
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,962
Then, of course,
there's the rest of us.

786
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:42,133
Yeah? Well, after today,
the Pope's on his own.

787
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:43,585
Good.

788
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,653
I think I might
have killed that guy

789
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,677
this morning.

790
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,824
Mark... Hey, Mark.

791
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,526
When I first checked his heart,

792
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,660
I heard a murmur.

793
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,829
He must have had
a congenital defect.

794
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,131
That guy crashed 10
minutes after he got in there.

795
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,166
There's nothing you
could have done about that.

796
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,167
Yes, there is.

797
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,669
I could have gotten an echo,

798
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,071
and then I could have
gotten him straight to the O.R.

799
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:08,343
You're holding yourself to
a ridiculous standard, Mark.

800
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,944
I've got to get to an autopsy.

801
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,801
It's your day off. Go home.

802
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,235
Low-voltage EKG.

803
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,603
BP's falling.

804
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,005
She's decompensating.
Where's that blood gas?

805
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,007
I'll check. You got it?

806
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:24,275
These numbers don't make sense.

807
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,543
Uh-oh. What?

808
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,561
Looks like you hit a
vein instead of an artery.

809
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,814
Is that the blood gas?
No. Yeah, but I screwed up.

810
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:32,117
I tapped a vein
instead of an artery.

811
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,718
No, I screwed up
and tapped a vein.

812
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:36,221
Well, whoever screwed
up, do it again and do it right.

813
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:37,688
Carter, you do it.

814
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:38,789
Non-specific ST changes.

815
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,891
Where are we? Susan.

816
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,309
I don't know where
you are, Kerry,

817
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,010
but I'm at pericardial effusion.

818
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,562
Or pump failure or an embolism.

819
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,731
Let's get an echo!

820
00:31:46,755 --> 00:31:48,933
Positive Ewart's sign.

821
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:52,037
Pressure's down, 50/30.

822
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:53,871
Pericardiocentesis tray!

823
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:56,307
Don't you think you should
confirm your diagnosis

824
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,043
before sticking a
needle in her heart?

825
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,544
I've made my diagnosis.

826
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:02,547
Alligator clamp
is on the needle.

827
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:04,783
The diagnostic gold standard
is an echocardiogram.

828
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,384
Fine. You wait while
the tech comes down.

829
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:08,842
I'll see if there's any fluid
around her heart. Okay.

830
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:17,868
I'm in.

831
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:22,400
Anything yet?

832
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:23,757
Nope. Not yet.

833
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,324
Here it comes.

834
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:32,159
What do you know?
Looks a little cloudy.

835
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,112
I wonder if it's transudate
or exudate fluid.

836
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:37,782
Anyone know the gold
standard to differentiate the two?

837
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:39,317
Kerry?

838
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:40,919
Measure LDH to protein.

839
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:42,220
What's the LDH ratio

840
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:44,789
to identify exudate fluid?

841
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:47,091
I'd have to look it up.

842
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:48,364
It's .5 to one.

843
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,942
Greene?

844
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,360
Yeah.

845
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,628
You guys should come
down here more often,

846
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,129
brush up on your gross anatomy.

847
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,130
You guys find
anything conclusive?

848
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,599
Why? What are you looking for?

849
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,367
Something wrong with the heart.

850
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,819
Think you missed something?

851
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:16,954
Possibly.

852
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:21,493
Well, you came at
just the right time.

853
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:22,794
Size and shape, normal.

854
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:24,295
380 grams.

855
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,063
Okay, who wants to section this?

856
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,900
Bill, I think it's your turn.

857
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,290
Martin, will you
hand him a knife?

858
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,983
Doug, it's been an hour,

859
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,819
and psych still hasn't
come down for that boy.

860
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:49,453
All right, I'll call them.

861
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:50,922
Why don't you
talk to him yourself?

862
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,389
Because there's nothing
physically wrong with him,

863
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,859
and I have four other patients.

864
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:58,662
Is it because the kid's gay?

865
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,497
What?

866
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:03,500
You heard me.

867
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:05,236
If you mean, is it because

868
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,270
that boy's particular problems

869
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,239
fall out of my
frame of reference

870
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:11,809
or my area of expertise,
then the answer is yes.

871
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:15,113
If you mean, is it
because I'm homophobic,

872
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,281
then the answer is no.

873
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,805
Okay?

874
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:25,340
No congenital or
valvular anomalies.

875
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,507
Endocardium, normal.

876
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,143
Myocardium, of normal
thickness and color.

877
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,347
Blood vessels at base, normal.

878
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:36,484
Coronary ostia are in the
usual anatomical position.

879
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,387
Arteries show no sign
of plaque. He's normal.

880
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,356
No sign of anything congenital?

881
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,527
Were you here just a second
ago? What was the cause of death?

882
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,828
Typical ER thinking...

883
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,613
Got to be cause
and effect, right?

884
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:49,747
Down here, we operate

885
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,866
on a slightly different gestalt.

886
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,954
Sometimes, there are answers,
but many times... mystery.

887
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:57,855
That's not very satisfying.

888
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:00,759
Mm. You think
you're a scientist?

889
00:35:00,783 --> 00:35:02,360
You want explanations,
hard answers,

890
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:04,062
algorithms of care?

891
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:05,847
That's dog crap.

892
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,384
Medicine's an art,
and art is ambiguous.

893
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,552
All right.

894
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:13,721
Preliminary results:
Idiopathic dysrhythmia.

895
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,385
No known cause of death.

896
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,596
Nurse?

897
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,531
Hi. How are you feeling?

898
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,867
Oh, tired.

899
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,169
They gave me a
million-dollar work-up

900
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,238
and couldn't find
anything wrong.

901
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:33,458
I just want to take my
worms and go home.

902
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:37,094
I have some bad news for you.

903
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:38,295
Your worms were
mistaken for trash

904
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,898
and put outside in
the snow. Oh, no.

905
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,868
By the time I found out,
they were already frozen solid.

906
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,202
We brought them in,

907
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,205
we tried to warm them with
blankets and warm water.

908
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,507
We used all our capabilities,

909
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:52,110
but we couldn't get them back.

910
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:53,466
I'm very sorry.

911
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,487
Can I see them?

912
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,138
What's that?

913
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,140
Vucelich's study protocol.

914
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,810
"Parameters for
exclusionary status."

915
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,645
Are you excluding someone?

916
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,146
Vucelich did.

917
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,115
Anyone I know?

918
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:18,086
Guy we worked on
today. He went bad.

919
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,721
He ever drop people who do well?

920
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,889
Why are you reading this now?

921
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,558
Has he dropped
someone before this?

922
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,549
Mrs. Rubadoux.

923
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,165
He's... he's not, I mean...

924
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,667
Vucelich wouldn't
drop bad outcomes

925
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,691
just to pretty up his
numbers, would he?

926
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,078
I don't know.

927
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,976
I don't need you trying
to hide my mistakes.

928
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,778
If I screw up, let
me deal with it.

929
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:44,779
You're right.

930
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,514
Don't lie on my behalf. I won't.

931
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,715
It's insulting. I got it, okay?

932
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,517
I gave you the credit.
What do you want?

933
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,618
What is with you today?

934
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,086
It's this residency thing.

935
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,656
My chances of getting in here
are about one in 50-something.

936
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,457
I don't even have an
interview set up yet.

937
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:57,959
I'm gonna end up
in North Dakota.

938
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,193
Damn it! What?

939
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,529
I forgot Dr. Benton's
night TPN orders.

940
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,231
None of his post-ops are
getting their IV supplements.

941
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,671
I got to run.

942
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,018
Susan...

943
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:12,357
One... second.

944
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:13,691
Yes, Kerry?

945
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,893
According to the
Washington manual,

946
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,596
the determinative
LDH ratio isn't .5 to one.

947
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,097
It's .6.

948
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,866
Oh, you got me again.

949
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,537
If you're going to be Chief,
get your facts straight.

950
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:29,023
You know what? If
being Chief means

951
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,825
having you breathing
down my back all day long,

952
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,827
to hell with it.
Life's too short.

953
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:35,897
I don't want you as my
mentor. Just stay out of my way.

954
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,498
That's the first time
I've ever seen you

955
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,266
act like a Chief Resident.

956
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,641
Maybe Morgenstern was right.

957
00:37:51,987 --> 00:37:55,032
Hey, Ray, where are you going?
I was just coming to talk to you.

958
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:57,234
I was just telling my dad
how good I've been feeling.

959
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:58,436
It was taking a long time,

960
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,704
and the nurse said the
CAT scan, it was okay?

961
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,905
Yeah, it's normal.

962
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,740
No tumors or, uh...
I hate to tell you

963
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,077
what's been going
through my head.

964
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:07,744
No, he's fine. Thank God.

965
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:09,814
Uh... could be migraines?

966
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:11,816
Uh, yes. It could
also be stress-related,

967
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,418
which is something
that I wanted to talk

968
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:14,985
to Ray about, if I could just...

969
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,154
I know what it is.
It's that damn trig.

970
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,772
Every time I have
one of those quizzes,

971
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,892
I get these headaches.
You're kidding.

972
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:22,709
No, I do. Could
that be what this is?

973
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,944
Uh, it could.

974
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,696
Because if that's it, I
know the prescription:

975
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,549
Applying the seat of your
pants to the seat of the chair.

976
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:29,900
Yeah.

977
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,602
Button your coat.

978
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:32,837
I'm sorry about this.

979
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,855
I spent the whole damn
day in the waiting room.

980
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,889
It's okay.

981
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,692
Listen, Ray, if you
want to talk about this

982
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,293
or anything else at all,

983
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,145
you just call me here, okay?

984
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:42,402
Sure.

985
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,569
I thought that she
was still at Beth Israel

986
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,706
doing protein kinase, or
whatever it is she does.

987
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,907
Oh, right, right...

988
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,709
He's on the phone.
Be off in a minute.

989
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,111
No, no. I don't need him anyway.

990
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,712
Look, I just want
to get the records

991
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,713
on one of our patients.

992
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,714
Which one?

993
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,617
Rubadoux, Sylvie.

994
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,774
I believe she was dropped.

995
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,190
Claire, could you come
in here for a second?

996
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,391
I can't find my pocket schedule.

997
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,159
Help yourself.

998
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,194
Yeah, I'm sorry.

999
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,595
My life is unraveling
as we speak.

1000
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,397
What jacket did you
wear at the lecture?

1001
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,731
Dear Claire, let's be serious.

1002
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,733
How could I possibly know
what jacket I was wearing?

1003
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,135
Why don't you just
find my schedule

1004
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,436
like I asked you to?

1005
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,238
Who's that? Who's been
asking? No, no, tell me.

1006
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,640
Kemper's been asking?

1007
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,343
Well, you can tell Kemper
that I am centimeters away.

1008
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,345
With any luck, I'll be in
the<i> New England Journal</i>

1009
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,713
next month.

1010
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,515
Yes, I'm afraid I'm
going to miss the forum,

1011
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,716
so please pass on my regrets.

1012
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,418
Tell them I've
checked into McClean

1013
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,287
to ride out a fugue state.

1014
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:44,314
21, 22, 23, 24, 25...

1015
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,961
Damn, man. Where
did you get all that?

1016
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:49,963
Alvin came through.

1017
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,000
No guts, no glory.

1018
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,201
You've got to be kidding me.

1019
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,603
Life ain't fair.

1020
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,838
Are you going to
report that to the IRS?

1021
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,840
I assume that's a
rhetorical question.

1022
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,241
Well, I'm going to
make my fortune

1023
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,243
the old-fashioned, legal way.

1024
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,512
Delivering Chinese food?

1025
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,714
No. Raising earthworms.
I got a dozen in there.

1026
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,115
I thought those
worms froze to death.

1027
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,318
Nope, most of them moved
into the middle of the bin

1028
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:11,319
for warmth and survived.

1029
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,420
Is that brilliant?

1030
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,155
You took that lady's worms.

1031
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,557
I did not. She gave me
enough to start my own colony.

1032
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,259
It's my ticket out of this dump.

1033
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,411
Come on, guys, let's
go home. Good night.

1034
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:22,213
Good night. Bye.

1035
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:23,237
Aah.

1036
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:27,885
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

1037
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:29,386
No, you didn't.

1038
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,255
I just finished your
discharge summaries,

1039
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:32,522
I called in your TPN orders,

1040
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:33,724
and I rounded the
patients upstairs.

1041
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,126
Can I go home now?

1042
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,577
Goodbye, Carter.

1043
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,847
I'm sorry about what
happened earlier. Mm-hmm.

1044
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,014
Good night.

1045
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,250
Carter. Yeah?

1046
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,586
Were those TPN
orders called in on time?

1047
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,921
Yeah.

1048
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,590
No. I screwed up again.

1049
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,425
They were 45 minutes late.

1050
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,384
I know. I called the pharmacy.

1051
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,857
So are we sworn enemies forever?

1052
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,513
No.

1053
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,230
Denial is a funny thing.

1054
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,665
It keeps you from asking
the scary questions.

1055
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,933
Which ones?

1056
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:36,436
The ones I've been
asking myself all day today.

1057
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,672
Am I dangerous?

1058
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,608
Should I be practicing medicine?

1059
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,611
We all ask those questions,

1060
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,046
and the answers
are "no" and "yes"

1061
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,047
in that order.

1062
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,316
I hope so.

1063
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,540
I lost my family for this job.

1064
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,790
You're wallowing.

1065
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:58,092
Yes, I am wallowing.

1066
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,344
First good wallow I've had

1067
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:02,213
in a while, so don't ruin it.

1068
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:03,981
Well, I'm going to drive home.

1069
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,382
You want a ride?

1070
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:08,607
Nope. I jogged in.
I'm going to jog out.

1071
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,256
Hey, you want to
hear something funny?

1072
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,457
Definitely.

1073
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:15,993
You know that guy
who died this morning?

1074
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:17,294
It wasn't my fault.

1075
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:20,398
I did everything right,
and he died anyway.

1076
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:22,900
So, what's the lesson in that?

1077
00:42:22,924 --> 00:42:24,569
You can't win.

1078
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:29,574
Oh, man. You are wallowing.

1079
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:30,942
Good night.

1080
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,149
Good night.

1081
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:36,664
Susan?

1082
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:37,798
Yeah?

1083
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:41,168
Did anybody think it was
odd my coming in today?

1084
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,771
No.

1085
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,345
Oh. I was just checking.

1086
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,560
Good night.

1087
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:50,816
Good night.
