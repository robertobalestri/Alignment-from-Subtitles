1
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,616
Excuse me.

2
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,191
Sorry.

3
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,240
<i>Doug Ross. Leave a message.</i>

4
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,144
Doug. Doug, it's Mark.

5
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,712
You there? Pick up.

6
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,246
Hello, hello.

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,682
You there?

8
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,983
Listen,

9
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,785
I left that sub-I paperwork
on the kitchen table,

10
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,486
and I need it.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,555
Doug.

12
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,024
Doug.

13
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,548
Shut up, man!

14
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,972
Oh, man!

15
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:11,119
Put this on your face.

16
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,369
He was here in the
emergency department.

17
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,605
They moved him up to Surgery.

18
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:19,872
You have one thing to do.

19
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:21,140
I've got 13 million.

20
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,842
Yeah, Dr. Weaver
wants those films now,

21
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,744
and she's not somebody
you want to mess with.

22
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:27,180
Hey, watch your mouth.

23
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:29,148
I hope you're not
Carol Hathaway.

24
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,206
Do I look like a nurse?

25
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,089
I'm very sorry, but...

26
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:39,992
if you could just wait
in the waiting room.

27
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,695
I don't have any information

28
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,095
about your son.

29
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,731
Hey, Wendy, can you come here

30
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:45,932
and help me with Mrs. Valdez?

31
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:47,334
They took her kid up to Surgery

32
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,735
about an hour ago.

33
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,473
Hey.

34
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,208
Hey, Jerry. What's going on?

35
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:56,609
Some serious gang-banging

36
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:57,910
in the wee hours.

37
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:59,045
Cops did a sweep

38
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,279
right under our carpet.

39
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:01,448
Trauma 1 or 2?

40
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:02,449
Take your pick.

41
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,583
Hey. That's your girl.

42
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:04,718
Miss Hathaway?

43
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:05,819
Yes?

44
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:07,119
Abraham Zimble,
the mobile notary.

45
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,120
Oh, yes, yes.

46
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,322
Thank you so much for coming.

47
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:10,323
Your escrow papers.

48
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,124
Oh, God, I have
to sign all of those?

49
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:13,226
By five o'clock,

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,627
or they won't give
you the house.

51
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:15,962
Okay, look, do you mind waiting?

52
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,163
$20 an hour, no problem.

53
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,531
Great. Okay.

54
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,532
BP's dropping

55
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,533
to 80/40,

56
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,735
pulse 150.

57
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,935
Cap refill is slowing down.

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,936
Resps 36, labored.

59
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,004
Need anything?

60
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,205
I don't suppose
you brought coffee.

61
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,206
Sorry.

62
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,441
Susan done with
that portable yet?

63
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:29,476
Doesn't look like it.

64
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,510
Call the O.R.

65
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,111
and let them do
the x-rays up there.

66
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,913
We've got this one. See
if Susan needs help...

67
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:34,914
Okay.

68
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:35,915
And tell her

69
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,083
to stop hogging that x-ray.

70
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:39,586
You're supposed to
stop hogging that x-ray.

71
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,587
She's all theirs.

72
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,455
They took him up to the O.R.

73
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,456
What's he got?

74
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,657
GSW to the face and abdomen.

75
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,058
Only it's a she, not a he.

76
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,660
Couldn't tell till we
cut open his shirt.

77
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,028
Abdomen's distended.
No bowel sounds.

78
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:50,663
I'll prep for a lavage.

79
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,064
You and Kerry the only ones on?

80
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,666
Carter and Benton
are in surgery.

81
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,701
Paged Ross, no answer,

82
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:55,702
and Mark's

83
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:56,703
on the train from Milwaukee.

84
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:57,937
Just us womenfolk.

85
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,005
What's up with that?

86
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,172
Oh, yeah.

87
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,974
Malik, see what's
keeping that O-neg,

88
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,965
would you?

89
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:23,362
Doug?

90
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,435
What are you doing here?

91
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,236
You didn't get my message?

92
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,538
What message?

93
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,972
I left the sub-I paperwork here

94
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,507
and Morgenstern
wants to review it today.

95
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:36,676
Look, why don't you
hurry up, get dressed,

96
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,194
and I'll ride in with you?

97
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,663
Why don't you just go? I
don't want to make you late.

98
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,864
No, no. I'm already late, so...

99
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,466
No, it's all right.

100
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,101
I'm gonna run some
errands and... It's okay.

101
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,636
Your beeper's going...

102
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,037
off.

103
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,257
Morning.

104
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,885
All right, look, it's
not what you think.

105
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,603
But it's what
I've seen, isn't it?

106
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,020
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

107
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,189
I've overlooked a lot of
your behavior, Doug...

108
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,158
but now a medical student?

109
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,677
All right, Mark, look, wait...

110
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,744
There are rules, Doug.

111
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,345
You can't go breaking
them all the time

112
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:14,547
and expect me to do nothing...

113
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:15,548
Come on, Mark.

114
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:16,949
You don't get it, do you, Doug?

115
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,751
You could be out
on your butt for this,

116
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:19,752
and I could be too,

117
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:20,920
for not reporting you.

118
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:22,488
Mark, wait...

119
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,945
Okay, that's fine.

120
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,344
Whoa!

121
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:22,214
Hey, yo! Chill out!

122
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,382
I told you,

123
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,117
you're going to have to wait.

124
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,720
Don't make me say it again.

125
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,922
Have you seen Dr. Greene?

126
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,156
He's busy...

127
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,091
forever.

128
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,593
My name's Jeanie Boulet.

129
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,728
We haven't met.

130
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,762
I'm a new physician assistant.

131
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,063
I start my ER rotation today.

132
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,364
Oh, God, who died

133
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:40,733
and gave you their bad luck?

134
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,067
Well, you'll need one of these.

135
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,804
They're a lousy fit,
but it's all we've got.

136
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:46,104
Hey, next time,

137
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,440
you stay, I'll go to X-ray.

138
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:48,441
Sorry.

139
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:49,442
Hey, Jeanie.

140
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,443
You starting this morning?

141
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:51,444
Yeah.

142
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:52,645
Jerry, I need
those Benieto films

143
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:53,846
before the end
of the millennium.

144
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,280
They just came in.

145
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,382
This is Jeanie Boulet, a
new physician assistant.

146
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:58,383
Kerry Weaver, Chief Resident.

147
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,418
First day?

148
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,453
Yeah.

149
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,487
I think you'll find

150
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:02,521
it's a vaguely friendly crowd.

151
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:03,923
My first day was certainly

152
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,891
a bundle of open arms.

153
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,025
What do you think?

154
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:08,961
Uh, looks like a
comminuted fracture

155
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,329
of the distal femur

156
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,498
and a mid-shaft humerus...

157
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,333
Excuse me.

158
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:15,434
50% apposition

159
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,635
and 30 degrees of angulation.

160
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,036
You know your
way around an x-ray.

161
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,037
Good start.

162
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:20,038
I am a physical therapist.

163
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:21,039
I was a physical therapist.

164
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:22,240
All right, on my count.

165
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:23,241
One, two, three.

166
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:24,443
What have we got, Peter?

167
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,512
Peter?

168
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,664
Gunshot wound to
the posterior neck,

169
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,700
multiple facial abrasions,
scalp laceration.

170
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,001
BP's 90/60.

171
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,071
Pulse 92, resps 24.

172
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,274
Cap refill's poor.

173
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,675
All right, let's tube him.

174
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,876
I'll do it.

175
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,980
ET Tray's on the counter. 7.0.

176
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,483
This is Jeanie Boulet, Peter.

177
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,085
Physician assistant.

178
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,336
It's her first day,

179
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,509
and I know we all want
to make her feel welcome.

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,392
No guarding or
rebound tenderness.

181
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,493
Normal bowel sounds.

182
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,711
Let's find radiology.

183
00:06:58,735 --> 00:06:59,945
What do we need for x-rays?

184
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:02,314
Cross-table and... Jeanie?

185
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,833
Cross-table C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

186
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,102
Get a gram of Ancef.

187
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,570
Good choice, Peter.

188
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,005
Everyone is so
on their toes today.

189
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,156
Film's back on Trujillo.

190
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,841
He's next door.

191
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,827
Except for Wendy.

192
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,331
Chest, stomach, back.

193
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,398
X-rays are in on Trujillo.

194
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:21,000
He's already gone up to the O.R.

195
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,069
This is Rico Figueroa.

196
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,470
If you could track
down his films,

197
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:25,494
we'd appreciate it.

198
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,257
Is he gonna live?

199
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,358
Yes.

200
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,999
Trying a little
rehabilitation there,

201
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,872
Chuny? Mark?

202
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,753
I gotta talk to you.

203
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,237
This is not the time or place.

204
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,839
Let's set up for a chest tube.

205
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,107
32 French.

206
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,708
Could you ask him to
squeeze my fingers?

207
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,794
Mark...

208
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,402
I said no, Doug. Get
the hell out of here.

209
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,367
Okay, Carter,

210
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,270
sixth intercostal space
at mid-axillary line,

211
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,388
then puncture the pleura.

212
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,606
We got a cop hurt,

213
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,207
pulling up to the
back door. How bad?

214
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,359
His hand.

215
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,483
Carol, why don't
you check it out?

216
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,667
Her son's up in the O.R.

217
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,768
She's been
hysterical all morning.

218
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,170
Okay, well, why
don't you put her

219
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,271
in the surgery waiting room?

220
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,006
And leave Randi
alone? She'll kill me.

221
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,274
Jerry!

222
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,408
Okay, okay.

223
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,378
Mrs. Valdez, Mrs. Valdez.

224
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,613
Is it calming down a bit?

225
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,813
Sort of.

226
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,249
Have you seen Mr. Zimble?

227
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,483
Who?

228
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,084
Mr. Zimble. Bald
guy, a lot of papers.

229
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,520
Oh, yeah, right.
He's in the cafeteria.

230
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:31,521
Have you seen Jerry?

231
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,588
He's upstairs.

232
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,656
I'm gonna kill him.

233
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,191
Whatever, but help
me with this first.

234
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,925
Grabarsky, what happened?

235
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,029
Dumb son of a bitch bit me.

236
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,897
Yeah, your stupid
dog bit me first.

237
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,732
That's what she's
supposed to do, idiot!

238
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,933
Now, where do you want him?

239
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,935
Nowhere near me.

240
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,936
You can piss off, <i>culera.</i>

241
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,138
What did you call me? Huh?

242
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,606
What did you call me?

243
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,696
What did you call me?

244
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,744
What did you call me?

245
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,498
Here, tough girl, hold the dog.

246
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:02,768
You. Now, lie down and shut up.

247
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,370
Grabarsky, I need
to look at your hand.

248
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:05,904
Hey! Hold on to Peggy for me.

249
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,640
I'd love to.

250
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:08,907
Page Bernstein for me, please.

251
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,676
Gee, I'd love to.

252
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,646
Al? Al, are you all right?

253
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,647
Yeah. Some moron bit me.

254
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:15,648
I'll take him.

255
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:16,649
Okay.

256
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:18,049
Okay, look out,
look out, look out.

257
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:19,451
Carter, you want to take him up?

258
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,420
Uh... I should probably
check in with Benton.

259
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,421
I'll do it.

260
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,890
Dr. Greene...

261
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:26,158
I need to talk to you.

262
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,793
Uh-huh. Uh, lounge
in 20 minutes?

263
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,595
So what's it look
like out there?

264
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,764
I think the worst is over.

265
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,432
Oh, never say the worst is over.

266
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:40,572
Oh, my God.

267
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:41,873
Mr. Zimble?

268
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,175
I went to get a doughnut

269
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,544
and the cashier was
picking him up off the floor.

270
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,446
Take him to Curtain
Area 3. I'll get Rico.

271
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,480
Mr. Zimble?

272
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,481
Passed out

273
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,683
right into his cream of wheat.

274
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:51,883
Who's Mr. Zimble?

275
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,051
My mobile notary.

276
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:54,119
What?

277
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,120
My escrow closes today.

278
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,722
I have to sign the papers by 5.

279
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:57,723
You bought a house?

280
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,325
Well, you know,
I got a great deal.

281
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,627
Mr. Zimble? Mr. Zimble?

282
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,828
I could never buy a house.

283
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,829
It's too scary.

284
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,298
It's not that bad.
You get over it.

285
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,466
Mr. Zimble?

286
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,067
I didn't know you'd
ever bought a house.

287
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,302
Oh, I haven't...

288
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,504
Oh, come on, Mark, shut
up and help save this guy.

289
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,673
Yes, thank you,
Carol. I think I will.

290
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,041
Mr. Zimble? There you go.

291
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,010
Come on. Hi.

292
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,312
Thank you.

293
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:22,481
Can I help with
anything in here?

294
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:23,482
We've managed so far.

295
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,483
Hey, Jeanie. How are you?

296
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:25,651
Fine, thanks.

297
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,053
Pulse ox falling. 82 on 50%.

298
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,187
Hang those two units.

299
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,588
I didn't realize you
were starting today.

300
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:30,606
Yeah, I finished.

301
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,607
BP?

302
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,191
91/50, pulse 112.

303
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,410
Must be great to be done
with all the classwork, huh?

304
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,695
Definitely.

305
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,896
You think you're
gonna miss rehab?

306
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,531
Carter! What the hell
are you yapping for?

307
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,733
I thought you wanted to help.

308
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:43,368
All right, then assess
the patient, all right?

309
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,453
Uh, penetrating trauma

310
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,088
to zone two of the neck,

311
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,290
can result

312
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,991
in tracheal compression...

313
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,443
secondary to hematoma formation

314
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:54,964
from subclavian or
internal carotid injury,

315
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,948
which is probably why
you're doing a bronchoscopy.

316
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,135
Anything else I can help with?

317
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,136
Yes, Mr. Carter.

318
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,737
We have used the
last blood gas kit.

319
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,738
It would be extremely helpful

320
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,362
if you would go and
make some more.

321
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:06,926
You mean...

322
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,243
actually go and make them up?

323
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,651
Syringe, label...

324
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,438
alcohol wipes,
little plastic bags.

325
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,175
Right.

326
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,663
Sorry. Sort of. Good morning.

327
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,197
Hi. What a day, huh?

328
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,366
Yeah.

329
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,167
Benton is in the foulest
mood I've ever seen,

330
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,403
which is saying quite a lot,

331
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,604
and Greene just yelled at Ross

332
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,005
right in the middle of a trauma

333
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,106
in front of everybody.

334
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,107
About what?

335
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,108
No clue.

336
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,109
Hey, you off tonight?

337
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,143
Yeah.

338
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,545
I've got two tickets
to Blues Traveler.

339
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,546
Good idea?

340
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,581
No, actually.

341
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,582
It would be great.

342
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,850
No, it won't.

343
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,752
I mean, I don't think...

344
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,820
I need to talk to you...

345
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,756
privately.

346
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,157
What?

347
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,761
Later.

348
00:11:58,785 --> 00:11:59,895
Wait.

349
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,063
Wait, wait, wait. What?

350
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,464
Harper, wait a
minute. What is it?

351
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,465
Nothing.

352
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,499
No, it's something.

353
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,170
Yeah? So tell me.

354
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,504
Come on. What's going on?

355
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,940
Just tell me.

356
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,375
Harper, just...

357
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,900
I slept with Doug Ross...

358
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,972
last night.

359
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:34,268
Carter, let's go!

360
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:47,493
Hey.

361
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,894
Hey, yo, senoritas,

362
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,731
could I get a little medical
attention here please?

363
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,850
Hello? Hello?

364
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,753
What is his problem?

365
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,043
Peggy had a little snack.

366
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,824
You gonna let me go?

367
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,327
Hey, yo, senoritas.

368
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,695
Give him to Benton.

369
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,896
He just went up to Surgery.

370
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,398
You know, this is
brutality and neglect.

371
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,000
I think he's young
enough for a pediatrician,

372
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,168
don't you?

373
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,902
Ross is doing a
consult with Bernstein.

374
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:14,937
Jeanie?

375
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,811
It's about time.

376
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,845
Thank you so much.

377
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,046
I hate to bleed to death

378
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,080
all over your pretty floor.

379
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,114
Going to add another scar

380
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,616
to your collection there, Jorge.

381
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,553
I have to clean these
bites with peroxide.

382
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,138
It's going to hurt.

383
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:33,906
Ah! Stop it!

384
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,157
Come on, you're a big boy.

385
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,181
Ah!

386
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:46,790
Oh, my ear.

387
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,342
Nice work.

388
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,643
Thanks.

389
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,435
Just don't tell
my parole officer.

390
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:02,635
So, Joseph,

391
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,036
what kind of
bicycle do you have?

392
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,904
A mountain bike,
except now it's trashed.

393
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,507
He's not getting another
one, that's for sure.

394
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,941
Just flipped out
from under you, huh?

395
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,143
I hit a curb.

396
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,910
He was unconscious
for four or five minutes.

397
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,179
Yeah, Dr. Ross told me.

398
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:14,547
Touch my finger.

399
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,681
Now touch your nose.

400
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:16,715
Again.

401
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:17,883
Good.

402
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,285
Well, he seems in
pretty good shape,

403
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:20,686
Mrs. O'Connor.

404
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,488
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

405
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:23,922
Dr. Ross?

406
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,558
I'll be right back.

407
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:26,559
The kid's fine.

408
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,760
No need to be admitted.

409
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,162
Five minutes ago, he
was still disoriented.

410
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,297
Well, he's alert
and oriented now.

411
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:32,898
Head CT's negative. He
could go squirrelly again.

412
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,900
He should have frequent
neuro checks for 24 hours.

413
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:36,969
His mother can wake him up.

414
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:38,971
Family situation
is questionable,

415
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:39,972
and Mr. O'Connor

416
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:41,374
just left them
his wife and child.

417
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:42,475
She's extremely distraught.

418
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,076
I don't know that
she would do it.

419
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,694
There is no medical
reason for this kid

420
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,279
to spend a full day in the ICU.

421
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:50,054
Send him home. End of consult.

422
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,353
Where's Randi?

423
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:55,821
She's on a break.

424
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,690
I bet it was assault
with a deadly weapon.

425
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:00,025
She's obviously good at it.

426
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:01,426
I bet she's good at murder too.

427
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,627
Murder?

428
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,029
They would never
have let her out,

429
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,030
would they?

430
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,431
My money is on grand theft auto.

431
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:07,967
Hmm?

432
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,034
Assault.

433
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,802
Theft.

434
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,637
Kidnapping.

435
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,839
Have you seen Dr. Benton?

436
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:16,208
Uh, he's with a patient in 2.

437
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,343
Oh, and Jerry,

438
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,510
with all the commotion today

439
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:19,611
you probably missed lunch.

440
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,546
You should just order
in a burger and fries

441
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,647
or something.

442
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,516
Eat here at the desk.

443
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,185
Jerry, 12-year-old
Joseph O'Connor

444
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,386
in, uh, uh... Curtain Area 2.

445
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,188
I want you to admit
him to Pedes ICU,

446
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,555
24-hour observation, please.

447
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,179
Sure.

448
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,828
The chest x-ray suggests

449
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,998
that you may have
an aortic aneurysm.

450
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,199
We need to do an arteriogram

451
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:41,433
to rule it out.

452
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:44,036
But I don't feel pain
in my chest anymore.

453
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,170
Well, that's because
you're medicated

454
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,538
but that could be deceiving.

455
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:49,008
How are you feeling, Mr. Lake?

456
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,109
Much better.

457
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,611
BP's 150/90. Heart rate's 96.

458
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:53,745
That's very good.

459
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,147
We'll keep you
on the Nipride drip

460
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,615
while we study your aortic arch.

461
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,250
What about the surgery
he's talking about?

462
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:00,068
This Dr. Vu...

463
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,637
Vucelich.

464
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,788
Do you know him?

465
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:04,606
No.

466
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,142
Dr. Lewis isn't on
the surgical team.

467
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,310
Dr. Vucelich

468
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,345
is an excellent
cardiovascular surgeon,

469
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,746
one of the best in the country.

470
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,747
He's doing very advanced work

471
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,632
on aortic aneurysms.

472
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:16,802
So he's the best one to help me?

473
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:17,987
Well, we're not even sure

474
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,588
that you're going
to need his help,

475
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,789
Mr. Lake.

476
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,874
Which is why I
called Dr. Vucelich.

477
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,710
For a second opinion.

478
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,645
Well, you'll be going to X-ray

479
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:27,813
in a few minutes

480
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:28,981
so it's premature

481
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,182
to discuss your condition

482
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,084
before we've seen
the films, okay?

483
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:33,119
Dr. Benton,

484
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:35,276
could I speak to
you for a minute?

485
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,041
Why are you stepping
in on my patient?

486
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,042
He's a medical case.

487
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,077
Could be surgical.

488
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,212
Ah, the chance to
cut is a chance to cure,

489
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,513
right?

490
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,681
We'll look at the arteriogram

491
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,016
and let Cardiology decide.

492
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,017
And Vucelich.

493
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,218
He's agreed to consult.

494
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,219
What are you doing?

495
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,286
Trying to use my patient

496
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,688
to get in on his research study?

497
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,989
He's doing clamp
and run surgeries

498
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,390
on aortic aneurysms.

499
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,458
Ah, so the big cheese

500
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,459
has you jumping through hoops

501
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,594
to find one, right?

502
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,862
I've never even met him.

503
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,496
Peter, Susan, is
there a problem?

504
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,833
No.

505
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,935
Good, then Peter,
if you don't mind,

506
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,536
I think I'm gonna
need a few stitches.

507
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,938
I'm on my way to Radiology.

508
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,339
I'll meet you in
the Suture Room.

509
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,798
Any time. It's just my ear.

510
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,142
How you doing?

511
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,143
I'm fine.

512
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,312
When you get a chance, uh...

513
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,315
I'm usually kind of
glad to avoid the, uh...

514
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,384
morning-after stuff.

515
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:40,952
Uh...

516
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,988
I'm sorry.

517
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:44,290
You don't need to apologize.

518
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,491
I was there too.

519
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,660
I know. If Mark hadn't,
you know, come in...

520
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,461
We would have already
had this kind of awkward,

521
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,896
kind of "Yikes,

522
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,199
what did we do?" conversation.

523
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:55,267
So, um...

524
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,203
I'll see you around, okay?

525
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:58,204
Okay.

526
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:00,161
Yeah. I'll see you around.

527
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,011
Maybe this job is too stressful.

528
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,345
Being a notary?

529
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,414
If it's causing
this heart attack.

530
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:11,233
You might have just fainted.

531
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,069
I don't know. This
business can be rough.

532
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,773
98% of my clients are
home buyers, like you.

533
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,809
So many papers to sign.

534
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,577
They never stop to read them.

535
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,596
I tell them to, but they don't.

536
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,116
It's so hard to watch.

537
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,551
They get nervous,
frightened, tense

538
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,753
thinking about the
mortgage every month

539
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:31,854
and the down payment

540
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:32,855
which just wiped out

541
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,124
their entire life savings.

542
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,926
Little beads of sweat break out,

543
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,128
their cheeks get flushed,

544
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,097
their fingers clammy.

545
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,700
My God, they know that at any
minute they could lose their job

546
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,552
or get disabled in some
horrifying industrial accident

547
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:48,103
and then within five years, bam.

548
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,105
There's that balloon payment,

549
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,339
and suddenly husbands and wives

550
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,473
are screaming at each other,

551
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,631
women are crying,
grown men throwing up.

552
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,415
Very stressful.

553
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,754
Could I have a glass of water?

554
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,230
You had Radiology

555
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,499
rush these up to
Dr. Vucelich, right?

556
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,500
Yeah.

557
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,336
Type III dissection

558
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,471
by the DeBakey classification.

559
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,939
Yeah, but, gosh,

560
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,241
that's only four
centimeters, right?

561
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,311
No signs of
pericardial tamponade.

562
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,646
The aortic valve is normal.

563
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,747
When you examined Mr. Lake,

564
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:32,848
did you appreciate

565
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,050
the murmur of
aortic insufficiency?

566
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,885
No.

567
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,186
Neither did I.

568
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,788
Looks like he doesn't
need surgery after all.

569
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,690
Oh, well. I'm sure Vucelich

570
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,692
won't mind coming
down anyway, will he?

571
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,861
I heard he's a pretty
easy-going guy.

572
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,218
It's still a good
time to meet him.

573
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,326
Don't forget your charts.

574
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,443
Dr. Vucelich, please.

575
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,346
Dr. Benton.

576
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:19,494
Hey. You want to talk?

577
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,696
I don't know, are you sure

578
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,098
this is the right
time and place?

579
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:23,332
Okay, fine. Forget it.

580
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,734
Mark, look, you
don't have to worry

581
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:25,935
about what you saw this morning.

582
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:26,936
You know what? I'm worried

583
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,137
about what I see every morning.

584
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,138
You fight with Kerry Weaver

585
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,172
over half your cases,

586
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,640
call in docs for
curbside consults,

587
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,641
fast-track patients.

588
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,843
What the hell are you doing?

589
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,044
The job. That's what I'm doing.

590
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,045
That's not what
Bernstein thinks.

591
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,312
Well, Bernstein
doesn't know squat

592
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,313
about working in the ER.

593
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,414
He knows about your cases.

594
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,415
Because you're telling him.

595
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,617
Oh, no. He reads the charts.

596
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,235
See, he's the
head of Pediatrics.

597
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,552
I didn't seduce her, Mark.

598
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,971
It doesn't matter
how it happened.

599
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,539
Harper's third year.
There are rules.

600
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:48,807
Stupid rule.

601
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,409
You know that. What
difference does it make?

602
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,210
You get caught breaking
them, you're out of here.

603
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,430
I get caught not reporting
them, I'm out of here.

604
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,480
Fine. You know what?

605
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,548
Report me. I don't care.

606
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:57,549
You don't care about anyone,

607
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:58,550
do you?

608
00:20:58,574 --> 00:20:59,751
I didn't do this alone, Mark.

609
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,919
She's 21 years old.

610
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:03,522
What about Carter?
You care about him?

611
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:05,124
He and Harper are going out,

612
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,392
or didn't you know?

613
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,792
It's got nothing
to do with Carter.

614
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,694
No, it's all about
you, isn't it?

615
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,438
It's always all about you.

616
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,691
Thanks for dropping by, Peter.

617
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,893
I was going to go ahead
and have Jeanie do it,

618
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:25,928
but seeing as you're here,

619
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,552
why don't you just
talk her through it?

620
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,268
Do a local block of the auricle

621
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,270
by depositing a line
of one percent xylocain

622
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,804
in the sulcus behind the auricle

623
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,206
from the inferior
to the superior pole,

624
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,440
knocking out the
greater auricular

625
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,741
and lesser occipital nerve,

626
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,177
irrigate with normal saline,

627
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,345
close with interrupted
6-0 nylon suture,

628
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,081
dress with antibiotic ointment,

629
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,650
wound check, two days,

630
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,017
suture removal, four days

631
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,254
update the tetanus.

632
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:55,090
He's nothing if not thorough.

633
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,909
Gotta drop these
off at Radiology.

634
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,144
Okay. Great. Thanks.

635
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,145
Breaking and entering.

636
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,346
Give her more credit than that.

637
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,547
I think she took a hammer,

638
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,548
bashed in the windshield

639
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,549
of her boyfriend's car,

640
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,951
found a knife,
and carved him up.

641
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,352
Do we have to be that specific?

642
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,954
Hey, Carol, you
want to make a guess

643
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:10,355
as to why Randi was in jail?

644
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:11,523
Jerry, do you really think

645
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,125
you should be mocking
what must have been

646
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:14,126
a demoralizing, dehumanizing,

647
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,828
debilitating experience?

648
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:17,029
Excuse me.

649
00:22:17,053 --> 00:22:18,864
Can someone direct
me to a Dr. Benton?

650
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:20,833
Yeah. Who are you?

651
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:22,635
I'm Carl Vucelich,

652
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:23,836
and I was supposed to consult

653
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,270
on a patient of his,

654
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:26,605
Harmon Lake.

655
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:27,973
Dr. Vucelich, I'm Susan Lewis,

656
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,642
and Harmon Lake
is actually my patient.

657
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,209
Excellent, Dr. Lewis.

658
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,145
Well, then, perhaps
you'll let me show you

659
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:34,735
what's on this film.

660
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:41,453
So...

661
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:42,821
well, you can see right here

662
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,523
that the aneurysm is
clearly four centimeters.

663
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:45,724
Which is borderline.

664
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:46,725
It should be treated medically.

665
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,226
Dr. Vucelich?

666
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,695
You're Benton?

667
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,697
Yes. I don't think we
had a chance to meet.

668
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:52,798
Why the hell did you

669
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:55,400
cancel my consult
on Harmon Lake?

670
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,636
Well, Dr. Lewis and I

671
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,171
took a look at the arteriogram.

672
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:01,707
And it showed the aneurysm
to be at four centimeters...

673
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:03,042
Yes?

674
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,077
Which is within the limits
when you manage medically.

675
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:06,494
I didn't want to
waste your time.

676
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,714
Third year resident?

677
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:09,881
Yes.

678
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,300
I think you'd better
push those limits

679
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:12,884
if you want to remain
invested in surgery.

680
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,386
Dr. Vucelich,

681
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,870
I'm still responsible

682
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,972
for Mr. Lake,

683
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,207
and I feel he should
be admitted to ICU

684
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,143
and started on oral
antihypertensives.

685
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,677
I talked to Mr. Lake,

686
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,013
and he agreed that surgery
was the better option,

687
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,299
which relieves you

688
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,835
of your responsibility.

689
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,737
Benton,

690
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:32,954
you're coming up.

691
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,258
It's time you learned something.

692
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,594
Should I come?

693
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,663
John Carter.

694
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,431
Fourth year Surgical sub-I.

695
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,432
He's my student.

696
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,401
Sure. Why not?

697
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,702
I like a crowd.

698
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:49,121
Well, here a croup,
there a croup.

699
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:50,989
Ross? You got it.

700
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:51,990
Let's get her started Ross!

701
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,025
On a vaponephrine nebulizer.

702
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,626
What the hell do
you think you're doing

703
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,694
admitting Joseph O'Connor

704
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:57,696
when I asked you not to?

705
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,098
I feel he needed observation.

706
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:00,298
I don't care what you feel.

707
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,299
He's not at risk

708
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:02,534
for intracranial hemorrhage.

709
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:03,668
Well, we'll know for sure

710
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,703
in 24 hours, won't we?

711
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:05,838
I sent them home.

712
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,439
You don't have
the right to do that!

713
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:09,674
I have every right! I am
the Chief of Pediatrics.

714
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,976
This is my patient,

715
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,028
and I will take responsibility
for him, Bernstein.

716
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,046
No, you won't,

717
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,380
and I will no longer

718
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:16,882
take responsibility for you.

719
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,751
You harass my clinic,
you harass my residents,

720
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,736
you deliberately defy my orders.

721
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,990
Now, your pediatric fellowship
is up as of December 31st.

722
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:28,944
Well, let this serve as notice
you will not be renewed.

723
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,951
You're out of here.

724
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,841
How long since we clamped him?

725
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,810
59 minutes.

726
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,045
I better hurry up here, boys.

727
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,112
Under an hour

728
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,313
and I've got a new record.

729
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:50,414
Now, Dr. Benton,

730
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:52,016
do you know why
we're in a hurry?

731
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,952
Prolonged lack of blood
supply to the spinal cord

732
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:55,419
can lead to paraplegia.

733
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:56,988
Is that where the
Lazerol comes in?

734
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:58,255
Mr. Carter,

735
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,824
you've been reading
my research study, huh?

736
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:02,760
On the 21-aminosteroids, yes.

737
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:03,962
Then you can tell Dr. Benton

738
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:05,263
all about it.

739
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,699
I, uh...

740
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:10,802
I'm sure Dr. Benton
already knows all about it.

741
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,453
Well, we could
always hear it again.

742
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,488
Repetition. Big
part of learning.

743
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,224
Release the distal Statinsky

744
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,458
and backfill the graft.

745
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,676
Mr. Carter?

746
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,913
Uh, Lazerol helps prevent
transverse myelopathy

747
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,515
from lack of oxygen
to the spinal cord,

748
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:25,616
as well as preventing edema

749
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,353
of the neuro tissue post-op.

750
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:29,620
Assuming the drug is effective.

751
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,539
Hopefully, that's
what my study will do,

752
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,041
isn't it?

753
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,543
We have perfusion.

754
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,378
Time?

755
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,681
Uh, 60 minutes, 28 seconds.

756
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,815
Damn.

757
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,883
How do you think

758
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,284
they come up with
these drug names?

759
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,485
Some guy walking
around New Jersey

760
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,722
going, "Prolixin,
Zoloft, Lazerol."

761
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,557
Come on. I came
up with that last one.

762
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,826
And a darn fine one it is, Carl.

763
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,166
Thank you.

764
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,027
Well, well, well.

765
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,169
Okay,

766
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,437
these two go up to Cardiology

767
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,973
and this one to Ortho.

768
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,074
No problem. Thank you.

769
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,208
Miss Hathaway?

770
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,209
Mr. Zimble.

771
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,210
How are you?

772
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,211
Miss Hathaway,

773
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,613
you should not
put this off forever.

774
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,647
I might have to leave.

775
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,848
I haven't been putting it off.

776
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,949
We've been pretty busy.

777
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,484
Perhaps you don't
really want this house.

778
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,942
Of course I want this house.

779
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,190
Oh, dear. You need some help?

780
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,275
Too late.

781
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,710
Here, let me get that.

782
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,680
Stay put, Junior.
I'll be right back.

783
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:30,954
Oh, God.

784
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,351
Me too.

785
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,342
I'll be right back.

786
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,491
I bet you're missing
rehab just about now.

787
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,693
Been missing it since
the first minute I got here.

788
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:42,894
There's extra
scrubs in the lounge.

789
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:43,995
It's okay.

790
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,163
I still got some stuff
in my locker upstairs.

791
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,899
Hey, Doug, you okay?

792
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:48,900
Yeah, I'm fine.

793
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:49,901
You want to talk?

794
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:50,902
Well, I'd love to,

795
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,704
but I got sniffles
and a cough in 7

796
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:54,739
and I got bed-wetting in 6.

797
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:55,874
You got a second?

798
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:58,799
Sorry. I'm on a break.

799
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:03,080
Can we at least talk about this?

800
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:04,181
Uh... yeah, okay, sure,

801
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,133
if you, uh... if you need to.

802
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,641
I'm sorry, John.

803
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:11,355
It was an exceptionally bad day,

804
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,840
and it just happened,

805
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,442
but it's not something
that's gonna happen again.

806
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,177
You don't owe me an explanation.

807
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:20,348
We've only been out a few
times. Never even kissed.

808
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,816
Once.

809
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,185
You know, you didn't
even have to tell me.

810
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,721
It's not that big of a deal.

811
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,690
John...

812
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,914
John, wait.

813
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:41,885
Do you remember

814
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:44,388
that little boy with
AIDS yesterday?

815
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,308
He was so small and helpless,

816
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,746
but I held him down,
listening to him cry,

817
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,048
squeezing out every
last ounce of life

818
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,834
he might have had.

819
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:59,553
It was the worst day of my life.

820
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,278
I didn't know where
to go with that.

821
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,920
Where I ended up...

822
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,937
Where I needed to be...

823
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,629
was with somebody who'd
been through that with me.

824
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,234
I hope you can understand that.

825
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,007
Picked her up at
the Delaney Mall.

826
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:37,008
Witnessed grand mal seizure

827
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,025
lasting about two minutes.

828
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,193
Any ID?

829
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,962
No, and couldn't
find anyone with her.

830
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,880
Normal saline IV TKO,

831
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:44,165
two of Narcan,

832
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,800
and an amp of glucose on board.

833
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,784
Move her on a count.

834
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,954
One, two, three.

835
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,822
Vitals are stable, BP 100/70,

836
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:52,824
pulse 110,

837
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:53,908
resps 18.

838
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,543
On our arrival she
was comatose, GCS 5.

839
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,061
I'm out of here. Carpe diem.

840
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,079
See you, Doris.

841
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,280
Let's get a CBC and Chem-7.

842
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,648
She has gingival hypertrophy.

843
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,832
Dilantin level?

844
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:03,567
Yeah. She's probably epileptic.

845
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:04,735
Babinski's downgoing.

846
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,970
Pupils equal, round, reactive,

847
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,905
corneal reflex normal.

848
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:10,308
DTR's one plus
equal bilaterally.

849
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,376
Small occipital contusion.

850
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,377
You want a CT?

851
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,812
No. Let's see how she responds.

852
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,780
Cross-table C-spine.

853
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,115
We should check with the police,

854
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:19,717
see if they've come up
with any identification.

855
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,885
I'll call

856
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,486
Child and Family
Services too, just in case.

857
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,288
Lydia, why don't you
clear out Curtain Area 2?

858
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,290
Put her in there.

859
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:27,713
Busy day.

860
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,914
Yeah, hi.

861
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,503
Peter. Peter!

862
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,218
I want you to know

863
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,820
that I didn't try to
come to County.

864
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,221
I applied to practically
every other hospital

865
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,222
in the county.

866
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,423
This is the only ER rotation

867
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,424
that was open.

868
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,126
Okay. Fine.

869
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,229
Peter, stop.

870
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,630
Are you going to be like this

871
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,865
the whole time I'm here?

872
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,273
Can we at least pretend
to be civil, professional?

873
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:59,991
Okay. Fine.

874
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:01,975
I've got some post-op
notes to check on.

875
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,299
You're cutting him
off, just like that?

876
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:09,300
It's hardly "just like that."

877
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:10,568
Neal's right, Mark.

878
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:11,969
We've been dealing
with this Ross situation

879
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,103
since last summer.

880
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,705
He's a little bit more
than a "situation."

881
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,973
Of course he... Not to me.

882
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:17,091
Neal...

883
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,543
Ross runs roughshod
all over that ER.

884
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,313
He takes over the
care of an outpatient,

885
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:24,098
never even shows
up to the Pedes Clinic

886
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,766
where I can at
least supervise him.

887
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,117
He's assigned to the ER, Neal.

888
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,919
Where, obviously, no
one is supervising him.

889
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:30,071
That's not true.

890
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,672
Pediatrics is not
going to pay for him

891
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,474
so much as one
day into the new year.

892
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,277
You guys deal with his behavior.

893
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,102
He's off my service.

894
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,123
He's a good doctor.

895
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,491
But he's a loose cannon.

896
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,676
I'm not sure I could handle
him any better than Neal.

897
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,711
He's a good doctor.

898
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:55,313
Look, I know this
is personal for you.

899
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,514
I know you two are friends.

900
00:30:56,538 --> 00:30:57,582
I'll supervise him.

901
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,750
His fellowship runs
through December.

902
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,952
Gives him over a
month to find another job.

903
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:02,537
We need him in the ER.

904
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,539
We need a lot of
things in the ER, Mark,

905
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,540
but be realistic.

906
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,444
Have you looked at your budget?

907
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,133
I'm due in surgery.

908
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,294
Got M and M in 10 minutes.

909
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,296
This won't take that long.

910
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,298
Um...

911
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,634
what you saw this morning

912
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,268
was private.

913
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,870
No one should have seen it.

914
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,572
Believe me, I wish I hadn't.

915
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,240
But you did,

916
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,645
and I'm concerned
with what that means.

917
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,279
I know this is the '90s

918
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,515
and there are rules
in medicine now.

919
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,434
They exist to protect
a medical student

920
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,968
from feeling they have to comply

921
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,103
with the suggestions

922
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,338
of one of their supervisors.

923
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,606
This wasn't a suggestion.

924
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,176
It was a choice, as
much mine as his,

925
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,610
but I don't want
my career defined

926
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,379
by having gone to
bed with someone,

927
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:03,281
especially since
no one will care

928
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,949
about the reason.

929
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,651
You don't care about
the reason, do you?

930
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,054
No, I don't,

931
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:10,055
but my job demands

932
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,390
that I care about
the ramifications.

933
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,758
If this were to get out,

934
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:16,261
it would more than
likely be misinterpreted,

935
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:19,079
affect my recommendations,
possibly even my internship,

936
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,449
so I have no intention
of discussing this,

937
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,718
either now or in the future,

938
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,459
and I hope no one
else will, either.

939
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,969
Jerry, will you
scream at Radiology?

940
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,371
I've got to get
those films on...

941
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,406
Robert Potter Bradley,

942
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,840
10 years old, broken finger.

943
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:49,644
Thank you, Jerry.

944
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,179
There, there. You're okay.

945
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,147
Honey, just settle
back down. You're okay.

946
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,148
We're right here with you.

947
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,216
What happened?

948
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,553
She woke up
agitated, disoriented,

949
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,954
trying to boot the
side rails and...

950
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,756
doesn't seem to
like the IVs too much.

951
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,957
Can't say as I blame her.

952
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,360
Can't say as I do, either.

953
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,045
Who'd have thought we'd
ever agree on something?

954
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,613
Her labs just came back.

955
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,214
That's right, you're okay.

956
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,782
Just settle down.

957
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:12,867
Just settle down.

958
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,569
We're gonna take care of you.

959
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,287
We're gonna take
care of you, honey.

960
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:17,639
We're gonna take care of you.

961
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,973
You're all right. Shh.

962
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,075
CBC and lytes are normal,

963
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,792
but her Dilantin
level's only five.

964
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:23,895
Sub-therapeutic.

965
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,029
An epileptic seizure

966
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:26,914
caused by her not
taking her medication.

967
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,299
All right, Chuny,
let's give her Dilantin,

968
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:30,801
seven mgs per kilogram
at 50 mgs a minute IV.

969
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,320
Coming up. Okay.

970
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,155
That's it. That's it.

971
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,091
You're okay.

972
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,826
You could have
gone into Pediatrics.

973
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,051
Thank you.

974
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,748
I don't want a nurse.

975
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:44,782
I'm not a nurse.

976
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:46,017
I want a doctor.

977
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,451
I work with doctors.
Now, move along.

978
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:48,886
You're a nurse?

979
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,187
I'm a physician's assistant.

980
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:51,723
Is that better than a nurse?

981
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,024
It's just different.

982
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:54,492
I don't want a nurse.

983
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:55,893
Mr. Stubey, I need
to examine you

984
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,161
and take your history.

985
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:58,162
Now, let's march. Come on.

986
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:00,598
♪ Onward, Christian soldiers ♪

987
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,433
Is everything okay?

988
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,036
Is he a doctor?

989
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,570
No, he's a nurse.

990
00:34:06,594 --> 00:34:08,439
Thanks, Malik. I got him.

991
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,341
♪ Onward, Christian soldiers ♪

992
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:12,076
♪ Marching as to war ♪

993
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,778
♪ With the cross of Jesus ♪

994
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,415
♪ Going on before ♪

995
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,450
♪ Onward, Christian soldiers ♪

996
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,320
♪ Marching as to war ♪

997
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:23,554
This is Mr. Preston.

998
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:24,755
Gunshot wound to
the right shoulder.

999
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:25,890
Good distal pulses

1000
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,591
and sensation in the arm.

1001
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:28,793
BP 100/60, pulse 120,

1002
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,195
resps 24.

1003
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,512
And the wheelchair?

1004
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,780
Frank Davelle, nasty scalp lac.

1005
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,382
I thought this was a double MVA.

1006
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,918
Malik, take Mr. Davelle
down to the Suture Room.

1007
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,185
I think he can wait.

1008
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,476
Harper, get in here.

1009
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,644
Oh, damn...

1010
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:47,879
All right, on three.

1011
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:48,946
Here we go, people.

1012
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,771
One, two, three.

1013
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:54,719
How you doing
there, Mr. Preston?

1014
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:55,920
Hell, he shot me.

1015
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,922
I can't believe that
son of a bitch shot me.

1016
00:34:57,946 --> 00:34:59,140
Dr. Benton, shouldn't we order

1017
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:00,925
a CBC, type and cross
four units packed cells?

1018
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:02,142
Yes, Carter.

1019
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,978
Cross-table C-spine,
chest, shoulder x-rays?

1020
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,618
Yes, again.

1021
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,115
Does it hurt anywhere else?

1022
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,433
My neck.

1023
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:10,451
I'm gonna sue his ass.

1024
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,552
That's very American of you.

1025
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,954
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's that?

1026
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:13,938
Your armpit.

1027
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:14,955
Fresh dressing.

1028
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:15,940
Thanks, Harper.

1029
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:16,958
Can you feel this?

1030
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:17,959
Yeah.

1031
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:18,960
Squeeze my hand.

1032
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,161
Carter, why don't you and Harper

1033
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,162
go take care

1034
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,363
of the bad guy next door?

1035
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,265
I can handle that on my own.

1036
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,289
Whatever.

1037
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,687
Excuse me.

1038
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,272
Harper, I need your help.

1039
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,607
Will you help me log-roll him?

1040
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,364
Doug?

1041
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,265
Hey, Carol. What's going on?

1042
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,601
Nice try,

1043
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,425
but the film's upside-down.

1044
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,574
Are you okay?

1045
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:09,844
Well, generally, this
has not been a good day.

1046
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:15,350
Specifically, this has
not been a good day.

1047
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,417
Although I'll tell you,

1048
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,852
it felt so good
yelling at Bernstein,

1049
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:18,953
for about five minutes there

1050
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,755
I felt completely liberated.

1051
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,089
And now?

1052
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,058
And now,

1053
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,293
I've been here a few years.

1054
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,295
It's the longest
commitment I've ever made

1055
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,915
to anything or anybody.

1056
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,183
Um...

1057
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:35,586
so...

1058
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,872
it's time to move on.

1059
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,942
Carol, Shep's on the phone.

1060
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,546
Speaking of moving on...

1061
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,132
You call me if you
want to talk, okay?

1062
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:49,556
Okay.

1063
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,364
The pool is your
idea. You ask her.

1064
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,632
She'd kill me.

1065
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:05,833
I think Wendy should ask her.

1066
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:08,135
Yeah. Now, she'd
never kill Wendy.

1067
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,136
What?

1068
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,538
What is wrong with all of you?

1069
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,339
Can't put your mouth
where your money is, huh?

1070
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,542
Hey, Randi,

1071
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,399
what did you do time for?

1072
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:21,232
Malicious mischief,

1073
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:22,467
assault,

1074
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,635
battery,

1075
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,904
carrying a concealed weapon

1076
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:29,429
and aggravated mayhem.

1077
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:32,860
What?

1078
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,461
No, Shep, I'm telling you.

1079
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,397
No.

1080
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,733
Carol, some guy
just crashed in 3.

1081
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,768
Oh...

1082
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,069
Defib. Set up for intubation.

1083
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,587
Oh, my God!

1084
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:44,606
I was examining Mrs. Kerns

1085
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,341
when this guy went south.

1086
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,125
Oh, I can't believe it.
It's my mobile notary.

1087
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:49,126
Your what?

1088
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,127
Notary.

1089
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:51,178
She's buying a house.

1090
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,780
He could see I
was putting it off.

1091
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:53,982
Told me I shouldn't
wait forever.

1092
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:54,983
Oh, don't beat yourself up.

1093
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:55,984
I'm a big procrastinator myself.

1094
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,785
God, maybe he knew
he was going to die.

1095
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,988
He's not going to die. Give
him another amp of epi.

1096
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:05,243
God, we were so
close. Two pages left.

1097
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:07,662
I need a 10 cc syringe.

1098
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,297
Get the paddles ready. 200.

1099
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,898
Carol?

1100
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,065
Carol!

1101
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,889
These two.

1102
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,042
Charging. 200.

1103
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,427
I can't believe I just did that.

1104
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:24,451
Neither can I. Clear.

1105
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:28,621
It's a good thing I did.

1106
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,816
Carter...

1107
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,574
Carter, I've got to talk to you.

1108
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,779
Carter...

1109
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,079
Now, look, I didn't know
about you and Harper, all right?

1110
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,103
I'm sorry.

1111
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,196
Hey, hey, hey.

1112
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,902
Nobody meant...

1113
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,249
nobody meant to
hurt you, Carter.

1114
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,339
Nobody...

1115
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,187
It happened
because she was hurt.

1116
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:24,972
It was a mistake, Carter.

1117
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,292
It was a mistake.
You understand that?

1118
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:30,828
And if you were smart,
you little piece of...

1119
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:33,013
if you were smart

1120
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,149
you'll give her another chance

1121
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,951
and you'll listen to her.

1122
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,253
I have,

1123
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:42,156
and now I'm having
to listen to you?

1124
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,475
I'm really happy that you both

1125
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,994
have made your peace with this

1126
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,046
but I'm gonna need
a little more time,

1127
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,553
if that's okay with everybody.

1128
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:10,534
How's she doing?

1129
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:11,569
Pretty well.

1130
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:13,176
She's coming around.

1131
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:21,351
Are you deaf?

1132
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,531
Yeah.

1133
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,133
Chuny, let's get these
restraints off now,

1134
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,134
and call

1135
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,568
for a sign language interpreter.

1136
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,770
Do you know how to sign?

1137
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,305
Poorly.

1138
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,662
You're going to be okay.

1139
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,545
Yes.

1140
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:41,398
You had a seizure,
but you're fine...

1141
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:43,834
fine now.

1142
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,537
I want to call your family.

1143
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:47,576
What's your name?

1144
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,062
Hi, Janie.

1145
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,564
I'm...

1146
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:58,404
Kerry.

1147
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,709
Okay.

1148
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,858
If they're so itchy,

1149
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,859
why don't you just shave?

1150
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,860
What, are you kidding?

1151
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,861
The fire department

1152
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,062
finally let us grow this stuff.

1153
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:13,497
I can't give in yet.

1154
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:14,564
Okay,

1155
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:15,933
we're almost
there, so don't look.

1156
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:17,334
Well, I thought
the point of this

1157
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:18,735
was for me to see this thing.

1158
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,170
Okay, but don't
look. Don't look.

1159
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,171
Step up. I can't look.

1160
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:22,172
What? Step up.

1161
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,409
All right, we're almost there.

1162
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,244
Okay.

1163
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:30,469
Okay, now look.

1164
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:36,475
Isn't it incredible?

1165
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:39,489
Yes, it is.

1166
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:40,891
I mean, I know it needs work.

1167
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,126
Yes, it does.

1168
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,527
I thought I'd paint it.

1169
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:45,195
Maybe gray with a green trim,

1170
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,932
or yellow.

1171
00:41:47,956 --> 00:41:50,134
And I know there's no stairs,
because they're in the backyard,

1172
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:52,136
but I figure I can just
nail those back on,

1173
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,537
and also I can nail back on

1174
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,671
the shutters.

1175
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:56,273
You should see the
inside of this house.

1176
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:58,475
Whoa. Oops. Sorry.

1177
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:01,412
The bedroom is
the biggest bedroom

1178
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,013
I have ever had
in my whole life,

1179
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:04,631
which isn't saying
a lot, but still.

1180
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,500
What?

1181
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,502
You look very beautiful
when you're happy.

1182
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,171
I am. I'm happy.

1183
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,172
I'm happy.

1184
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,374
Come on, let's go. Wait.

1185
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:14,975
What? Listen, I don't
want you to worry

1186
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,743
that I'm rushing
into anything here,

1187
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,678
but this is your first house,

1188
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,414
and I think that someone

1189
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:21,949
should carry you
over the threshold.

1190
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:22,983
Okay, no.

1191
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,385
No, I knew that you would agree.

1192
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,585
No, you know what? Shep! Shep!

1193
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,987
Put me down! You're
gonna drop me.

1194
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:27,988
What are you talking about?

1195
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:28,989
I'm a fireman.

1196
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:29,990
Oh, come on.

1197
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,014
Shep, put me down.

1198
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,141
They must have
changed the schedule.

1199
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:50,532
I missed mine by five minutes.

1200
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,981
So you didn't say anything

1201
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,215
to Morgenstern?

1202
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,872
No, I didn't.

1203
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,355
Why are you doing this, Doug?

1204
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,856
You're a good doctor.

1205
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,593
Bernstein doesn't agree.

1206
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,663
I looked at that kid's chart.

1207
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,766
Joseph O'Connor.

1208
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,867
No signs

1209
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,569
of intracranial bleeding.

1210
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,770
You knew

1211
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,439
he didn't need to get admitted.

1212
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:19,806
You were pushing Bernstein

1213
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,763
the same way you've
been pushing me.

1214
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,703
Why are you doing this, Doug?

1215
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,874
I don't know.

1216
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,298
You'll miss your train.
