1
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:35,395
Mobilize with Kocher maneuver.

2
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:37,029
Divide at pylorus.

3
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:38,898
Transect stomach TA 90.

4
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:40,733
I.D. ligament of Trietz.

5
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:42,735
Come on.

6
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,599
My Billroth II's been canceled.

7
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,968
Good morning to you too, Peter.

8
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,436
Is there a problem?

9
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,104
I believe your patient
developed a fever.

10
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,605
No, no, no.

11
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,808
I mean, is there a problem
with me in this department?

12
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,209
Ever since I left
Dr. Vucelich's study,

13
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,610
I've been underutilized.

14
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,813
When you were
working with Dr. Vucelich,

15
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,114
he monopolized
most of your time.

16
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,350
Now you're back with
the teeming masses

17
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,351
and there's lag time

18
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,352
while a schedule plays catch-up

19
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,619
to your change of fortune.

20
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,378
I see.

21
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,197
What do we got?

22
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,198
30-year-old male

23
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:53,433
had a bad Valentine's Day.

24
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:54,868
Threw himself on the El tracks

25
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,770
in front of an oncoming train.

26
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:57,971
Did a good job on himself.

27
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,338
How are his vitals?

28
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,808
Sinus tach at 150, BP's 50 palp.

29
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,376
Bilateral hemothorax,

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,845
rigid belly, head trauma,

31
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,847
near amputation, right forearm

32
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,216
deformed fracture, left femur,

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,086
open fracture, lower
right extremities.

34
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,688
Okay, you put in
the other chest tube.

35
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:16,355
I'll do the DPL.

36
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,324
Oh, that's a deal. 36 French.

37
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,993
All right,

38
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,295
we need four units of
O-neg on the rapid infuser.

39
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,214
Pupils are unequal and sluggish.

40
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,249
We need a head CT
to rule out a bleed.

41
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,517
No time. Positive tap.

42
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,734
Do those burr holes blind.

43
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,903
No way. I need a CT first.

44
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,239
All right, let's shock him.

45
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,041
I wish I would
have thought of that.

46
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,209
200!

47
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,343
Clear!

48
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,029
Clear.

49
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,200
All right, we got a rhythm.

50
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,201
Sinus tach at 160.

51
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,535
Lidocaine 100 IV push.

52
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,572
Dopamine 400 and
500. Start it at 10.

53
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,873
All right, we got a pulse.

54
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,407
Okay. I'll take him.

55
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,992
You, stick with me.

56
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,011
You do the burr
holes up in the O.R.

57
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,012
If you don't, he's toast.

58
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,380
He's not stable.

59
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,416
Yeah, well, he's as
stable as he's going to get.

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,417
Let's move.

61
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,418
Uh, Peter?

62
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,219
We have some other
sick people down here

63
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,387
if you want them too.

64
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,588
Wow. What'd he
have for breakfast?

65
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,058
Something hard to digest.

66
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:12,706
Oh, Suz, did you forget?

67
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,041
I'm not on till 11.

68
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,276
We can sleep in.

69
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,811
Yeah...

70
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:19,245
Oh, you're soaked.

71
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,781
Yeah, okay.

72
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:23,617
Oh, boy.

73
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,985
Yeah.

74
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,087
Yes?

75
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:29,423
<i>Good morning, Ms. Lewis.</i>

76
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,224
<i>It's Ms. Pearline
with social services.</i>

77
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,126
Who?

78
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,478
<i>Ms. Pearline.</i>

79
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,679
<i>I'm here for your home visit,</i>

80
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,680
<i>for the adoption.</i>

81
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,248
What?

82
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,849
Well, I, uh...

83
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,434
I worked really late last night.

84
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,036
<i>Well, you could reschedule,</i>

85
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,238
<i>but it will take</i>

86
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:45,672
<i>another four to six weeks.</i>

87
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:48,175
Uh, no, no, no. Come on up.

88
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,526
Just come up slowly, please.

89
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,578
Good morning.

90
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,013
Actually, good night.

91
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:55,165
Hey, Dr. Ross.

92
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,416
Still got that extra ticket

93
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,101
to the Bulls-Spurs
game next week?

94
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,737
Well, Jerry, I do
have two tickets,

95
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,238
but they're not extra.

96
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,490
The ones your dad gave you?

97
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:04,558
Mm-hmm.

98
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:05,759
I thought you threw those out.

99
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,144
Well, I was going to,

100
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,812
but they're mid-court,
about 10 rows up.

101
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,347
Well, you guys heard

102
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,331
about all the excitement
here yesterday, right?

103
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:13,734
Scottie Pippen came
in. What excitement?

104
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:14,735
Here?

105
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,735
He did not.

106
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,504
Yeah, I... Actually, he did.

107
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:18,771
Brought in a kid

108
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,807
from his Cabrini
Greens tutoring program.

109
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,275
They'd had a basketball clinic.

110
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,377
Kid took a charge,
broke his collarbone.

111
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:25,545
Nice try, Jerry.

112
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,980
Lot of details.
Almost believable.

113
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,749
It's the truth. Look.

114
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,318
I got his autograph.

115
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:32,719
You know what that's worth?

116
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:35,054
It's I-N, not E-N.

117
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:36,723
No, it's E-N. It was him.

118
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:37,924
Who else was on?

119
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,492
The kid's mom showed up,

120
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:40,893
so Scottie split pretty quick.

121
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,128
So nobody else saw him?

122
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,830
I'm heading upstairs.

123
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:45,465
Can we watch?

124
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,066
My God.

125
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,535
Conni, haven't you
had that baby yet?

126
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,204
Oh, you won't have me
to make fun of after today.

127
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:53,573
Thought you were
working up to your due date.

128
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:54,908
I have, and then some.

129
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,577
Doc's gonna induce if
nothing happens by Monday.

130
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,595
I'm going up to OB
for a non-stress test.

131
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,998
I feel like a damn elephant.

132
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,799
An elephant's gestation period

133
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,001
is two years.

134
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,335
Oh, shut your mouth.

135
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,937
Okay, my interview
is not till 4:00.

136
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,338
Benton'll be done
with the Billroth

137
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,572
by 10:30.

138
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,773
I'll find him. I won't beg.

139
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,942
I'll be dignified.

140
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,143
I'm not getting a fair shot

141
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,477
at this internship,
I'll tell him,

142
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,379
unless he rewrites my
letter of recommendation.

143
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,114
90 applicants for six slots.

144
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,782
How did you even see it, anyway?

145
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,184
It was on his desk, and, oh...

146
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,585
"Has put forth a
consistent effort."

147
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,920
That's what he says about me.

148
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,921
"Has acquired solid...

149
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:25,922
"Technical skills".

150
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,923
I told you that part.

151
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,524
Several times.

152
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,727
You know, I know he and
I have had our differences,

153
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,528
but I've worked
my butt off for him.

154
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,930
Where the hell's our train?

155
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,999
John, how soon after intercourse

156
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,200
can you get a pregnancy result

157
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,201
by a blood test?

158
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,369
Seven days.

159
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,971
Did I tell you about
the other applicants?

160
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,438
Harvard, Yale,
Stanford, Hopkins.

161
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,440
I got the home court
advantage, but still... still...

162
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,676
Wait a sec. Did you
just say "pregnancy"?

163
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,378
You think you're pregnant?

164
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,046
How's that possible?

165
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,414
We've been really
careful. I know.

166
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,515
Did you miss your period?

167
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,784
No, not yet. I'm just obsessing.

168
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,952
You don't need this today.

169
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,453
I know. This whole
interview thing

170
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,155
is nerve-racking enough.

171
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,957
I'm sorry. Do you want
to draw some blood?

172
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,958
No, it can wait.

173
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,026
I'm just being paranoid.

174
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,917
You worry about your interview.

175
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,367
Okay, okay, we need some help.

176
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,069
What happened?

177
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,171
Hey, we need some help here.

178
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,472
Don't tell me your water broke.

179
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,474
Sprinkler system went
berserk on the fourth floor.

180
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,810
It's raining cats and dogs,
and we can't shut it off.

181
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,879
Need a hand here, quick.

182
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:23,980
Jerry.

183
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,081
Yep, yep.

184
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,482
The whole west
wing is getting soaked.

185
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,184
Labor and Delivery
and the Nursery?

186
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,685
NICU and Postpartum.

187
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,820
All high-risk women

188
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,256
are going up to the sixth floor.

189
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,290
Everyone else is down here.

190
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,291
How many?

191
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,794
Eight, I think,
all in active labor.

192
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,462
Oh, boy. All right. Chuny.

193
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,497
Okay, we're gonna
need some dry gowns,

194
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,498
some warming lamps.

195
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,566
Also, uh...

196
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,868
You've got to change.

197
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,870
Blow dryers, if you can
round any of them up.

198
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,871
This is a new one.

199
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,872
This really sucks.

200
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,873
Dr. Ross? Yeah.

201
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:50,874
This one's pretty ripe.

202
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,142
Is there any time

203
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,176
between your contractions?

204
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,177
No. None.

205
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,411
All right. Uh...

206
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,513
let's get a pelvic bed
set up in Trauma 1.

207
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,537
Somebody call Mark.

208
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,186
Coming through.

209
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,738
ICP's 14.

210
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:06,339
Final ligature.

211
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:08,208
Spleen's out. Suction.

212
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:11,211
So I guess if you're
looking to kill yourselves,

213
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,330
the El tracks'll do the job.

214
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,865
All right, we're dry.

215
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,534
Send it to Pathology.

216
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,168
What do you want to tackle next?

217
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,520
Let's run the small bowel

218
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:21,538
for perforations.

219
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,539
How's the arm look?

220
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,040
Bad as the rest of him.

221
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,241
Think you can save this guy?

222
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,676
We're chasing our tails here.

223
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,645
Damn.

224
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,713
He's hemorrhaging.

225
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,382
It looks arterial.

226
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,984
All right, let's open him up.

227
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,251
It's your party,

228
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,653
but this is a teaching
exercise now.

229
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,237
What do you mean,
teaching exercise?

230
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:39,773
There's not a life to save here.

231
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,491
You want to bet?

232
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:42,681
Sternal saw.

233
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,063
Run up to Labor and Delivery.

234
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,065
Take some galoshes and
an umbrella if you have to,

235
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,333
but find me an extra stash

236
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,335
of preemie and
term-sized ambu-bags,

237
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,569
and infant ET tubes.

238
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,071
Make sure we have
some bulb syringes.

239
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,639
You got it.

240
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,641
Christy, your baby's head
is engaged in the canal,

241
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,076
but the membrane
isn't ruptured yet,

242
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,678
so we're gonna have
to do an amniotomy

243
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,779
to rupture it.

244
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,164
What's the presentation?

245
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,932
Station two plus, fully
effaced and dilated.

246
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:08,001
I'll be right back. Yeah.

247
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,736
He went to buy film.

248
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,571
He won't even know where I am.

249
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,072
We'll find him. Just relax.

250
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,073
Taking an incubator.

251
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,575
Blankets.

252
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,943
Chuny, you were on yesterday.

253
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,644
Tell Dr. Ross Scottie
Pippen was in here.

254
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,712
Oh, yeah,

255
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,597
and so were Jordan and Rodman.

256
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,683
Jerry and Conni and I
beat them three on three.

257
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,284
It's a monsoon up there.

258
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,053
All our fetal
monitors are trashed.

259
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,454
How many do you have down here?

260
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:29,455
A few. We'll rotate.

261
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,857
Well, high risks went up to six,

262
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,258
which is where I have to be.

263
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,893
I'll just send down a
couple of residents.

264
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:34,894
We can handle it.

265
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:35,929
Who's attending?

266
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,530
Good. Push, push. That's it.

267
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,531
You know Mark Greene?

268
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,766
Oh, yes.

269
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,800
Membrane ruptured?

270
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:42,301
We had to do it for her.

271
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,569
Was the head engaged?

272
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:44,871
Yes.

273
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,873
All right. Don't want
a cord prolapse.

274
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,008
Okay.

275
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,208
Now, when you get the urge,

276
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,011
I want you to just
go ahead and push.

277
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,395
Okay?

278
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,629
Okay, good.

279
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,198
Ooh. Seeing a head here.

280
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,699
All right, here it comes.

281
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,084
Now take a deep
breath. Deep breath.

282
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:01,009
Push.

283
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,603
Patient in Exam 2 is ready.

284
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:20,590
I'm on my way.

285
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:24,160
Mrs. Wilson, you have
a beautiful baby boy.

286
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,495
Fundus is firm.

287
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,163
Placenta's coming.

288
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,766
Activity, two, pulse, two,

289
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,335
grimace, two.

290
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,153
One laceration.

291
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:35,989
Dr. Greene, will you suture?

292
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:38,491
I think I can handle that.

293
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:39,759
Apgar, nine.

294
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,161
I'll check again in five.

295
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:42,361
Use 2-0 chromic.

296
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,663
Interrupted suture

297
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:44,664
for the muscularis layer,

298
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:45,865
interlocking for the mucosa.

299
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,767
We can manage from here, Janet.

300
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,969
You got other fish to fry.

301
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,104
Just don't take any chances.

302
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,105
You run into any trouble,

303
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,657
run them straight to us.

304
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:54,958
Six East for all C-sections,

305
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,509
understood?

306
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,511
Uh-huh, and we're going
to need another bassinet.

307
00:11:58,535 --> 00:11:59,512
They'll be sending them down.

308
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:00,713
No, we need another one now.

309
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:02,465
She's having contractions again.

310
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,066
What?

311
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,234
Why?

312
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,369
I hope you're ready

313
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,520
for an encore, there, Christy,

314
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,072
because you're
having another one.

315
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,457
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

316
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,292
She came in just before
the sprinklers went.

317
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,693
Nobody had a
chance to monitor her.

318
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,312
I had an ultrasound months ago.

319
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,780
I got a hold of the head.

320
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,181
No, no, no. Make that the tush.

321
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,215
This is a breech?

322
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,466
I'll deliver.

323
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,500
No, no. I'm okay.

324
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:22,702
I got a good hold here.

325
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:23,903
What's wrong?

326
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,121
Well, it looks

327
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,356
like your second baby
wants to be different

328
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,159
so he's going to
come out butt-first.

329
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,426
Now, just push.

330
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,777
Get the feet out.

331
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,379
Okay, good. Good, Christy.

332
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,414
Good, good.

333
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:36,249
Push. Push. All right, good.

334
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:37,417
Push.

335
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:39,118
All right, that's good.

336
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,423
That's really good, Christy.
Keep going. Keep going. Push.

337
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:45,392
Good.

338
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,416
Okay.

339
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:53,850
Those are the shoulders.

340
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,185
Okay, now, just relax, okay?

341
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,420
Because I've got to get
a good grip on the head.

342
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,888
Flex the head.

343
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,278
All right, now, push gently.

344
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,360
Nice and slow.

345
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:05,595
Good, good, good.

346
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,046
Good. Excellent.

347
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,536
Nice, nice.

348
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:12,952
Nice work, Mom.

349
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:14,292
Oh, there.

350
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,107
Look at that.

351
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,175
Oh, my God.

352
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,209
Two of them?

353
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,244
Pretty smooth, Mark.

354
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,245
You'd think

355
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,047
you delivered a
breech every day.

356
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,814
Page me if you need me.

357
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,117
Okay.

358
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,952
Doug?

359
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,087
You can suction.

360
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,477
Mom, relax.

361
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,168
The place was a pigsty

362
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,802
and Susie has this
bruise over her eye

363
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,304
from pulling the highchair over.

364
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,106
The more I explained
it, the phonier it sounded.

365
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,107
I'm sure you were

366
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,142
the best adoption candidate

367
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,143
they've had all month.

368
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,810
I don't know.

369
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,312
They're sending this
guy over this week

370
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,313
for work-site interviews.

371
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,314
Please lie.

372
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,715
Can you take this girl in 3?

373
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,117
We prefer to be
called "women" now.

374
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,318
Yeah, well, you
judge for yourself.

375
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,719
With my last two,

376
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,756
I had Pitocin and an
epidural with no complications.

377
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,158
I'd love to pit you, hon, but...

378
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,526
With the shortage of monitors

379
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,760
we can't be sure

380
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:11,861
if your baby's having distress.

381
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,346
I'm in distress.

382
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,665
If I wanted a natural
childbirth I'd have stayed home.

383
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,833
What are they gonna
come up with next?

384
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,170
Natural dentistry?

385
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,722
Okay, Ms. Amayo...

386
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:24,791
Uh...

387
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:27,143
Tina.

388
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,410
How are you doing?

389
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,763
It hurts.

390
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,965
Okay, I'm going to put
these on you for a reading.

391
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,834
Did they tell you about
the monitor upstairs?

392
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:35,835
I don't know.

393
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,370
There was a lot of stuff.

394
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:38,371
Yeah.

395
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,939
Oh, good. A doctor's here.

396
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,107
Sorry, Tina.

397
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,175
They didn't have<i> X-Men.</i>

398
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,843
I'm Dr. Lewis.

399
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,444
I was just explaining
the monitor to Tina.

400
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,546
It's been a crazy day for her.

401
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,998
So your daughter's 13?

402
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,032
She's not our daughter.

403
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,034
We've only known Tina

404
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,585
for a few months.

405
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:53,953
We're adopting her baby.

406
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,154
She called us

407
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:56,989
when the contractions began.

408
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,341
Her mother was...

409
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,543
out.

410
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,061
Did you find my mama?

411
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,429
She's still not home.

412
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,198
I'll try again
in a little while.

413
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:06,199
And who examines that?

414
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:07,200
Your urine specimen?

415
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:08,201
Yeah.

416
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:09,668
We send that to the lab.

417
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,037
And you'll alert them
about my abduction?

418
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,339
Well, uh...

419
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:15,040
Not that I expect
them to have tests

420
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,041
to identify alien life.

421
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,127
No, probably not.

422
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,446
But if they do find
something unusual,

423
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,032
maybe the FBI or
NASA will listen to them.

424
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,901
They certainly

425
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,603
don't take phone
calls from the victims

426
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,420
of extraterrestrial
insemination.

427
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,907
You're pregnant by aliens?

428
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,092
It was so humiliating.

429
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,594
I bet.

430
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:36,996
Oh.

431
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,231
Here's one more to go...

432
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:39,999
Okay.

433
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:45,805
And this goes with it
for a pregnancy test.

434
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,606
You ready for another look?

435
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,209
Oh, could we do two
more laps, please?

436
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:52,212
I want to be at least
four centimeters this time.

437
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:53,629
She's very goal-oriented.

438
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,203
Walk on.

439
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:59,252
I hate men like that.

440
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:00,686
It gives you false hope.

441
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,771
It's safer to believe

442
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,795
that guys like that don't exist.

443
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,447
Oh, finally. Fresh recruits.

444
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,831
I thought this shift
would never end.

445
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:13,032
What's the EBL?

446
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,033
Five liters.

447
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,501
Carter, want to scrub in?

448
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,503
I would, but they
asked me to give a tour

449
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,588
to the visiting candidates

450
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:19,655
of the hospital.

451
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,690
Stiff competition.

452
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,691
Mm-hmm.

453
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,459
I had a couple of hours to kill

454
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,294
before my interview,
you know, at 4,

455
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,963
so I thought I'd come by.

456
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,464
Hey, I was hoping
that you managed

457
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,666
to get a final draft
of my letter of rec out.

458
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,867
One draft. Sent it last week.

459
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,603
Great. Great.

460
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,937
Great.

461
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,271
Thanks.

462
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,473
Nice work.

463
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,375
Peter, word's gotten around

464
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,577
this is where the
resurrection is.

465
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,845
I have some students

466
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,814
who want to watch
you raise the dead.

467
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,616
They'll have a good
view from there.

468
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,317
They'll benefit from learning

469
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,286
how and why you decided
to pursue this hopeless case.

470
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,589
"How and why"?

471
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,790
Hmm.

472
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,125
I saw this guy.

473
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,326
I knew I could fix him.

474
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,194
I went to work.

475
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:03,132
Pressure's 110/75.

476
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,500
Good call, Kerry.

477
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,668
She's abrupted.

478
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,902
Any time.

479
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,504
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

480
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,706
You know, he said he was
going to send some tickets.

481
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,008
Jerry, are you still telling

482
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,042
that Scottie Pippen story?

483
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,209
It's not a story.

484
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,277
Shh. Here she comes.

485
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,345
Hey, Conni.

486
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,647
Hey.

487
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,015
The beet soup, huh?

488
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,349
That's what they say.

489
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,483
I don't know. Crazy.

490
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,085
It's put a lot of
women in labor.

491
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,086
It was in the newspaper.

492
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,087
What has?

493
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,490
The beet soup
over at Doc Magoo's.

494
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,692
Induces labor.

495
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,693
Oh, come on.

496
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,761
Yeah, I read that.

497
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:32,912
It's not that far-fetched.

498
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:33,946
A lot of plants

499
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,016
have ergot alkaloid derivatives.

500
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,851
And what do those do?

501
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,904
Make the uterus contract.

502
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,088
Susan...

503
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,323
Yeah?

504
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,025
I've been monitoring
Leah Russell. Uh-huh.

505
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:47,460
A few things don't add up.

506
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,528
She hasn't been able

507
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:49,729
to give us a urine sample.

508
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:50,797
Her chart shows

509
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,465
she's had two previous births

510
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,033
but she told me she lives alone.

511
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,968
She's nervous, underweight...

512
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,102
You're thinking drugs?

513
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,304
I checked with a few hospitals,

514
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,305
and as a teen,

515
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,173
she gave birth to
two crack babies.

516
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:02,642
One she lost at six months.

517
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,376
One was taken away at birth.

518
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,301
Lead the way.

519
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:10,750
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

520
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:11,774
Hi, Dad.

521
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,555
I hate this part!

522
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:17,540
Try to save your breath, Monica.

523
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,075
If you don't get a vasectomy,

524
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,143
I swear

525
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,944
you're having the next one.

526
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,663
Oh! How big is this kid?

527
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,297
All right, all right.

528
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,482
Ease up on the pushing, okay?

529
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,185
There's the head...

530
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,620
Would you please shut up?

531
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,422
She has to go through
this herself soon.

532
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,593
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

533
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,761
That's it.

534
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,162
Look at that one.
She's a 10-pounder.

535
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,230
I take it back.

536
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,000
Hon, you scream all you want.

537
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,551
Suction?

538
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,453
Baby's lethargic. Apgar three.

539
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:49,739
Hold on. Hold on. Okay.

540
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:50,940
No, no, no. Okay. All right.

541
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,042
Let's bag her.

542
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,077
Is something wrong?

543
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:55,962
Ma'am, did you test positive

544
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,947
for diabetes during
your prenatal care?

545
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,249
What's... what's...
what's wrong?

546
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,139
Start CPR, right now.
I'm gonna intubate.

547
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:06,155
Prep an umbilical line,
and heel stick a glucose.

548
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,173
Please?

549
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:08,440
What is it?

550
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:10,276
This never happened
with my other kids.

551
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,295
You may have developed
gestational diabetes

552
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,964
during your pregnancy.

553
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,966
Bolus her with
two cc's per kilo.

554
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,967
Is she breathing?

555
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:18,968
Weak respiratory effort.

556
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,569
Give her a 10 cc infusion of D10

557
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,771
and stick her for
another glucose.

558
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:22,939
Why isn't she crying?

559
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,774
Your baby's been intubated.

560
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,609
Okay. Just try and lie back.

561
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,945
Try and lie back, Monica. Relax.

562
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,414
Jeanie tells me
you're having trouble

563
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,316
giving us a urine sample.

564
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,550
Yeah, I tried.

565
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,152
Well, I suggest you try again,

566
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,553
because if you can't
produce a sample,

567
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,555
we're going to have
to put a catheter in you

568
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,606
to get one.

569
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,824
Why do you even need it?

570
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,843
So we can do a tox screen.

571
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,261
You do those on white women too?

572
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,062
We do those on
everyone who has a history

573
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,598
of drug or alcohol abuse

574
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:49,799
so I suggest you cooperate.

575
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,300
Let me know the results.

576
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,367
You looked me up.

577
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,503
Shall we?

578
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,404
You had to tell her?

579
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,706
She's the doctor.

580
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,073
Well, I was just tripping,

581
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,909
because I was busted before.

582
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,844
I was a kid then,
but now I'm clean.

583
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,813
Let's find out.

584
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,484
Pulse ox 98.

585
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,853
Yeah. That's
what I want to hear.

586
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,287
Come here, you.

587
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,622
Look at that.

588
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,492
Oh, Dr. Greene, thank you.

589
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,493
Thank you.

590
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:18,961
Wait. I didn't get it.

591
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,195
Do that again.

592
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,263
Oh, thank you!

593
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,598
Dr. Ross?

594
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,583
Yeah? Get over here.

595
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:24,817
No, no, no, no.

596
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,252
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

597
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,620
Nurses too.

598
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,954
This is the doctor

599
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,740
that saved our little Renee.

600
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,226
I love you.

601
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,894
Here. Me too, Doc.

602
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,062
Okay.

603
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,396
I love you.

604
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,564
You know what?

605
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:39,732
I love that doctor too.

606
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:42,434
All right. I want a
copy of that one.

607
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,937
Okay, I'm going to take
little Renee up to NICU.

608
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:46,139
And have them check her out.

609
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,206
Congratulations.

610
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,607
I got it on tape.

611
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:49,964
Oh.

612
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,401
Pleased to meet you.

613
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,835
John Carter.
Pleased to meet you.

614
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,570
Ken Matsumitsu. You're from...

615
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,772
I'm the local guy. You're...

616
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,273
From Boston.

617
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,309
Ken's the Howard Hughes
Fellow at Harvard this year.

618
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,677
Oh. Congratulations.

619
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,245
John Carter.
Pleased to meet you.

620
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,580
Andrea Zucker. Stanford.

621
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,248
Ah, California.
Explains the tan.

622
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,750
No, actually,

623
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,436
I just got back from Senegal.
Did 10 months in a clinic there.

624
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,437
Oh.

625
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,455
This is Martin Fisher.

626
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,456
How are you?

627
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,591
Martin Fisher.

628
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,192
Published in<i> Nature</i> last month.

629
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,460
That's me.

630
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:25,527
Okay, guys.

631
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,229
We can all go home.

632
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,647
Did you read it?

633
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:30,649
He cloned tyrosine
kinase receptors.

634
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,217
Wow.

635
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:37,139
Well, shall we, with the tour?

636
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,444
Her back is killing her.

637
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,478
What can I do?

638
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,314
Tina, roll on your side.

639
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,682
When the contractions start,

640
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:47,666
press down on her back.

641
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,901
Give her some relief. Like this?

642
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:49,925
Yeah. Good, good.

643
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,744
Is she doing okay?

644
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:00,746
Yeah, thanks to the two of you.

645
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,516
I just hope she's not
depending on us too much.

646
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,683
What do you mean?

647
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:06,419
She needs a mother herself.

648
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:08,187
We can only adopt a baby.

649
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:11,841
We can't take her too.

650
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:13,976
Give me the bullet.

651
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,811
Allow me.

652
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,813
I'm Dr. Anna Castiglioni,
Internal Medicine,

653
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,014
in my 34th week.

654
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,816
I have a scheduled
induction for Monday.

655
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,251
My membrane
ruptured 40 minutes ago.

656
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,685
I'm fully dilated.

657
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,021
I'll take the express elevator
to Labor and Delivery.

658
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,522
I'm sorry, Dr. Castiglioni,

659
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,325
but L & D has
maintenance problems,

660
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,692
so we're taking all admits

661
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,727
in here today.

662
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,996
You have your hands full?

663
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,331
Yes,

664
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,932
but I think we can
handle one more.

665
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,234
All right, on my count.

666
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,357
One, two, three.

667
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:47,543
Sorry. I think you
left this behind.

668
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,711
Stage three
carcinoma of the breast.

669
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,714
I had a mastectomy
six years ago.

670
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,248
The cancer flared up again

671
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,517
last spring.

672
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,552
I was started on a
CMF chemo regimen

673
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,454
and slated for radiation when
I found out I was pregnant.

674
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,807
Are there any
implications for the fetus?

675
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,291
The ultrasounds look fine,

676
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,043
but methotrexate
is contraindicated

677
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,328
in the first trimester,

678
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,781
so I won't rest easy
till I see this baby.

679
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,534
Well, it shouldn't be long.

680
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,035
The angels were
watching over her.

681
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,236
If I'd had the radiation,

682
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,071
she would have
gotten a toxic dose.

683
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,641
You suspended
your own treatment?

684
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,859
For the first trimester.

685
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:23,428
I've been on a modified
regimen since then.

686
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:26,097
It wasn't a hard choice.

687
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,234
I've got a matter
of months left.

688
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:30,219
My baby has her
whole life ahead.

689
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,553
You're right, Doctor.

690
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,888
You are fully dilated.

691
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,556
All right, let's call Coburn.

692
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,558
Tell her we got
one on the way up.

693
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,927
Dr. Coburn? Oh, no.

694
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,396
Please. I have worked
too hard for this delivery

695
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,314
to have Janet Coburn
anywhere near it.

696
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,648
You're old friends, huh?

697
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:46,018
Still,

698
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,619
all the high risks
have to go up.

699
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:48,954
I'm not considered high risk.

700
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:51,756
Dr. Lopez was going to induce me

701
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,858
in the birthing center.

702
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:54,126
<i>Hello?</i>

703
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,560
Is Ferdie there?

704
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:56,795
I hope you're
calling your husband,

705
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:57,913
because this baby

706
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:58,914
is on her way.

707
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,348
My husband's already driving in.

708
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,251
<i>Hello?</i> Fernando.

709
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,971
You'll never guess where I am.

710
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,305
Let me hand you over

711
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,841
to Dr. Mark Greene.

712
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,042
It's my OB.

713
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,877
Break it to him gently.

714
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,868
He's going to be jealous.

715
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,983
Man, look at this.

716
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:21,604
Standing room only.

717
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,772
So you got Humpty Dumpty
back together again, huh?

718
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,240
Getting there.

719
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,242
Marathon surgery.

720
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,612
You run the 20K too?

721
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,046
Not since med school.

722
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,015
How's it look?

723
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,016
Massive crush injury.

724
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,450
We should amputate.

725
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,652
This guy's gonna live. He
might as well keep his arm.

726
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,454
It's longer than a long shot.

727
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,192
Look, it won't hurt to try.

728
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,210
Well, she'll thank you.

729
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,211
Patient's mom.

730
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,445
She works over in recovery.

731
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:48,229
Said to tell you, "God bless."

732
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,985
Okay, spectators.

733
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:54,186
No intermission.

734
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,154
We're going straight
into the next act.

735
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:57,489
Pulse ox 97.

736
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:59,124
I owe you an apology.

737
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:00,859
Your tox screen
came back negative.

738
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:02,511
I told you I kicked it.

739
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,046
People don't think you can,

740
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,314
but I did.

741
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,816
You must be a strong lady.

742
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,966
Not strong enough

743
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,167
to take much more of this.

744
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:10,418
Oh! There she is!

745
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,904
Ooh, ooh, my, my! No, Sonya.

746
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,338
Don't look at me. I'm a wreck.

747
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:14,807
Oh, looks like this baby's

748
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:16,025
giving you a real workout,

749
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,026
girlfriend.

750
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,027
That's for sure.

751
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:19,528
I brought you some candy.

752
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,864
We're pretty crowded.
We have to limit visitors.

753
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,166
But I'm her sister.
Birthing coach...

754
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,384
and sister.

755
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:27,685
Okay.

756
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,254
Just don't stay too long.

757
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,890
Oh! Look at you!

758
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:33,725
Jeanie, have you seen Harper?

759
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,060
Not recently.

760
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,963
She sent out blood tests
for the woman in Exam 2.

761
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:39,331
Ah. The alien abduction.

762
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:40,799
Yeah. This is so odd.

763
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:41,934
Oh! I want my mama!

764
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,969
We're here with you, Tina.

765
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:45,503
Blow. Blow. Go on.

766
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:46,771
It hurts.

767
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,773
Yes, that's because
your baby's coming.

768
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,841
Hurts...

769
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:51,843
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Next door.

770
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,211
Got it, got it. Blow, okay?

771
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,779
You're doing great, Doctor.

772
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,148
You're doing great.

773
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,483
There's meconium in the fluid.

774
00:25:58,507 --> 00:25:59,617
Amnioinfuse

775
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,852
500 cc's normal saline.

776
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:02,187
Look, you push,

777
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:03,243
I'll run the procedure.

778
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,776
Do exactly what she said.

779
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,127
Since then,

780
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,529
I've had the most
awful nosebleeds.

781
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:11,597
Harper. There you are.

782
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:12,831
Dr. Weaver.

783
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:13,965
Whatever possessed you

784
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,401
to run a pregnancy test

785
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,202
on this visibly
gestational woman?

786
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:18,304
I...

787
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,371
had a lapse.

788
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:20,773
I don't know what
I was thinking.

789
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:21,924
Until the hypnosis,

790
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,625
I thought I was absent-minded.

791
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,360
Maybe they've gotten to you too.

792
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:26,478
Maybe they beamed up

793
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,613
the entire lab,

794
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:28,881
because Ms. Clarke's
pregnancy test

795
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:30,099
came back negative.

796
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:31,233
Oh, yes.

797
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,735
I told you

798
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,002
this was no ordinary conception.

799
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,403
It's not.

800
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,406
It's pseudocyesis,
and a classic case of it.

801
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,409
Ms. Clarke's pelvic
exam confirms the labs.

802
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,578
She's not pregnant.

803
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,613
But look at her.

804
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,814
Distended abdomen

805
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,483
from hyperventilation
due to "contractions."

806
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,318
She's got a colon full of gas.

807
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,987
That's what they always say.

808
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,790
Those creatures blew
their interstellar filth

809
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:55,958
into all my cavities,

810
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,826
and it's hibernating there.

811
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,245
Yeah. Good choice.

812
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,047
The whole father-
in-waiting thing

813
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:03,615
has changed since
the Ricky Ricardo days.

814
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,718
It's nice to preserve
some traditions.

815
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:06,885
Excuse me. Just a sec.

816
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:09,154
I mean, I know how
you feel... Excuse me.

817
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:10,455
Hey, can't you see we're...

818
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,723
Hey. Jerry, right?

819
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:13,158
Uh-huh.

820
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:14,926
I just want to thank you again.

821
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,494
Oh, you're welcome.

822
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:20,565
Uh, can you stay here
for just one minute?

823
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:21,566
One minute.

824
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,223
One minute.

825
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,425
How is the fetal heart rate?

826
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,683
140, good variability.

827
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,232
I'm not progressing.

828
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,217
You can do it.

829
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,218
Dr. Ross...

830
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,170
I'm busy in here, Jerry.

831
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,171
He's here! Scottie Pippen!

832
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:43,472
Jerry.

833
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,942
Okay. Okay. I'll bring him here.

834
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,077
Where did he go?

835
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,111
Where did he go?

836
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,112
Who?

837
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,146
Scottie Pippen.

838
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,781
Is he kind of a tall guy?

839
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,283
Yeah. You could say that.

840
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:56,952
He said to tell
everyone, "Thanks."

841
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:59,110
Like they're gonna believe that.

842
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,725
I can't. I can't.

843
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:04,860
Yes, you can!

844
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,428
You are. Hold your breath.

845
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,529
Use it

846
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,596
to push the baby out.

847
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,597
I'm gonna die.

848
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,666
No. No, you're not.

849
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,300
You're doing beautifully.

850
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,468
Okay, Tina.

851
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,371
One more time, and
then you're there.

852
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:16,638
You said that before.

853
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,674
I know. You are doing
such a hard thing,

854
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,075
and you are doing a great job.

855
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,076
I've seen grown women

856
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,478
who can't hang
in there like that.

857
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:23,512
Really?

858
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,763
Really. I'm so proud of you.

859
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:25,764
Okay, come on.

860
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:26,765
Bear down. Bear down!

861
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,233
Bear down!

862
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:29,885
Come on, bear down!

863
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,353
It shouldn't be long now.

864
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,654
Did your friend leave?

865
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,756
Yeah.

866
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,156
Can I go to the bathroom?

867
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,947
Sure.

868
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,196
Let me help you.

869
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,620
I can do it.

870
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,827
What's wrong?

871
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,865
Get this damn
stuff away from me.

872
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,636
Your friend bring this?

873
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,017
Damn.

874
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,919
Am I ever gonna kick this stuff?

875
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,586
I've been clean for two months.

876
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,972
But you did use crack
during your pregnancy?

877
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:42,708
Yeah.

878
00:29:42,732 --> 00:29:45,143
I mean, not too much
after the beginning.

879
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:49,202
I have to let the doctors know.

880
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:54,936
Help my partner.

881
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,071
He was electrocuted.

882
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,239
Grab that gurney!

883
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,075
Come on!

884
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,177
Here. Lie him here.

885
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,912
He's soaking wet. What happened?

886
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:06,781
We were up in OB,
working in standing water.

887
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,782
A 220 line fell.

888
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,783
It must've been hot.

889
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,285
Yeah. Here's the entrance wound,

890
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,286
right palm.

891
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,288
Exit wound on the foot.

892
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,190
Let's try Trauma 2.

893
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,492
Need a room!

894
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,059
Yeah, we'll move next door.

895
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,060
In here.

896
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,396
Careful of the baby.
Can we crowd in?

897
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,397
15 liters O-2,

898
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,465
by mask.

899
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:27,169
Start him on an IV. Saline, TKO.

900
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,604
Pulse ox.

901
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:30,772
Get him on a cardiac monitor.

902
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,341
Got a good vein here.

903
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:34,409
Lidocaine 100 IV push.

904
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,410
What about you?

905
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,745
How are you doing, sir?

906
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:39,080
Oh, when I knocked
him away from the ladder,

907
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,815
I guess I got a little jolt.

908
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,883
Well, sit down here, sir.

909
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,373
We're going to take care of you.

910
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,933
Here you go.

911
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:00,151
She is perfect.

912
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,819
Look at that.

913
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:03,855
Picture of health.

914
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:07,225
Hello, beautiful.

915
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:08,882
Hello.

916
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,431
I didn't think it
would be so hard.

917
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:17,068
That's why they call it "labor."

918
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:19,204
I mean,

919
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:22,107
I didn't think it would
be so hard to see her

920
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,731
when I know...

921
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:32,517
I love you.

922
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:35,542
I will always love you.

923
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,468
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

924
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,366
The easiest birth
I've ever seen.

925
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,867
We don't usually
give extra credit

926
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:50,868
on the Apgar,

927
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:51,869
but when they come out

928
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,338
reciting Shakespeare...

929
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,440
Well, he takes after his mom.

930
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:56,874
Couldn't have
done it without you.

931
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,377
Yeah, we're still
trying to figure out

932
00:31:58,401 --> 00:31:59,628
how to clone your husband.

933
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:03,198
It could happen.

934
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:04,566
Little Thomas here

935
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,201
is a chemistry experiment.

936
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:07,936
In vitro fertilization.

937
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,404
A miracle baby.

938
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,839
Dr. Ross?

939
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,441
Hmm?

940
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:14,075
We set up a full OB on six.

941
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,076
We're going to start

942
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,494
transporting the
postpartum women

943
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,695
and their newborns.

944
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,397
We've got one more
close to delivery.

945
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:20,582
Okay,

946
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,800
so that's eight
mothers to transport,

947
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,603
and nine healthy newborns.

948
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:27,389
That's a nice ratio, Dr. Greene.

949
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:30,330
Moms did all the work.

950
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,431
Dr. Ross, this is Mr. Wilson.

951
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,599
His wife had the twins.

952
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,600
Oh, hey, hi.

953
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:39,668
Dispatch called.

954
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:40,869
I was on the Berkeley run.

955
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,070
It was snowed in out there.

956
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,206
Took them three hours
to get a relief driver,

957
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,107
almost three more
to get me back in.

958
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,776
Well, you want to see your kids?

959
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,843
I sure would.

960
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,367
Come on.

961
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:53,465
Here you go.

962
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:56,189
Boys, I'd like you
to meet your father.

963
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:12,951
I'm sorry I wasn't
here for you guys.

964
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:16,071
That's not how it's going to be.

965
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm going to always
be here for you

966
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,108
whenever you need me

967
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,878
and sometimes when
you think you don't.

968
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:26,314
I'm your dad

969
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,039
and that's my job.

970
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,927
To be there.

971
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:41,045
You're gonna be a great father.

972
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,647
They say

973
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:45,483
it's all about the
kind of start you get.

974
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:46,818
She's crowning, Dr. Ross.

975
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:47,885
The crack baby?

976
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:49,053
Mm-hmm.

977
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:51,956
Okay. Excuse me.

978
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,427
Push, push, push, push. Good.

979
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,829
Good. Yes.

980
00:33:57,853 --> 00:34:01,633
You have a little girl.

981
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:03,468
Is she okay?

982
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:04,703
She's beautiful.

983
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:05,971
Is she breathing?

984
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:07,427
Oh, yes, she is.

985
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,493
Apgar seven.

986
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,911
Head circumference

987
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,679
may be on the small side.

988
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:15,780
What does that mean?

989
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,998
It means, ma'am,

990
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,449
that your daughter,
for the moment,

991
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,684
seems fine,

992
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,886
but that you were doing crack

993
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,020
while you were pregnant,

994
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:23,522
which can cause
developmental problems.

995
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:25,423
Learning problems
we may not know about

996
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:26,524
for months, maybe even years.

997
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,126
I'm going to take
her up to NICU.

998
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,028
But you're bringing
her back, though, right?

999
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:33,448
You're giving her back to me?

1000
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:34,849
I'll get to have her?

1001
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,307
Yes, you probably will.

1002
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,825
So even though my family
was predisposed to law,

1003
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,059
I was the black sheep

1004
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,561
and decided to go into medicine.

1005
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:49,047
Shoot. Can I try again?

1006
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:50,632
The point, Mr. Carter,

1007
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:51,966
is to tie the knot

1008
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,067
without pulling the clip away

1009
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,352
from the magnet.

1010
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:55,687
I know.

1011
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,306
Mr. Carter, can you

1012
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,474
run through the steps
of an adrenalectomy?

1013
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,575
Uh...

1014
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,127
sure.

1015
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:05,314
Identify the mass by CT.

1016
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:06,704
Make a Kocher incision.

1017
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,567
I almost had it.

1018
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:11,353
What if that had been a patient

1019
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:12,554
and your inept technique

1020
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:16,407
caused uncontrolled
arterial hemorrhage?

1021
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:18,376
I, uh...

1022
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,544
I would repair the damage

1023
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:22,164
and...

1024
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,087
proceed.

1025
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:28,069
Good answer, Mr. Carter.

1026
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,405
It may not be
possible to tie that knot

1027
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,708
without dropping the magnet,

1028
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:34,876
but you didn't lose your cool,

1029
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,144
and that matters.

1030
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,929
That, and your academic records,

1031
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,164
your board scores,

1032
00:35:39,188 --> 00:35:40,849
and your letters of rec.

1033
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:41,883
Quite frankly, I...

1034
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:42,984
Carl Vucelich sent

1035
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,552
his standard glowing report...

1036
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,756
Still didn't fix the typo
in the second paragraph.

1037
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,075
But it's Dr. Benton's letter
that gives us the most...

1038
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:52,711
pause.

1039
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:56,130
I am at a loss to explain...

1040
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,116
You're one of the first
students to survive Dr. Benton.

1041
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,618
But to have him use words

1042
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:01,219
like "solid"

1043
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,787
in connection with
surgical technique...

1044
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:04,239
High praise from Benton.

1045
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,791
Not to mention "full knowledge

1046
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:08,893
of anatomy and
diagnostic tools."

1047
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,646
That's tantamount to gushing.

1048
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,332
Are you sure he wrote this?

1049
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:15,884
He did.

1050
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:18,587
Well, you're a most
impressive candidate,

1051
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,322
but we have many
impressive candidates.

1052
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,607
One last thing.

1053
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,731
Tell us why you
want to be a surgeon.

1054
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,937
It's not a trick question.

1055
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,647
Hmm. No. Um, hmm.

1056
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:44,379
I, uh...

1057
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:48,249
I see people with
injury or disease...

1058
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,942
and I know that
I can fix them...

1059
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,328
So that's what I want to do.

1060
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:03,214
Oh, excuse me, nurse.

1061
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:04,716
How soon before they move her?

1062
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,951
Oh, it shouldn't be too long.

1063
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,186
Oh, you probably
have time, Harris.

1064
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,187
I'm starving.

1065
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,404
I was just going to run

1066
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,606
to that diner across the street

1067
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,807
and get her something to eat.

1068
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,109
I loved that beet soup

1069
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,533
I had there last night.

1070
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,452
Do you know what that lady

1071
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,620
in Curtain 1 just said?

1072
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:26,721
What?

1073
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,856
I'm out of here.

1074
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,958
You're not going to join us?

1075
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,860
Nope. Sorry. I got
to see someone.

1076
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,578
Join who?

1077
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:36,147
Leslie! Leslie!

1078
00:37:38,107 --> 00:37:41,108
Oh!

1079
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:46,174
He's beautiful.

1080
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,343
You two finally
have your family.

1081
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,046
I am so sorry that I missed it.

1082
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,432
Thank you, Harris,
for everything.

1083
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:54,856
We're making you
two the godfathers.

1084
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:59,855
Too good to be true.

1085
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:02,324
Re-check his crit in 30 minutes.

1086
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,558
Don't forget,

1087
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,826
15 mgs per kilogram per minute.

1088
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,261
Page me stat

1089
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,218
if his systolic BP
drops under 100, huh?

1090
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:14,402
Carter, what are you doing here?

1091
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,338
Brought you dinner.

1092
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:19,229
Tofu, brown rice,
veggies on the side.

1093
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,500
Thanks.

1094
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,885
I know it's been hard lately.

1095
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:32,921
I just want to thank you

1096
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:34,956
for setting the bar high,

1097
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,224
and for everything.

1098
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:38,248
For being a good example.

1099
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,498
The interview went okay, huh?

1100
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:47,635
It's hard to say. I think so.

1101
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,359
Is that guy going to live?

1102
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:55,498
Yeah, I think so.

1103
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:02,050
It's just...

1104
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,219
now that I've seen her...

1105
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,804
she's so pretty.

1106
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:07,872
Yes, she is,

1107
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:09,391
but it's also a
huge responsibility.

1108
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:11,559
Not that much.

1109
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,562
I have a baby

1110
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:14,863
and it is an impossible job.

1111
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:16,565
You never think you're
doing well enough.

1112
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,071
My mom will help.

1113
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:22,120
I'd pay you guys back someday

1114
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:23,671
for the pre-natal stuff.

1115
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,323
We don't want the money, Tina.

1116
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:26,524
You shouldn't change your mind

1117
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:28,326
right now, where
everything's so emotional.

1118
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,111
Tina!

1119
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:34,215
My baby! Oh, look at this!

1120
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,150
We tried to find you, Mama.

1121
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,551
Oh, it's a boy or a girl?

1122
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,586
A girl.

1123
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,687
Oh, that's lucky!

1124
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,639
She's just like
you. Lots of hair.

1125
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:43,041
I think she knows me.

1126
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:46,094
She's got your eyes, huh?

1127
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,462
Oh, yes. Yes.

1128
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,297
Oh, yes,<i> pobrecita.</i>

1129
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:50,632
Yes.

1130
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,818
Oh, look at that.

1131
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:55,437
I want to keep her.

1132
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,472
Well, of course you do, baby.

1133
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,274
<i>Mira,</i> look at
that itty-bitty face.

1134
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:01,464
Yes,<i> mi pobrecita.</i>

1135
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,029
Excuse me.

1136
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,731
Is there another Hotel Dupree

1137
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,199
around this area?

1138
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,334
No. It's the only one.

1139
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,002
Problem? No, no.

1140
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,986
It's just not quite
the dive I expected.

1141
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,575
Uh, I'm here to see
a guest. Ray Ross.

1142
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,242
Oh, well, Mr. Ross
is in the bar...

1143
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,178
Why am I not surprised?

1144
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,646
But he isn't a guest.

1145
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,203
Mr. Ross owns this hotel.

1146
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:48,022
Hey.

1147
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,991
Doug.

1148
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,993
Oh, what a surprise.

1149
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,327
Yeah.

1150
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,362
You found me.

1151
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:55,697
You left your number, Ray.

1152
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:58,332
Oh, yeah.

1153
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,767
Come on, have a drink.

1154
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,869
Listen, Ray,

1155
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,726
I just wanted to give you these.

1156
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,543
You know, I was going
to play along, Ray,

1157
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,144
you know, like Mom
and I always did.

1158
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,913
You know, take your...

1159
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,447
your gifts

1160
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,617
that drop out of the blue,

1161
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,952
and I decided, uh, no, you know?

1162
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,389
I'm not going to let
you get away with it.

1163
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:24,526
Not this time. So...

1164
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,661
you're not my father.

1165
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:29,096
A father is someone
who was there

1166
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,264
and you never were.

1167
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,533
I know. I'm sorry.

1168
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:34,301
You and your mother
deserved better.

1169
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,037
Well, she did.

1170
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,239
No, you did too.

1171
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,974
Hey, Jimmy? Yeah?

1172
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,375
I'll have a bottle
of Maker's here.

1173
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,376
Right away.

1174
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,978
Look, I'm beat.

1175
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,147
I delivered eight
babies today, so...

1176
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,281
Oh, yeah, sure.

1177
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,449
Oh, yeah, I understand.

1178
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:52,186
Boy, the night you were born...

1179
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,790
I swore I was a changed man.

1180
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,091
Your mother must have told you

1181
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,093
how you came
into this world, huh?

1182
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,728
Well, it's a hell of a story.

1183
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:04,465
She must have told you
about the skates, huh?

1184
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,968
She didn't tell you
about the skates?

1185
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:08,970
We were up at the
cabin, and the lake was...

1186
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:09,971
The cabin?

1187
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,139
The one that the bank took back?

1188
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,507
Yeah, well, that was, uh...

1189
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,742
that was a mix-up.

1190
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,011
Anyway, you weren't
due for another two weeks

1191
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,012
and there your mother was.

1192
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,013
She went into labor...

1193
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,014
Right.

1194
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,649
And the lake was frozen over

1195
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:24,435
and the doctor was afraid

1196
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,604
to drive across
the ice, you know?

1197
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,105
So there's your mother, huh?

1198
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:32,844
Strapping on skates
between contractions.

1199
00:42:32,868 --> 00:42:34,512
I swear, I thought

1200
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:36,576
I was going to have
to deliver you myself.

1201
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,140
Where is everybody?

1202
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:48,143
You're the last
one to clock out.

1203
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:49,778
Well, it's my last
day for a while.

1204
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:51,535
Good luck.

1205
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:38,926
Excuse me.

1206
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,161
Do you have

1207
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:41,595
any beet soup tonight?

1208
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,147
Oh, you want the...

1209
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:45,166
beet soup?

1210
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,600
Surprise!

1211
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,936
Oh, they got you good!

1212
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,171
We did, didn't we?

1213
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:51,205
I hate you guys.

1214
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,539
I hate you.

1215
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,941
Congratulations. Any day now.

1216
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,142
We are so happy for you.

1217
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,510
And happy it's not us.

1218
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:57,912
Well put.

1219
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,347
Here you go.
Little Susie liked it.

1220
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:00,982
I hope you do.

1221
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,250
One order of beet soup

1222
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:04,352
and we can rush back
for Conni's delivery.

1223
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:09,712
I wish! I wish. Oh!

1224
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,227
That's a good shot.

1225
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,528
What, are you out of breath?

1226
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,397
No. No, no. Get out of there.

1227
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:18,565
Ah,

1228
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,167
you're getting slow
in your old age.

1229
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,352
Come on, give me a break.

1230
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:22,920
Give me a break.

1231
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:24,873
No, you can't spin it.

1232
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:26,074
All right, watch this one.

1233
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:27,925
You better guard...

1234
00:44:27,949 --> 00:44:29,582
Aah!

1235
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,482
Okay, rematch. Two out of three.

1236
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,401
What do you want to play for?

1237
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,303
Uh...

1238
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:41,122
tickets to the Bulls game.

1239
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:43,107
One for each of us, all right?

1240
00:44:43,131 --> 00:44:44,975
You're on.

1241
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,244
Let's go.

1242
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,179
Come on.

1243
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:50,598
All right.

1244
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:53,367
Okay, are you out of breath yet?

1245
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,636
You need to sit down?

1246
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,038
Ready?

1247
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,407
Men are up. Men are up.

1248
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:01,275
That's a score, champ.

1249
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,665
Ready?
