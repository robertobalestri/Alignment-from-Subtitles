1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,519
<i>I didn't want to give
up fighting for her.</i>

2
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,121
<i>I would've gone on forever.</i>

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,126
I mean, little Susie's
almost a year old.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,417
She's been with me forever.

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,451
Her birthday's next
week. Did I mention that?

6
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,718
She fell in love

7
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,354
with our neighbor's
little puppy, JoBo,

8
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,324
so I got her this
stuffed little animal...

9
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:35,950
Black and white, floppy ears.

10
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,803
Did I tell you the
daycare center called?

11
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:48,975
It seems I still have
an outstanding bill.

12
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,444
Gotta love that whole...

13
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,968
insult to injury thing.

14
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,975
I kind of hate
going up there, but...

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,661
it's Susie's birthday next
week. Did I mention that?

16
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,769
I've got to remember
to send her a present.

17
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,253
<i>Anyway, I suppose
things are okay.</i>

18
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,422
<i>I don't have to get
up twice a night,</i>

19
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,525
<i>so at least I'm getting
some more sleep.</i>

20
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,762
<i>Just going to work,</i>

21
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,865
<i>coming home,
sticking to a routine.</i>

22
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,990
<i>I guess life's getting
back to normal...</i>

23
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,872
<i>before the baby, that is.</i>

24
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,676
Ma'am?

25
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,076
Hello. Hi.

26
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,645
I'm Father Ruiz-Anchia.
Can I help you?

27
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,746
Uh, yeah.

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,347
That lady who
just sat down there,

29
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,750
She dropped this outside.

30
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,986
Last week, it was her keys.

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,788
Once, she even
stepped out of a shoe.

32
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,790
Didn't even realize it.

33
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,524
Thank you.

34
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,526
I'll give it to her. Okay.

35
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,765
It's beautiful, isn't it?

36
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,334
They're rehearsing for
a christening tomorrow.

37
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,503
"Salve Mater Misericordia."

38
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,107
based on the sequence
"Salve Mater Salvatoris"

39
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,375
by Adam of Saint Victor.

40
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,001
No one knows who
did the translation.

41
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,553
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

42
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,977
Hello?

43
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,080
Can I help you?

44
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,284
I don't know.

45
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,790
I don't know.

46
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,876
Turfed the chest
pain to Cardiology,

47
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,044
the chronic puker to Medicine.

48
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,380
I love these things.

49
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:16,516
My daughter, she left
them after her last visit.

50
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,819
Bipolar to Psych, and
say goodbye to Mr. Barry.

51
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,554
The one who called you
an incompetent poser?

52
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,222
That was only before
his horrifying rectal

53
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:24,891
revealed an even more horrifying

54
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,025
case of hemorrhoids.

55
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,361
Sent him to the Surgery clinic.

56
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:30,129
Carter's with that otitis media,

57
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,098
Ross isn't on yet,
and Lewis is late.

58
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:33,900
No. She worked an
extra four hours last night.

59
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,835
She's not due for another hour.

60
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,236
You just want her to be late.

61
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,371
Don't be ridiculous.

62
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:40,540
"A propensity for tardiness

63
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:41,541
"makes her a
problematic candidate

64
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:42,676
for Chief Resident"?

65
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,076
Mark, I can't
believe that you think

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,812
I'd keep tabs on anyone.

67
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,013
You're late, Jerry.

68
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,004
Time out. What do you see?

69
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:54,354
Well, come on. Al
and I are engaged.

70
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,522
Oh, yeah. It's gorgeous.

71
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,923
Congratulations.

72
00:04:56,947 --> 00:05:00,893
And the rest of the good news
is paramedics are on their way in.

73
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,997
Some failure-to-fly
suicide attempt. GCS-3.

74
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,049
If he's gorked, why are
they bringing him here?

75
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,051
Landed in the lake,
which is still a little chilly.

76
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,086
Got to warm him up before
they can pronounce him.

77
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,972
Can't be cold and dead.

78
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:14,841
I thought we were going
to do something fun today.

79
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,309
I'm having fun.

80
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,012
Yeah. Is this what you and
Dad used to do every morning?

81
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:20,513
If it makes you feel any better,

82
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,681
Dad couldn't keep
up if he were driving.

83
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,385
You know that you're the first
woman I've ever jogged for?

84
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,070
Doug, I'm so flattered.
Yeah, it's a fact.

85
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,872
Remind me to reward
you when we go back.

86
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,857
Let's go back.

87
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,792
Ow!

88
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,393
Wait, wait, wait.
Hang on. I got you.

89
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,562
My knee, my knee.

90
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,231
Hang on. Let me see this.

91
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,033
Damn. It goes out
on me all the time.

92
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,367
I'm a doctor, you know.

93
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:42,802
Yeah, a pediatrician.

94
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:44,103
Are you complaining?

95
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,339
Uh... not necessarily.

96
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,041
Here you go. Like this.

97
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:49,442
Is this helping at all?

98
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:52,445
Uh... uh-huh.

99
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,281
Yeah?

100
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:58,551
I really am sorry.

101
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,554
I'm not saying that she,
the individual in question,

102
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,057
isn't a possible candidate
for Chief Resident.

103
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,458
Just not a probable candidate.

104
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,526
I'm not saying that either.

105
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,793
30 years old,
traumatic full arrest,

106
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:08,961
been down 45 minutes.

107
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,563
Did a half-gainer
off of a 75-foot crane

108
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:11,564
right into the lake.

109
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:15,535
On my count. One, two, three.

110
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,903
Last epi? Four minutes.

111
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,921
I'm only saying that this
candidate for Chief Resident

112
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,708
has had some serious
personal difficulties of late.

113
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,692
Which have been
handled quite well,

114
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,827
considering all things.

115
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,212
Gave two of
atropine in the field.

116
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,747
Pupils fixed and dilated.

117
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,849
I could consider
supporting this individual

118
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,985
if there were more
supervision involved.

119
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,987
No BP, no pulse.

120
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,356
By the new ER Attending
Morgenstern wants to bring in?

121
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,640
It's a possibility.

122
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,841
Flatline.

123
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,242
And the candidates
for that job are..?

124
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,827
Gosh, I think it's
still pretty wide open.

125
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:42,828
Temp's normal.

126
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:43,946
He's warmed up. He's dead.

127
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,347
So whoever I support
for that position

128
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,100
will support my choice
for Chief Resident.

129
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:48,317
It's a possibility.

130
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,452
Mark, excuse me,

131
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,253
but whenever you two
are done talking in code

132
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,222
about Dr. Lewis
being Chief Resident

133
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,491
and Dr. Weaver
becoming an Attending,

134
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,676
can we call the time of
death? This guy is toast.

135
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,094
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Uh, time of death, 8:53.

136
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,697
Let me know when
the family get here.

137
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,753
And call the eye bank.

138
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,801
Ooh-eee, girl, that's pretty!

139
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,087
Finally popped
the question, huh?

140
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,789
Yep. He really wanted me
to have his mother's ring,

141
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:11,162
but she's still alive.

142
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:17,864
Oh, Susan. Hi.

143
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:19,165
Hi. Where is everyone?

144
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,532
Field trip to the park.

145
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:23,035
Spring at last, thank God.

146
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,104
Oh. Well, I have a bill to pay.

147
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,039
Well, listen, would you
mind stopping back?

148
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,943
They're holding the bus for me.

149
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:30,370
And of course, we get up there,

150
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:32,037
and no one's there
but an OB nurse,

151
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,973
and Chloe is screaming
for the Beatles.

152
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:35,375
"The White Album"!

153
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,478
Carter's fumbling,
can't find it anywhere.

154
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:39,712
Chloe doesn't want
to breathe, right,

155
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,414
but she thinks this
singing will help.

156
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,417
So there we are, like
a bunch of crazies...

157
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,987
♪ Blackbird singing
In the dead of night ♪

158
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,490
♪ Take these broken
wings And learn to fly ♪

159
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,024
♪ All your life... ♪

160
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,760
And there I am,
in between verses,

161
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:57,029
telling her, "Push,
Chloe. Push. Come on.

162
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:00,688
You can do it,
girl. You can do it."

163
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,672
And I cut the cord

164
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:11,511
and wrapped the little
warm baby all up and...

165
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:15,147
put it on her chest.

166
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,484
Oh, this brand-new life.

167
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,986
Chloe was crying.

168
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,656
I was crying.

169
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,358
She was so beautiful...

170
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,861
our baby girl.

171
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,397
I told her,

172
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:35,857
"You did it, Chloe.
You really did it."

173
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:41,173
You know what she said?

174
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:45,344
She said, "No, we did it.

175
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,735
We did it."

176
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:54,509
Our baby girl.

177
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,191
I did send the check in.

178
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,761
I wouldn't say it were
in the mail if it weren't.

179
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:04,630
Jerry, get off the phone
and clear Curtain Area 3.

180
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,532
Clear Curtain Area 3.

181
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:08,167
You got it.

182
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,868
Okay, come on.
Don't play with that.

183
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,104
That's really
expensive, okay, Jimmy?

184
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:13,106
Here, give me back your
gun. Give me back this.

185
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,673
Come on. Annie, Jimmy, come on.

186
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,841
I'll take you inside.

187
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,360
You have to give that back.

188
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,194
No, I want to stay with my mom.

189
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,663
Annie, take your
brother and go with Lydia.

190
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,149
Gently. Here we go.

191
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:25,367
Dr. Greene, I don't feel
good. I just don't feel good.

192
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,431
We've got you,
Loretta. We've got you.

193
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,160
Gently, gently, gently.

194
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,042
Oh, I'm sorry.

195
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,643
I didn't mean to scare you.

196
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,978
No, no, you didn't, not really.

197
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,847
We couldn't be out
of penicillin, could we?

198
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,905
Oh, they moved the
antibiotics down there.

199
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,989
Oh, this is adorable.

200
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,491
Yeah, I had to clear
out some of Susie's stuff

201
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,978
from upstairs at Daycare.

202
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,380
Susan, if there's
anything I can do

203
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,215
I mean, if you want
to talk about anything...

204
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,522
You were right.
Here it is. Thanks.

205
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,684
I'm with Pickman.

206
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,253
I know. Shep's off today.

207
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,255
Yeah, well, I'd be with
Pickman even if he wasn't.

208
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,056
You shouldn't have filed
that complaint with the IAD.

209
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,475
Hey, he shouldn't
have slammed that kid.

210
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:23,692
That's not what happened.

211
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,093
Yeah, sure, whatever.
You were there, right?

212
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,829
You think he was
just doing his job?

213
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,947
Yes, I do.

214
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:29,449
Well, I'll tell you
what I believe.

215
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,818
I believe the job doesn't
have to be done that way.

216
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,820
And who died and made
you the voice of experience?

217
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:36,606
Raul, that's who.

218
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,776
Look, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean that.

219
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,011
You know, Shep's
been working at this job

220
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,512
for almost eight years,

221
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,114
so if you ever want to step off

222
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,515
that high moral
ground you're sitting on,

223
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,549
you just might learn something.

224
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,101
Yeah, I already have.

225
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,270
Then that's what you should
be telling the IAD investigator.

226
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,994
I already have.

227
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,486
Abdominal pain for how long?

228
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,720
Couple of days.

229
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:11,056
I feel so bloated.
It doesn't go away.

230
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,224
Any vomiting?

231
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,558
Yeah.

232
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:15,795
Could I be dehydrated again?

233
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,597
We'll get some fluids
in you, just in case.

234
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,599
D-5. Half at 150 an hour.

235
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,002
CBC, lytes, chest
and abdominal series.

236
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,436
Coming up.

237
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,738
I couldn't even get
the kids to school.

238
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,174
They shouldn't be in here.

239
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:30,059
Don't worry. Jerry's
probably showing them

240
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,493
some horribly
educational pictures

241
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,347
of open heart surgery
or something worse.

242
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:36,566
I'll check back when
the tests are back.

243
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,855
Okay.

244
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,806
Hey, there you are.

245
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,124
Oh, hi. How'd it go?

246
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,627
Oh, man, that guy was
a real son of a bitch.

247
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,762
Shep, it's just an interview.
It's not a military inquest.

248
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,164
Yeah, but he asked
a thousand questions.

249
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,565
You know, he
already talked to Reilly.

250
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:53,866
I know. Little peckerhead.

251
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,101
Guy hasn't seen half
the stuff I've seen.

252
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,304
Calm down. It's
going to be fine.

253
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,505
So you're going to tell him

254
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,307
that you were there
the whole time, right?

255
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,741
I mean, that you saw everything.

256
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,743
Yes. I was there. The
guy stumbled into the table.

257
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:05,767
That simple.

258
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,932
Anyone could see it was
kind of a tough situation.

259
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,868
Shep, you're driving me crazy.

260
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm going to speak to
this investigator guy,

261
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,229
then this whole thing's
going to go away.

262
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,710
Will you please go away?

263
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,479
It's my day off.

264
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,048
I don't really have
anything else to do.

265
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,716
Well, it's spring, you know?

266
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,319
Plant some flowers,
drive some golf balls.

267
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,321
I don't play golf.

268
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,056
Start.

269
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,624
Annie, will you stop...

270
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,659
Just...

271
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,094
Want me to call the cops?

272
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,796
Don't laugh. Al's on the way.

273
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,330
By the way, congratulations.

274
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,731
We just got into town

275
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,534
practicing for a basketball
tournament on Saturday.

276
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,669
I talked to her mom.

277
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,171
She said she was operated on

278
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,738
when she was eight weeks old.

279
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,507
It was something
called a Kasai procedure.

280
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,542
Carter? Hepatoportoenterostomy.

281
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,367
Done for liver failure
from bile duct obstruction.

282
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,284
Okay, up and in.

283
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,019
I can do it myself, thank you.

284
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,687
T.C.'s what you'd
call dedicated.

285
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,555
I finally knew
something was wrong

286
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,157
when she didn't want to play.

287
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,725
I need to be fixed now, okay?

288
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,127
Because I have a
tournament on Saturday,

289
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,461
and it's very important.

290
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,563
My son's in a peewee
tournament next week.

291
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,833
Peewee stops at eight. I'm ten.

292
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,034
Sit up.

293
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,869
Fever's 101.

294
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,705
Mm-hm. Uh, how long
has she been jaundiced?

295
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,541
We've got a lot of kids.
I didn't really notice.

296
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,010
Dr. Ross, can I speak
to you for a minute?

297
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,278
Yeah.

298
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,513
Her folks live in Penrose.

299
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,083
Penrose? That's, like,
150 miles from here.

300
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,585
Yeah. Soybean country.

301
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,820
They're on their way,

302
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,089
but I got all these
other kids at the motel,

303
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,991
and God knows what
damage they're doing.

304
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,592
Okay. Well, I
would imagine T.C.'s

305
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,127
going to have to be admitted.

306
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,596
In the meantime, we'll
keep a good eye on her here.

307
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,020
All right, thanks.

308
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,269
Come with me. You're
going to be okay.

309
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,704
Cats!

310
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,773
Burmese, Cornish
Rex, Japanese Bobtail...

311
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,742
My hatred for them
knows no bounds.

312
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,644
Short hair, long hair.
I hate them. I just...

313
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,746
I think you're
allergic to them, Iris.

314
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,814
I never used to be.

315
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,516
My brother had a cat growing up,

316
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,884
and I hated that thing.

317
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,853
Sometimes your allergies
get worse when you get older.

318
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,755
Or maybe that's
completely false.

319
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,224
I'm shooting the
Chicago cat show,

320
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,292
and suddenly,

321
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,659
I'm Tippi Hedren in<i> The Birds.</i>

322
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,195
They're everywhere!

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,297
Iris, Iris, Iris, stop.

324
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,698
Okay. We're just
going to get you

325
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,799
your own room here, okay?

326
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,050
Russian blue, Himalayan,

327
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:28,420
Egyptian Mau, Bengal, Balinese,

328
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:32,346
Burmese, Cornish
Rex, Japanese Bobtail...

329
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,778
Please, somebody help me.

330
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:36,762
It's my baby.

331
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:37,896
Clear Trauma 1.

332
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,097
What happened?

333
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,700
She was in her
crib. She doesn't cry.

334
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:41,701
I can't wake her up.

335
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:42,868
How old is she?

336
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:45,137
Just turned six months.
Her name's Grace.

337
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:47,272
She's not breathing,
and she's cyanotic.

338
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,607
What is wrong with her?

339
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:49,608
What is it?

340
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:51,343
Pediatric intubation tray.

341
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,444
4.0 ET tube.

342
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,746
Heart rate's only 40.

343
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,431
O.14 of atropine. Has
she been sick, Mrs..?

344
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,766
Ramsey. Judith Ramsey.

345
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,301
Um, a little. She was vomiting,

346
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,619
just getting over the flu.

347
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:01,953
Fever or seizures?

348
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:02,972
Damn it. Temp's normal.

349
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,239
She was jerking.

350
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,907
I couldn't get her to stop.

351
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,576
I need a 3.5, not a four.

352
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,577
Use a four.

353
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,279
Susan? I'll do it.

354
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,080
Please, just tell me
what is wrong with her.

355
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,866
Mrs. Ramsey, you're
gonna have to wait outside

356
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,484
so that we can
take care of Grace.

357
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,686
I don't want to leave her.

358
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,270
Susan, take Mrs. Ramsey
to the Waiting Room.

359
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,355
Kerry... No, please.

360
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,906
Susan, now.

361
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,109
20 cc's per kilogram
bolus normal saline.

362
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,544
CBC, Chem-7,

363
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,546
heel stick glucose,
get a head CT,

364
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,403
and we may need an LP.

365
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,930
Come on.

366
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,344
Oh, God.

367
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,027
Oh. Oh.

368
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,714
Let me see, let me see.

369
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,119
Think she'll be able to
play in that tournament?

370
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:08,453
I doubt it.

371
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:09,955
Let me know when the LFT's, BUN,

372
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,123
and creatinine are back.

373
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,390
Okay.

374
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:13,592
And Carter? She's in here alone,

375
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,127
so stay close.

376
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:17,630
Okay.

377
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:18,654
Eww.

378
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,592
Eww.

379
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,798
What are you kids
doing in the hall?

380
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,581
Why is it that Chloe
always called Mom "Cookie"

381
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,672
and I always called Mom "Mom"?

382
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,921
She was such a
great kid that way...

383
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,423
Funny and fearless.

384
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:22,327
Just one big party
all wrapped up in...

385
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,897
We'd dress up and
put on these plays

386
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,433
at the top of the stairs.

387
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:30,702
Chloe, of course, went
straight for mom's best dresses,

388
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,338
best jewelry, best shoes,

389
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,839
I was always afraid
they'd get mad,

390
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,309
so I was the one in the
bathrobe and the sneakers...

391
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,845
but they never did.
Never. Not once.

392
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,981
Chloe went for the good stuff,

393
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:45,217
and I went for
being the good girl.

394
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,086
She was such an
accomplished adult

395
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,054
by the time she was nine,

396
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:51,790
and so lousy at it by
the time she was 19.

397
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:55,194
I mean, if she could just
go back to some of that...

398
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,952
then if she wanted
to be a mother...

399
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,425
What am I saying?
She is a mother.

400
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,780
Boy, when you buy
somebody lunch,

401
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:15,781
you go all out.

402
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:16,949
How's your knee?

403
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:18,417
You know, if it's
still bothering you,

404
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:20,286
I can get you
something for that.

405
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,121
I heard from Ray.

406
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:23,455
Oh yeah?

407
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,958
Well, not from him,
actually. About him.

408
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:28,294
How's the good
life in the Caymans?

409
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:30,129
Never went there.

410
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:31,797
He's in Mexico.

411
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,966
Kind of sends a
message, doesn't it?

412
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,468
Like what? Like he's
not coming back?

413
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,972
Well, what's it
look like to you?

414
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,207
Well, I'm used to
him disappearing.

415
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:44,543
He doesn't tend to
mention it in advance.

416
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,807
Yeah. I guess not, considering
he took my money with him.

417
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,652
Well...

418
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:54,920
thanks for all the sympathy.

419
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,288
No, uh, no.

420
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:59,324
I'm sorry. I'm just,
I'm disappointed.

421
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:02,994
Well, don't be. It
wasn't your money.

422
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:06,965
Well, he bolted on
me year after year,

423
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:09,084
but I just would think
with you in the picture...

424
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,252
With me in the picture.

425
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,653
What's that got to do with it?

426
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,905
I would think that he
would want to see you.

427
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:14,929
Come back and see me?

428
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,847
Come back and see us?
Is that what you mean?

429
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:23,698
He doesn't even
know about us, Karen.

430
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,984
Maybe it's your idea of
fun to watch him find out.

431
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:30,122
Is that what this is about,
Doug? What we're about?

432
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,408
You finally getting back at
Daddy, stealing his girlfriend?

433
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,642
You know what?
That's ridiculous.

434
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,427
Is it? For three weeks,
you've been telling me

435
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,695
how you can't stand the guy

436
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,497
could care less if you
ever see him again,

437
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,099
and now you're disappointed
he's not coming back?

438
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,138
That is ridiculous.

439
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,555
My motto is: "Think Jordan."

440
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,556
Okay, I'm just saying

441
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,924
that you can't rule out Orlando.

442
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,259
What do they know
about basketball in Florida?

443
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,427
Does this hurt?

444
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,746
Yeah. A little.

445
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,181
All right.

446
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:58,434
T.C.'s right. Orlando's
got a good record,

447
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,869
but when push comes
to shove, they'll choke.

448
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,671
Only one NBA leader in scoring,

449
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,406
and zip in rebounds.

450
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,196
Okay. I give up.

451
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,484
Carter.

452
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,986
Liver is enlarged and
firm upon examination.

453
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,556
Lab tests show elevated
LFT's, leukocytosis,

454
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,057
and a prolonged PT,

455
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,159
consistent with
ascending cholangitis.

456
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,862
Start her on one gram
cefotaxime IV Q-6.

457
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,997
Is she on a list for
a liver transplant?

458
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,231
Yeah. Status 3.

459
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,834
All right. Move
her up to Status 2.

460
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,401
She's going to have
to stay hospitalized

461
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,003
until we find her a liver.

462
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,506
Guess I better brush up
on my basketball trivia.

463
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,410
Well, you should do that anyway.

464
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,179
Hey, Dr. Benton. Al Boulet.

465
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,347
Hey. How you doing?

466
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,349
I got some kind
of flu or something.

467
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,352
Yeah, um... well, take care.

468
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,376
Right.

469
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,692
I'm sorry about those
kids and the camera.

470
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,660
Oh, I'm just glad I got it back.

471
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,029
I'm sorry about snorting
all over your hand.

472
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,798
It's just another adventure.

473
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,800
Uh, speaking of
which, I was thinking...

474
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,369
Bless you.

475
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,637
Thank you.

476
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,038
Who are you?

477
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,140
Lily.

478
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,707
Where'd you come from?

479
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,897
The bus stop.

480
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,546
What's wrong?

481
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,631
I can't get him off.

482
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,399
Is that a hermit crab?

483
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,468
Herman. My dad named him.

484
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,804
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to cut him off, Lily.

485
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:28,723
But he'd die, right?
I can't kill Herman.

486
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,342
No. Of course you can't.

487
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,144
Cats you can kill,
but not Herman.

488
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,712
It's just water, honey.

489
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:35,852
There you go.

490
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,900
Thank you.

491
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:39,956
You're welcome.

492
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,272
I produced this cheesy

493
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,041
Jacques Cousteau rip-off thing

494
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,210
a couple of months ago.

495
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,313
Anything on that little
baby, Grace Ramsey?

496
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,215
She's breathing spontaneously.

497
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,983
We're waiting on the CT.

498
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,484
Okay. Let me know.

499
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,353
They're seriously
backed up up there.

500
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,844
Just let me know.

501
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,428
Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver.

502
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,629
Hi.

503
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:08,997
Your name's Al Boulet?

504
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,498
Yeah.

505
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,702
We got a Jeanie Boulet
here. Any relation?

506
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,437
She's my wife.

507
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,772
Actually, we're separated.

508
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:22,010
You've been losing weight,
having fevers, sweating?

509
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:25,514
Yeah. I think I've
got the 24-day flu

510
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:28,350
instead of the 24-hour.

511
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:32,020
A lot of stuff's been
going around at work.

512
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,289
Deep breath.

513
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:37,859
The shortness of breath,
how long's that been going on?

514
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,362
Uh, a month or so.

515
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,864
Mr. Boulet, I'm going
to get a chest x-ray,

516
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,266
and I'll talk to you

517
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,201
about some blood
tests I'd like to order.

518
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,670
Okay.

519
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:49,838
Seen Dr. Greene?

520
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,439
Yeah. He snuck
out for some lunch.

521
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,109
Radiology screwed up
the films on Loretta Sweet.

522
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,543
We have to redo them.

523
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,378
What happened? Are you okay?

524
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm fine, I'm fine.

525
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,883
Teach this SOB to grapple
with a soon-to-be-married man.

526
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,685
Come on. Let's go
pour a little cold peroxide

527
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,053
on those cuts.

528
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,488
You don't look so good.

529
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,656
Well, don't you worry.

530
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,057
Nothing's going to ruin
our celebration night

531
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,391
at the Ritz Carlton.

532
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,295
Okay, let's get you cleaned up.

533
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,462
Hey, Jeanie.

534
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,679
I didn't know you were here.

535
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,232
Yeah. I'm just getting
a little checkup.

536
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,300
What's wrong?

537
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,836
Nothing, really.

538
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,670
Just, uh...

539
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,322
a little tired lately.

540
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,824
Breath feels kind of
short or something.

541
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,293
Working too much, that's all.

542
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:02,560
Did they say anything?

543
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,929
No. They just took
a bunch of blood.

544
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,904
Did some x-rays.

545
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,401
Look, I've got
some other patients.

546
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,136
Hey, don't worry about it.

547
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,806
Go do your thing. They
got me in good hands.

548
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,597
I'll try and stop by later.

549
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:32,624
Hi. This is Jeanie
down in the ER.

550
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:35,293
We've been waiting on
some lab tests forever.

551
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,962
Boulet. Al Boulet.

552
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:39,631
Yeah.

553
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:42,367
If you could put a rush
on them, I'd appreciate it.

554
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,324
Thanks.

555
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:49,641
Carol Hathaway?

556
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:50,975
Yes.

557
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,011
Sorry to keep you waiting.

558
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm David Haskell from IAD.

559
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,515
That's Investigations and...

560
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,184
Audit Division. Yes, I know.

561
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,436
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

562
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,437
You said that.

563
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:05,657
Must've really meant it then.

564
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:08,627
So, you saw Anh stumble.

565
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,845
Who?

566
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,747
Anh Nguyen. Vietnamese
boy. You saw him stumble

567
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,681
and hit his head
on a coffee table?

568
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,816
That's right.

569
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,800
Just lost his balance?

570
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,868
Must have.

571
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,820
Which would make sense

572
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:22,056
after Mr. Shepherd gave
him a... What did he call it?

573
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,391
"a light shove."

574
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,662
Is that how you'd
describe it? A light shove?

575
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,997
Well, the kid wasn't
falling very fast,

576
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,382
so, yeah, it was
probably pretty light.

577
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:34,570
Now, Mr. Brown says you
helped him unstrap a board.

578
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:35,938
Yes. He was nervous
and frustrated,

579
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,239
so I helped him do it.

580
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,240
Then you both took the
board back into the kitchen.

581
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,742
No. Reilly took it.

582
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,244
That's right.

583
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,714
He says he was headed to
the kitchen with the board,

584
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,216
and that's when he
saw Mr. Shepherd...

585
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,419
"slam" is the word he used...

586
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:55,090
Slam Anh Nguyen across the room.

587
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,459
So you must've gone
back into the kitchen

588
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,494
at pretty much the same time.

589
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,346
No. Reilly moved in first.

590
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,314
He carried the
board ahead of me.

591
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,984
Yeah, but if you
both saw the incident,

592
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,685
which obviously you did,

593
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,788
since you think it
was a light shove

594
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:13,741
and Mr. Brown
thinks it was a slam...

595
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,533
Then both of you had to
be there the whole time.

596
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,383
Yes. That's right.

597
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:27,127
I was there the whole time.

598
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,677
No, we had a fight
and I feel like a jerk.

599
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,679
My dad did take her money,

600
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:37,515
and I wasn't all that
sympathetic, but...

601
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,885
she was accusing me of
wanting him to come back.

602
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,554
Doug, what is this all about?

603
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,572
I don't know. What kind
of a question is that?

604
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,108
Your dad stealing her
money is not your fault.

605
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,577
Except that he gave
the money to me.

606
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,079
So give it back.

607
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,314
I can't. I only have $10,000.

608
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,084
I gave $15,000 for
that kid's chemotherapy.

609
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,925
This is way too
complicated for me.

610
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,763
Kerry, the CT's are back.

611
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:12,084
Subdural hematoma,
loud and clear.

612
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,652
There are retinal
hemorrhages in each eye.

613
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:14,686
You found this upon examination

614
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,087
and didn't even
bother to tell me.

615
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,489
You were already upset
about the intubation.

616
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:19,307
This mother's abusing
her child, and you know it.

617
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,109
Where is she? I
want to talk to her.

618
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,577
Not yet. Not yet?

619
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,946
A subdural hematoma
and retinal hemorrhages

620
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,831
are the hallmarks of
Shaken Baby Syndrome.

621
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:27,849
I know that, Susan. But...

622
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,434
This child could
have brain damage.

623
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,852
I've ordered a
Neurosurgical consult.

624
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,637
Yeah. Great. I want
to talk to the mother.

625
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:33,839
She is the problem.

626
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:35,323
I've called Children
and Family Services.

627
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,691
They have a thousand cases.

628
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,292
Who's going to keep
tabs on this one?

629
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,311
I've also notified the police.

630
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:41,113
You think they have
time to deal with this?

631
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,313
It's the best we can do.

632
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:44,148
You know that if this
mother doesn't get it,

633
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:45,383
and that baby starts crying,

634
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,686
and she picks her up,
and the baby doesn't stop,

635
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,287
she's just going
to start shaking her

636
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,288
and shaking her.

637
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,691
We can't solve this, Susan.

638
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:56,094
I wish we could, but
we both know we can't,

639
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:58,864
so we're going to take
care of the child, okay?

640
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:00,966
We're going to do
everything we can

641
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,089
for the child.

642
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,706
They took the baby
up to Pediatrics ICU.

643
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:12,010
Children and Family Services
came down to talk to the mother.

644
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:16,815
The police are looking into
it, and that's the last I know.

645
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,985
It's the last I'm gonna know.

646
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,988
Sometimes that's the good
thing about being an ER doc.

647
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,547
Treat 'em and street
'em. Turf 'em upstairs.

648
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,997
Got to hand it to that
Kerry Weaver, though.

649
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,032
She surprises you.

650
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:37,002
Just when you think
she's completely clueless,

651
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:41,006
she hangs in there,
stalling, arguing with me,

652
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:45,010
agreeing with me.

653
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,635
"We can't solve the problem.
We can take care of the child."

654
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:55,341
Until I finally let go.

655
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:07,804
Getting bored
sitting in your room?

656
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:13,743
Hey, your fever's down.
Come on. Bounce me one.

657
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,293
The good news is that

658
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,729
once you get a new liver,
the disease won't come back.

659
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,398
And you're official now.

660
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,705
You're all signed up
on the transplant list.

661
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,523
It's not like we need this
thing to happen right away.

662
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:35,565
If it takes a few months,
you're still gonna be fine.

663
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,582
Unfortunately, you're
going to have to stay here.

664
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:43,985
Well, not here. You're
going to be upstairs,

665
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,021
but I'll come visit
you whenever I can,

666
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,090
and you can educate me

667
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,998
on the finer points
of the point guard.

668
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,597
Maybe we can watch
the playoffs together.

669
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,533
That sounds pretty
cool, doesn't it?

670
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:02,370
But I can't play in
my tournament, can I?

671
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,538
No. No, I'm sorry, T.C.

672
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,163
You can't play in
your tournament.

673
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,195
Thought I'd never
get out of there.

674
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,396
I'm glad you didn't wait.

675
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,498
Tuna on whole wheat
with lettuce and tomato.

676
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,133
You want it? I'm
not really hungry.

677
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,918
Right after I finish
my cheese steak.

678
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:36,754
I know I've said
this before, but...

679
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,907
you have to get Kerry
Weaver off my back.

680
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:39,924
What now?

681
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,160
Six-month-old baby
girl came in cyanotic.

682
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:43,761
Kerry thinks I can't
handle the intubation.

683
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:44,763
But you did, right?

684
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:45,764
No! She took over.

685
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:47,599
Yes, it was a baby,
yes, it was hard,

686
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:48,983
but I've done this
a hundred times.

687
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,887
How's everything else?

688
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,838
You mean therapy?

689
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:55,340
That is what you mean, right?

690
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:58,776
Well, do I feel
terrific? Not really.

691
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,296
Um, am I marginally
better? Not really.

692
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,599
Am I happy I'm spending
my money on therapy

693
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,184
and not, say,
Gymboree or a stroller?

694
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,686
Not really.

695
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,472
So everything's going okay?

696
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,030
You want to walk back?

697
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:20,152
They didn't page me.

698
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,452
I wish there was
something I could do,

699
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,842
something I could say.

700
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,313
So do I.

701
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,262
It would be so much easier

702
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,265
if this bad news were
happening to some patient.

703
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,267
Mm, I shouldn't
be drinking this.

704
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,635
I'll never get to sleep.

705
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,537
I never sleep anyway.

706
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,641
Yeah, you know, we actually
had a class in medical school,

707
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,844
uh, sort of how to
deliver the bad news.

708
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:54,382
We even had to make
videotapes and perform it.

709
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:59,020
"I'm very sorry, sir, but your
wife was hit by a Mack truck,

710
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:03,791
and we did everything
possible, but she died."

711
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,561
Then some actor
playing the husband

712
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,931
would go into
convulsions on the floor

713
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,667
and start crying out in agony.

714
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:17,272
That's not usually
how they react.

715
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:20,675
They shake, then
they start to cry.

716
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,778
Yeah, I remember the
first time I had to do it.

717
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:27,615
It was this elderly man,
and his wife had just died.

718
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,618
No big accident, just old age.

719
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,421
And he looked at me for about...

720
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,722
a minute,

721
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,559
and then walked away.

722
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,385
Yeah, I was the
one left shaking.

723
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,967
Practice makes perfect, though.

724
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,570
Now I can deliver that
speech in a heartbeat,

725
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,172
and it's not that
I don't feel badly,

726
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,807
because I do,

727
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:56,044
but I get the words
out, and I move on.

728
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,768
The healers are always
taught to move on...

729
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:05,242
and for the life of me, I
can't seem to do that now.

730
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:11,326
This hurt is so
strong and so present,

731
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,329
it makes me feel her...

732
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:18,988
and to still be
able to feel her...

733
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:26,129
I don't want to
move on from that.

734
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,661
You need something?

735
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,330
Your interview
must have gone well.

736
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,099
I got a lot of work, Reilly.

737
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,163
Haskell just called. They
dropped the investigation.

738
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,003
Seems your answers confirmed

739
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,705
Shep's side of the story.

740
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,528
Well, now we can
all get back to work.

741
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,345
Look, I like you, Hathaway,

742
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,947
but whatever you said in there,

743
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,249
I don't think you're
doing Shep any favors.

744
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,617
Look, maybe it's the Raul thing,

745
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,853
and maybe he's going
to come through this,

746
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:14,088
but right now, he
doesn't belong out there.

747
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,879
He's dangerous.

748
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,235
I can't keep doing this.

749
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:28,569
Yes, you can.

750
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,704
You made it through
the last surgery.

751
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,606
You can make it
through this one.

752
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,308
It's the kids.

753
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,710
They never know what's going on

754
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,746
from one day to the next...

755
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,549
Where I'm gonna be,
where they're gonna be.

756
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,168
They're going to be at
my house tonight, okay?

757
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:47,038
My parental skills can
use a little brushing up.

758
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,707
I don't know what to tell them.

759
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,943
I don't know what to say.

760
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:56,213
I've hardly even
seen them all day.

761
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,866
Well, I can tell you one thing.

762
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,658
They've been pretty
busy. Take a look.

763
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,675
Look, Mom.

764
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,061
They turned us into doctors.

765
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,530
Officer, I'm so sorry.

766
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:14,081
Are you kidding?

767
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,467
He was the center of attention.

768
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:17,802
He loved it.

769
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:20,304
Are you sure you
can't stay for dinner?

770
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:22,006
Mom, look, thank you,

771
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,176
but I can't eat dinner
at 5:30 in the afternoon.

772
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,944
Oh. Pathetic, isn't it?

773
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:29,113
Howard comes
back from the office,

774
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,615
grabs dinner, rushes
back to the office.

775
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,651
I thought tax season was over.

776
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,452
What happened to April 15?

777
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:38,355
Does the word "extension"
mean anything to you?

778
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:39,690
As a matter of fact,

779
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,426
I think I have one of those.

780
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,960
All right. Listen, Mom...

781
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:44,762
So, how much do you need?

782
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,831
No. You can't
possibly know that.

783
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:49,133
I haven't said
anything about money.

784
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:51,636
Well, you're not here
for dinner, are you?

785
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,904
No.

786
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:55,640
And you don't drop
by a lot to play Bridge.

787
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:56,974
I don't play Bridge.

788
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:58,242
My point exactly.

789
00:36:58,266 --> 00:36:59,510
Doug, there are three reasons

790
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:00,778
kids come back home.

791
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,963
One, to announce
they're getting married...

792
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,418
Two, they're depressed

793
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,587
and they need a place
to sleep for three years,

794
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:11,344
and three, they need money.

795
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,544
My money's on the money.

796
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,098
So, were you always so smart?

797
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:24,290
Right up until the day
I married your father.

798
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:30,007
Doug...

799
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,876
all those years you
were growing up

800
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,994
not knowing about your dad...

801
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,181
I couldn't help you then.

802
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,116
Nothing would make me happier

803
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,518
than to help you now.

804
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,520
Don't you even want to know

805
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:45,189
what I'm gonna
use the money for?

806
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:47,546
You really want to tell me?

807
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:51,779
Bring the carrots over here.

808
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,304
Okay.

809
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,793
Broken tib-fib.

810
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,795
Jeanie, do you have a minute?

811
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,163
If I call Ortho now,

812
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,131
they ought to make
it down by summer.

813
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,800
Jeanie...

814
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,969
It's about Al, isn't it?

815
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,303
Yeah.

816
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,705
And is it AIDS?

817
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,875
Yeah. Pneumocystis pneumonia.

818
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:24,929
I saw his chart, and when
he told me how he was feeling,

819
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:26,264
his symptoms...

820
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:28,866
I need to give him the news,

821
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,868
but I thought it might
be easier for him if...

822
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,143
No, I'll do it. I'll do it.

823
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,562
I know you're separated...

824
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,281
but he may have
been HIV-positive

825
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:44,870
for a few years.

826
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:47,748
Have you ever been tested?

827
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,927
How many married
people get tested?

828
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,106
I checked for you
at the hotel suite.

829
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,908
Doesn't seem to be mine anymore.

830
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,344
Something about when
you lose company money.

831
00:39:13,368 --> 00:39:15,613
You're going to have to let me

832
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:17,181
write you something for that.

833
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:18,471
Whatever.

834
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,277
I got to say, I much
prefer your place.

835
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,947
Whatever.

836
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,034
Some of what you said,

837
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:38,636
I don't know if
it's true or not,

838
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,638
but you made me think about it,

839
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:43,274
and I...

840
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,298
I realized that...

841
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:51,882
I want to be with you, Karen.

842
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:58,122
You don't see me
kicking you out the door.

843
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,758
You're going to
have to let me do this,

844
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:03,149
because I have a very
low threshold for your pain.

845
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:09,189
Up and there you go.

846
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:18,075
Karen?

847
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:19,410
Doug?

848
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:21,245
I have a confession to make.

849
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,080
You're not married, are you?

850
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,082
No. It's worse than that.

851
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,818
Okay.

852
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,822
You know the money that
my father took from you?

853
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,724
He, uh... he gave it to me.

854
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:36,427
What?

855
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:39,497
Yeah. I... I mean, he
never gave me a dime

856
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,932
when I was in medical school.

857
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:43,601
I mean, he just...

858
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,769
he just handed
me a bunch of cash

859
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,694
before he took off.

860
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:52,776
$25,000.

861
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,668
Yeah. I want you to have it.

862
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:00,072
$25,000?

863
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:16,189
Ray stole over 250 grand.

864
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,604
250 grand?

865
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:23,096
You got it.

866
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:29,580
This is nothing.

867
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:30,748
This is, uh...

868
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,717
this is a drop in the bucket.

869
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,284
No, it's everything.

870
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:36,620
That's the sweetest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

871
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:38,522
I mean, I could
get fired tomorrow,

872
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:41,214
but I got to love
you for this one.

873
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,736
Mmm...

874
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,738
Great news, huh, baby?

875
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,740
They dropped the whole thing!

876
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,077
Whatever you said in
there, it made the difference.

877
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,913
We are home free.

878
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:03,414
Let's celebrate.

879
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,082
Let's go do something.

880
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,084
Shep, I got a lot of paperwork.

881
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,086
Ah, you can do this
later. This can wait.

882
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,755
No! I really need
to do this now.

883
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,757
Okay, we go to dinner, then.

884
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,426
Dinner, maybe a club.

885
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,760
You know, um...

886
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,662
they're playing
basketball outside.

887
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:21,198
Um, I'll join you
when I'm finished.

888
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:23,500
Okay.

889
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:25,458
Don't be too long.

890
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,298
Al, I need to talk to you.

891
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,476
It's cold in here tonight.

892
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:06,160
Maybe Chloe is
getting it together,

893
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:09,163
or maybe Joe can
keep it together.

894
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:13,000
Sometimes I dream
that they call and say

895
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:17,004
"Hey, Suz, why don't you
take her again for a while?"

896
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,239
and in my dream, I say,

897
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:21,464
"Yes, Chloe, I will
take her forever."

898
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,213
Then I wake up, and
I know it's not true,

899
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:29,539
because my arms hurt
from feeling so empty.

900
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,689
I always knew you
loved your children.

901
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:40,683
I just never realized how
much you fell in love with them.

902
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,866
<i>Little Susie was
like a storybook...</i>

903
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,724
<i>One that you never
wanted to put down.</i>

904
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:55,543
<i>Every smile was some new page</i>

905
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:59,602
<i>to be pored over,
studied, touched...</i>

906
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,707
<i>remembered.</i>

907
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,751
<i>I loved my storybook.</i>

908
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:41,744
<i>For the first time
in a long time...</i>

909
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,347
<i>I didn't feel alone.</i>
