1
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,543
Oh!

2
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,613
I was just dropping off
yesterday's post-op notes.

3
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:21,614
That's okay.

4
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:23,383
I was, uh, I was up reading.

5
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:25,287
Didn't you have
surgery this morning?

6
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:27,859
Oh, damn!

7
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,945
File on Mrs. Rubadoux.

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,047
You finished with it?

9
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,648
Uh, yeah. I'll, uh,
drop it off later.

10
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:39,749
Get going.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,573
I'll take care of it.

12
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:49,676
Hey, Carter.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,677
Morning.

14
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,412
And a grand one it is.

15
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:53,613
Yeah, easy for you to say.

16
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,914
I'm not on until noon.

17
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,115
Yeah, well, it's much more fun

18
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,651
to ride in together.

19
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:58,869
Don't you usually drive to work?

20
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,238
My car's in the shop.

21
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,506
What, did you drive around,

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,073
like, two, three weeks

23
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,675
with that brake
warning light on?

24
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,732
No. A week... at most.

25
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:10,881
Is your apartment on this line?

26
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,350
No. I'm on the
Congress-O'Hare line.

27
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,552
But you're taking
Ravenswood today?

28
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,421
Yeah. It's Mark's line.

29
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:18,538
This is us.

30
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,006
Stop and shop at
Davey's Liquor Depot.

31
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,224
What?

32
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,193
Tequila shopping.
Doug Ross's birthday.

33
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,594
Yeah, margaritas at
my apartment after work.

34
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:25,579
Okay. See you later.

35
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:26,629
Bye.

36
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,336
Right.

37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,034
I'm doing an
endarterectomy at 11:00,

38
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:33,303
if any of your Residents
want to observe.

39
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,205
Give them an excuse
to miss my rounds?

40
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,240
How thoughtless of me.

41
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,241
Peter.

42
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,376
Morning.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,178
Peter, so good of you to wake.

44
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,179
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,380
I was working late last night...

46
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,381
And you overslept?

47
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,382
It won't happen again.

48
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:46,616
I certainly hope not.

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,017
If you'd been
responsible for this patient

50
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,219
I think he might have questioned

51
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,453
your professionalism.

52
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,455
I stayed up reading some
of the research study files.

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,358
Well, that's very impressive,
but diligence is no excuse.

54
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,327
There now, the lecture is over.

55
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,230
Mrs. Rubadoux, Mr. Roth,

56
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,597
Warrington, Dorgan, McFarland...

57
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,733
And these patients
have what in common?

58
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:04,984
You used Lazerol

59
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,071
and the clamp-and-run
technique on all of them.

60
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,861
We used the clamp-and-run.

61
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,675
I went through the charts.

62
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,077
I'm just trying to understand

63
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,130
why all of these patients
were excluded from the study.

64
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,331
Well, each had complications

65
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,900
which made them
unsuitable candidates.

66
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:21,901
Shouldn't we have
determined that

67
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:22,902
before the clamp-and-run?

68
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:23,903
They were emergent cases.

69
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,104
Would you have let them die?

70
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:26,105
Of course not.

71
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,674
Now, this is your
first research project

72
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:28,775
you've participated
in, isn't it?

73
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:29,776
Yes.

74
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,777
Well, then it's my fault.

75
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,878
Obviously, I failed
to communicate

76
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,013
the magnitude and
scope of this kind of study.

77
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,014
No, I understand the scope...

78
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,416
No, Peter, I don't think you do.

79
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,418
Mrs. Rubadoux had
pulmonary disease,

80
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:41,020
renal insufficiency, and
congestive heart failure.

81
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,021
She was never a candidate

82
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,206
for the study.

83
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,807
Now, thank you, Claire.
I'll sign those later.

84
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,075
But with Mr. Roth...

85
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,210
Ah, with Mr. Roth,

86
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,945
we changed surgical
procedure in mid-course,

87
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,547
which was to the
benefit of the patient.

88
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,748
Now, would you have us continue

89
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:52,749
the clamp-and-run

90
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,151
just to include
him in the study?

91
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,418
No, but there are rules

92
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,786
for compiling data, right?

93
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,455
We're talking
about saving lives.

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,056
You and I have talked
about risks before,

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,090
particularly when related

96
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,792
to this extraordinary
level of medicine.

97
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:03,993
We'd never take the first step

98
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,828
if we didn't take risks.

99
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,430
Now, I hope that,
as we go along,

100
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,632
you can grasp that.

101
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,200
I'll try to.

102
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,201
Perhaps I was foolish

103
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,470
to bring you in on the team.

104
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,837
No, sir. I don't think so.

105
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,838
Third-year residents

106
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,839
rarely have the maturity.

107
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,840
You are very lucky

108
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,841
to have had this opportunity.

109
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,842
Perhaps you don't realize

110
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,866
how lucky you are.

111
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,590
Maybe you ought to
take a day to consider that.

112
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,563
Sorry.

113
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,342
Thanks.

114
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,343
Carter...

115
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,344
Yeah?

116
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,745
Since you have
time on your hands,

117
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,747
I have a knee lac
on a six-year-old in 2.

118
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,848
Can't do it.

119
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,450
We are observing a
thyroidectomy at 11:00.

120
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,252
And we've got rounds
with Dr. Vucelich at 10:00.

121
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,287
You've got time. What?

122
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,555
Make yourself useful, Carter.

123
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,256
About that knee lac, Carter?

124
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,257
Doug, do you mind?

125
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,458
Paramedics are pulling up

126
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,893
with an apparently
intoxicated and disheveled

127
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:44,894
street individual.

128
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,062
Be my guest.

129
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,730
Man...

130
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,931
Come on. I've
missed you, Carter.

131
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,932
By the way,

132
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,100
happy birthday, Dr. Ross.

133
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,235
It's not my birthday.

134
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,586
That's an ugly rumor.

135
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,787
And, Jerry,
Groundhog Day is over,

136
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,206
so let's get rid of that guy.

137
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,773
I am so sorry, Marguerite.

138
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,709
I just can't understand
how this happened.

139
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,178
My foot hit the ice,
my bum hit the bricks.

140
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,946
I thought I'd
shoveled all the steps

141
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,582
but there it was,
third from the top.

142
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,850
A small, yet undeniably
slick patch of ice.

143
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,420
I'm gonna live, Edward.
Don't worry about it.

144
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,422
Yes, but why, why
did this happen?

145
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,890
It was an accident.

146
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,291
There are no accidents.

147
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,342
He tends to overthink things.

148
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,610
Studying to be an analyst.

149
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,611
Psychoanalyst?

150
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:19,896
Scary, huh?

151
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,880
I still can't believe my
daughter married him.

152
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,285
Nathan Conley, 27 years old.

153
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:27,253
ETOH intoxication, ALOC, ataxic.

154
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,405
Oh, man!

155
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,122
Nystagmus, BP 90/40, resps 14.

156
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,291
Excuse me, I'm just
gonna move upwind.

157
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,292
Who called it in?

158
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,711
He and his girlfriend
were bunking up

159
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:35,879
with some other deadbeat guy.

160
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:36,979
Nathan couldn't
stop throwing up.

161
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,480
Said he drank a gallon of vodka,

162
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,481
took some Xanax.

163
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,616
"Some" Xanax?

164
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,418
"Some" being the only
number he could think of.

165
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,442
Whoo, man!

166
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:47,640
Did you make up
today's schedule?

167
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:48,975
Like every day.

168
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:49,976
Where is it?

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,277
That is it.

170
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:53,079
Well, I was assisting Dr. Zarem
on a parathyroidectomy

171
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,114
at 11:00,

172
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:55,915
and Dr. Enari on a
nephrectomy at 3:00.

173
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,317
This says Bachtell's assisting.

174
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,919
Dr. Vucelich said you were
going to be tied up in the ER,

175
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,943
so I reassigned.

176
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,226
Mark and Susan? Really?

177
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,960
Carter said that they
were very chummy.

178
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:08,961
On the El?

179
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,163
I thought Susan drove to work.

180
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,698
I saw them in the
lounge yesterday.

181
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,734
Hey, I saw them
in the cafeteria.

182
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,088
Susan, how are you this morning?

183
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,255
I'm fine, thank you, Doug.

184
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,824
Haven't I already
seen you today?

185
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,742
Yes. You know, you have.

186
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,294
You have seen me today.

187
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,295
Carol, what do you say

188
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,696
we get to that earache in 1?

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,696
Oh, right. Earache.

190
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,203
Mm-hm.

191
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,936
Did you lose consciousness?

192
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,704
Uh, not this time, she didn't.

193
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,855
This time?

194
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,989
Two months ago

195
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,092
I stumbled over his new puppy

196
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,626
and hit my head on the driveway.

197
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,627
My wife and I,

198
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,045
we want children, but...

199
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,132
Okay, let's just... We'll
get it out in the open.

200
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,617
I have some problems
with commitment...

201
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,052
Accepting responsibility.

202
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,955
We thought a puppy might help.

203
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,190
Any blurry vision this time?

204
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,274
No, just the cut.

205
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,542
Do you think

206
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,944
that I could somehow be
causing these accidents?

207
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,546
I know that we've been
having some difficulty

208
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,547
since you moved in.

209
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,133
Let the doctor work, Edward.

210
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,401
Are you allergic to lidocaine,

211
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,503
Mrs. Janeway?

212
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,537
I wasn't before.

213
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,756
Got stitches on my
arm last summer.

214
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,174
Edward sliced me
with the Weed Whacker.

215
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,227
Oh, my God, I
did. I did, didn't I?

216
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:16,034
I can't believe this.

217
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,482
I'm experiencing displacement.

218
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,151
That's an immature
defense mechanism

219
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,520
wherein your
feelings of hostility

220
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,321
are inappropli... in... ina...

221
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,690
Inappropriately redirected.

222
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,826
Sorry about this.

223
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,527
My daughter, the
only one with a job,

224
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,232
had to go to work today,
so Edward brought me in.

225
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,466
That's okay.

226
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,868
Have you had a tetanus booster?

227
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,169
Three months ago.

228
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,838
Cut my leg on the
basement stairs.

229
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,429
Tripped over
Edward's golf clubs.

230
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,193
Banana bag's going.

231
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,212
Are we done?

232
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,547
What's the deal, Carter?

233
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,814
Surgery withdrawal?

234
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,016
I ordered a blood alcohol level

235
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,550
and a tox screen.

236
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,719
Okay, get a CBC,
stick him for a glucose,

237
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:57,720
and let's get a Chem-20.

238
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,322
His lytes have gotta
be all screwed up.

239
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,356
Got it.

240
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,091
Scattered rales bilaterally.

241
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,133
Did you check his pupils?

242
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,069
Equal, round and reactive.

243
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,570
Saline's going.

244
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,571
Let's give him naloxone,

245
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,573
two IV push,

246
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,041
and why are we
doing that, Carter?

247
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,708
To reverse the narcotic effect.

248
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,911
Are we boring you, or
is it the way he smells?

249
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:22,912
Sorry.

250
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,113
Okay, check his
head for contusions.

251
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,148
Glucose is 40.

252
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,433
Give him an amp of glucose

253
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:28,434
and 100 migs of thiamine.

254
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,652
Why are we giving him thiamine?

255
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,371
I don't know.

256
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:32,805
Given his poor
nutritional state,

257
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:33,923
glucose can precipitate

258
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,459
Wernicke's encephalopathy.

259
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,443
Symptoms which include ataxia

260
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,496
and paralysis of eye movements.

261
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,932
Isn't it nice to know you
can learn something new?

262
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,285
Mm-hm.

263
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:47,229
Prep for a gastric
lavage. I'll be back.

264
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,505
Oh, and Carter,

265
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,106
I want you to do a neuro check

266
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,575
every 15 minutes,

267
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,410
and don't forget to
do a stool guaiac.

268
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,479
Good to see you back
down here, Carter.

269
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,965
We missed you.

270
00:08:58,989 --> 00:08:59,966
Hey, Mark, how's it going?

271
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,166
I am ready for a margarita.

272
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,334
Little celebration?

273
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,736
What do you mean?
It's your birthday.

274
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,770
No, about you and Susan.

275
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,572
I want you to know
I think it's great.

276
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,573
What?

277
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:08,975
I understand you two
went home together

278
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:09,976
last night.

279
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,977
Wh... What are
you talking about?

280
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:11,978
We arrived this morning, but...

281
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,813
You know what?
You can fill me in later.

282
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,504
Dr. Greene...

283
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,719
Hi. I'm Reilly Brown.

284
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:20,987
We haven't met. You're doctor...

285
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,287
Mark Greene.

286
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,056
Shouldn't you be in
high school somewhere?

287
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,525
I'm a lot older than I look.

288
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:26,626
21.

289
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,827
Well, what do you got, Reilly?

290
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:28,828
Wilson Wolfe, 50.

291
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:30,429
Stuck his right hand
in the snow blower,

292
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:31,463
and ouch!

293
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,098
BP 120/80, pulse 106.

294
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,299
I think he's a little nervous.

295
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,300
Lose any fingers?

296
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,636
Oh. No, got 'em right here.

297
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,987
Ah. Good work, there, Reilly.

298
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,455
Dr. Benton?

299
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,890
What is it, Carter?

300
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,291
I can understand
if you're still upset

301
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,659
about my claiming that aneurysm,

302
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,861
but I don't see why

303
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,195
my surgical education
should suffer.

304
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,196
There's no surgical
service today.

305
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,197
Get back to work.

306
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,198
Who needs help in here?

307
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,199
Carter, get back to work...

308
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,550
Get back to work.

309
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,169
Hi. I'm Reilly Brown.
We haven't met. You're...

310
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,570
Mark, can I talk to you later?

311
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,638
Yeah, sure. Everything okay?

312
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,739
Yeah. No big deal.

313
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,641
All right, Reilly, that's all.

314
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,192
You can go now.

315
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:03,295
BP's 120/80.

316
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,231
Mr. Wolfe here seems
to have put his hand

317
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,966
into a snow blower.

318
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,568
Yeah, something was blocking it.

319
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,904
I... I cannot believe
I was that stupid.

320
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,272
Ah, lots of people are.

321
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,525
Whoa! Okay, we got a pumper.

322
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,826
Okay, Lydia,
inflate the BP cuff.

323
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,611
We have the two fingers.

324
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:19,912
Mr. Wolfe, are you right-handed?

325
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,413
Yes.

326
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,157
Not anymore, you're not.

327
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,619
Haleh said Nathan's waking up.

328
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:27,887
Yay.

329
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:28,887
Hey! Hey!

330
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,523
What are you doing?

331
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,990
No! Leave us alone.

332
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:32,991
Haleh, call Security.

333
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:34,427
Leave us alone.

334
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:36,261
No. No! You cannot be here!

335
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,797
I have to take care of him.

336
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:38,798
Uh, Carter...

337
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:39,832
It's okay, baby.

338
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,233
I'm going to take care of you.

339
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,234
Must be the girlfriend.

340
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,670
What exactly do you suspect?

341
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:45,671
I'm not quite sure.

342
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,673
But you do have suspicions?

343
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,674
I think he's not including

344
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,675
any bad outcomes.

345
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:50,676
And you're certain?

346
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,677
Yeah.

347
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,445
And when you confronted him?

348
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:54,446
He said it wasn't true.

349
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,848
But you think it is?

350
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,401
He explained two of them,
but there are three others.

351
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,637
First, there were five, and
now, there are only three?

352
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,872
Yeah.

353
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,139
Well, I'd make sure.

354
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,108
Well, I'm going over
the charts again.

355
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,278
Maybe he can
explain all of them.

356
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,046
He took me off
the surgical service.

357
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,648
Well, he could have
dozens of reasons

358
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,283
to do that.

359
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,852
Look, if I was going
to talk to somebody,

360
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,588
I mean, officially,
who would it be?

361
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,623
The dean.

362
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,725
Going up against a
guy like Vucelich...

363
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,960
He's one of the top
cardiovascular surgeons

364
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:25,961
in the country.

365
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,496
What if it comes down

366
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,664
to your word against his?

367
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,299
You don't think I
should pursue it?

368
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,967
If you do, and you're wrong,

369
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,091
your career's over.

370
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:42,662
I can't believe

371
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:43,863
you made me eat that chili.

372
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,065
I didn't make you eat it.

373
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,066
Yes, you did.

374
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,483
You held a gun to my head...

375
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,507
Whoa! Watch out!

376
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,957
Oh, man! Help! Help! My leg!

377
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,759
All right, don't move.
We're going to help you.

378
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:56,776
What's your name?

379
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,444
Paul. He's going to kill me.

380
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,446
Just relax. We're going
to get this bike off you.

381
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,447
Got it? Thanks, Jerry.

382
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,649
Let's just back it up, here.

383
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:03,650
It's a cool bike.

384
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:05,085
It's kinda heavy.

385
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,285
Please don't tell him I'm here.

386
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,687
Don't tell who? Is
someone after you?

387
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:08,922
He's going to kill me.

388
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:10,223
Who's gonna kill him?

389
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,042
My father. He won't let
me have a motorcycle.

390
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,476
He doesn't think they're safe.

391
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,528
Yeah, well, I guess
you didn't listen to him.

392
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:16,662
All right, lie back down.

393
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:17,930
I bought it this morning.

394
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:20,266
It was great until
the throttle stuck.

395
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,267
Lie down. Lie down.

396
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,291
I couldn't stop it.

397
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,508
Dr. Benton...

398
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,509
What is it, Carter?

399
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,510
Well, I now know

400
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,511
that you have the utmost

401
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,512
lack of respect for me.

402
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,914
If you want to quit the study,

403
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,915
that's your business,

404
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,116
but you should have told me.

405
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,517
Who told you I quit the study?

406
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,518
Everybody I've run into

407
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,586
in the last hour.

408
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,421
And I think I have
the right to know

409
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,256
before they did.

410
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,759
It's more complicated
than that, Carter.

411
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,662
I did not quit the study.

412
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,519
Right.

413
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,920
I've gotta get rid of the bike!

414
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:15,021
Settle down, Paul.

415
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,422
No, really, I've
got the pink slip

416
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:17,423
in my pocket.

417
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,791
Maybe somebody here will buy it.

418
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:21,311
It's a little damaged.
How much you want for it?

419
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,445
Mark...

420
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,913
I'm just trying to help him out.

421
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,682
His father's gonna clobber him.

422
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:26,716
Yeah, sure.

423
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,217
Ow!

424
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,619
Looks like a fractured fibula.

425
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,120
I can take him from here, Susan.

426
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,956
Yeah, "take him" is right.

427
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,792
Okay. See you later.

428
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,460
You don't have to
tell my dad, right?

429
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,461
How old are you?

430
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,463
17.

431
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,332
Yeah. I'm sorry. You're a minor.

432
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,884
Maybe he'll be grateful
that you didn't kill yourself.

433
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,158
I doubt it.

434
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:51,524
Miss Boulet...

435
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:53,292
Ruby, what are you doing here?

436
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,478
I just wanted to thank you again

437
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,545
for all your help.

438
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,530
You're welcome.

439
00:13:57,554 --> 00:14:00,399
And to let you know

440
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,223
my sweetheart
passed away yesterday.

441
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,355
Oh, Ruby. I'm so sorry.

442
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,490
How are you doing?

443
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,492
Oh. Okay.

444
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,261
Not great.

445
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,463
I knew it was gonna happen,

446
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,065
but I guess you
really never believe it

447
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,050
until it does.

448
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:21,054
Anyway,

449
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:24,256
the services are
this afternoon at 4:00

450
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,828
at the Mount Sinai Cemetery,
you know, off Grand.

451
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:29,879
I know you're busy,

452
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:33,215
but if you'd like to come,

453
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,185
it's okay.

454
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,887
Thank you, Ruby. I
would like to come.

455
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,189
Okay, then.

456
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,391
I'll see you later.

457
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:44,694
I'll see you later.

458
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,196
Carter...

459
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,230
Nathan's back asleep

460
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,698
having puked three more times.

461
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,201
Angel's awake,
weepy, and full of regret.

462
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,535
"Never gonna drink
another drop again,"

463
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,570
she says.

464
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:54,870
Great couple of
shpos, these two.

465
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,372
What did you just say?

466
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,041
"Shpos." It means
subhuman pieces...

467
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,143
No, I know what it
means, thank you.

468
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,602
Well, I gotta get
these x-rays to the O.R.

469
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,083
Carter's been hanging
around Benton too much.

470
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,818
Haven't we all?

471
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,553
Bad day at Black Rock, Dr. Ross.

472
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,054
Multiple seven-year-olds
on their way in...

473
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,155
Animal bites.

474
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,957
Something about a
petting zoo run amok.

475
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,415
♪ Happy birthday Dear Doug... ♪

476
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:24,550
Hi.

477
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:26,619
Hi.

478
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:29,221
How's Ruby? Mr. Rubadoux.

479
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,857
He's hanging in.

480
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:33,192
His wife died yesterday.

481
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:34,594
The service is at 4:00 today,

482
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:35,595
Mount Sinai.

483
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:36,596
I'm going,

484
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,997
if you want to go with me.

485
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,398
I don't think I can make it.

486
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:42,902
I'm pretty jammed up today.

487
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:43,903
These elevators take forever.

488
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,237
I'm gonna take the stairs.

489
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,512
How long have
you had that cough?

490
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,647
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:55,915
A while.

492
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:56,916
Well, your chest x-rays

493
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,955
will show us more.

494
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:00,937
Do they show everything?

495
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,060
Why?

496
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,656
Maybe they'll show I have AIDS.

497
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,947
Do you?

498
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:09,294
Yeah.

499
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,465
Look, you don't have to
tell Nathan about me, right?

500
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,833
Have you been sick
with anything else?

501
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,036
Fevers, rashes, night sweats?

502
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,272
No.

503
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:20,373
Just the cough.

504
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:24,494
Okay, get a CBC, ABG, Chem-20,

505
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,963
a UA, hepatitis
titers, place a PPD,

506
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,019
and get a CD-4.

507
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,918
I'm concerned that you
might have pneumonia,

508
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,920
so I'm going to keep
you here for a while

509
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:35,171
and run some tests, okay?

510
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,641
Look, um...

511
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,943
you don't have to
tell Nathan about me,

512
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,178
right?

513
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,981
It's against the law
for me to tell him.

514
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:45,982
You should.

515
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,051
He has a right to know,

516
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,153
and if he is sick,

517
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,187
he should be getting treatment,

518
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,211
and so should you.

519
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,575
I just think he might get
mad at me, you know,

520
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,599
and, uh...

521
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:00,929
he might wanna
take off or something,

522
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,582
and, uh...

523
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,606
he's all I have.

524
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,907
Can you make that out to "cash?"

525
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,008
You got a deal.

526
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,009
You got robbed.

527
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,210
I'm doing this as a favor.

528
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,211
You still have to explain

529
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,379
what happened to your leg.

530
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,413
Oh, God.

531
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,414
We'll tell your dad

532
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,515
that you were hitchhiking,

533
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,117
and you got picked
up by a motorcycle,

534
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,886
and then bam! Mark!

535
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,120
Well, he hates hitchhiking too,

536
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,422
but, you know, at least,
I'll only be grounded.

537
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,579
Oh. Watch out for the throttle.

538
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,827
So I got lucky.

539
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,230
In more ways than one, I hear.

540
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,231
What?

541
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,232
Nothing.

542
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,584
Lydia, what did you hear?

543
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,120
Do you have pain anywhere else?

544
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,554
Only my stomach.

545
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,724
Okay, okay. Sit back.

546
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:45,858
What do you got?

547
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,627
Oh... oh...

548
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,728
T-Ball, is that you?

549
00:17:48,752 --> 00:17:50,145
I haven't seen you in a while.

550
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,582
Oh, my stomach,
it hurts for real.

551
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,267
Uh-huh.

552
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,386
It does! I ain't lying to you.

553
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,987
Yup.

554
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,210
Jeanie...

555
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,893
I can't remember his real name,

556
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,795
but he's under T-Ball
in the turkey file.

557
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,096
Frequent flyer. Drug-seeking.

558
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,097
Are you sure?

559
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,498
He really seems to be in pain.

560
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,700
You'll get used to these guys.

561
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,234
They'll do anything
for Valium, Percodan,

562
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,535
preferably Demerol.

563
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,337
Let him moan and
groan for about an hour.

564
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,528
He'll get bored, go
somewhere else.

565
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,059
Carter!

566
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,660
I asked you to wake
Nathan Conley up

567
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,661
every 15 minutes.

568
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,662
I had something to do.

569
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,863
Yeah, you had that to do,

570
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:25,864
and you didn't do it.

571
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:26,865
Okay, I'm sorry.

572
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,067
I want chest films on him,

573
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:29,068
P.A. and lateral.

574
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,069
Jerry...

575
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:31,504
I need you to call
Social Services.

576
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,506
I've got an AIDS patient
who's going to need placement.

577
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,507
This thing's still here?

578
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,158
Belongs to Dr. Greene now.

579
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,977
Mark bought a motorcycle?

580
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,311
Got it cheap.

581
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:40,345
There's only one helmet, though.

582
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,281
You're going to
have to get your own.

583
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:43,282
What?

584
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:44,316
When spring comes,

585
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,918
you guys will be
riding in on this

586
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:46,919
instead of the El.

587
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,988
I know I would.

588
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:50,222
What are you talking about?

589
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:51,356
You and Dr. Greene.

590
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,758
I think it's terrific,
by the way.

591
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:53,759
You make a great couple.

592
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:54,993
Excuse me.

593
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,430
I'm looking for
Dr. Douglas Ross.

594
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:58,631
He's with a patient right now.

595
00:18:58,655 --> 00:18:59,832
Can I tell him who's here?

596
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:03,102
All right, now, you, over there.

597
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,303
I want to sit by Joseph.

598
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,704
I don't want her next to me!

599
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,457
Bet you can't wait
to have that baby.

600
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,541
Hmm. The baby part's fine.

601
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,159
It's when they get
to be this age...

602
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,344
Hey, hey! You know what, guys...

603
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,495
Uh, Nurse Hathaway,

604
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,364
will you give us a
hand over here, please?

605
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,982
I want to sit by Joseph.

606
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:16,983
Get her away from me!

607
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:18,851
I didn't even want you

608
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,052
to come to my birthday party!

609
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,453
All right, take off. You got it?

610
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:22,672
You're gonna sit
over here. Yeah.

611
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:23,673
Dr. Ross...

612
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:24,740
Yeah.

613
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,542
A guy at the desk
wants to see you.

614
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,543
Who is it?

615
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,544
He said you'd know him.

616
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,528
Surprise for your birthday.

617
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:30,552
Wha...

618
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,022
Doug?

619
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,046
Who is it?

620
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,589
My father.

621
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,013
Carol...

622
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,080
Yeah?

623
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,682
I looked up T-Ball's
card in the file.

624
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,683
He's always claimed back pain.

625
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,951
This time, it's his stomach,

626
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,185
not his usual M.O.

627
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,320
Guess he's branching out.

628
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,488
Maybe,

629
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,890
but I ran some
additional blood tests,

630
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,212
just in case.

631
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,145
I wanted one in high school,

632
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,346
but my parents wouldn't let me.

633
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,748
Then I wanted one
after med school,

634
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:23,749
my wife wouldn't let me.

635
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:25,317
Whoo! Got a good one here.

636
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,518
You know about motorcycles?

637
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,586
Five brothers?

638
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,787
Had them all over the backyard.

639
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,656
You'd better get
a lock and chain.

640
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,741
E-Ray got his stolen.

641
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,075
Keep it in your apartment.

642
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,127
Third floor, no elevator.

643
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,801
Susan could keep
it at her place.

644
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,586
Jerry, I'm looking for Carter.

645
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,987
I haven't seen him.

646
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:45,988
All right.

647
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,122
Oh, have you seen Carter?

648
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,924
Is he missing again?

649
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,225
Angel's chest films are back.

650
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,226
It looks like pneumocystis,

651
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,494
and I asked him to order

652
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,563
a bronchoscopy.

653
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,398
Angel...

654
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,832
Oh, man,

655
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,100
I was afraid this would happen.

656
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,435
I had a feeling she
was gonna leave.

657
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,179
That girl was too scared.

658
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,980
If you need to
help, I can wait...

659
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,716
I'm a pediatrician, Ray.

660
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,917
This is a damn exciting job

661
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:15,985
you got here.

662
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,019
Only if you're unlucky,

663
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,287
which I happen to be today.

664
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,856
Don't they need this?

665
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,457
They got plenty of those inside.

666
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,193
Yeah? Come on. Go on out, Doug.

667
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,895
Come on, Dougie, go on.

668
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,433
You know, my name
isn't Dougie anymore.

669
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,100
Is that why you came here?

670
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,202
Play ball with your boy?

671
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:35,321
Not with this.

672
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:36,655
Now, if this were
a basketball...

673
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,889
We don't have a basketball.

674
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:39,225
Remember when you were a kid,

675
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:40,826
I used to put you
on my shoulders,

676
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,127
and you'd slam dunk?

677
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:44,296
"Two points, two
points!" you'd scream.

678
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,314
How's your mother?

679
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,388
She's fine. She's happy.

680
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,955
God love her. She deserves it.

681
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,156
I'll tell her you said so.

682
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,693
No, you won't.

683
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:00,011
You wouldn't even
tell her you saw me.

684
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,447
Afraid it'll upset her.

685
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:03,438
Afraid she'll get
all melancholy.

686
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:09,688
People never gave
her enough credit.

687
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:10,806
She's a strong woman.

688
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,064
She kind of had
to be, didn't she?

689
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,013
She walked out on me once.

690
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:19,448
Compared to the 12 times
you walked out on her?

691
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,049
You mean walked
out on you, don't you?

692
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,952
What are you doing here, Ray?

693
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,319
What do you want from me?

694
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,103
I don't want anything from you.

695
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,576
You're all over the airwaves.

696
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,593
You're a big hero.

697
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,034
I was feeling proud of you.

698
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:40,659
I do have regrets.

699
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:43,939
I gotta go to work.

700
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,596
Yeah.

701
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,299
Uh, Doug...

702
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,206
Happy birthday, son.

703
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,923
Uh...

704
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,058
I'm all turned around.

705
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:03,458
Is the El this way?

706
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,482
It's that way.

707
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,472
Dr. Vucelich...

708
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,707
Mr. Carter.

709
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,708
You look winded.

710
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,709
Yeah, I was hurrying.

711
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,960
Dr. Vucelich...

712
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,696
I know Dr. Benton
left the study,

713
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,047
and I just wanted to say

714
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,715
that I've learned more under you

715
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,217
than in four years
of medical school,

716
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,886
and I'd very much like

717
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,221
to continue on the team.

718
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:37,426
Well, there's initiative,
wouldn't you say?

719
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,560
For better or worse,

720
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,162
there seems to be a
plethora of students

721
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,146
on the team right now.

722
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,347
I can't see

723
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,566
that I would have anything
of substance for you to do

724
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,425
since you're way
beyond scut work.

725
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:50,144
Best of luck.

726
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,930
Excuse me.

727
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,529
Did you ask Nathan

728
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:57,730
if he'd take an AIDS test?

729
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:59,297
He says it gives him the creeps.

730
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,500
Bilateral perihilar
infiltrates right there.

731
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,101
He needs to know
that Angel has AIDS,

732
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,302
and he might have it, too.

733
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:05,504
Yeah, well, you can't tell him.

734
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,505
The law protects her privacy.

735
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,740
I could if they were married.

736
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:09,341
And they're not.

737
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,776
Who's protecting Nathan?

738
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,777
And if he has AIDS,

739
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,778
who's protecting all the women

740
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,046
that he might have sex with?

741
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,281
Ethically, I agree with you.

742
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,482
But the law's the law, right?

743
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:19,186
Even if it's not right.

744
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,720
Hey, T-Ball, you giving up?

745
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:23,789
CBC showed microcytic anemia.

746
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:25,490
Blood smear showed
red cell stippling.

747
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:26,692
Got a blood lead level

748
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,627
80 micrograms per deciliter.

749
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:29,628
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin,

750
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:30,629
confirmed lead poisoning.

751
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:31,630
I was just sleeping

752
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:32,831
in that old building at night.

753
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:33,866
I didn't care

754
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,601
they was fixing it
up during the day.

755
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,652
Dust from the renovations.

756
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:37,886
Full of lead.

757
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,488
Didn't think I needed
validation on this one.

758
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,706
I called Medicine.
They're admitting him.

759
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,574
You seen Doug?

760
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:44,175
He's still got that
birthday boy in 1.

761
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,176
The llama bite?

762
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,211
Mm-hm.

763
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,579
He's out talking to his dad.

764
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,531
Probably, he'll never come back.

765
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,116
Have you seen Benton?

766
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,117
He's looking for you

767
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,118
to check on some patients.

768
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:55,287
I can't right now.

769
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,855
There's an arm lac in 6,

770
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,190
rule out appendicitis in 3,

771
00:24:58,214 --> 00:24:59,791
and Dr. Lewis
wanted to talk to you

772
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:00,792
about that girl, Angel.

773
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:03,062
She split AMA.

774
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,453
Uh, I can't deal with
those right now, Jerry.

775
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,767
Whew. Oh, man...

776
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:12,894
You!

777
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,525
You tell me!

778
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,726
What the hell are you doing?

779
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,711
They're wine coolers.

780
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,813
They're really good.
You want some?

781
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:23,264
Oof!

782
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,551
I fell.

783
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:26,952
You fell.

784
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:28,753
Couldn't be because you
were drunk again, could it?

785
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,572
Hey, man, you leave her alone...

786
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,208
Get up.
- -there's
nothing wrong...

787
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,475
Get up! Nathan, make him stop.

788
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,492
Carter...

789
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:35,678
You guys are the
ones who won't stop.

790
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,879
You're sick, and you get drunk,

791
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:38,681
and you both
rip out your I.V.'s.

792
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:39,681
Carter, that's enough.

793
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,716
What's the matter with you?

794
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,917
Oh, man, look what you did.

795
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:44,119
Look what I did?
Look what I did?

796
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,871
Carter, out of here.
Out of here now!

797
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:46,872
Okay, you, back in bed.

798
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:47,990
He made her cry, man.

799
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,592
Haleh, can you help
Angel out of here?

800
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,534
Come on, back in bed. Now.

801
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:04,022
So what's going on?

802
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:05,224
You saw what was going on.

803
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,768
No, not with them, with you.

804
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,697
These people come in
here on drugs and booze,

805
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:12,898
and they don't listen to us,

806
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:14,099
and we're supposed
to treat them.

807
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:15,100
We're supposed to treat them.

808
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:16,434
What good is it?

809
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,236
Tomorrow, they're going
to be back on the street

810
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,738
doing the same thing.

811
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:21,874
Day after that they're back in
here doing the same thing to us.

812
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:23,609
Well, that's what the job is.

813
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,810
If you don't like them needy...

814
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:25,878
I don't like the abuse.

815
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:26,979
Well, none of us do.

816
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,914
Well, at least
you're used to it...

817
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:30,621
with... your sister.

818
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,772
You know, when
you first got here,

819
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,408
we were a little
concerned about you.

820
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,711
You seemed to care too much.

821
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,695
We're not worried
about that anymore.

822
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:49,156
What happened to you, Carter?

823
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:54,756
Loretta... Hi, Dr. Greene.

824
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,757
How you been?

825
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,059
We've been looking for you.

826
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,860
Jimmy was dying to
see <i>The Lion King</i> again.

827
00:26:58,884 --> 00:26:59,962
No, I wasn't.

828
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,563
How about some ice
cream in the cafeteria?

829
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,947
I was just going on a break.

830
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,699
It's a little cold
for ice cream.

831
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,202
Hot chocolate?

832
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,637
Oh, I couldn't hear you.

833
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,172
Thank you.

834
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,173
We need to talk.

835
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:12,563
Exam 1?

836
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,194
Conni...

837
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,595
Could you take
Loretta to Exam 1?

838
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,613
Sure.

839
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,736
Thanks.

840
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:24,002
How'd he do it?

841
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,003
Playing soccer.

842
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,738
I thought you said he was 60.

843
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,873
With his grandchildren.

844
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,076
There's a large joint effusion.

845
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,544
I'll do an arthrocentesis.

846
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,081
Tell him to stick
to the sidelines.

847
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:37,583
Do you have another minute?

848
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:40,285
Certainly.

849
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:42,254
Dr. Vucelich is telling people

850
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:44,223
that I left the study.

851
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,024
I wasn't sure you'd
want to talk about it.

852
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,792
I didn't exactly leave.

853
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:50,862
Oh, Carl's very discreet.

854
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,264
He didn't think it
would look good

855
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:54,633
that he had to
fire his star pupil.

856
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:56,468
Is that what he said?

857
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:58,704
I believe the euphemism was

858
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:01,573
"we're experiencing
a difference in style."

859
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:04,065
Hell, I'd have just fired you.

860
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:08,646
Our differences had
to do with the data...

861
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,048
Who's left in,
and who's left out.

862
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:13,251
Well, that's a matter
of interpretation.

863
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,319
It's his research study.

864
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:17,021
He did get the
grant on the strength

865
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:19,091
of his reputation and
accomplishments.

866
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,881
Do you know how much money
he brings into this hospital?

867
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,749
If you've had a
disagreement with Vucelich,

868
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:27,850
I suggest you
retreat immediately

869
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,985
and apologize.

870
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,708
It wasn't a disagreement.

871
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:38,042
Peter, you have the arrogance
of a great surgeon, the ego,

872
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:40,279
and someday, one
hopes, the talent,

873
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,947
but what you don't have
is the ability to get along,

874
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,138
to be a member of the team.

875
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:48,787
Once you're a Carl
Vucelich, you don't need that,

876
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,931
but you can't be a
Carl Vucelich without it.

877
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:56,794
Here you go, Joseph.

878
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,997
I'll give your dad another call.

879
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:00,798
Mark, you got a minute?

880
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,799
Someone check out that bite?

881
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,867
Yeah, it's okay,

882
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,469
but he could use
someone to talk to.

883
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,903
His dad was supposed to be here

884
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,038
two hours ago.

885
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:08,228
Sure. In a few minutes.

886
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,530
Please, sit down.

887
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,132
I have some difficult news.

888
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,316
Yeah. I've been tired,

889
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,819
but what do you expect
from an old hooker?

890
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,722
The new job's going great,
kids are doing well at school.

891
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:25,095
Everything's good, Dr. Greene.

892
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:31,630
Your biopsy last time was
positive for cervical cancer.

893
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:34,832
It's stage 1-B,

894
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,034
which is relatively early

895
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,421
in the spread of the disease,

896
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,623
although, that can
only be confirmed

897
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,326
through surgery.

898
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,263
Treatment is
radical hysterectomy

899
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,966
with removal of the
uterus and cervix.

900
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,059
Sometimes, radiation
therapy is done.

901
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,646
Statistics show with treatment,

902
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,997
the five-year survival rate

903
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,888
is over 90%.

904
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:14,406
Five years...

905
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,697
My kids won't even be teenagers.

906
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,904
Mr. Rubadoux...

907
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,768
I'm very sorry about your wife.

908
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,693
I made a mistake.

909
00:32:14,717 --> 00:32:17,529
Not in the way I
treated her, but...

910
00:32:17,553 --> 00:32:18,785
in the way I treated you.

911
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,642
I wasn't honest. Wasn't fair.

912
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:30,274
I was wrong...

913
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:31,982
and I'm very, very sorry.

914
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:39,156
This day isn't about
you, Mr. Carter.

915
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,159
How's Angel?

916
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:22,160
She's still asleep.

917
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:24,629
Are you kicking us out now?

918
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:27,682
Mm. Not quite yet.

919
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:32,470
Oh, God, I gotta
stop this, you know.

920
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:35,473
Angel's better at it.

921
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:39,211
She can stop drinking
for a while, you know,

922
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:42,880
but I just drag
her right back in.

923
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:44,787
I don't know why she stays.

924
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:51,440
Nathan, there's something
that Angel's scared to tell you,

925
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:55,009
but it's something that I
think you have a right to know.

926
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,033
She has AIDS.

927
00:33:57,153 --> 00:33:59,898
She has AIDS?

928
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:01,048
You mean, the whole thing?

929
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,841
Yes, which means
you could have it, too.

930
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,244
Have you ever been tested?

931
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,361
But could I have
given it to her,

932
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,905
or could she have
given it to me?

933
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,739
Well, if you test positive,
there's no way to know.

934
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:29,928
Loretta needs a little time

935
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:30,929
to let it settle in.

936
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:32,363
Is she going to
have the surgery?

937
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:33,498
Yeah. She's just worried

938
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,900
about who's going
to take her kids

939
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:36,501
for five days.

940
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,570
Al and I can take them.

941
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:39,938
He thinks, after we get married,

942
00:34:39,962 --> 00:34:41,506
we should adopt three or four.

943
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,263
This'll get him off that kick.

944
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,244
Where have you been?

945
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:47,946
On the longest walk known to man

946
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,247
and I'm freezing.

947
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:50,916
Start the margaritas in an hour.

948
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,818
Mark, thank you,
and thank Susan,

949
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,553
but I'm gonna have to pass.

950
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:56,455
Things went that well
with your dad, huh?

951
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:58,389
No, that was fine.
Same old thing.

952
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:00,224
He just wanted to
borrow 100 bucks.

953
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:02,193
Llama birthday
boy is still here.

954
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,194
What?

955
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:04,395
Bite's been treated,

956
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:06,465
but his father is running late.

957
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:08,099
Joseph?

958
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:10,769
Hey, how's the arm?

959
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:11,770
Did you know

960
00:35:11,794 --> 00:35:13,188
that you are my first llama bite

961
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:17,992
in my entire pediatric career?

962
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,195
Which makes this
a very special day.

963
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,897
Also because it happens
to be my birthday.

964
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,598
I hate my birthday.

965
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,100
Yeah, me too.

966
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,117
My dad's always late.

967
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:29,538
So's mine.

968
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,339
He gave me a trip to that zoo,
and then he didn't even come.

969
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,441
Mm...

970
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,009
What did you get?

971
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:38,512
Uh... I got a card,

972
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,747
and I got, and I got...

973
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,586
I got two tickets
to the Bulls game.

974
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,424
All right, get this.

975
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:52,928
There are some
brownies in the refrigerator

976
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:54,229
in the lounge.

977
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:57,365
They are not birthday
cake, and they are not mine,

978
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,766
but I think we
should steal them.

979
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,768
Yeah?

980
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,357
Yup. Yup.

981
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,542
Peter...

982
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,012
I'm sorry we couldn't
meet in my office.

983
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:12,179
I can't get rid

984
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,214
of that endarterectomy team

985
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:15,316
from Philadelphia.

986
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,886
I, uh...

987
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,688
I went over the charts again.

988
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,689
All of them.

989
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,626
Well, I can see
that spending a day

990
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,827
thinking about this
hasn't helped you,

991
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,844
so let's stop right here.

992
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:29,447
Agree to disagree,
and you can move on.

993
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:30,698
Apparently, I already have.

994
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,183
Oh, I didn't fire you.

995
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,018
I just let people
know that you quit.

996
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,587
Which I hadn't.

997
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,144
Well, I thought you needed
help making that decision.

998
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,293
I don't understand.

999
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:43,561
At least three of those patients

1000
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,196
should not have been
excluded from the study.

1001
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,782
I determine who's
in and who's out.

1002
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:52,353
I thought the protocol
determined that.

1003
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,721
If you're manipulating the data,

1004
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,840
how can the study be valid?

1005
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:58,209
How dare you question me?

1006
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:00,077
I give you the
opportunity of a lifetime,

1007
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:02,714
and you have the temerity
to challenge my reputation.

1008
00:37:02,738 --> 00:37:04,315
The results won't be accurate.

1009
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,816
Aren't lives at stake here?

1010
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,035
Yes, Peter, lives are at stake,

1011
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,986
lives that I save.

1012
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,022
Mothers, fathers,
grandparents are living

1013
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:12,390
because I made choices.

1014
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:15,081
I risked everything to
do what I know is right.

1015
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,646
The rules are
there for a reason.

1016
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,081
Grow up, Peter.

1017
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,683
You aren't some junior
chemist at the FDA.

1018
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,017
You're a surgical Resident

1019
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,552
in a struggling county hospital.

1020
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,687
Now, how do you think

1021
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,022
money comes into this place?

1022
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:29,224
Takes more than a "please,"

1023
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,226
and, "I promise to do
what's right for my country."

1024
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,427
It takes results,

1025
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,331
and that, at any cost,
is what I produce.

1026
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:38,599
Now, you screw with that,

1027
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,101
and you will be
off surgical service

1028
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,225
for a hell of a lot
longer than one day.

1029
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:00,505
Boy, when they made you stupid,

1030
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:05,142
they made you really stupid.

1031
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,377
That's the only funny thing

1032
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,001
I've heard all day.

1033
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:11,716
I'm going to die,

1034
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,917
and you're going to tell me

1035
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:14,385
I should give these up.

1036
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:16,987
Actually, the cold's
doing more damage.

1037
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:20,991
You do have pneumonia.

1038
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:22,575
Maybe quicker's better.

1039
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:26,954
I told Nathan.

1040
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,236
I know it's illegal,
but I did it anyway.

1041
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,205
He's really worried about you.

1042
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,740
He's worried

1043
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:37,759
that maybe he gave it to you.

1044
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:43,264
He wants to go
through this together.

1045
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,265
Yeah.

1046
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,522
Sure. If he has it...

1047
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,795
but if he's clean,
and I'm sick...

1048
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,843
why is he gonna
want to stick around?

1049
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,867
Which option are you hoping for?

1050
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:10,808
It's cold out here.

1051
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:16,068
I'm gonna go inside.

1052
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,189
Sorry about this.

1053
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:27,831
The dean's staff meetings
usually don't take this long.

1054
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,278
That's okay.

1055
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:33,397
Does the dean know
what it's regarding?

1056
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:34,933
No, he doesn't.

1057
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,806
Hmm.

1058
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,074
Yes?

1059
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:44,430
Of course.

1060
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,812
It'll just be another
minute or two.

1061
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:18,576
I don't know,

1062
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,378
I just really think I've
turned into a cliche.

1063
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:21,379
Don't do this, Mark.

1064
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:22,380
Yeah, I mean,

1065
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:23,581
don't you think I've got that

1066
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:25,183
guy-about-to-be-divorced look

1067
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,384
all over me?

1068
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:27,585
I mean, here I am,

1069
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:30,054
in a very attractive,
single woman's apartment

1070
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:32,823
drinking like I'm
still in my 20's,

1071
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:37,395
with a brand-new,
used motorcycle.

1072
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:39,297
You are a guy
about to be divorced.

1073
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:41,099
Yeah, but I don't
have to act like one.

1074
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:44,068
Here. Try this.

1075
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:45,769
Mmm.

1076
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,873
Not as good as the first,
better than the second.

1077
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,341
Does it matter?

1078
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,742
People at work are
making up stories

1079
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:52,876
about you anyway.

1080
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,545
About us, you mean.

1081
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:55,913
Mm...

1082
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:59,484
Yeah, and what is
that, can I ask you?

1083
00:40:59,508 --> 00:41:00,884
My car's in the shop.

1084
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:03,187
I drop Susie off at my parents',

1085
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,022
meet up with you to
go tequila shopping,

1086
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,023
and all of a sudden,

1087
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,326
we're having a torrid affair.

1088
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,427
Who said it was torrid?

1089
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:14,632
No one. I'm just
assuming it would be.

1090
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:15,766
That's not what I meant.

1091
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,735
That's okay. I know
what you meant.

1092
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:20,971
I'm sure it would be, too.

1093
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:24,164
Why wouldn't it be?

1094
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:26,999
No reason at all.

1095
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:34,788
There's not enough lime in this.

1096
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,679
Hey, bro.

1097
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:46,814
Hey, what's up, Walt?

1098
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,750
Same old thing.

1099
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,652
What happened?

1100
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,556
You look like you
lost your tenth patient.

1101
00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:02,663
I don't know, man...

1102
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:08,669
I don't know.

1103
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,471
I'm off that research
study I told you about.

1104
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,673
Thought the main man loved you.

1105
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,442
Yeah, well, he was
breaking some rules,

1106
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,427
and I called him on it.

1107
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,544
Were you right?

1108
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,981
I just thought it'd
be different, man.

1109
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:23,117
I mean, the work we were
doing, where I was going.

1110
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:24,802
Different from what?

1111
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:28,373
Different from everything
that got me here.

1112
00:42:28,397 --> 00:42:30,007
You know, scratching my
way through med school,

1113
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,976
playing this game and that game,

1114
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,778
and I just, you know,

1115
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:38,015
you angle for the best
Residency no matter what, and...

1116
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,052
Whew!

1117
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:44,154
You did what you had to do.

1118
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:46,991
What we all have
to do every day.

1119
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:48,793
Yeah, so why do
we keep on doing it?

1120
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,161
Well, that's up to you, man.

1121
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:52,229
The world doesn't change

1122
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:53,813
just because you're
moving up in it.

1123
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:04,758
I went to the dean to, uh,
tell him what was going on,

1124
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,462
and, uh, I don't know,
I waited around...

1125
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:09,519
20 minutes, and I left.

1126
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:17,405
I just left.

1127
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,374
You know, I'm stupid
enough to ruin my career,

1128
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:25,746
but I don't even
have the... courage...

1129
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,282
to do it the right way.

1130
00:43:37,516 --> 00:43:40,561
You don't understand, Walt. I...

1131
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:45,183
I always thought
when the time came...

1132
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,306
I'd do the right thing.

1133
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:59,012
That's...

1134
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,704
Hey...
