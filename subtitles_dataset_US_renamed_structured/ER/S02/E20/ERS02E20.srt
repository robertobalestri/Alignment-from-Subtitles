1
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,688
<i>There's a blown water
heater at a residential location.</i>

2
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:15,242
<i>Southeast corner
of Gaze and Throup.</i>

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,128
Copy that. Unit 47 will
respond in about five.

4
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,330
All right, everyone
wears rubber boots.

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,582
Find Carol that extra pair.

6
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,883
Hey, I thought the idea was

7
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:25,702
that you guys respond to
emergencies, not cause them.

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,019
Hang on, hang on.

9
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,955
We gotta pay you nurses back.

10
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:31,174
Every time an MICN rides
along, we get double the calls.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,859
Come on, Riley,
you're gonna jinx us.

12
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,060
Shep!

13
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,814
This is unit 47 en route.

14
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,349
<i>Copy, 47.</i>

15
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,171
Uh-huh.

16
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,173
<i>Ross?</i> This is Ross.

17
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:48,441
<i>Doesn't sound like...</i>

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,846
No, Doug Ross. Ray's
away on business.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,181
Let me... let me, uh,

20
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:57,216
let me give you somebody
who can answer that.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,018
Here.

22
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:03,812
<i>Hello. Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,349
This is Karen Hines.

24
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,398
Oh, hi, Andy.

25
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:15,602
Uh, yeah. How, how
are the marlin running?

26
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:17,103
Oh, no kidding?

27
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:21,908
I... I thought you had fished
out every key south of Largo.

28
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:25,412
So, Andy, Ray
isn't there with you?

29
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:28,448
Oh, well, I guess he must
have gotten distracted

30
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:30,472
in the Caymans.

31
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,488
That's nice.

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,824
Yeah, yeah, you just tell
him he's got to call Chicago

33
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,091
when he gets in.

34
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,750
Yeah. Yeah, we miss him up here.

35
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:47,600
You know...

36
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,270
You are a good liar.

37
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:52,672
I wasn't lying.

38
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,208
I wasn't. I do miss Ray.

39
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:56,909
He's a kick.

40
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,667
He's a dying breed.

41
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,985
Oh, man, this is
really perverse.

42
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,822
Oh, hey, it's not like your
dad and I are going steady,

43
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,966
so let's just minimize
this Oedipus stuff.

44
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,218
You want to call in sick,

45
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,552
rent a Jackie Chan movie?

46
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,021
No, it doesn't work that way.

47
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,622
You could meet
me for a late lunch

48
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,058
around 4:00 is
what you could do.

49
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,994
I hate hospitals.

50
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,332
How do you feel about diners?

51
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,767
There's one across the street.

52
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,068
You could meet me there.

53
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,005
Uh-huh. A real diner?

54
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,841
Meatloaf, ketchup on the table.

55
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,133
You've seduced women
before, haven't you?

56
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,599
She's down here somewhere!

57
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:55,118
It just blew up!

58
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,820
Becky girl?

59
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,754
Your water heater was here

60
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,023
and your daughter's
bed was there?

61
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,824
Oh, my God.

62
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,693
Please, sir. Please.
You have to step away.

63
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,495
You shouldn't be down
here with bare feet. Please.

64
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,629
It's still standing water.

65
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,431
I told you we needed a new one.

66
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,733
We couldn't afford it.

67
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,369
But we can afford a
case of bourbon a week.

68
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,686
Would you just shut up!

69
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,488
Riley, go get backup,
all right? I got it.

70
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,190
It was making noises all week.

71
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,457
Why don't you just shut up!

72
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,195
All right, listen,
just take it easy!

73
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,396
What color pajamas
is she wearing?

74
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,315
Pink. Look for the color.

75
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,650
All right, when
was the explosion?

76
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,734
10 minutes...

77
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,853
Backup's on the way!

78
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,520
I found a foot!

79
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,755
All right. Yeah, here.

80
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,907
All right, take it easy.

81
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,975
Not too close. Not
too close. Easy.

82
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,195
Find her head!

83
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,396
Gently.

84
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,731
All right, let's go.
Gently. All right.

85
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,932
Let's roll her. Get the board.

86
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,000
Right.

87
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,024
One, two, three.

88
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,695
Oh, God.

89
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,910
Weak pulse. Breath sounds?

90
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,879
Oh, my God, she's not breathing!

91
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,180
Riley, get an ET tube.

92
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,347
Are you with us, Riley?

93
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,817
Yeah, yeah! Come on, come on.

94
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,851
Shoot!

95
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:02,852
For crying out loud!

96
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,921
I got another one! Come on!

97
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,062
Here, here! She's got it.

98
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,784
Oh, thank God!

99
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,253
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

100
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:22,588
Okay, darling, you're
going to be just fine.

101
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,541
Let's wrap her up.

102
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,409
Let's get her up.
One, two, three.

103
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,843
Easy, easy. Okay.

104
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,911
Give me the oxygen mask.

105
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,145
Sweetie...

106
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,147
Okay, sweetie, this is going
to help you breathe, okay?

107
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,967
Let's get outta here.

108
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,568
Are you taking
her to the hospital?

109
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:36,569
County.

110
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:37,721
Is she gonna be okay?

111
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,322
We're going to make
sure at the hospital.

112
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,391
Uh... I'm coming too.

113
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,025
I'll get dressed.

114
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,093
Gotta find your own transport.

115
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,117
The ambulance is full.

116
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:47,597
We can make room.

117
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,399
Forget it.

118
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,534
I'm not letting these
idiots into my rig.

119
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:52,935
It's the girl's mother.

120
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,170
Yeah, you heard her.

121
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,572
They knew the
heater was a hazard,

122
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,307
and they got a
kid living near it.

123
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,075
They're too drunk to notice.

124
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,643
Okay...

125
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,400
Stupid people shouldn't breed.

126
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,459
Morning.

127
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,460
Oh, morning.

128
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,962
How's it going? Going.

129
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,463
Man, did you
see all that traffic

130
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,464
this morning?

131
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,966
I took the El today as usual.

132
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,733
I didn't think you
were working today.

133
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,135
Oh, yeah, well, I got called in.

134
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,154
It's just as well.

135
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,357
How did it go last night?
I was thinking about you.

136
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,442
Uh, yeah, thanks. I
got your message.

137
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,186
I'll fill you in later.

138
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:57,850
Susan...

139
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,253
Glad you could fill in

140
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,389
on such short notice.

141
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:03,790
No problem.

142
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:07,293
You'll be able to go home by 4.

143
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:09,083
I can do a full 12.

144
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,849
Okay, let's get a CBC,
Chem-7, a heel stick...

145
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:04,884
Heel stick, a glucose.

146
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,386
I said that already? Twice.

147
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,054
Lip lac in 3.
Looks like stitches.

148
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,055
Oh. I'll get it.

149
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,056
Sure you can handle another?

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,123
Yup.

151
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:12,858
Mark, were you looking for me?

152
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,894
Morgenstern wants
to see us upstairs.

153
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:15,895
Did he say why?

154
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,929
Something wrong?

155
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:18,698
No, but it's May the 2nd,

156
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:20,533
so it could be the announcement.

157
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,034
Announcement?

158
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,503
Resident of the Year...

159
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,238
Not that I'm expecting it.

160
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:27,207
Emergency medicine
always gets overlooked.

161
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,408
Oh, yeah. Resident of the year.

162
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:30,076
Did I remember to
put your name in?

163
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,311
I did.

164
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,712
Doesn't he make the
announcement in June?

165
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:33,946
First of May.

166
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,748
So do you think you're
gonna need me today?

167
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,750
The reason I'm asking
is, if you don't need me,

168
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,219
and there's nothing
on the schedule,

169
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,753
Simon got me in

170
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,388
to assist on a breast
reconstruction at 10,

171
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:44,390
which is a procedure
that I haven't done yet.

172
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,559
Somebody page me?
Dr. Ross, Trauma 1.

173
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,561
Hey, I hear you're doing
a OB rotation at Parkland?

174
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:49,795
I fly to Dallas on Friday.

175
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,997
I want to talk to you
before you leave, all right?

176
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,016
I'm here.

177
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,918
Where's Ross?

178
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,186
Went out to meet the paramedics.

179
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,586
Got a little girl in bad shape.

180
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,688
Dr. Benton...

181
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,122
since a lot of surgeons
have mentioned

182
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,724
that an elective in
plastics can't hurt...

183
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,526
Oh, plastics. The
beautiful people's specialty.

184
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,727
I thought I'd check it out.

185
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,728
Well, go on. Go. Go.

186
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,730
You sure? Yeah.

187
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,754
Thank you. Thank you!

188
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,467
I got your page.

189
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,802
Yeah. On this
lovely May morning,

190
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,337
we have a 6-year-old girl

191
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,972
exhumed from two feet of rubble.

192
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,173
Respiratory arrest.

193
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,975
Resuscitated on the scene.

194
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,076
BP 90/60.

195
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,077
Thanks for calling me early.

196
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,462
Just protecting myself.

197
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:24,163
If we're going to
be working together,

198
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,199
I'll make sure that
you're on board

199
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:28,201
from the very beginning.

200
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,269
He must have been
wearing a big ring.

201
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,205
Yeah. This could
take a few stitches.

202
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,473
Will there be a scar?

203
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:35,108
Well, there could be
at the vermilion border

204
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,809
where the lip meets the skin.

205
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,112
Do you want me to
call a plastic surgeon?

206
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:41,147
Not that I'll be
staring in the mirror,

207
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,382
but my boyfriend says
I have a pretty face.

208
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:44,783
You do.

209
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,367
Somebody's mighty
low to be mugging you.

210
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,289
Honey, three times in two years.

211
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,291
They think the blind
are an easy target.

212
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,093
Well, I think you
set this one straight.

213
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,730
That self-defense course
was worth every penny.

214
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:00,333
The cane worked like a charm.

215
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:03,469
Radared in on his balls.

216
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:04,570
Bam! Bull's-eye!

217
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,222
He let go of your purse, did he?

218
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,294
Wouldn't you?

219
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,061
What's that, Ms. Crandle?

220
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,930
Tip of his pinkie.

221
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,032
You bit his finger off?

222
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,700
Well, if the police
don't need it

223
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,792
for evidence, I want
it for a souvenir.

224
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,257
I want mommy!

225
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,876
Shh, she'll be here
in a minute, sweetie.

226
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,544
C-spine is clear.

227
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,579
Let's get that collar off.

228
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,813
No pneumo.

229
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,148
All right. DPL's negative.

230
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,767
Crit's normal. No
internal bleeding.

231
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,785
Becky...

232
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,053
you're one lucky little girl.

233
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,254
Good work in the field, 47.

234
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,790
Lucky Carol was with us.

235
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,091
It was very scary,

236
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,477
but you are a brave little girl.

237
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,645
Where's my mommy?

238
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,246
She'll be here any minute.

239
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,264
All right, hold on.

240
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,665
We've got a bulge in the groin.

241
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,868
Where? There.

242
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,436
Reducible hernia?

243
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,338
Incarcerated.

244
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,522
Probably caused by increased
intra-abdominal pressure.

245
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:57,523
From the trauma?

246
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,058
Mm-hm. Let's get
her up to Surgery.

247
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,076
Becky, tell you what,

248
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,011
you're gonna be fine.

249
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,447
Dr. Benton, here, is gonna
fix you right up, okay?

250
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,482
And as soon as your
mommy and daddy get here,

251
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,284
I'm going to bring
them up to see you.

252
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,253
Gosh, no. Sorry to disappoint.

253
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,587
Don't they announce
that in June?

254
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,588
No. First of May.

255
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,990
Doesn't matter.
It was a long shot.

256
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,591
No. I called the two of you up

257
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,893
to start a conversation

258
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,161
about next year's
Chief Resident.

259
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,428
Good idea.

260
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,529
Hope you don't mind me

261
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,530
including Kerry in
this conversation.

262
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,982
Not at all.

263
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:26,386
She's one of the strongest
Chiefs we've had in years.

264
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,771
You did a fine job
for us also, Mark.

265
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,139
I thought Kerry and you

266
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,608
could make this
a mutual decision.

267
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,777
Susan Lewis would
be my first choice.

268
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,012
Before we discuss
specific candidates,

269
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,346
we ought to brainstorm

270
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,148
about what qualities
we'd see in an ideal chief.

271
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,617
Makes sense.

272
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,119
An ER chief needs
to be focused in crisis.

273
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,120
Exactly.

274
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,221
A leader in the ER

275
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,405
needs to cut to the chase,

276
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,406
assume the worst.

277
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,407
Right. Don't you think

278
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,414
Susan Lewis has that quality?

279
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,429
I think Kerry's right.

280
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,998
Let's not try to
solve this today.

281
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,702
Let's just start
the ball rolling.

282
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,423
Carter, glad I caught you.

283
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:04,891
Yes, I was just about to assist

284
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,626
on my first breast
reconstruction.

285
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,161
Well, I'm afraid you aren't.

286
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:10,396
Why?

287
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,997
Did you call the
registrar's office

288
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,833
requesting a review
of your transcript?

289
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:14,901
I wanted to verify

290
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,268
that I'm graduating with honors.

291
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,970
They discovered when
they pulled your records

292
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,539
that you're deficient in
ambulatory medicine.

293
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,606
What?

294
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,941
You can't graduate
without seeing

295
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:24,610
the required number
of Pedes patients.

296
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:25,945
What?

297
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,112
Luckily...

298
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:28,731
Doug Ross is
willing to take you on

299
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,882
for the next four weeks.

300
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,483
I was hoping for an
elective in plastics.

301
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:32,502
Good news is,

302
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,970
if you start this morning,

303
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,838
you have the time to
complete this remedial work

304
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,023
and graduate with
the rest of your class.

305
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,998
Dr. Ross is expecting you.

306
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,631
Yeah, and I want that
consult down here stat.

307
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,200
Susan, did you just say "stat"?

308
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:48,334
Yeah, and I mean it.

309
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:49,502
Oh, look who's here!

310
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:50,520
Isn't she precious?

311
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,856
She looks just like her mommy.

312
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,424
Will she let me hold her?

313
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,459
Oh, I hope so.

314
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,594
My arm's about to fall off.

315
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,230
Hello! Hello!

316
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,231
So tiny!

317
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,633
Hello, baby. Hello.

318
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,668
Nice outfit.

319
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,103
I think so.

320
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,554
Hey, it's Randiwear, right?

321
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:09,578
Aw...

322
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,351
Susan, code.

323
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,786
What do you got?

324
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,971
A woman passed
out in a crosswalk.

325
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,674
GCS 10 in the field.
She's coming around.

326
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,965
Okay. Trauma 1.

327
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:34,864
Ma'am? Ma'am? Do
you know where you are?

328
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,164
Uh-huh. All right.

329
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,868
Let's move her
on a count of three.

330
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,603
One...

331
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,704
two...

332
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,272
three.

333
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,973
Get a glucose.

334
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,643
Look she's
hypertensive. 170/120.

335
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,413
Titrate a Nipride drip
to a diastolic of 100.

336
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,948
Ma'am, do you have a
history of high blood pressure?

337
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,584
Oh, no! Not again.

338
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,085
Okay, okay, okay, try and relax.

339
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,637
Her name is Joanne Bairos.

340
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,640
Joanne, we're going to try
and lower your blood pressure.

341
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:01,857
Has this happened before?

342
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,509
I don't wanna lose
this baby! Not again.

343
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,744
You're pregnant? Yeah.

344
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:05,762
How far along?

345
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,698
Um, 20... No, no. 21 weeks.

346
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,699
Okay, cancel the Nipride.

347
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,700
Give her 10 of Hydralazine.

348
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,701
Call OB.

349
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,369
You lost an earlier baby?

350
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,723
Last year in the sixth month.

351
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,826
Oh, God, I can't live
through this again.

352
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,296
Okay, hook her up to the
fetal monitor and an EKG.

353
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,564
Did you have
preeclampsia before?

354
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:26,783
Do you remember?

355
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,385
They said it was
high blood pressure.

356
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,787
It made my placenta tear,

357
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,789
and if they didn't take
the baby out, I'd die.

358
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,890
I see.

359
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,942
My baby was too little.

360
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,027
She couldn't live.

361
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,178
BP is rising. 180/130.

362
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:41,964
Add Propranolol.

363
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,016
Who's on call for OB? Dr. Croix.

364
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,469
But it's not the baby's fault.

365
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,505
Your hypertension is probably
related to the pregnancy.

366
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,474
No, no, but I've
been dizzy sometimes

367
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,524
in between the pregnancies.

368
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,192
You have?

369
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,794
Yes.

370
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:56,813
What's the fetal heart rate?

371
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,365
145. Good variability.

372
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,188
Please, don't let them take her.

373
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,470
Susan, shouldn't we
be moving her up?

374
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:06,189
No. I'm going to do
an ultrasound first.

375
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,425
Her BP's 190/140.

376
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,693
The fetus isn't in distress.

377
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,061
I want an ultrasound first.

378
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,830
What are you doing?

379
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,254
Trying to save your baby.

380
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,055
I don't know. I'll check it out.

381
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,090
Yeah, I heard
you. I'll check it out.

382
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,091
Told you they were mad.

383
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,326
Haleh, is that ultrasound

384
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,427
for the hypertensive patient

385
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,095
OB's screaming at me about?

386
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,564
Who the hell ordered that?

387
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,855
I'll take care of it.

388
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,326
Bring me up to speed.

389
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,194
Hypertensive woman
in her 21st week.

390
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,595
Fetal heart tones normal.

391
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,214
She responded to Hydralazine

392
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,215
and Propranolol.

393
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,233
What's the BP?

394
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,851
130/100.

395
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,852
She's stable for transfer.

396
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,253
Any contractions?

397
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,255
Some cramping,
nothing on the monitor.

398
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,040
It's preeclampsia.
Get her up to OB.

399
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,975
It's Susan's patient, Kerry.

400
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,294
Patient lost a
22-week fetus last year

401
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,295
to preeclampsia.

402
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,747
For goodness sake...

403
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,633
Complains of dizzy spells
and possible hypertension

404
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,867
between pregnancies.

405
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,936
Any protein in the urine?

406
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,170
Susan, if we've
learned anything...

407
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:13,605
Yes, yes, there.

408
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,259
Right there... mass in
the right adrenal gland.

409
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,860
Call the O.R. to
schedule a room.

410
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,395
You're right. Looks
like Conn's syndrome.

411
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,629
What does that mean?

412
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,431
You have a tumor
in your adrenal gland

413
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,100
producing a hormone,

414
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,501
which is making your
blood pressure rise.

415
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,169
It's very serious.

416
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,154
You'll probably need
surgery to remove the mass.

417
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,172
But the baby?

418
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,506
It should be okay.

419
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,908
Cancel OB, we're
going straight to Surgery.

420
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,142
Good call, Susan.

421
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,144
I think all of us would
have missed that one.

422
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,947
They could have done
the ultrasound up in OB.

423
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,147
Yeah, they aborted
her last time.

424
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,533
Let Surgery know
we're on the way.

425
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,352
Well, I think we've earned
ourselves a doughnut.

426
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,353
Anyone else want a Dinkle's?

427
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,337
They've got some inside.

428
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,660
Help yourself.

429
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,992
Could you bring me back one?

430
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,861
Yeah, you bet.

431
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:52,885
He's trying.

432
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,020
Now I'm supposed to eat
doughnuts with the guy?

433
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,534
It's not his fault
Raul died, Shep.

434
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,186
It's not your fault, either.

435
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,189
I know. I know
whose fault it is.

436
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,874
It's the fine,
upstanding, drugged-out

437
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,032
meth-burning citizens
we're here to serve.

438
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,102
That's who Raul died for.

439
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,869
Oh, you're kidding.

440
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,937
Yeah, that's what I heard...

441
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,339
Resident of the Year.

442
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:22,007
I guess it isn't a
personality contest, huh?

443
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:23,608
Do we have to go to the party?

444
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,044
There's gonna be cake.

445
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,111
Anyone seen Dr. Ross?

446
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,346
Check the lounge.

447
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,380
Ted, you're an attorney...

448
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,350
Never say "trust me."

449
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:33,519
So divorce wasn't slow
and complicated enough

450
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,054
with two parties
and two lawyers.

451
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,389
Now we have to get
a mediator involved.

452
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,690
I don't believe in divorce.

453
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,992
I always suspected you
were an old-fashioned girl.

454
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,528
Don't believe in
marriage, either.

455
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,729
Oh! Dr. Benton,
your highness, sir.

456
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,131
Dr. Bradley was looking for you.

457
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,232
When?

458
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,134
Just now. He said it
was regarding your letter

459
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,936
to the ethics committee.

460
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,159
Thanks.

461
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,293
I'm gonna need some help.

462
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,594
Loretta? Loretta, I got you.

463
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,863
I got you. I got you.

464
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,331
Clear Curtain Area 2, okay?

465
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,100
I got you.

466
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,868
All right.

467
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,403
So I don't pretend to be happy

468
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,404
about the situation,

469
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,943
but I'm gonna do
my best for you...

470
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,243
and I'm available at any hour.

471
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,229
She's not falling for the
guy with amnesia, is she?

472
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,897
Nah, she's faking.

473
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:19,965
Ever since she got possessed,

474
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:21,801
it's completely
changed her personality.

475
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,503
So do you need me
for anything right now?

476
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,472
Well, we'll see what comes in.

477
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:28,858
You're a fourth year,

478
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,426
so you're not going to
need a lot of hand-holding.

479
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,629
You're gonna get me out
on time, which works for me,

480
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,831
so just show up, hang
out, and you'll get an A.

481
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,756
<i>Something tells me that it
will change our lives forever.</i>

482
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,620
Whatever happened
to his brain tumor?

483
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,622
Oh, it was cured when
he was struck by lightning.

484
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,723
Oh.

485
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,313
It was not.

486
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,440
Watch out. He's gonna drug her.

487
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,217
<i>You ready?</i>

488
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,108
<i>I promise you.</i>

489
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,723
<i>You will not be disappointed.</i>

490
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,390
BP's 70/50.

491
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,558
Okay, let's get that EKG.

492
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,461
Does your father have a
history of heart problems?

493
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,712
Not before a few weeks ago.

494
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,313
He was having trouble
breathing breathing at night,

495
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,614
so he went to the clinic.

496
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,384
They said my heart wasn't
pumping hard enough.

497
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:14,219
Did they give you
any medications?

498
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:15,237
Oh, yeah, they did.

499
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,939
Here they are.

500
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,293
Danny, honey, no! I'm so sorry.

501
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,528
I'm really sorry.

502
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,029
What do we got?

503
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,465
Mr. Dellanova's complaining
of nausea and blurred vision.

504
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:28,317
Why don't you show
them to the waiting room?

505
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,518
When did he get this medicine?

506
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,108
Oh, on the 18th.

507
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,706
How's that EKG, Kerry?

508
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,074
Sinus brady with
second-degree AV block?

509
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,075
How'd you guess?

510
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,594
Yeah, he took way
too many tablets.

511
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,028
He should have
twice as many left.

512
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,614
Malik, get a dig
level. What is it?

513
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:43,531
Your father
overdosed on digoxin.

514
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,017
Is that serious?

515
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,019
Yeah, it can be, but
we've caught it in time.

516
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,521
Stand by with Digibind
or do you want a lavage?

517
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,828
It's all yours.

518
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:54,260
Dr. Bradley, you
were looking for me,

519
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,261
Dr. Benton.

520
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:57,429
Ah, yes. I'm sorry
it took so long

521
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:58,781
to respond to your letter.

522
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,183
Well, I, uh, I know
you're a busy man.

523
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,102
I gather you are too. Your
letter was dated April 23,

524
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:05,503
but you left
Dr. Vucelich's study

525
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:08,106
in early February?

526
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,325
That's true.

527
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,126
So it took you almost
three months to report

528
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,761
on what you yourself called

529
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,314
"an alarming disregard for
research study protocol?"

530
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,083
Well, I was hesitant
to make accusations

531
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:20,953
against Dr. Vucelich... I
mean, a man of his stature.

532
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:24,823
I believe that
caution is warranted.

533
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,425
Let me return your
letter to you now.

534
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,961
Uh... these claims are accurate.

535
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:29,995
Oh, I have no doubt

536
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:32,230
since they are reported
in the addendum

537
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,888
to Dr. Vucelich's study.

538
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,236
He's owning up to it?

539
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,438
Apparently, it was
always intended

540
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:40,839
to be part of the
published article.

541
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:43,976
When did Dr. Vucelich
add this addendum,

542
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,410
before or after
I sent the letter?

543
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,074
I wouldn't be able
to answer that.

544
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,829
Feeling better?

545
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:05,296
Some.

546
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,348
What happened?

547
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,950
You were dehydrated.

548
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:11,186
Oh. I couldn't keep
anything down.

549
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,555
Did your oncologist
prescribe Compazine?

550
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,990
No.

551
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,392
Did you tell him
about your symptoms?

552
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,961
I tried, but he's pretty busy.

553
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:23,232
I called about the burns,
and he never got back to me.

554
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,233
Radiation burns?

555
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,367
I thought it was something

556
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,451
that was supposed to happen,

557
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,954
but another woman
in the waiting room

558
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,539
says I shouldn't
be getting burned.

559
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,507
What's your
oncologist's name again?

560
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,592
Dr. Lyle Howard.

561
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:38,196
Look, my kids
are at a neighbor's.

562
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,231
Yeah.

563
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,699
Can they spend the night?

564
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:41,900
Yeah.

565
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:45,225
You're being
admitted. I'll stop back.

566
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,225
Mark, Susan just had
an interesting case,

567
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,726
but I can't convince her

568
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,928
to present it to the students.

569
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:53,929
There's not much to present.

570
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,898
Sure there is.

571
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,666
You all met my new
student, John Carter?

572
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,801
You're doing a Pedes rotation?

573
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,403
Never too late.

574
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,272
You're mighty chipper today.

575
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,374
Yes, I am. Thank you.

576
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,110
So, Mark, I was
trying to explain

577
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,445
that Susan needs
to think like a teacher,

578
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,615
explain how she
arrived at her diagnosis.

579
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,949
I don't know,

580
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,951
it just occurred to me
he took too many pills.

581
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,286
Oh, it's freezing in here.

582
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,087
I'm trying to impress on Susan

583
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,472
the importance of recognizing

584
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:21,907
a good opportunity

585
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,675
to augment her teaching files.

586
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,878
How did the patient present...

587
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:35,253
Oh, damn it!

588
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:36,277
Where are you?

589
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,618
Susan? Susan, what do you think?

590
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:52,259
I've got patients waiting.
I gotta get back to work.

591
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,441
Ah...

592
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:57,609
Ah...

593
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,877
All right. Okay, buddy.

594
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,279
You're not feeling
so great, huh?

595
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,280
What's his temperature?

596
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:02,281
103.

597
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:03,282
Okay, Carter,

598
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,083
this is a good
place for you to start.

599
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:06,318
Why don't you come get me

600
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:07,352
and present your findings.

601
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,920
No problem.

602
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:11,390
I'm going to listen
to your chest.

603
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,258
Okay, take a deep breath for me.

604
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,978
Oh, Dr. Ross, someone
named Karen called for you.

605
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,179
Any message?

606
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,981
Confirming lunch.

607
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,049
Oh, Karen's her name, huh?

608
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,050
Where'd you meet her?

609
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,274
We have a mutual acquaintance.

610
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,089
Did you ever get a
hold of that oncologist

611
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,657
Uh... Howard?

612
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,458
Secretary said he would
be tied up all afternoon.

613
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,493
Where is he?

614
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,128
Uh...

615
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,097
Upstairs...

616
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,232
number 701.

617
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,850
Mark...

618
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:39,990
do you have a second?

619
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,489
This is, uh, Jennifer, my, uh...

620
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:45,858
Soon-to-be ex-wife.

621
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:48,126
Hi. Randi.

622
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,763
You have a great
soon-to-be ex-husband.

623
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,953
Excuse me.

624
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,285
Where's Jerry?

625
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,320
Huh?

626
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,538
Oh, he... he's off today.

627
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:01,790
Is something wrong?

628
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,159
No. I was just in
town to see my lawyer.

629
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,160
You know, I don't know,

630
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,345
about an hour into the meeting,

631
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:08,831
I realized I'd spent $250.

632
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:11,200
It just seems so ridiculous.

633
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,620
I just... We've been making
decisions together for 15 years.

634
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,257
I just thought we
could get together and...

635
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,147
cut to the chase.

636
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:23,433
My shift ends at 8.

637
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,982
Great. I'll swing by then.

638
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,038
Yeah.

639
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,893
1033.

640
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,512
Great. Now what?

641
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:41,713
Has anyone called
for paramedics?

642
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:42,737
Hello?

643
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,605
My brother, he's shot.

644
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,076
This way.

645
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Stay close.

646
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,922
Whore!

647
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:04,603
One more word out of you,

648
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:06,205
and your pal can
fricking bleed to death

649
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:07,206
right where he is.

650
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,742
We're sorry. Please.

651
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,812
She's a nurse, and she works
every day saving your asses!

652
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,380
I'm okay, Shep.

653
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:17,404
I wish you would've
stayed in the rig.

654
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,179
I've spotted our customer.

655
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,434
Stand back, stand back.

656
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:33,031
He's barely breathing.

657
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,049
Time to practice again, Riley.

658
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,483
I've got it.

659
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,484
Weak pulse.

660
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,503
I'm gonna start an IV.

661
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,938
My God, how many
times was he shot?

662
00:24:39,962 --> 00:24:41,473
Is he dying? Don't let him die.

663
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,559
Step back! Just let me work!

664
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,561
Riley, go get the board.
We're gonna need the board.

665
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,513
Got it.

666
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:48,730
All right, IV's in, wide open.

667
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:49,765
You okay?

668
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,966
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

669
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,990
Back off!

670
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,794
Come on!

671
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,776
Take a deep breath.
You're doing fine.

672
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,977
Help him, man! Come on!

673
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:02,978
You gotta step back.

674
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:03,995
Help him!

675
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,536
Come on, man,
help him! Help him!

676
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,988
Stay off!

677
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,956
Hey! Take it easy, man.

678
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,241
Easy!

679
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,259
Hey, what happened?

680
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,948
Guy wouldn't back off.

681
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,995
He's out cold.

682
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,466
Good. Maybe now I can work.

683
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,102
So that's your diagnosis.
That the kid has the flu?

684
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,603
Viral syndrome.

685
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,505
I prescribed fever control
measures and fluids.

686
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,040
He's got a rash, conjunctivitis,

687
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,442
swollen glands.

688
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:34,709
How long's he had the fever?

689
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,378
His mom said about a week.

690
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,679
Fever of unknown origin

691
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,680
for seven days.

692
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,681
Did I miss something?

693
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,815
What color's his tongue?

694
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,816
Pink.

695
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,817
Not strawberry?

696
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,186
Uh, maybe. I'm not sure.

697
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,387
Did you notice his chapped lips?

698
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,388
Yeah.

699
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,622
All right, give him an aspirin

700
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,623
and order an echocardiogram.

701
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,691
Aspirin?

702
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,493
I thought you never
gave aspirin to a child.

703
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:52,494
Unless, of course,

704
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,495
he's diagnosed with Kawasaki's.

705
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,831
Kawasaki's. Um...

706
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:00,468
Kawasaki's is a cluster of
unremarkable symptoms

707
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,204
that can lead to
coronary aneurysm.

708
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,239
Fever, chapped lips,

709
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,841
and the strawberry
tongue are the tip-offs.

710
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,242
Admit the boy to the Pedes unit.

711
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,499
Right away.

712
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,282
Susan?

713
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,084
Susan, I thought you
went home at 4:00.

714
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,418
What, and miss the big party?

715
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,887
Yeah, yeah, I just heard.

716
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,122
Certainly my choice
for Resident of the Year.

717
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,525
So you're not
avoiding going home?

718
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,827
Well, there's that, too.

719
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,829
Look, do you want
to get a bite to eat

720
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,165
later on or something?

721
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,900
Damn, I just made plans.

722
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,551
I can cancel... No, no.

723
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:34,569
I... I'm fine.

724
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,737
Tomorrow?

725
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,661
Yeah, sure... well, we'll see.

726
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,978
Mr. Dellanova, you're
doing much better.

727
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,546
We're going to admit
you to CICU for follow-up.

728
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,216
Okay, I need your
John Hancock on this.

729
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,885
All these lines?

730
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,009
Just the one marked "Patient."

731
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,758
Uh...

732
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:57,792
Your father said

733
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,827
the overdose was an accident?

734
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,229
Oh, yes.

735
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,415
The dosage was right
there on the bottle.

736
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,251
My mom died a few months ago.

737
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:07,903
He misses her.

738
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:11,139
I've had to take
over doing his bills,

739
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,375
but that's just because
he hates paperwork.

740
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,176
He always has.

741
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,044
He's not the suicidal type.

742
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,430
And does he need
glasses for reading?

743
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,198
He's more of a TV-watcher.

744
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,399
Ma'am, if you'll come with me,

745
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:24,086
we'll get him admitted.

746
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,853
Pop, I'll be right back, okay?

747
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,690
Bye, sweetheart. All right.

748
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:32,927
Mr. Dellanova, do
you know my name?

749
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,030
I know I owe my life to you.

750
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:39,834
No, my name. I'm wearing it.

751
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:40,835
Can you read this?

752
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:45,940
Um... uh... doctor something.

753
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,748
I can't make out
the... the second part.

754
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:53,498
I'm Dr. Lewis...

755
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:55,823
and you need to tell your
daughter that you can't read.

756
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:01,622
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

757
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,281
I thought the clinic said
something about twice a day.

758
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,312
Then I thought

759
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:09,681
maybe it was two
pills each time.

760
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:12,489
Medications can be
tricky for a lot of reasons.

761
00:28:15,243 --> 00:28:19,457
I never wanted my kids to know.

762
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,594
I wanted them to...

763
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,596
to do school... right.

764
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,264
And you raised a good daughter,

765
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,838
and now you should
let her help you.

766
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,828
You want your kids not
to be ashamed of you.

767
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,082
You have children, right?

768
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,937
Uh, no. No, I don't.

769
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,908
Excuse me, it's been a bad day.

770
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:09,140
Yeah, stack it in the lounge
and put the cake in there too...

771
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,141
What's this?

772
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,142
Sparkling cider.

773
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,277
For some announcement thing.

774
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,079
Dr. Greene told
me to put it in there.

775
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:15,280
Don't tell him I saw it.

776
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:16,514
All right, Carter,

777
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,116
I'm going across the
street to grab lunch,

778
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,117
and I'm late,

779
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:20,718
so you page me if you need me,

780
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:21,719
and, Carter, if
you're wondering,

781
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:22,820
you do still need me.

782
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,744
I know. I will. Uh-huh.

783
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,942
Got a twofer.

784
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,244
Adolescent male
sprang a few leaks

785
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,045
when one of his homeboys
disapproved of his method

786
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,048
of tying twisties
on the baggies.

787
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,066
Guy on gurney two

788
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,167
fell down and went boom.

789
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,202
All right, I'm with Shep.

790
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:38,203
Carter, you take two!

791
00:29:38,227 --> 00:29:39,937
Haleh, get Benton
for me, please.

792
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,739
I'll join you in a
minute, Mr. Carter!

793
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,129
Okay.

794
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,861
All right, start
pumping the fluids.

795
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,463
Four units O-negative
on the rapid infuser.

796
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,399
BP's 40 palp.

797
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,167
Kid's Swiss cheese.
He's draining like a sieve.

798
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,168
I'll start a central line.

799
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,569
Get a CBC, Chem-20,
and chest films.

800
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,305
How old do you
think this kid is?

801
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,107
My guess is 14,
but look at the scars.

802
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,230
He's been around.

803
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:02,310
V-fib!

804
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,711
Let's shock him.

805
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,779
No, hang on. Move back.

806
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,197
Mmm.

807
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,198
Excuse me.

808
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,199
Just a second.

809
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,768
Ross called me?

810
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:10,792
Trauma 1.

811
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,209
He's not responding.

812
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,443
Thoracotomy tray.

813
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:19,895
Finally, Peter. I'll
check on Mr. Carter.

814
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,896
Number 10 blade, please.

815
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,963
Whoa, what is that,

816
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,364
an entrance wound
or an exit wound?

817
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,632
At this point, who can tell?

818
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,817
You want me to crack him?

819
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,819
No, I got it. There you go.

820
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:30,921
Rib spreader.

821
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,257
I'll break it for you.

822
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:34,325
Thanks.

823
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:35,760
Oh, what a mess.

824
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:37,562
Bullet must have
nicked the aorta.

825
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,948
Need some suction here, please.

826
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,349
Aorta's cross-clamped.

827
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,483
He's in fib!

828
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,619
Internal paddles!

829
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,563
Need another
three units, please.

830
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,013
Hang on. Give me 20.

831
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,296
Charging. Clear!

832
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,814
Again, 30.

833
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,133
Charging. Clear!

834
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,997
We've got a rhythm. Let's go!

835
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,539
Shooting!

836
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,008
Clear.

837
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,811
Okay, did you get an AP, a
lateral, and an open-mouth?

838
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:11,846
Once he clears his C-spine,

839
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,381
let's send him for a panorex.

840
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,283
No signs of
respiratory distress.

841
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,735
One million units Pen G.

842
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,369
I feel a step deformity.

843
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:19,971
What did he hit
his jaw on again?

844
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:21,773
One of those stone coffee
tables, pretty sharp edge.

845
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,575
Yeah, he fell right
over backwards onto it.

846
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,343
Well, he really
didn't fall, did he?

847
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,344
He was pushed.

848
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,345
Yeah, well, I shoved him.

849
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,746
I was trying to tube his pal.

850
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,098
You threw him across the room.

851
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:32,333
I wish I'd have
thrown him. I felt like it.

852
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,135
Well, however he fell,
he needs a head CT.

853
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,537
Let's call Maxillofacial
to wire the jaw?

854
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,561
Well done, Mr. Carter.

855
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:45,363
Are you looking for someone?

856
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:46,364
Um...

857
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:47,365
Coming through!

858
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:49,334
Sorry.

859
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:50,701
Hey. Hi.

860
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:51,769
Hi.

861
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:54,139
Sorry I'm late. I got held up.

862
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,273
I think I'll wait outside.

863
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:56,741
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

864
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:57,875
Oh, take your time.

865
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,311
Yeah.

866
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,878
Hey, Riley. What?

867
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,314
Don't ever pull that crap again.

868
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,964
What are you talking
about? What crap...

869
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:04,988
You know what I mean!

870
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,572
Is it too late for our lunch?

871
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,872
I kind of lost my appetite.

872
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:29,874
Yeah, I guess you didn't
see anything in there

873
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:32,376
that'd change your
opinion about hospitals.

874
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,499
Or doctors.

875
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,783
Hey, Doug...

876
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,952
you haven't by any chance
heard from your dad today,

877
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,253
have you?

878
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:43,354
No, I haven't. Why?

879
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,755
I can't reach him
in the Caymans.

880
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:46,190
Oh, that's all
right, He'll turn up.

881
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,025
He always does.

882
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,827
Although sometimes,
it takes years.

883
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:53,598
Oh, you think that's funny.

884
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:54,599
Yeah. He's got some

885
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:56,867
of my hard-earned
money with him.

886
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,137
A lot of money?

887
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:02,312
Enough.

888
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,428
Hey...

889
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,164
There's really only one thing
to do after a day like today.

890
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,216
And what's that?

891
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,501
What time do you get off?

892
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,064
Boy, did I pick the
wrong specialty.

893
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,098
Yeah, what's that?

894
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:28,166
Emergency medicine.

895
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,367
Damn radiation oncologists

896
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,568
work a few hours a day,

897
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,769
and then they lock their doors

898
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:32,970
at 10 to 5:00.

899
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:36,508
Those radiation oncologists
sound pretty smart.

900
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,276
You're Dr. Howard, aren't you?

901
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,277
You're Mark Greene?

902
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:40,878
I saw your name
on the call sheet.

903
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:42,747
I didn't have time
to get back to you.

904
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,349
I was calling about
a patient of yours,

905
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:46,651
Loretta Sweet.

906
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:47,936
She's down in the ER.

907
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,471
She's hypovolemic with cystitis.

908
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,340
Yeah, that happens.

909
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,942
ER sounds like the
right place for her.

910
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:55,609
She seemed unprepared
for the side effects.

911
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,011
If she complains
at her next visit,

912
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,079
I'll prescribe Compazine.

913
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,680
She tried to bring
up a few things.

914
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,182
I think she feels a
little overwhelmed

915
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,351
and confused.

916
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,552
Don't they all?

917
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,471
Maybe that should
tell you something

918
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:07,638
about your success

919
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,607
at keeping your
patients informed.

920
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,842
I give my patients
plenty of information.

921
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:14,546
She also has radiation burns.

922
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,863
This a relative of yours?

923
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,014
Friend of the family.

924
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:19,350
Catch me during office hours,

925
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:21,107
I'll review her chart.

926
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,589
Trauma 2! Didn't
you get the page?

927
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:25,590
What page?

928
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:26,591
Hicks, she's frantic.

929
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:28,126
She says a multiple trauma in 2.

930
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,127
I didn't get a page.

931
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,484
She paged you half an hour ago.

932
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,219
Surprise!

933
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:35,850

934
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,719

938
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,744
Congratulations.

939
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:49,397
Congratulations, Peter.

940
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,749
All right, Dr. B!

941
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:54,318
So it's a prestige thing.

942
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,954
I mean, they'll never
give it to an ER Resident.

943
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:57,955
Susan... there's a patient here

944
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,356
that you're going
to want to see.

945
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,775
You were off an hour
ago. You want me to get it?

946
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,899
No, I'm fine.

947
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,247
I won't deny it.

948
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,781
When Susan's on
her game, she's good.

949
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,084
I agree. Focused and decisive.

950
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,285
She was today.

951
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,287
I just wish she was
like that all the time.

952
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,288
She's not very adept

953
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,289
at keeping her personal problems

954
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,290
out of her work.

955
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,292
Night, all. See you.

956
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,527
Uh, Peter, congratulations.

957
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,661
You deserve it.

958
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,446
I hate to run, but I
got an appointment.

959
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,199
Good work, Peter.
I'm proud of you.

960
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,868
So give my best to Karen.

961
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,270
So, Peter, I have
an intussusception

962
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,271
in half an hour.

963
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,327
Care to join me?

964
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,343
Sure.

965
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,745
I think I'll cash in on my
15 minutes' worth of fame.

966
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,529
You've worked
hard enough for it.

967
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,205
So did you nominate me?

968
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,642
No, I believe that
was Carl Vucelich.

969
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,814
So in case you thought
I hadn't noticed, I had.

970
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:55,096
I'm gonna miss you.

971
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,331
Good. You should.

972
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,455
I want a big piece.
There you are.

973
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,074
It's too big.

974
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,597
You want some?

975
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,311
What is it?

976
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,013
Oh, man, I'm so pissed.

977
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,449
What?

978
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:16,817
Over Riley.

979
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,818
Punk.

980
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,353
He put in a freaking
incident report

981
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,354
against me.

982
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,323
What?

983
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,392
Yeah. He said I used
excessive force with that guy,

984
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,593
that banger with the busted jaw.

985
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,463
He made it sound like
I went off or something.

986
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,148
Guy's supposed to be my partner.

987
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:32,216
Why would he say that?

988
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,818
He's green. You
know, he was amped.

989
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:35,352
We were all amped.

990
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:37,660
I mean, you saw it. I
barely shoved that guy.

991
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,160
Come on. It's been a long day.

992
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,664
So we'll say, every Wednesday,

993
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,399
every other weekend,

994
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,501
and we'll rotate
summers and holidays.

995
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:51,525
That should work.

996
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,689
And we'll include
the stipulation

997
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,691
that we both have to stay in
the Chicago-Milwaukee area

998
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,710
until Rachel graduates
from high school.

999
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:00,778
Can you even imagine?

1000
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,068
No.

1001
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:04,572
Well, that was easy.

1002
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:08,052
So should we split
up the stock portfolios?

1003
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:09,709
Ha! Sure.

1004
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,860
I'll split a piece
of pie with you.

1005
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:16,326
You're on.

1006
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,662
Slice of, uh, rhubarb?

1007
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:19,864
All right.

1008
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:20,899
Two forks.

1009
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:22,522
Coming up.

1010
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,057
Why don't you wait over there?

1011
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,393
Okay.

1012
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,445
So, Mr. Johnson,

1013
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,680
I hear you had
a little accident.

1014
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:38,449
Yeah, I cut my finger.

1015
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,550
I was making a sandwich.

1016
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:41,052
The kitchen can be
a dangerous place.

1017
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:42,453
It won't stop bleeding.

1018
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:44,055
Ah, cut the tip
of your pinkie off.

1019
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,156
We'll need to irrigate that.

1020
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,874
Are you right-handed,
Mr. Johnson?

1021
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,576
Yeah.

1022
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,911
Then how did you
manage to cut the tip

1023
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,430
of your right pinkie off?

1024
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:54,515
Yeah, wouldn't you
have to cut your left hand?

1025
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,718
I don't know.

1026
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:57,768
Hmm...

1027
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,632
and what about
your, uh, other injury?

1028
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:04,225
Uh, fell back on my chair
and landed on the leg.

1029
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,626
All right, you wanna lie back

1030
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,450
so I can look at that?

1031
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:16,621
Oh, yeah. That's one
mean testicular contusion.

1032
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,422
We'll need to do an
ultrasound of his pelvis.

1033
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:19,473
Immobilize his legs.

1034
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,693
You're going to
need to lie very still.

1035
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,895
So did you bring the
tip of your finger in?

1036
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,097
We can graft it back on.

1037
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:29,116
Uh, no, I couldn't find it.

1038
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,085
Lost in the kitchen, huh?

1039
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,020
Well, it doesn't matter.

1040
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,605
We can probably
make this one fit.

1041
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,424
Hey!

1042
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,825
Let me up! Let me up!

1043
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:38,981
Hey!

1044
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,329
That was fun.

1045
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,864
Made my day.

1046
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,513
I can't believe
we just did that.

1047
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,416
Me neither.

1048
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,118
Oh, God.

1049
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,209
What am I going to tell Craig?

1050
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,114
You've handled that one before.

1051
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,133
Is that what this was? Revenge?

1052
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,935
Parting shot?

1053
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,936
No.

1054
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,505
No, no, no, no.

1055
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,074
Uh...

1056
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,998
it was just a bad idea.

1057
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,902

Oh, my.

Where's Mr. B?

1109
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:41,184
Who?

1110
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,019
That ratty pink and blue bear.

1111
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:44,255
I put him by the door!

1112
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:45,556
She cannot ride without him!

1113
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,990
Did you pack it? I don't know.

1114
00:42:48,015 --> 00:42:49,593
I know I left it by the door.

1115
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:51,595
Where is B?

00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:52,796
Yeah, yeah, it's
okay. It's okay.

1117
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,797
Yeah. We'll find him.

1118
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,699
Here, here, here.
Will this work?

1119
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:57,100
No, it has to be the bear!

1120
00:42:57,124 --> 00:42:58,802
She can't sleep, either!

1121
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,971
Damn it! Okay,
I'll go look upstairs.

1122

Okay.

00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:23,860
Okay. Yeah. I'm still looking.

1125
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:26,185
It's okay, Susie.

1126
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:42,680
Damn it, Mr. B, where are you?

Everything's going
to be okay now.

00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:58,295
There you go. Yeah.

1133
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,231
Look, we found it, sweetie.

1134
