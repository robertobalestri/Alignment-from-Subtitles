1
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,210
Doug...

2
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,378
Doug!

3
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,447
He's not here.

4
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:22,482
I need you to take
a look at little Susie.

5
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,284
I'm not on yet, am I?

6
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:26,653
You're a pediatrician.
You're always on.

7
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:30,824
Yes, but I'm not
your pediatrician.

8
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:32,559
What time is it?

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,194
Uh, 6 a.m.

10
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:37,063
She was up half
the night coughing.

11
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,899
All right.

12
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:41,000
Hey there, little one.

13
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,669
What's going on?

14
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:43,804
Let's see.

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,006
Seems pretty agreeable.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,642
Well, yeah, that's
because I kept her company

17
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,643
for the last five hours.

18
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:50,644
Ah...

19
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:52,245
What's the matter?

20
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,313
I got elbowed

21
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:54,815
in the Mommy and
Me class yesterday.

22
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,683
Hmm. Sounds vicious.

23
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,418
Oh, yeah, it was.

24
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,386
I had the blue end
of the parachute,

25
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,155
and little Susie was underneath,

26
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,372
and this yuppie mother came by

27
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,574
and yanked it and shoved me.

28
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,775
I'm telling you,

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,960
this mother thing is not easy.

30
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,545
Well, you wouldn't
know it by her.

31
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,548
No temperature.

32
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,005
Lungs are clear.

33
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,787
No sore throat.

34
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,322
This is the healthiest,
happiest baby

35
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,257
that I have ever seen.

36
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,559
Oh, God,

37
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,561
I am never going to
make Gymboree tonight.

38
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,895
Doug?

39
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,731
Doug, paramedics
are at the back door

40
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,899
with an infant, unresponsive.

41
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,967
Okay. You need a hand?

42
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,201
Always.

43
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,203
Okay. Oh, bye-bye. Can
you hold her for a sec?

44
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,605
Sure. Thanks.

45
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,606
Hey, little Susie.

46
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,630
Hey...

47
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:39,910
What do you got?

48
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,711
Two-month-old male
found unconscious

49
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,346
and cyanotic in his crib.

50
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,347
What is it? What's wrong?

51
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,049
He was fine last night.

52
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,183
Unresponsive at scene.

53
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,385
Gave him two rounds of epi

54
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,552
and atropine in the field.

55
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,553
Got nothing.

56
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,355
He just had a
little bit of a cold.

57
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,774
I just took him to our
pediatrician yesterday.

58
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,943
Let's tube him.
Number four uncuffed.

59
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,144
Hook up a compression, will you?

60
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,179
Got it.

61
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,330
Number one,
straight laryngoscope.

62
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,531
I need tape on the tube.

63
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,266
Here you go.

64
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,701
Temperature?

65
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,902
It's 93.

66
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,704
It wasn't a bad cold,
not even a fever.

67
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,205
Deep tendon reflexes absent.

68
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,207
He's unresponsive to pain.
Let's try a high dose epi.

69
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,409
What's he weigh,
about 10 pounds?

70
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,626
12.

71
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,228
Asystole. Okay. 0.5.

72
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:16,496
Did our doctor miss something?

73
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,898
What's your name?
Mr. and Mrs. what?

74
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,265
Kenway.

75
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,484
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Kenway,
we need you to wait outside.

76
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,485
What's wrong with him?

77
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,854
Haleh...

78
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,474
I'm Haleh Adams. We need
to let the doctors do their work.

79
00:02:27,498 --> 00:02:29,475
I want to stay with my
baby. Come on, sweetie.

80
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,478
It's okay. I'll be with you.

81
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:33,034
Anterior fontanel is flat.

82
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,350
Anything on the monitor yet?

83
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,085
No petechiae or ecchymosis.

84
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,119
Another dose of epi?

85
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,088
What's his down
time? 45 minutes.

86
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:44,090
Any pulse? No.

87
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,859
Pupils fixed and
dilated. Defibrillator?

88
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:47,794
No rhythm. I'm gonna shock him.

89
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,251
Charging.

90
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:55,168
Susan...

91
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,920
Susan, it's over.

92
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,789
Susan, it's over.

93
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,625
It's over.

94
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,289
I'll mark the chart.

95
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,098
SIDS?

96
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,135
Lydia, take him off the monitor.

97
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,959
I'll get his parents
back in here.

98
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,380
Will you stay with him?

99
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,142
You got to look at that face.

100
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,013
She was fast
asleep... weren't you?

101
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,414
Thank you, Conni.

102
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,516
You're welcome. Here you go.

103
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,240
Ooh, yeah.

104
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,656
Mm, yeah.

105
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,127
What?

106
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,063
Oh, yeah.

107
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,665
You're my little girl.

108
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,968
Oh, my little girl.

109
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,337
Yeah.

110
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,272
I love you.

111
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,142
Yeah. I love you.

112
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,811
Yeah, I love you.

113
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,504
Yeah.

114
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,406
Hi.

115
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,407
Hi.

116
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,408
You look awful.

117
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,110
Uh, post-op, two hours sleep.

118
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,144
How's tonight look?

119
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,313
Good, if Benton
ever lets me out.

120
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,915
It's been, like, two days.

121
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,850
It's been, like, over two days.

122
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,519
Well, I have a couple
of hours tonight

123
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,686
between 6 and 8.

124
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,687
Your place?

125
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,255
Mm-hmm... Dr. Wolverton.

126
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,757
Hey...

127
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,758
Come with me.

128
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:49,759
Where we going?

129
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,182
This way.

130
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,373
Hold the elevator!

131
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,975
Where are the films
on that Spencer kid?

132
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,910
Radiology's backed up.

133
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,113
Oh, damn. Four West again.

134
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,382
Gabriel's calcium back yet?

135
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,616
Normal. It's on his chart.

136
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,251
Neuro's consulting on Weingast.

137
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,275
The films are...?

138
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,105
Yeah, in the reading room.

139
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,074
Next time, leave it bedside.

140
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,164
Uh... This way.

141
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,278
Oh!

142
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,280
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,582
Hey. Hey!

144
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,984
Hey, I could use some help here.

145
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:31,985
Now?

146
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,286
No, next Labor Day.

147
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,287
We'll send somebody.

148
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,122
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

149
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,157
We'll clean it up.

150
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,158
Later.

151
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:39,358
When we get back from, uh...

152
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,062
Radiology. Yeah.

153
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,350
Conni?

154
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:50,436
Oh, hi. Dropped
the lateral decubitus.

155
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,637
Could you hand me those charts?

156
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,238
We came in looking
for the films on...

157
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,373
Smith, John.

158
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:55,775
They don't appear
to be here, so...

159
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,559
We'll be back. Later.

160
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,146
Close call.

161
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,214
Hey, could you
guys give me a hand?

162
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,215
Uh, sure.

163
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,239
No problem.

164
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:08,787
Uh, right here okay? Great.

165
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:09,989
Do you want a bite?

166
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,040
I don't think so, Lydia.

167
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,908
Oh, God, I do. I
missed breakfast.

168
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,176
What's in the boxes?

169
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,244
Something for me?

170
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,946
Mm-mm.

171
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,915
It's for the children's
Christmas drive.

172
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,700
Oh, yeah, there's going to
be one lucky four-year-old

173
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:22,685
who gets this.

174
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,254
I haven't sorted through it yet.

175
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,455
Is it Secret Santa time already?

176
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,457
Almost, and I arranged
for you to get me,

177
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,481
so make it good.

178
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,561
So my mom sold the house.

179
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,696
Helen's moving?
Yeah, to the burbs.

180
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,698
She's been storing this
stuff in her basement for me

181
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,733
for years.

182
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,900
Now Carol's pawning it off

183
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,402
on some unsuspecting
four-year-old.

184
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,105
No, I'm going
to toss half of it.

185
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,449
You'd never throw
away this stuff.

186
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,276
My mom's the saver, not me.

187
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,711
KC and the Sunshine Band.

188
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,414
Yeah, you can toss that.

189
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,516
Whoa, this...

190
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,551
Aw, come on.

191
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,218
Now, you've never
twirled a baton.

192
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,488
No, I did. I did.

193
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,512
I did.

194
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,792
Something like this.

195
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,530
Okay.

196
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,299
Scalp lac in 3.

197
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,300
Anyone seen Carter?

198
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,324
Nope.

199
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,435
What is it?

200
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,770
You're not a Catholic, are you?

201
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,872
Said goodbye to
the old homestead?

202
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:34,873
Yup.

203
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:35,975
Must be hard.

204
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,143
No, not really.

205
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,744
You know, when my
folks sold their place,

206
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,812
I went back there,

207
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,381
and I carved my
name into every closet.

208
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,484
It's just a house.

209
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:46,885
It's a home, Hathaway.

210
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,387
It's got little height
measurements

211
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,855
on the kitchen door.

212
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,724
It's got a banister
where I fell off,

213
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,626
and I broke my collarbone.

214
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,194
It's got this cool crawl space

215
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:56,429
where my brothers and I

216
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,430
used to hide our<i> Playboys.</i>

217
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,564
<i>Playboys?</i>

218
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,099
Yeah, when we were kids.

219
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,101
Uh-huh.

220
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,604
So, um, no ID on this patient?

221
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,005
Nope. Nothing.

222
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,690
We found him at the Goodman.

223
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,092
He's been sitting
there for a while.

224
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,426
Yo, Shepherd.

225
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,050
You gotta move your rig.

226
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,201
I need someone to cover a shift.

227
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,802
Not tonight. I'm sorry.

228
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,004
Bet she'd take a rain check.

229
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,005
Sorry, buddy,

230
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,373
this is something I can't move.

231
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,740
Hit-and-run's here!

232
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,942
Need a hand with this one?

233
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,165
Yeah.

234
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,178
What's open?

235
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,601
Trauma 1.

236
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,149
Doris...

237
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,118
35-year-old male,
auto versus pedestrian.

238
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:40,990
BP 110/65. Pulse tachy at
120, possible mandible fracture.

239
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:45,228
500 cc bolus, normal
saline, O-2, 10 liters,

240
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,963
and hare traction
on the left leg.

241
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:47,946
On my count.

242
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,883
One, two, three.

243
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:53,136
Back to the slopes. See you.

244
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,170
What's his name?

245
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,671
Ethan Brown.

246
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,872
Mr. Brown, you're in the ER.

247
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,541
You were hit by a car.

248
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,910
Let's get a cross-table C-spine.

249
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,813
Chest. Pelvis, left
femur, mandible.

250
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,415
CBC, type and cross
four units, Chem 7.

251
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,383
My wife!

252
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,919
Try not to talk, Mr. Brown.
Your jaw might be broken.

253
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,920
We'll contact your wife.

254
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,921
I'll get a Foley in.

255
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,724
Pressure's good. 125/80.

256
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,859
Midshaft fractured femur.

257
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,310
Good distal pulses.

258
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,595
Abdomen's benign.

259
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,066
Droperidol, 2.5, slow IV push,

260
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,834
and let's watch his pressure.

261
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,702
What happened? Someone
ran him down. Hit-and-run.

262
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,337
Interviewing witnesses now.

263
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,338
No! No!

264
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,422
TMs are clear.

265
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,058
No Battles Sign.

266
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:33,542
All right. Clear CT.

267
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,893
No, no, no, Mr. Brown...

268
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,179
You've gotta leave the mask on.

269
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,998
Okay, calm down. Calm down.

270
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:42,034
Hi. I'm Carol.

271
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,669
What's your name?

272
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,504
Why do you ask that?

273
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,173
Just curious.

274
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:49,075
Mr. Sullivan.

275
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:51,094
Can't smoke in
here, Mr. Sullivan.

276
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,561
Suture kit.

277
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,796
Thanks. Can you hang out?

278
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,181
I'm not sure he's
gonna need any.

279
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,982
Can you hand me that saline?

280
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,646
May I borrow a pencil, please?

281
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,190
Why is your arm
bleeding, Mr. Sullivan?

282
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:05,708
I work for the, uh...

283
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,710
I work for the committee.
I'm a... I'm an architect.

284
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,734
This is a... this is,
uh... This is a pen.

285
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,034
Here you go. How's this?

286
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:17,035
Is there someone we
can call to take you home?

287
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,804
Why do you... Why do you ask?

288
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,662
I mean, I know where it is.

289
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,510
Okay. No, he's not
going to need any stitches,

290
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:27,079
but let's call psych
and social services.

291
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,981
Get Matthews to supervise...
Matthews has got the interview

292
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,082
for Vucelich's
research project...

293
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,384
Then get Jones to do it...

294
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:32,785
Jones, Lieberman, Sheets,
they all got interviews.

295
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:33,952
They're wasting their time.

296
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:35,554
Vucelich is never going
to pick a third-year...

297
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,822
You ought to apply.

298
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:38,123
It'd be great for your
career, your resume.

299
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:39,158
Yeah, not to mention yours.

300
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:40,393
You have a hematoma
on your neck.

301
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:41,394
What do we have?

302
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,162
Hit-and-run, moderate velocity.

303
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,898
Left femur fracture,
head trauma.

304
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,032
What is he on?

305
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,167
Droperidol for agitation.

306
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,802
We couldn't control him.

307
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,346
Got Mr. Brown's films.

308
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:53,872
There's a shadow
in the right base.

309
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,641
Carter, hemothorax!

310
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:56,859
Pulse up, 120.

311
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,194
I'll set up a Thora-Seal.

312
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,362
O-2 sats falling.

313
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,997
Number 32 French.

314
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,265
Hey, I know.

315
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,372
I know.

316
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,255
Curved Kelly.

317
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,191
I'm in.

318
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,259
Anyone call CT?

319
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:15,928
Yeah. They're ready for him.

320
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,430
Suction.

321
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:19,931
It's draining.

322
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:22,468
His real name is Joshua Shem.

323
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,071
He's a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

324
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,495
Ran away from his
residential home.

325
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,311
They faxed us this.

326
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,213
Prolixin, Thorazine,
Trilafon, even Clozaril...

327
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:35,614
Won't stay on any of them.

328
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,216
This is the third
time he's run away?

329
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,018
Yeah. They said they
won't take him back again.

330
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,219
Three strikes, and
you're out, huh?

331
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:41,820
Any family? His mother.

332
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,222
I'm still trying to
track her down.

333
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:44,357
Okay. Thanks, Jeanie.

334
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,958
Hey, Randi, could
you find me the number

335
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,093
to Campanelli's, please?

336
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:48,660
You don't wanna
go there, Dr. Ross.

337
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,296
Excuse me?

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,297
Drafty, stuffy,

339
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:53,065
and the pasta's kind of iffy.

340
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,368
Anyone we know?

341
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:56,602
What's this?

342
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:58,004
You told Mark you
couldn't work tonight.

343
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,005
Personal obligation.

344
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,539
We got failure to fly in 3.

345
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:01,940
A kid fell off his bunk bed.

346
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:03,142
You care to join me?

347
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,332
Okay.

348
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,396
Ethan! My God!

349
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,397
Ma'am...

350
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,398
Is he hurt?

351
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,733
Is he going to die?

352
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,735
No, he's not going to
die, but you really can't...

353
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,936
You can't go with him. Ma'am!

354
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,937
I'm his wife!

355
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,005
Mrs. Brown,

356
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,607
your husband has been
in a serious accident.

357
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,475
We're taking him
up for a head CT,

358
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,876
but his injuries do not appear

359
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,279
to be life-threatening.

360
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,280
Then he's not gonna die?

361
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,881
No, I think he's
going to be fine.

362
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,082
Come with me, I'll show you.

363
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,852
Oh, my God!

364
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,187
My sister, she's unconscious!

365
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,188
What happened?

366
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,756
She had a skating accident.

367
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,358
They took care of
her at St. Anne's,

368
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,359
sent her home,

369
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,360
but in the car,

370
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,361
she started shaking all over.

371
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,395
Sounds like a seizure.

372
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,396
What's her name?

373
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,397
Reba.

374
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,532
I couldn't wake her up.

375
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,699
Reba?

376
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,750
Reba, can you hear me?

377
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:46,285
She's postictal.
Let's start a line.

378
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,037
15 liters O-2 by mask.

379
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,471
Does she have a
history of seizures?

380
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,124
No. We were at the
skating rink, practicing,

381
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,326
and a boy ran into her.

382
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,743
Her legs were
cut up pretty badly.

383
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,045
Pupils equal, round, reactive.

384
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,213
Did she hit her head?

385
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,814
I think so. She had a headache.

386
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,115
Were any X-rays taken?

387
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,084
I don't know. They...
They stitched up her legs.

388
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,320
Responsive to pain.

389
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,889
BP 120/70. Pulse 56.

390
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,423
We need a head CT.

391
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,458
What's going on?

392
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,659
Your sister had a seizure,

393
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,144
which can happen
after a head injury.

394
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,063
We're going to take
an X-ray of her brain,

395
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,747
make sure there's
no bleeding, okay?

396
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,817
Okay.

397
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:19,701
A small, gold
pendant would be nice.

398
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,503
Earrings, Ford Explorer.

399
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,839
Thank you, Lydia.
I'll keep those in mind.

400
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,840
How serious?

401
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,841
Seizure following head trauma.

402
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,343
They saw her at St. Anne's.

403
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,844
Barkley's the chief over there.

404
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,679
You want me to call
him... Don't bother.

405
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,081
They didn't even do a CT.

406
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,316
Hey, doctor. We wrapped up
that hit-and-run. That quick?

407
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,752
Witness ID'd the plates,
and get this, it was his wife.

408
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,837
Come on.

409
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,340
Lydia? Lydia,
where's Brown? Who?

410
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,342
Ethan Brown, the guy
who got hit by a car.

411
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,510
Oh, Exam 4.

412
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:45,800
Call Security.

413
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:52,250
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

414
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:56,439
Die! You bastard!

415
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,540
I hate you! I'm gonna kill you!

416
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,259
Get her out of here!

417
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,195
Cyanotic. Pulse ox's down to 70.

418
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,621
Hyperventilate him. Blood gas?

419
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,722
What was that about?

420
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,647
Marital bliss.

421
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,180
After dinner, power
Christmas shopping.

422
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:22,949
Everything for everyone
in under three hours.

423
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:24,083
Actually, you could come.

424
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:25,618
Shop for Jennifer and Rachel.

425
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:26,686
Nah, Rachel's getting a bike.

426
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,187
Jennifer already
has her present.

427
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:29,522
I agreed to spend four...

428
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:32,358
Count them... four wintery days

429
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:34,360
with her folks in Sheboygan.

430
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:36,029
Four days with the Reverend?

431
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,030
Yeah.

432
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:38,965
Go with God.

433
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:40,166
How's she doing?

434
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,333
She's coming around.

435
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,568
Hi, Reba. I'm Dr. Lewis.

436
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,786
Do you know where you are?

437
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,571
Mm...

438
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:46,706
Hospital?

439
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,229
Do you remember what happened?

440
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,632
No.

441
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,331
It's normal to be
confused after a seizure.

442
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,133
We want to keep her
in the hospital for...

443
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,283
Uh-oh.

444
00:15:58,307 --> 00:15:59,686
Valium, five.

445
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,071
What's happening?

446
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,072
Valium, five.

447
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,907
Pulse ox 85.

448
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,158
Put her back on the mask.

449
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,582
Oh, my God. Help her, please!

450
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,000
Doctor... Dr. Vucelich.

451
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,001
Uh, Carter, John Carter.

452
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,637
Ah, Carter, yes.

453
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:19,706
I'm going to see your
Dr. Matthews at 5, right?

454
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,707
Well, no. Actually,

455
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,742
I'm Dr. Benton's student.

456
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:23,976
Well, in that case,

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,778
I guess look forward
to seeing him later, then.

458
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,112
Well, no, actually, uh,

459
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,113
he's not signed up.

460
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,315
I know he wanted to be,

461
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,016
but I believe
your list was full.

462
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,618
Carter, you don't
have to cover for him.

463
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:34,119
I mean, if the man
isn't interested...

464
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,921
No, no, no, no. He's interested.

465
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:38,157
He's definitely
interested, um...

466
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,092
Well, to be honest,

467
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:41,761
I forgot to sign him up.

468
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:42,862
Aha.

469
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,464
And he was pretty
upset about it.

470
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:47,266
I see. Well, I guess I'm going
to have to cover for you, then.

471
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,868
Why don't you send him in at 6?

472
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:49,869
I think it's a hickey

473
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,070
you have on your neck, Carter.

474
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,855
Yeah. Yeah.

475
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,573
That makes 20 of Valium.

476
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,775
How long has she been seizing?

477
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,842
10 minutes.

478
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:57,910
Let's load her with Dilantin.

479
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,278
900 milligrams at 50 a minute.

480
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,904
She's probably
tearing her sutures out.

481
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,753
Is she on any drugs?

482
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,754
No.

483
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,755
Diabetic?

484
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,290
No.

485
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:12,425
Is she allergic to lidocaine?

486
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,442
Lidocaine?

487
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,743
Yeah, it's like Novocain.

488
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,745
They would have given it
to her before the sutures.

489
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,880
I don't know.

490
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,682
They were injecting
her with a lot of stuff.

491
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,699
Hold the Dilantin!

492
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,167
800 phenobarb.

493
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,569
Could be lidocaine
toxicity. Get a level.

494
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,170
100 in.

495
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:28,074
Conni, I want you to get a hold
of a Dr. Barkley at St. Anne's

496
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:29,541
and have him fax
her chart over ASAP.

497
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,360
I know I gave you
nights off this week...

498
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,495
Yes, thank you.

499
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,662
Yes, well...

500
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,930
Not that it did any good.

501
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,599
Hudson pleaded with
me to cover for him.

502
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,801
So I guess you couldn't
cover for Bowers, then?

503
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,636
I'm good, Mark,
but not that good.

504
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,472
Reba Siburry's seizures.

505
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,109
St. Anne's gave her a
toxic dose of lidocaine?

506
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,110
Her level was nine.

507
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,879
Missed all the fun.

508
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,881
This would make a
terrific case report.

509
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,882
You know, Morgenstern's dying

510
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,082
to have somebody present a paper

511
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,051
at the SAEM conference.

512
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,386
I could use the credit.

513
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,889
The hospital pays for the trip.

514
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:00,923
Trip?

515
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,258
It's in Miami.

516
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:07,362
Sounds like a
terrific opportunity.

517
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,431
I can't write and
present a paper.

518
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,333
Sure you can. And
take care of Susie?

519
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,736
I thought your dad was
going to help pick up the slack.

520
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,137
Yeah, but I still
barely have time

521
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,338
to get dressed in the morning.

522
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,339
Well, I can help you

523
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,340
with your schedule here.

524
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,942
Yeah, thanks, that's great,

525
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,443
but I can't spend my days off

526
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,145
in the med library
doing research.

527
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,747
And a trip?

528
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,814
Okay.

529
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:26,815
Are you disappointed?

530
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,250
Of course not.

531
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,635
Do you think I should do it?

532
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,742
Susan, it's your decision.

533
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,594
Do your voices tell
you to harm yourself?

534
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,129
Harm anyone else?

535
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,130
Voices, voices, voices...

536
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,398
I don't... I don't...

537
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,567
I don't hear, uh,
you know, voices.

538
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,402
Do you want to
stay in the hospital?

539
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,906
I'm not, uh... crazy,

540
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,307
or, you know, whatever...
What you think.

541
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,292
No, no, but you might
want to try new medicines

542
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:54,293
with fewer side-effects...

543
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:55,294
Thank you, no.

544
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:56,929
I have... I have...
I have work to...

545
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:01,734
May I?

546
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:04,170
Here, Josh.

547
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:06,238
How are you going to eat, Josh?

548
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:07,256
The Colonel makes me chicken.

549
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,724
And sleep?

550
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,260
I'm, um... I'm
building a... a house.

551
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,678
It's cold outside.

552
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,347
Look, I... I know! I
have a... I have a jacket.

553
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:16,883
I know, um,

554
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,700
how... how to
take care of myself.

555
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,570
I am... I am a...
I am a man to...

556
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,671
Okay.

557
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,007
Josh, it was nice
meeting you. Okay?

558
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,549
Come on, let's go.

559
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:33,699
Can you hold him? Nope.

560
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:34,800
Not even for a day?

561
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,402
I've got calls in to
some halfway houses.

562
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,836
I'm sure I can place him.

563
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,838
He's in no imminent danger,
to himself or anyone else.

564
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,173
There's nothing I can do.

565
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:43,392
You think he can take
care of himself on the street?

566
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,493
He claims he can.

567
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,094
And you're gonna
take his word for it.

568
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,363
I didn't write the law.

569
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,938
He's an adult. If he
wants to go, he goes.

570
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:53,652
Guess Joshua
is off his checklist

571
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:54,786
for the day.

572
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,955
No, he's a good guy.

573
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,773
He must get 30
cases like this a month.

574
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,758
He does what he can.

575
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,942
So what do we do?

576
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,377
Well, we try and stall him.

577
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,841
Hope that a home comes
through, wait for the mother to show.

578
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,700
I got Benton that
interview at 6.

579
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,502
It's, what, like 15 minutes
to your house, right?

580
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,504
So that gives us an hour
and 20 minutes, tops,

581
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:13,705
before study group,
which is nothing.

582
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,541
Look what you did to my neck.

583
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,009
You are an incurable romantic.

584
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,311
Only one problem, though.

585
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:19,645
Carter!

586
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:20,679
Oh, man.

587
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:21,680
I haven't told him yet.

588
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:22,736
See you later.

589
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,852
Hey...

590
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:27,853
Got a patient for you.

591
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,221
Great.

592
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,223
Hey, I was wondering, do
you have plans this evening?

593
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:32,325
Reason I'm asking is because

594
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,525
I bumped into
Dr. Vucelich earlier...

595
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,526
And?

596
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,028
And... What? Nothing.

597
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,696
You sign me up? No, not really.

598
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,730
You better not have.

599
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,333
Well, see, the thing
is, he requested you.

600
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:42,134
He thinks you're gonna
be great for this study,

601
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,936
and he wants to
talk to you about it

602
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,994
in his office at
6 tonight, today.

603
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,408
Do a 2 percent block,
irrigate, pull the nail,

604
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:50,409
no stitches.

605
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:51,433
Okay.

606
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,916
Hi, Josh.

607
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,485
I... I have... I have to go.

608
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,691
But we're not finished yet.

609
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:04,579
What?

610
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:13,148
Hey, Josh... This
is really good.

611
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,734
I just draw what they tell me.

612
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,319
I have to go, uh... home.

613
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,910
I have to... I have to...

614
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,625
Where is your home?

615
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,745
Oh, I just bought one.

616
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:27,446
Oh. Where?

617
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,115
Wicker Park, on Hoyne Street.

618
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:33,219
Yeah, Jugendstil. Proto-Modern.

619
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:35,937
I guess. Maybe.

620
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,789
It's nice. Very solid.

621
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,792
Turn of the century.

622
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,960
Living room, fireplace.

623
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:44,229
Copper inlay. Tile.

624
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:45,781
No fireplace.
Just plaster walls.

625
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,716
No. Go behind.

626
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,551
It's... It's there.

627
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:50,920
You'll see that it's there.

628
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:54,423
Thanks. I didn't know
I bought a Jugen...

629
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:57,059
Joogen... thing.

630
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,227
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it.

631
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,196
Hey, Josh, are you hungry?

632
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,197
I...

633
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,181
You should eat something.

634
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:07,119
I'll let you keep the pencil.

635
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:08,143
Okay?

636
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:12,258
Okay?

637
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:13,597
Okay.

638
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,097
Your psych patient's still here.

639
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,098
Uh-huh.

640
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:20,099
Consult been down?

641
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:21,100
Yup.

642
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:22,101
Not admitted?

643
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,369
Nope.

644
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:24,403
Why hasn't he been discharged?

645
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,804
I'd like to put a
sterile dressing

646
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,072
on his abrasion,

647
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,723
and maybe put some
antibiotic ointment.

648
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,327
As long as we have a bed,
let's get him fed, cleaned up.

649
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,328
Good idea.

650
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,762
Okay, 7:00?

651
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,632
You look beautiful
whatever you wear.

652
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,034
I love you too. Bye.

653
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,402
Your personal obligation?

654
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:43,772
ER.

655
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:44,773
Hang on.

656
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,291
Dr. Greene?

657
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:48,310
It's for you.

658
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,778
Hillsborough Community Hospital.

659
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,580
Where's that?

660
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,704
Uh... Milwaukee.

661
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,918
Hello.

662
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,655
What happened?

663
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,639
Oh, God.

664
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:02,296
Is she all right?

665
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:06,962
Ra... Rachel, my daughter?

666
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,530
Yeah. Of course.

667
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,131
I'll be there as soon as I can.

668
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,701
Mark?

669
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,769
Jen and Rachel.

670
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,137
They're at a hospital.

671
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,154
I gotta catch a train.

672
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:17,890
What happened?

673
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:19,607
Car accident.

674
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,909
Is Rachel okay?

675
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,445
It's only Jen.

676
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,147
No, take my car.

677
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,582
Thanks.

678
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,339
Yeah.

679
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,359
Greene. Jennifer Greene.

680
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,427
Any news?

681
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,863
No, they won't tell me anything.

682
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,199
Yeah.

683
00:23:43,223 --> 00:23:44,183
Okay. Thank you.

684
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:45,584
Are we this bad
when people call?

685
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:47,086
No, I give them a bucketful

686
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,553
of complete and
accurate information.

687
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,522
Anybody know anyone over there?

688
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:53,258
I used to date one
of their O.R. techs.

689
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:54,526
Oh...

690
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,528
I haven't talked
to him in six years.

691
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:57,552
Dial.

692
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:01,600
Hey, that's cool.

693
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:02,601
It is, isn't it?

694
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,802
A patient gave it to me.

695
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:04,803
What's a patient doing

696
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:06,037
drawing you a Sullivan Arch?

697
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,273
Sullivan? Joshua
calls himself Sullivan.

698
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:10,142
Yeah. Louis, Lewis.

699
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,243
Something like that.

700
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:12,578
It's over at the Art Institute.

701
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,813
He says it's his home.

702
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,770
Unfortunately, it's
about to be true.

703
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,251
Oh, Shep, no, give me that back.

704
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,252
Oh, no. Come on.

705
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,253
No, Shep, please.

706
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:22,254
Is that you?

707
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,422
Oh, come on.

708
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,090
Oh, come on, you
were cute! Shep!

709
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:26,892
No, stop, stop, stop.
Come on, give it back!

710
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,294
"To the coolest
girl in the class."

711
00:24:28,318 --> 00:24:31,096
Okay, very funny.

712
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,164
"I'll never forget

713
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:35,100
"what you did for me
last summer at the lake.

714
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:37,736
Love, P.J."

715
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,037
Oh, yeah?

716
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,106
What did you do that
made him so grateful?

717
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,343
It's a "her," not a "him."

718
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:45,411
I was calming her down

719
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:46,878
because she broke
up with her boy...

720
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,281
You know, I don't need
to be telling you any of this.

721
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:51,116
This is great. This is trash.

722
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,685
No, this is going home.

723
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:55,153
You're gonna thank me one day.

724
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:58,346
This is good stuff.

725
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,978
Food poisoning in 4.

726
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,546
Oh, and Morgenstern
wants to see you.

727
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,814
Uh-oh.

728
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,349
No, it's good news.

729
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,684
About presenting
the lidocaine toxicity.

730
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,287
Mark told Morgenstern
about that case?

731
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:13,588
No, I did. He was very excited.

732
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,490
This is a great opportunity.

733
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,092
Finally got rid of
that migraine in 5.

734
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,360
Oh, good.

735
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,661
Food poisoning in 4.

736
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,685
Psst!

737
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,899
I think I can make that
window of opportunity.

738
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:24,900
My place at 6?

739
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:25,901
You got it.

740
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,169
Carter, Harper...

741
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,971
I need to pull the
drains on some post-ops.

742
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,639
Well, you've got
your interview at 6:00.

743
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,041
Which is why you're gonna do it.

744
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:34,043
Harper, scalp lac
in the Suture Room.

745
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:36,145
I have food poisoning in 4.

746
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:38,613
Well, after the
food poisoning in 4.

747
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,165
That's great.

748
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:42,668
Shem, Joshua. He's 28.

749
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:45,304
Diagnosed schizophrenic.

750
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:47,906
You've gotta be
kidding. Six months?

751
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,376
No, I checked there too.
They don't have any beds.

752
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,744
Okay.

753
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,045
Yeah, I'll try Carnegie House.

754
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:55,146
Okay, thanks. Bye.

755
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,274
Doctor...

756
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,904
I see you found all my patients,

757
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:21,472
and they're all grateful
to still be with us.

758
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,874
Endarterectomies?

759
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:24,375
Thanks, Claire.

760
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,778
Why don't you tell my wife
I'll meet her at the restaurant.

761
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,013
Mm-hmm.

762
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:29,214
You wouldn't believe
the Christmas presents.

763
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,215
Yeah, must be hundreds.

764
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:32,584
At least.

765
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,552
Why don't you come
with me, Benton?

766
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,810
I think you're going
to find this interesting.

767
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:40,192
What about the interview?

768
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:41,949
This is it.

769
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:50,886
Excuse me.

770
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,970
I'm Madeline Shem,
Joshua's mother.

771
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,890
Oh, hi. I'm Carol Hathaway.

772
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:55,957
I'm glad you came.

773
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,893
Was he hurt?

774
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,078
No, just a small
abrasion on his arm.

775
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:02,230
We spoke to the
residential home.

776
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,634
But they won't take him back. I
know. He's run away so much.

777
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:08,103
We've had no luck
getting him into another.

778
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,572
Took us nine months
to get him into that one.

779
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,907
Well, could you take him home?

780
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,293
Oh, I wish.

781
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:18,063
Joshua's let go of everything,
his past, his family, our home.

782
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:19,798
None of it means
anything to him anymore.

783
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:21,788
He'd never stay.

784
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:25,354
Hard to believe

785
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,589
he was gonna be an architect.

786
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,846
Had a breakdown in college.

787
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,733
Hi, Josh.

788
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,002
I brought you pencils,

789
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:42,670
sharpened just the way you like.

790
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,738
Thanks. Thanks very much.

791
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,641
We've been waiting
for these to arrive.

792
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,426
I, uh...

793
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,264
I give him money, which
makes me feel better,

794
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:54,799
and his pencils, which
makes him feel better.

795
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:56,534
That's really the only thing

796
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:58,270
he still cares about.

797
00:27:58,294 --> 00:27:59,626
Still...

798
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:04,131
I love you, Josh.

799
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,166
Radial and ulnar
pulses are strong.

800
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,801
He's gonna need a tetanus.

801
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,003
Yeah, and let's give him
five of morphine, slow IV push.

802
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,337
Give me the bullet.

803
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,939
Impaled foreign body.

804
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,208
Fell off a ladder onto a
Christmas reindeer display.

805
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,643
They're gonna fire me.

806
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:22,961
Through and
through left deltoid.

807
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:24,963
Distal neuro and
vascular intact.

808
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:26,081
I crushed Rudolph.

809
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,116
Darned expensive,
those displays.

810
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,151
Your last meal?

811
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:30,135
Breakfast.

812
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,137
No, no...

813
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:33,338
I don't know.

814
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:34,339
Can you feel this?

815
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:35,373
Yeah, yeah.

816
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:38,026
BP's 140/85. Pulse 110.

817
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,727
O.R. been notified? This?

818
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,396
It's killing me.

819
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,198
O.R.'s ready.

820
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,199
Gram of Ancef.

821
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,852
Spectacular case earlier, Susan.

822
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:47,853
It's a shoo-in for presentation

823
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:48,854
at the SAEM conference.

824
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:50,255
Might even make
it into the annals.

825
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,556
Uh-huh.

826
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,374
Doctors forget that a
seemingly benign anesthetic

827
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,376
has the potential

828
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,060
for cardiac

829
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:57,829
and neurological toxicity.

830
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:00,453
Okay, let's get this
puppy up to the O.R.

831
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,286
I presented at the conference

832
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,822
when I was a resident.

833
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,923
Terrific case,
terrific opportunity.

834
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:12,093
I left the visual
aids on the plane.

835
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,362
Well, I have to decline
your offer, Dr. Morgenstern.

836
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,363
Personal reasons.

837
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,048
You do realize, don't you,

838
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:19,817
you're a candidate for
Chief Resident next year?

839
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,620
I know that I need to start
presenting and publishing,

840
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:24,856
but it's just that now's
not a very good time.

841
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,957
There's never a good time.

842
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,692
I'd just hate to
see the personal

843
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:28,894
overwhelm the job.

844
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:30,795
I'm not overwhelmed,
Dr. Morgenstern,

845
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,063
and I'm doing my job.

846
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,365
Yes, but to build a career,

847
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,400
you've got to take
on more responsibility.

848
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:38,069
I've taken on plenty
of responsibility,

849
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:39,470
so you'll have to forgive me

850
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:41,406
if I don't stay after
school these days

851
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,530
to work for extra credit.

852
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:00,442
Where's Emergency?

853
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,043
My wife and daughter
were in an accident.

854
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,245
Where's Emergency?

855
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,635
Oh, over there.

856
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,161
Where's the ER?

857
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,695
This is the ER.

858
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,863
Jennifer and Rachel Greene?

859
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,265
Sorry?

860
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,699
I'm Mark Greene. I'm
an Emergency physician.

861
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,701
My wife and daughter
have been in an accident.

862
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,170
Just sent up to the O.R.

863
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,771
What floor?

864
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,528
Second. Take the
stairs. It's faster.

865
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:51,810
Jen, Jen!

866
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:52,944
Jen, I'm here.

867
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:54,179
I'm okay, Mark.

868
00:30:54,203 --> 00:30:55,480
Rachel's okay.

869
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:57,315
Where is Rachel?
Where's my daughter?

870
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,717
Probably in the waiting area.

871
00:30:58,741 --> 00:30:59,718
She's okay.

872
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:01,619
I wanna stay with my wife.

873
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:02,621
You can't right now.

874
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:03,622
I'm a doctor.

875
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:04,689
I'm Dr. Shreiger.

876
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:07,709
What are you, a Resident? Yes.

877
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,245
I'll be working
under Dr. Musgrave.

878
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,729
You can't be in
here, Dr. Greene.

879
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:14,249
I'd like to talk
to the Attending.

880
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:15,317
Your wife suffered
multiple injuries

881
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,300
when she was broadsided.

882
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,103
She's stable,

883
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,704
but she's got a compound
right tib-fib fracture.

884
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:21,005
The films?

885
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:22,807
Abdominal CT showed a
small amount of free blood,

886
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:24,876
so we're gonna do an
exploratory laparotomy,

887
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,077
and we'll have an orthopod in

888
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,579
to fix the fracture.

889
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,381
You should have a
seat in the waiting room.

890
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:31,605
Dr. Musgrave will find
you when we're through.

891
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:46,598
Susan, this came for you.

892
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:47,799
I had to sign for it.

893
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,201
Ooh, secret admirer?

894
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:51,970
Uh... No.

895
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,105
Is it from Chloe?

896
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:54,239
The one and only.

897
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:55,696
Might as well open it.

898
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,815
These are $100 bills.

899
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,949
There's, like, 20 of them.

900
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,818
30 of them, she says.

901
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,054
$3000?

902
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:10,521
Are they marked and sequential?

903
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,523
What did she write?

904
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,692
You read it.

905
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:18,012
"Ho, ho, ho, little Susie.

906
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,582
Aren't you surprised
your mommy is so rich?

907
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,517
Give this green
stuff to Aunt Susie

908
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,518
for helping out

909
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,920
and doing so much for you.

910
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,354
Do you remember me?

911
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,923
Loves and kisses,
your crazy mom."

912
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,524
I think she's trying
to pay her debt.

913
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,359
She must have been stoned.

914
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,711
Ah, it's a holiday
thing, you know.

915
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:34,779
Brings out the ghost

916
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:35,914
of many a deadbeat relative.

917
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:39,517
I come from a long line of them.

918
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,486
I don't want her money.

919
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,653
My advice?

920
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:44,422
You take what you can get

921
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,679
and do not expect more.

922
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,748
Hey. Hi.

923
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:54,249
Daddy! Daddy!

924
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:57,118
Hi. How are you, baby?
You all right? Hmm?

925
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,053
This is Craig, Daddy.

926
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,188
Uh, Craig Simon.

927
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,173
This is my daughter, Amanda.

928
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:02,574
We were all in the
accident together.

929
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:03,775
Oh, hello.

930
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,777
Hi. We've spoken
on the phone before.

931
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:08,463
Oh, right. The appeals court.

932
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,265
Right.

933
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,017
The kids are fine.

934
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,352
Jennifer's got a
bad break to her leg.

935
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:15,720
It's a...

936
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,255
Compound fracture,
yeah. Talked to the doctor.

937
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,224
Right.

938
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,294
Uh, we were going to
a staff Christmas party.

939
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,062
A guy came out of nowhere.

940
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,531
Yeah, she's a terrible driver.

941
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:29,623
But I was driving.

942
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,205
Our car was squished, Daddy.

943
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,463
Mm...

944
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,577
Your head's all right?

945
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,601
Yeah. It's nothing.

946
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,488
I want to make sure that
Jennifer's going to be okay.

947
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:51,689
If it's all right with you,

948
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,291
I think we'll stick
around for a while.

949
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:55,282
Sure.

950
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:06,204
Randi...

951
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:07,973
Randi!

952
00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:09,174
It's going to be pretty hard

953
00:34:09,198 --> 00:34:10,708
for people to see through that.

954
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:11,943
They can walk around.

955
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,311
Okay, I'm getting out of here.

956
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:15,513
If you hear anything about
Mark, will you call my machine?

957
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:16,815
Sure.

958
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,416
Bad news for Joshua.

959
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,252
St. Joe's, Lacey Street,
Carnegie House...

960
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:21,853
All the residential
homes have a wait list

961
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:23,255
of about 600 years.

962
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:24,589
Yeah, well, it's
too late, anyway.

963
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:26,479
He left an hour ago.

964
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,228
He's too sick to be out there.

965
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:33,064
He's not sick enough
to stay in here.

966
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,000
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

967
00:34:35,024 --> 00:34:36,401
In rehab, I work with a patient,

968
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:38,036
I feel like I'm giving
them something.

969
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,037
We give them something.

970
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:40,038
We give them a Band-Aid

971
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:41,439
and send them back to the front.

972
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:42,774
Treat 'em and street 'em.

973
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:44,509
We do the best we can.

974
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,777
And when that's not good enough?

975
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,867
Most days, it has to be.

976
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,511
So you're familiar
with endarterectomy

977
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:04,646
for the prevention of stroke.

978
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,680
I've done some reading.

979
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:06,914
And you also know

980
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,383
that symptomatic patients

981
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,517
with stenotic lesions

982
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,085
do better with surgery

983
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,621
than with medical care alone.

984
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:13,655
Not all studies agree.

985
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,656
True.

986
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,759
When do doctors ever agree?

987
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,360
I assume you're familiar
with the CASANOVA trials.

988
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,596
Carotid artery stenosis
with asymptomatic narrowing,

989
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,264
operation versus aspirin.

990
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,916
Right.

991
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,702
And what did they find?

992
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:28,703
No benefit from endarterectomy.

993
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,772
Well, I'm about to
prove them wrong.

994
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,806
I really wasn't planning

995
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,376
on hiring third
years for my studies.

996
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,410
They don't have the skills.

997
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,611
I've got the skills.

998
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,612
Really?

999
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,613
Mm...

1000
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,548
You're arrogant as hell.

1001
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,017
I like that.

1002
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,252
Let's see those skills, doctor.

1003
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,210
Scrub in.

1004
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,049
Jennifer Greene?

1005
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,050
Hi. I'm her husband,

1006
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,051
Dr. Mark Greene.

1007
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,536
Doctor...

1008
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,254
I'm Dr. Musgrave.
Everything went well.

1009
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:04,939
Thank God.

1010
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,142
I took a look at the spleen.
No rupture, no lacerations.

1011
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,777
Ortho did an open reduction

1012
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:11,046
and internal fixation
of the midshaft

1013
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,248
comminuted fracture
of the right tib-fib.

1014
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,983
No complications.

1015
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,317
You can see her soon.

1016
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,086
How long do the
screws gonna stay in?

1017
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,121
About six months.

1018
00:36:19,145 --> 00:36:21,389
You can hold onto it.

1019
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,958
It's a copy.

1020
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:24,514
Thank you.

1021
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:31,171
Do you wanna translate for me?

1022
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,687
Hey...

1023
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:36,788
Oh!

1024
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:39,925
How are you?

1025
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:44,496
Let me look at you.

1026
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,030
Still ugly as sin.

1027
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,668
Let's get a drink.

1028
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:51,970
So what about this fancy dinner?

1029
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:53,237
Something wrong?

1030
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,740
Can't I just take you
to a nice restaurant?

1031
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:56,942
I would have been happy

1032
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,577
to throw something
together at home.

1033
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,612
Mom, just let me do this, okay?

1034
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,180
Well, suit yourself.

1035
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:03,682
Thank you.

1036
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:05,750
Um, what do you want?

1037
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:07,018
Champagne cocktail.

1038
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:08,252
Moet, please.

1039
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:12,445
I'll have a Manhattan,
straight up. Thanks.

1040
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,160
So how's my famous son doing?

1041
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:18,563
Well, I'm still fixing
kids for a living.

1042
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:19,764
How's Howard?

1043
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:20,932
I never see him.

1044
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:24,335
Year-end tax deadline.
I'm a CPA widow.

1045
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:25,359
What can I say?

1046
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,939
Have you heard from anyone?

1047
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:30,675
Besides the<i> Tribune</i>
calling about you?

1048
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,844
Anyone else?

1049
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:34,813
What's up, Douglas?

1050
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,815
Nothing is up.

1051
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,216
Now, don't even start.

1052
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
I know you.

1053
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,342
Dad called.

1054
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:46,357
What does he want?

1055
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:48,059
He saw me on TV,

1056
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,862
and he just wanted
to touch base.

1057
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:52,631
So what did you say?

1058
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:55,856
I told him to... get lost.

1059
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,504
He wants money.

1060
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,673
He's not going to
get any money, so...

1061
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:02,974
Does he think

1062
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:05,109
he can just waltz
right into our lives

1063
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:07,178
any damn time he wants to?

1064
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,948
I didn't tell you
this to upset you.

1065
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:13,952
He's up to something, Doug.

1066
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:15,676
Just forget about him.

1067
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,826
Hey... He can't touch us...

1068
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,384
ever again.

1069
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:55,782
Hi, Josh.

1070
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,064
How are you doing?

1071
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,587
Why do you ask that?

1072
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:04,435
It's beautiful.

1073
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:05,704
Mm...

1074
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:12,443
They destroyed this
in 1970... something.

1075
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:13,745
We're going to go

1076
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,680
and rebuild and...

1077
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,938
Josh, look. You forgot these.

1078
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,785
Thank you very much.

1079
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:21,820
We've been, uh...

1080
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:24,277
we've been expecting these.

1081
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:28,392
Is there anything else you need?

1082
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,029
We can... We can
always use, uh...

1083
00:39:31,053 --> 00:39:33,120
If you have pencils...

1084
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:37,669
Here, Josh.

1085
00:39:37,693 --> 00:39:39,626
Try and stay warm, okay?

1086
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:48,596
What did she say?

1087
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,332
She said, "Okay,
hon. Let's go home."

1088
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,935
Ah, the beauty of codependency.

1089
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,836
Hey...

1090
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,138
Hey...

1091
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,040
Jeanie and I are just
drowning our bad day.

1092
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,041
Over root beer.

1093
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,109
Ah...

1094
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,110
How was surgery?

1095
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,711
Slow. I held a clamp.

1096
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,712
Sorry about tonight.

1097
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,331
Did you guys have a date?

1098
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:08,183
A date?

1099
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:09,434
During med school?

1100
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,035
What, are you kidding?

1101
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:12,102
How many more years?

1102
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,104
Counting the Air Force?

1103
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:15,056
Air Force?

1104
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,841
She felt like she needed
a little more direction

1105
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:18,392
in her life.

1106
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,179
Did a lot of drugs as a kid.
Didn't do well in high school.

1107
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:22,614
15th in a class of 2,000.

1108
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:23,781
Could have done better.

1109
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:26,450
Um, in college, I
knew I wanted more.

1110
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:27,685
To be a fighter pilot.

1111
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:31,155
And a doctor, so one semester...

1112
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,657
This really good-looking
recruiter comes by...

1113
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,692
And I signed up.

1114
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:34,793
You have been listening.

1115
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:36,194
Yeah, I've been listening.

1116
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:37,796
They're paying for med school,

1117
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,964
and after residency, I give
them four years of service

1118
00:40:39,988 --> 00:40:43,068
Wow. My husband thought
I was an overachiever.

1119
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,720
Mm. She hasn't even
gotten to the astronaut part.

1120
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:58,488
Sorry! Ride's over.

1121
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:01,869
I forgot my soap.

1122
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,304
Oh, hi, Mrs. Bassett.

1123
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:06,207
Oh, your baby's getting so big.

1124
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:09,110
Oh. Well, actually, she's...

1125
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,747
Oh, and beautiful,
just like your mama.

1126
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:13,914
Thank you.

1127
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,816
She's really cute.

1128
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,153
Yes, you are.

1129
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:19,154
Good night.

1130
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,544
Good night.

1131
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,049
Hmm.

1132
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:34,735

1141
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:06,134
He knew about my house.

1142

I spoke with the doctor.

1161
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,630
Everything went really well.

1162
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,615
Rachel?

Yeah. He is.

00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,874
Oh, Mark.

1168
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:34,789
Oh, I know.

1169
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,759
We don't have to talk now.

1170
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:38,998
When you come home.

1171
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:47,023
I didn't want to tell
you before Christmas.

1172
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,561
I know.

1173
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,049
I know, Jen.

1174
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:12,048
You fell in love with him?

1175
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:17,820
I didn't mean to.
