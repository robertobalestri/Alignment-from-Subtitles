1
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,015
How you doing, Nurse Hathaway?

2
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,250
If I were driving,

3
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,314
we would have been there
by now, Paramedic Shepherd.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,737
You got to love these
late summer runs.

5
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,539
Especially up to Humboldt Park.

6
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,358
You ever been to
California and Division?

7
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,659
Yeah, that little outdoor cafe?

8
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:35,061
Cappuccinos every morning.

9
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:37,386
Yeah, well, slip that
vest on before you order.

10
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:52,145
We always promise
these rides'll be exciting.

11
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,013
We might have to wait
on those cappuccinos.

12
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:55,037
Yeah, right.

13
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:00,153
Excuse me. Excuse me, pardon me.

14
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,254
Are you taking the call?

15
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:03,055
We got this one.

16
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,390
Just relax, right. We're here.

17
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,058
He's cyanotic. Oh,
man, looks like he's lost

18
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:07,093
about four liters.

19
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:10,218
Doesn't look good.

20
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,200
Uh, multiple gunshot wounds,

21
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,435
chest, abdomen.

22
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,636
He's lost a lot of blood.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,188
Hey, Raul!

24
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,722
Yeah?

25
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,191
We've got Payaso over here.

26
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,525
He's not breathing, no pulse.

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,827
We're in full arrest.
How about you?

28
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,995
I've got brains all
over the asphalt, bro.

29
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,263
Well, then come over
here. We need you.

30
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,265
You can help me tube him.

31
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,183
You got it.

32
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:31,567
Here, you check his rhythm.

33
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,019
Come on!

34
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,993
Where's the
ambu-bag? Behind you.

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,508
7.5?

36
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,876
Come on!

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,211
A little cricoid pressure.

38
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,279
Got it!

39
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,963
You bag him.

40
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,815
I'm going to try and stick him.

41
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,800
Come on, dammit!

42
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:47,801
I think we're fine.

43
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:49,119
His name's Payaso?

44
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,120
It's a nickname.

45
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,838
It means "the little clown."

46
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,373
Worked on him, what,
about three times before?

47
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:54,857
Dumb-ass little kid.

48
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,493
You're really pissing
me off, Payasito!

49
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,512
Crackhead at 14.

50
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,646
We need a line.

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,314
I can't get a vein
anywhere here.

52
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:03,683
Pedro!

53
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,084
Hey, excuse me,

54
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,903
can we get a little crowd
control here, please!

55
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,605
Move, everybody! Move back!

56
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,673
Move back!

57
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,075
<i>Esta bien, senora.</i>

58
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,099
<i>Esta bien, por favor.</i>

59
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,379
Come in here.

60
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,602
Coming through!

61
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,821
One, two, three.

62
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,073
Give them room, give
them room. Back it up.

63
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:30,293
Six GBH.

64
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,328
Move it back!

65
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,929
Please, everybody, back up!

66
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,231
Back, back, back!

67
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,832
I need you all to
move back, please!

68
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,834
Back up! Out of the
way! Out of the way!

69
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:38,858
What's our M.A.R.?

70
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:44,724
Give him another amp
of epi in two minutes.

71
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,748
Got it.

72
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,581
Welcome to hell.

73
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,311
Lydia, you seen Carter?

74
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,667
Not lately.

75
00:03:58,872 --> 00:03:59,983
Hey, Kerry.

76
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,485
Hey, Peter. These your sprouts?

77
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,752
One ER rotation together

78
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,221
and that's what you
remember about me?

79
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,589
They're dead. I need the space.

80
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,624
So, uh, how's it going?

81
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:12,895
Uh, my first day here, and
I've only upset Doug Ross.

82
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,897
That's not too bad, huh?

83
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,748
You must be losing your touch.

84
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:17,751
Good to see you again, Kerry.

85
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:18,951
Thanks, Peter.

86
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,253
No can do.

87
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,554
That's not the kind of attitude

88
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:22,805
that we encourage
around here, Bob.

89
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,141
No can do, Dr. Ross.

90
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,676
You love saying that,
don't you? No can do...

91
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,843
Anybody seen Carter?

92
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,844
Anybody seen the chocolate donut

93
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,046
that Bob refuses to bring me

94
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,214
from the cafeteria?

95
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,915
He's in Exam 4.

96
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,251
Dr. Weaver said no
more food errands.

97
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,287
Inappropriate use of personnel.

98
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,922
You just love
Dr. Weaver, don't you?

99
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,442
It appeals to that whole
Germanic thing in you.

100
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,743
I am Polish.

101
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,179
Screaming twins, Curtain 2.

102
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,203
All right.

103
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,516
Morning, Susan.

104
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,517
Uh-huh. What have you got?

105
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,518
Fourteen-year-old,

106
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,653
multiple gunshot wounds.

107
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:54,821
Asystole, 2 amps epi,

108
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,022
2 mgs atropine in the field.

109
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,607
How long's he been down?

110
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,691
Thirty-five minutes.

111
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,243
Looking for miracles?

112
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,787
Two liters of normal
saline already in.

113
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,216
On my count.

114
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,669
One, two, three.

115
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,887
Slumming with the paramedics?

116
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,556
Yeah, recertifying for my MICN,

117
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,957
so pretty much.

118
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,158
Come on, Payaso,

119
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,211
you've survived
worse than this before.

120
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,275
He's in fib. Let's shock
him. Two hundred.

121
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,548
Four units O-neg.

122
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,967
Crash 5. Got the loop.

123
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:24,968
Clear?

124
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,070
Clear.

125
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:30,023
Three hundred. Clear? Clear.

126
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,024
360?

127
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:32,392
Yup. Clear.

128
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,863
No breath sounds
on the left side.

129
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,214
Hemothorax. Chest tube tray?

130
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,248
Got your O-neg.

131
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,283
Another amp of epi?

132
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,785
Yeah, let's high-dose him,

133
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,941
five milligrams.

134
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,625
Scalpel.

135
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,827
Bag.

136
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,934
Tube.

137
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,188
Oh, man, the
blood's pouring out.

138
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,639
Shh, he's still asleep.

139
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,056
God, we had such
a night last night.

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,575
You wouldn't believe it.

141
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,743
Triple MVA... Car
versus horse trailer

142
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,778
in the middle of Chicago.

143
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,429
What a mess.

144
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,147
I had such a blast,

145
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,983
but we didn't get
to bed till 5:00,

146
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,885
and now, I am late for rounds.

147
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,837
So if you are still here
when he wakes up,

148
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:20,273
will you tell him I said thanks?

149
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,329
Thanks.

150
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,367
Carter...

151
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,269
Carter!

152
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,772
There's already 1500
CCs in the Pleurovac.

153
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,773
Thoracotomy tray?

154
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:37,774
Let's do it.

155
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,775
Time down?

156
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,399
Uh... Forty-four minutes.

157
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,062
Aw, jeez, there's
a bucket's worth.

158
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,714
Haleh, get some lap pads.

159
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,099
Somebody get a light in here.

160
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:48,651
Double MVA at the back
door. What have you got?

161
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,085
Multiple gunshot
wounds to the chest,

162
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,187
full arrest...

163
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,188
Susan?

164
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,206
High dose epi, atropine,

165
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,573
4 units O-neg.

166
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:55,925
He's exsanguinated
into the left chest.

167
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,393
Your pals are
pulling up to the curb

168
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,594
You might give them a hand.

169
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,262
I work here. Nurse Manager.

170
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,263
Kerry Weaver. Chief Resident.

171
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,649
How long has he been in arrest?

172
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,016
Forty-five minutes.

173
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,452
Too late for miracles. Let's
call it. We need the room.

174
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,770
It's my case, Kerry.

175
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,405
We got a 7-year-old kid
and his mom coming in

176
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,506
who we can save.

177
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,774
We've got a
14-year-old on the table...

178
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,758
Who we can't.

179
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:15,127
Call it.

180
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:16,462
What was that time?

181
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:17,497
Forty-five down.

182
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,731
Susan.

183
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:20,833
Susan.

184
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,357
All right. I'm calling
it. Time of death, 7:19.

185
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:28,591
Someone call Housekeeping.

186
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,276
Poor tidal volume. No response.

187
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,277
Another gurney please!

188
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:33,662
Tube him and use number six.

189
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,598
Mannitol? 30 grams.

190
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,599
We need x-ray in here!

191
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,407
Welcome to hell.

192
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,927
Absolutely nothing
happened, I can assure you.

193
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,829
You know, she must
have made the other bed

194
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,565
because that's where
she was sleeping,

195
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,400
because, you know,
we didn't do anything.

196
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:56,101
Carter, do I look
like your father?

197
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,503
No. Actually, not at all.

198
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:58,504
I don't care what you did

199
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,572
or didn't do,

200
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,607
except for oversleep,
which you did,

201
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:02,608
and despite your extended nap,

202
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,210
I'm going to assume

203
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,944
that you're fully prepared
for this morning's surgery.

204
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,146
Absolutely.

205
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,947
Good, because I'm
going to work your ass off.

206
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,349
Good. Great, because
we're doing the, uh...

207
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,017
Thoracic outlet syndrome.

208
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,041
Right.

209
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,236
Carol!

210
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,237
You scared me.

211
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,173
I know. I do that
to a lot of people.

212
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:34,907
Sorry...

213
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,742
and I'm sorry I didn't
realize who you were earlier.

214
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,144
Oh, that's all right.

215
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:41,214
You, uh, enjoying
paramedic ride-along?

216
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:43,416
Yeah, it's kind of fun
being out for a change.

217
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,417
Good, you know,

218
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,485
I've been
reorganizing a little bit.

219
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,287
Can I run some things by you?

220
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:48,288
Okay.

221
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:49,289
The doctors really need

222
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:50,323
to write down their orders

223
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:51,324
when they give them.

224
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,925
No more of this
three-hours-later crap

225
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,027
and blaming the
nurses if it's not done.

226
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,028
That'd be great.

227
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,530
And I think that
residents are capable

228
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,199
of cleaning up after procedure,

229
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:00,200
don't you?

230
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,601
Are you going to tell them that?

231
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,002
Sure, why not?

232
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:05,004
And they're going to stop
peeking through the charts

233
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,506
picking the most
interesting cases.

234
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,850
I mean, you don't get a
choice. Why should they, right?

235
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,512
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

236
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:13,802
Already is.

237
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,059
So, thoracic outlet syndrome.

238
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,497
I really haven't had
a chance to, um...

239
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:32,498
It's the lung, right?

240
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:34,901
Don't get me started
on the Brigham.

241
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:35,902
What?

242
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,169
They bring me in

243
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,337
to set up their
emergency medicine

244
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:39,972
training program.

245
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,941
They keep me on
the line for six months.

246
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:43,843
Damn thing never
got out of committee.

247
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:44,911
Bunch of mud-phuds.

248
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,161
Mud-phuds?

249
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,764
MD/Ph.D..

250
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,700
Bench scientists doing research.

251
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:55,171
Running gels, chopping up DNA.

252
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,172
Northern blots,

253
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,606
Western blots, Southern blots.

254
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,891
Blots?

255
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,727
Don't get me wrong.
They're good people.

256
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,777
They're smart people,

257
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,763
but they couldn't
diagnose a cold

258
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:06,299
if it stood up and
sneezed on them.

259
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,351
So you must be pretty
glad to be back, then.

260
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,286
You bet you!

261
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,421
Give me a good sick body,

262
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,856
needs a little slicing,

263
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,324
and I'm a happy man.

264
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,925
Go find Benton, will you?

265
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,828
I believe we're ready.

266
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,296
Maybe it's just too
complicated for tonight.

267
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,698
No, no, no, no. I
want to see you.

268
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,699
I just, um...

269
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,267
I promised Jackie I would...

270
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,619
Uh, Dr. Benton,

271
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:28,020
I think that all he really needs

272
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,021
is some active
resistance therapy

273
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,856
for that left leg.

274
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,395
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's good. I, uh...

275
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,363
I, uh, I promised Jackie
that I'd pick up Steven

276
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,814
after football practice.

277
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,017
Walt's down with the flu.

278
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,141
My class is over at 7.
I can make it by 7:30.

279
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,312
How about 8?

280
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,697
Al's off at 10.

281
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,435
Tsk...

282
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,323
Oh, man.

283
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,339
Yes, you're my yummy yummy.

284
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,208
Hey, Bob! You seen big Susie?

285
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,243
At the desk.

286
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,811
You look very sharp.

287
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,146
Thank you.

288
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,816
Did you hear that, bumpkin?
She says I look sharp.

289
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,152
Hi, Susie!

290
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,336
Chloe, what are you doing here?

291
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,605
Oh, I'm running so late.

292
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,691
Will you take the baby
to daycare, please?

293
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,843
We're learning Windows.

294
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:24,877
I cannot miss
class this morning.

295
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,262
It's very complicated.

296
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,463
How are things at Midwest Biz?

297
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,698
You know the academy?

298
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,900
Yeah, night school,
two years ago.

299
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,234
If you need any help,

300
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,986
I'm actually pretty good
at all that computer stuff.

301
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,921
Oh, thanks, Jerry.

302
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,856
She should have
been here an hour ago.

303
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,725
I know, but don't
I look sharp, huh?

304
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:40,759
Yeah, you do.

305
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,783
Hello.

306
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,981
Okay. Thank you, Susie.

307
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,850
Okay, so you're going to
pick her up after work, okay,

308
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,218
because I got that job fair.

309
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,219
That's tonight?

310
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,054
I put it on our weekly schedule.

311
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,689
Yeah. That's right,
that's right. I forgot.

312
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,691
Okay. Bye, Susie.

313
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,709
Bye, sweetie!

314
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,244
You need any help?

315
00:11:58,268 --> 00:11:59,245
No.

316
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,246
Shh...

317
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,247
Excuse me.

318
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,082
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

319
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,584
Okay, yeah. Shh...

320
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,535
So just hold up his arm.

321
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,403
He's a pretty big guy.

322
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,506
Oh, yeah. 380, easy.

323
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,530
Big arm.

324
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:15,694
You know, you'd think we'd have

325
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,296
some kind of
pulley thing for this.

326
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,816
Watch the pleura.
Don't want to puncture it.

327
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,817
We do.

328
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,818
We do?

329
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,153
Hold it up higher, Carter.

330
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,937
Keep the neurovascular
bundle out of the way.

331
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,790
Uh, let's Bovie

332
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,259
this little fella, please.

333
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,111
So the, uh, pulley
thing, it's not working?

334
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,417
Periosteal elevator.

335
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,500
What did he do?

336
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,567
Overslept.

337
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:41,237
Well, this will
teach him a lesson.

338
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,472
Yeah, well, that's
what we're here for.

339
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,607
To teach him, right, Carter?

340
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,109
Don't...

341
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,278
move that arm.

342
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:53,049
Just out of curiosity,
how long is this surgery?

343
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,066
I need the rib cutter.

344
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,057
And, uh, Bovie, please.

345
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,543
So Rachel had her pancakes,

346
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,677
then threw up at 6:30.

347
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,313
Jen had a breakfast meeting.

348
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:08,614
I missed the first train out.

349
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:10,249
While I'm waiting for two hours

350
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,317
at the station,

351
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:12,751
I start talking to this guy

352
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:13,952
named Gozukizil.

353
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:15,688
So he's heard I'm a doc, right?

354
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,789
Next thing you know,

355
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,323
he's pulling down his pants.

356
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:20,759
He wants to show me
some mole on his butt.

357
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:21,927
I don't think I'm cut out

358
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,562
for this commuting thing.

359
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:24,763
Yeah, Mark, that's
really interesting

360
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,499
but it's just been
a lousy morning.

361
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:28,233
I've got a crying
baby in my arms...

362
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,635
Here's the diaper bag...

363
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,637
So maybe we can talk

364
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,771
when I get back from day care.

365
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:33,772
Sure.

366
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:34,840
Oh, I see

367
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:36,292
Kerry Weaver made it in.

368
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,210
Have you had a
chance to meet her yet?

369
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,211
Oh, yeah.

370
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,513
She's in, all right,

371
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,814
and I've definitely met her.

372
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:42,882
Good.

373
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,483
Great call on the new
chief resident, Mark.

374
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,306
Really special.

375
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,583
Hi, Al. It's me.

376
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,784
Hi.

377
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,353
Uh, listen, I'm sorry, honey.

378
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,821
I hate to do this again,

379
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,823
but they changed the
study group schedule.

380
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,858
Yeah, for tonight.

381
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,494
I know, but what can I do?
<i>Well, how about a late dinner?</i>

382
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,565
No, I probably won't
get out till midnight.

383
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,134
No, no problem.

384
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,702
It was running
fine this morning.

385
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,637
Started right up.

386
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,639
Yeah, I'll be careful.

387
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,675
Okay, thanks...

388
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,332
and, Al, I'm sorry.

389
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,048
Okay.

390
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,017
I'll see you tonight.

391
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,108
Okay, bye.

392
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,661
Sticky bag lady for you.

393
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,863
Maple syrup would be my guess.

394
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,165
Yeah, it was a real mystery.

395
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,199
She fell

396
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,234
while trying out
her new rollerblades

397
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,435
down on Michigan Avenue.

398
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,670
Want to take her, Susan?

399
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,853
Gee, I really would,

400
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,556
but I've already taken
the next patient in line.

401
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,590
Rhinorrhea with otitis,

402
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:58,624
Exam 5.

403
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,792
Okay.

404
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,260
Conni, let's get a room.

405
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:03,718
Oh, man, I hate the sticky ones.

406
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,432
Oh, you got another one?

407
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:08,217
Yeah. Hitchhiker.

408
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,352
Flagged us down on the way in.

409
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,453
She asked for you personally.

410
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,887
Loretta, right? Mm-hmm.

411
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,339
Same room?

412
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:15,024
Sure. Why not?

413
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,308
Looks like she's doing

414
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,910
the old PID Shuffle.

415
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,711
Pelvic inflammatory disease.

416
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:20,901
Occupational hazard.

417
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,283
I just bring them in.

418
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:27,386
I don't need to
know what they have.

419
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,155
Five hundred
milligrams tetracycline

420
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,589
and a dose of mebendazole

421
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,091
for the baby with the pinworm.

422
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:33,159
There you go.

423
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,360
Now, I've written them all down.

424
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:35,428
Are you happy?

425
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,829
And those will be
generic, Dr. Ross?

426
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,432
Yes, Haleh, those
would be generic.

427
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:41,867
Mrs. Beals, I'm Dr. Ross.

428
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:43,803
This is Haleh Adams,

429
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,587
and you must be Byron.

430
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,473
Yeah. He burned himself.

431
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,957
I'll say.

432
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,792
Let's take a look.

433
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,694
Yeah, boy.

434
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,962
It looks kind of...

435
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,471
kind of cool and
gory-looking, though, huh?

436
00:15:58,674 --> 00:15:59,969
You feel that?

437
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,004
Yeah? So you say this
happened while you were at work?

438
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,472
The manager called me.

439
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,975
He had the cops and
the fire department there.

440
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,644
They were all yelling

441
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,229
So I grabbed Byron here
and I brought him here.

442
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:11,463
The manager?

443
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,149
Yeah, we live in a motel.

444
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,484
The Harbor View.

445
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,502
Although there's no harbor,

446
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:18,487
and there's no view.

447
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,379
Byron set the room on fire.

448
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,576
I guess we probably

449
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,234
don't live there anymore.

450
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,733
What is the
differential diagnosis

451
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,867
for pelvic pain?

452
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,469
Ectopic pregnancy?

453
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,637
Appendicitis?

454
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,688
And...

455
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,172
Stress in the workplace.

456
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:39,432
What else?

457
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,429
Mittelschmerz, PID,

458
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:44,497
endometriosis,

459
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:46,532
ruptured ovarian cyst,

460
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:47,533
to name a few more.

461
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:48,534
My money's on PID.

462
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,136
You had it before?

463
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,905
Yeast infection,
urinary tract infection...

464
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,807
Not much I haven't had.

465
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,191
Tests?

466
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,860
CBC, lytes, pregnancy,

467
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,230
cultures for GC and chlamydia.

468
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,637
Barinski?

469
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,784
Pelvic ultrasound?

470
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:06,919
Not quite yet,

471
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,220
but let's assume for the moment

472
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,988
that it is PID.

473
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,172
How do you want to treat her?

474
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,044
Ceftriaxone

475
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,547
and Zithromax.

476
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,104
She is way ahead of you here.

477
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,187
Joanie, how is she?

478
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,523
Oh, Susan, thanks for
coming up so quickly.

479
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,541
What's wrong, little one?

480
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:29,708
Are you okay?

481
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:30,776
She's burning up.

482
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,860
I think it's just
a slight fever,

483
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,346
actually, but you
know the rules,

484
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,646
no fevers, no infections.

485
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,349
Yeah, yeah. Thank
you for calling me down.

486
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:38,084
I want to get her
checked out right away.

487
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,552
I'm sure it's nothing
serious, Susan.

488
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:41,154
Did you call Chloe?

489
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:42,321
No, this is one
of her class days.

490
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,339
You're the contact.

491
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,157
Oh. Right.

492
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,326
I figured you might want
to take her downstairs first.

493
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,662
Yes, yes. Thank you.

494
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:51,863
I don't know who's
in worse shape,

495
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,131
mom or the kid.

496
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,866
Let's worry about the kid first.

497
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,967
Get a hold of Jack Chandler,

498
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,436
child psychiatry.

499
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,638
I don't know if he's on
today, but track him down.

500
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,207
He owes me a favor. Okay?

501
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,208
Okay.

502
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:03,342
Thank you, Haleh.

503
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,110
Doug, Doug, I need
you for little Susie.

504
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:06,345
Fever retrieval from day care.

505
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,513
Maybe she should
go straight to Pedes.

506
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:08,647
Let me just take a look here.

507
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,316
What's the story
with this little one?

508
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,650
She's burning up.

509
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,719
Well, not really.
I'll check her out.

510
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:14,720
Might be roseola.

511
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:15,721
She looks

512
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:17,022
like she might
be getting a rash.

513
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:18,757
I don't actually see that.

514
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:19,791
Maybe she's bacteremic.

515
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:20,959
Is there anything going around?

516
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,528
Always, always.

517
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,730
Big Susie, why don't
you go on your break

518
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,198
and let your
friendly pediatrician

519
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,133
take a look?

520
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:29,768
Okay? Yeah, okay.

521
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:30,769
Come here.

522
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:31,770
Thanks. Bye.

523
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,239
Dr. Lewis?

524
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,741
Dr. Weaver asked if you could
take the bounce-back back pain

525
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:36,742
in Exam 6.

526
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,009
Ah, bounce-back back pain.

527
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,144
Right, sure, and Bob,

528
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,613
could you do me a favor

529
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:41,780
and call my sister for me?

530
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:42,781
Chloe Lewis.

531
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,650
Midwest Business Academy.

532
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,785
The number's on a card
in my wallet in my bag

533
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,854
in a drawer in a
desk in the lounge.

534
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:49,955
Tell her Susie's sick

535
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:51,490
and she needs to
come pick her up.

536
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:52,791
Bag, drawer, desk, lounge.

537
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:53,959
Thank you.

538
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,261
Got it.

539
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:57,095
So what do you want to do?

540
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,767
How about some Jim
Beam and call it a day?

541
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,968
Well, we should get a CBC

542
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:04,503
and a Chem-7.

543
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:05,604
Lytes?

544
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:06,705
Lytes are in the Chem-7,

545
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,106
but before we order any tests,

546
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,942
why don't we
observe the patient?

547
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,606
What's wrong with him?

548
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:17,049
Okay, does the fact
that he's bright yellow

549
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,750
suggest anything?

550
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:19,785
He's jaundiced.

551
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,453
Probable alcoholic,
uh, hepatitis.

552
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:22,838
I'd start him on a banana bag

553
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,496
and check his LFTs.

554
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,078
Carter, take this whiny guy.

555
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,279
Frequent flyer

556
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,447
complaining of stomach pain.

557
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,187
Exam 4.

558
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,753
Betadine, Kerlix,
adult no-necks.

559
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,922
God, I love County.

560
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,724
These private hospitals
get all bent out of shape

561
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,191
if you try to steal
their supplies.

562
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,860
Stealing supplies?

563
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,795
We were just saying

564
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,864
how it's not really considered
theft here at County.

565
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,232
I know. I was joking.

566
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,300
There's

567
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,151
a Mrs. Rodriguez here.

568
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,554
You brought in her
son this morning,

569
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:55,788
a 14-year-old.

570
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:57,823
Anyway, someone
said you knew the family.

571
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:58,857
I think it's probably best

572
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,227
if they hear it from
someone they know.

573
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:02,366
Sorry.

574
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,318
I don't know the family.

575
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,776
I've never seen them before.

576
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,724
This is...

577
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,260
this is not what I do.

578
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,667
Why don't we put
this stuff down?

579
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,001
What was his name again?

580
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,836
Uh, Payaso.

581
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,870
No, that's a nickname.

582
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,038
It's, uh...

583
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,697
It's Carlos, I think.

584
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,012
Mrs. Rodriguez,
I'm Carol Hathaway.

585
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,580
I'm a nurse here
at the hospital.

586
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,022
<i>Senora, no hablo ingles.</i>

587
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,856
Go ahead.

588
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,191
Your son Carlos

589
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,335
was brought in this morning.

590
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,433
He had multiple gunshot wounds

591
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,568
to his chest.

592
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,569
We tried to save him

593
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,393
for 45 minutes.

594
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,979
We used all our capabilities,

595
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,982
but his heart
stopped, and he died.

596
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,105
I'm very sorry.

597
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,650
His name is Rawlings.
He's 51 years old.

598
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:31,917
Acute onset of right groin pain

599
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:33,152
last evening,

600
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:34,219
accompanied by
nausea and vomiting

601
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:35,220
times three.

602
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,422
No bowel movement
in the last 24 hours

603
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:38,457
and notes a previously
reducible mass

604
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:40,426
that suddenly became
tender and non-reducible

605
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,027
after sneezing several days ago.

606
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,596
He's currently on no medications

607
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,963
and has no allergies.

608
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,499
Upon physical exam,

609
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:48,301
a small, tender,
non-reducible mass

610
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:49,852
was appreciated in
the right groin area,

611
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:50,952
consistent with a
strangulated hernia.

612
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,354
All right, don't
just stand there.

613
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,022
Let's get him up to the
O.R. Let's move. Come on.

614
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,156
IV and foley are in.

615
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,575
CBC and lytes are back.

616
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,943
O.R.'s been notified.

617
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,044
Carter, you ordered all that?

618
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,079
Yeah. Good pickup.

619
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:02,314
Thanks. I was examining...

620
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,899
All right, let's
just get him up.

621
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,768
Come on, move. Clear! Clear!

622
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,153
I think you're the only resident

623
00:22:07,177 --> 00:22:09,054
whose handwriting
the nurses can read...

624
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,756
Well, that's something.

625
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,957
So let them read it.

626
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:13,025
Break down the meds

627
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,927
when you're ordering them, okay?

628
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:16,128
I don't want a screw-up

629
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,629
because some nurse
forgot the heparin.

630
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,031
Actually, the nurses here

631
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:20,299
are pretty good, Kerry.

632
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:22,334
The nurses here are
downright great, Susan.

633
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,158
I think they deserve
that from the rest of us.

634
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,773
Oh, good, Doug. How is she?

635
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,275
She's fine except
for the noise factor

636
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,643
and a slight cold.

637
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,378
She'll be fine in a day or so.

638
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:34,980
Thanks, Doug.

639
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,715
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

640
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:37,817
You just have a little cold

641
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:38,951
is all.

642
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:39,985
That's all. That's all.

643
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:40,986
It's okay. Dr. Lewis.

644
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,987
Yes?

645
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:42,988
It's okay.

646
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:45,374
Your sister isn't there.

647
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,676
Did they say where she went?

648
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,827
No, they said she
hasn't been there

649
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,229
in three weeks.

650
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:51,913
What do they
call it, "drop off"?

651
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,233
Dropped out?

652
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:55,489
Yes.

653
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,909
You're kidding, Bob, right?

654
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:11,739
Shh.

655
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,379
Why don't you give me a hand?

656
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,403
Susan?

657
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,233
Susan,

658
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:30,386
Bob tells me you've
been sitting here

659
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,870
for 20 minutes. Shh.

660
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,607
Are you in some
kind of a fugue state?

661
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:37,843
Shh.

662
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,112
We've got a trauma coming in.

663
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:41,380
A bank robber.

664
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:42,664
Some little old lady

665
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:43,883
mowed him down

666
00:23:43,907 --> 00:23:45,384
while he was fleeing the scene.

667
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,988
Hit him with her car.

668
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,389
It's all very exciting.

669
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:53,742
Malik will watch the baby.

670
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,778
I slid the peanut under
the spermatic cord.

671
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,246
What's a peanut?

672
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,748
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

673
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,848
I keep forgetting

674
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,250
that you haven't
done surgery yet.

675
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,636
It's a small clamp with
some gauze on the end of it.

676
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:05,854
I'm sorry.

677
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,072
Are you sure you
don't mind this?

678
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:08,139
I mean, I could
probably practice

679
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:09,191
on some patient.

680
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,609
No, no. You, uh...

681
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,078
You're actually
pretty good at it.

682
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:14,430
Yeah, but I missed one
earlier this morning and...

683
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,914
Oh, in that case,

684
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:18,072
I think the veins
are a little over there.

685
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:20,919
Yeah.

686
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:22,354
It's a pretty complicated
surgery, actually.

687
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,555
I was really surprised

688
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,856
that Dr. Benton let me
Bovie those bleeders.

689
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,658
You're kidding.

690
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,026
Mm-mm.

691
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,828
I didn't think med students
got to Bovie anything.

692
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:31,096
It's very rare.

693
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,315
Did you do it in that
surgery this morning?

694
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,217
The thoracic outlet
syndrome? No.

695
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,618
That's pretty much
standard stuff.

696
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,270
They didn't really need
me too much on that.

697
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:40,222
Hey. That looks pretty good.

698
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:43,175
Maybe I could draw
some blood later.

699
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,699
Sure.

700
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,329
Carter.

701
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,627
BP's 100/50,

702
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:03,028
pulse, 120.

703
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:05,531
Blunt trauma to the
abdomen, both legs and head.

704
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:07,032
Car threw him around 15 feet,

705
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,900
knocked him right
out of his sneakers.

706
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,869
Cops kept questioning him

707
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,338
as if he wasn't gorked
out or something.

708
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,162
They were following
us all the way in.

709
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,377
On my count...

710
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,080
One, two, three. Now, please.

711
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,247
Love your work.

712
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,348
Always.

713
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:25,183
Let's go. Hurry up, Connie.

714
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,169
Oh, we have a child bank robber.

715
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,454
Get a CBC

716
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:29,805
type and cross-match,

717
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,841
6 units, Chem-7.

718
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:32,975
Get a Foley in.

719
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,744
We need some x-rays.
Cross-table C-spine.

720
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:35,794
Chest, pelvis,

721
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:36,996
and both lower extremities.

722
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,563
Connie, could you please call

723
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:39,998
for the portable, now?

724
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,183
Connie, get some O-neg down here

725
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,339
while you're at it.

726
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,353
How you doing, Susan?

727
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,354
Really well. Thank you, Mark.

728
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,405
Has your day gotten better?

729
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:47,840
Good bilateral breath sounds.

730
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:49,208
Actually, no.

731
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:50,809
Seems to be a little
tension in the workplace.

732
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:53,579
Holy moly. Check this out.

733
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:56,181
Whoo-wee. Lottery time.

734
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:57,233
You think anyone will notice?

735
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,867
I know I won't.

736
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,469
He needs a peritoneal lavage.
Can we get that prepped?

737
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,059
And where the hell's the Foley?

738
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,771
All right, let's get
that lavage going.

739
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,361
Hey, you boys,
want one of these?

740
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,212
What?

741
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,364
It's kind of a
policy thing with us.

742
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:29,732
Wet-Naps are for wimps.

743
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,633
Oh, yeah?

744
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,536
Well, it might help clean off
some of that primordial ooze.

745
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,972
What?

746
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,307
Hey.

747
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,692
Why's 23 here?

748
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:43,183
Maybe there are
multiple victims.

749
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,150
Hey, Larkey,

750
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,335
the boys at dispatch
screw up again?

751
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,337
Nah.

752
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,338
We were out cruising
for snow cones

753
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,638
heard the call.

754
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:55,090
Is this the seizure?

755
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,126
Heat prostration. Fell down.

756
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,161
Started mumbling in Lithuanian,

757
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,913
which our junior
ticket taker there

758
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:03,933
diagnosed as a seizure.

759
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,434
Okay.

760
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,986
Well, it looks like you have
everything under control here.

761
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,655
Your rig's a little
sloppy, though.

762
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,756
Hey, some of us

763
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,774
are trying to work here.

764
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,942
Yeah. Hey, Larkey.

765
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,751
So, where are those snow cones?

766
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:24,903
You did excellent
work today, Carter.

767
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,059
Oh.

768
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:29,475
A lot of students freeze up

769
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:30,609
on their first Bovie,

770
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:31,677
but you were calm, steady.

771
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:32,944
Morgenstern was impressed.

772
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:34,113
Really?

773
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:35,330
So was I.

774
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,498
Vaguely.

775
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,167
Choledocholithotomy,

776
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,368
first thing in the morning.

777
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,769
And then I can scrub in?

778
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,204
7 a.m.

779
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,805
Dr. Benton, about the
IV thing that happened...

780
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,041
Carter, just don't oversleep.

781
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,464
Right.

782
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,341
I'd always heard
banks put dye in

783
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:03,642
with stolen money.

784
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,244
Well, I guess it's better

785
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,911
than being puked on

786
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,980
but, uh, harder
to get out, I hear.

787
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,014
Yeah.

788
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,049
I don't suppose

789
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:12,618
we get to keep the money.

790
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:14,386
God knows, County
could use it, huh?

791
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,475
No, I don't suppose.

792
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:20,326
I understand your
niece has a cold.

793
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,915
Mm.

794
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,082
Well, fluids

795
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,250
and fever-control measures.

796
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,567
Yeah, Malik's looking
after her in Room 5.

797
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:32,037
I saw her.

798
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:33,906
She is quite adorable.

799
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,341
Thank you.

800
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:37,547
Susan...

801
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,347
You got a little spot

802
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:45,039
right there, under your chin.

803
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:55,811
Can I come in?

804
00:28:55,835 --> 00:29:00,132
What is this, Grand Central?

805
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,733
Are you all right?

806
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:03,101
It's just dye, Mark.

807
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,536
That's not what I meant.

808
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,271
It hasn't been a
very good day, okay?

809
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:07,639
I know you're
worried about the baby

810
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,640
but it's just a cold.

811
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,708
Rachel used to get them

812
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:10,742
all the time.

813
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:11,877
She still gets
them all the time.

814
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:13,245
I know you're the expert, Mark,

815
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:15,247
but you don't need to tell
me that children get colds.

816
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,715
Doug Ross has told me that,
Kerry Weaver's told me that.

817
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,133
Believe me, I get it.

818
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,768
I didn't know that you and
Kerry were close enough yet

819
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:20,803
to be, uh...

820
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,070
talking about little Susie.

821
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,474
She told me about calling
that code this morning.

822
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:26,558
Mark, she is irritating as hell,

823
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:27,810
and you know it.

824
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,377
Well, I'll admit that
she has a style...

825
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,829
Problem? Challenge.

826
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:35,734
You would think on her first
day she'd at least try and be nice.

827
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:37,598
Maybe she thinks
that way about you.

828
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,091
Sorry.

829
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,893
You think you're going to
be able to handle this okay?

830
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,296
Do I have a choice?

831
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:50,599
Take a look.

832
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,634
No, thank you.

833
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:53,201
It's great.

834
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,887
It's high,

835
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:56,104
which means it's scary.

836
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,240
Compared to what
you do for a living?

837
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,574
I'm very careful down there.

838
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:00,848
I'm being careful.

839
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:04,329
Man, and I'm a wimp
for using a Wet-Nap?

840
00:30:04,353 --> 00:30:06,865
That's different.

841
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:07,999
Oh, it's a policy kind of thing?

842
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,023
Yeah.

843
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:11,770
It's, like...

844
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:12,988
whoever's driving the car

845
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,456
gets to pick the music,

846
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,191
except for country,
which is unacceptable,

847
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,359
and whoever drives gets to pick

848
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,444
where we stop for lunch.

849
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:21,246
They decide who
stays in the ambo

850
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,965
and who goes up
on the Ferris wheel.

851
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,250
Raul never gets
to drive, does he?

852
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,124
No.

853
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:30,589
So, if you're so
afraid of heights

854
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:32,091
what are we, um...

855
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:33,509
what are we doing up here?

856
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:36,049
I figured we should
have a little quality time.

857
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,550
So, this is a
sacrifice on your part?

858
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:44,620
Yes, you could say that.

859
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,054
Not to mention the
sacrifice Raul's making

860
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,789
in staying on the ground.

861
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,747
Who?

862
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:55,764
Okay, one more time.

863
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,667
Excuse me. Dr. Ross?

864
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,624
Uh... Mrs. Beals.

865
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,507
Could you excuse
me just for a second?

866
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,508
It's not really Mrs.,

867
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,509
but that's okay.

868
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,510
Look, I really need

869
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:09,545
to make the afternoon shift

870
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:10,679
or I'm going to lose my job.

871
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,448
Byron will be okay
with you, right?

872
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,351
You can't leave yet.

873
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,852
I have to, or they'll fire me.

874
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,821
I'm just going to have
to take Byron with me.

875
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:20,422
Byron has to still see

876
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,724
the child psychiatrist.

877
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:22,825
He's in there with him now.

878
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,626
Dr. Ross, please.

879
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,362
I really need this gig.

880
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,263
Okay. All right.

881
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,347
We'll, uh...

882
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:30,365
we'll watch out for Byron.

883
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,267
You get back as soon as you can.

884
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,418
Okay. Thanks.

885
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:34,787
Oh, thank you, Haleh.

886
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,621
When did you reach
Jack Chandler?

887
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,911
I haven't.

888
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:45,180
Where's my mom?

889
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,681
She'll be back.

890
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,050
Probably gym class, right?

891
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,784
I don't even go to school.

892
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,553
I don't have to anymore.

893
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,654
Where's my mom?

894
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,222
Uh, Dr. Meyers, can I see you

895
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,223
down the hall just for a second?

896
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,358
Yeah, sure.

897
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:57,392
Byron, we'll be right back,

898
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,982
okay, buddy?

899
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,866
So, this kid is a real mess.

900
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,802
Who the hell are you and
what are you doing in there?

901
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:08,020
Psych resident.

902
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:09,354
I'm trying to help
this 9-year-old.

903
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:10,889
Yeah, well, this just
isn't the kind of case

904
00:32:10,913 --> 00:32:12,291
you can just poach out of the ER

905
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:13,391
Hey, I was called
down here, okay?

906
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:14,459
By who? By whom.

907
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:16,461
By Dr. Weaver, chief
resident. Code red!

908
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,413
Somebody call the
damn fire department!

909
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,581
Just rip it out! Rip it out!

910
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,582
Open the door!

911
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,583
I got it.

912
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,668
Byron!

913
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,874
Byron!

914
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:27,706
Byron!

915
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,740
Where's the kid?

916
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:29,764
What kid?

917
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,260
What kid?

918
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,645
Call security, will you?

919
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:36,436
Byron!

920
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,701
Hey.

921
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:42,153
Hey, are you okay?

922
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:43,655
Come here. Let me see.

923
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,224
It's okay.

924
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:46,258
Everything's
going to be all right.

925
00:32:46,282 --> 00:32:47,693
Where's my mom?

926
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:48,860
You kind of had me scared there

927
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:49,950
for a minute.

928
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:55,867
Where's my mom?
We'll get you your mom.

929
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,836
Where's my mom?

930
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,371
It's okay.

931
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:00,639
Where's my mom?

932
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:04,348
It's all right.

933
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,033
This thing break
down on you again?

934
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,069
You should have called me.
I would have come out here

935
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,204
and helped you. Al...

936
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:16,939
you know Peter
Benton, don't you?

937
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:18,040
Remember, I did
some physical therapy

938
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,274
for his mother last year?

939
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,475
My husband, Al.

940
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,576
Yeah. You came by
the house once, right?

941
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,746
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

942
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,747
Surgeon, right?

943
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,683
Uh, resident.

944
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:28,950
Well, yeah.

945
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,936
You know, surgical resident.

946
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,688
You know anything
about distributors?

947
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:33,755
Peter's brother-in-law

948
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,974
is a mechanic.

949
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:37,876
His mother talked
about her family...

950
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,828
a lot, all the time.

951
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,331
Sounds like my mom, doesn't it?

952
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:44,333
Listen, uh...

953
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,767
is there anybody
you want me to call?

954
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,819
No, no. I think we got it.

955
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:49,020
Why don't you give it a try?

956
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:50,044
Yeah, okay.

957
00:33:56,252 --> 00:33:58,663
There you go. We got it.

958
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,499
I got to get us some
new wheels, man.

959
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,101
This thing's shot.

960
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,269
Hey, it's good to see you again.

961
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,773
Yeah. Take care.

962
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,106
Mrs. Beals, please...

963
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,341
I told you, there is no "Mrs."

964
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,576
Cindy, okay?

965
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,677
Please don't leave yet.

966
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:30,878
Byron's a very sick little boy.

967
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,380
He needs psychiatric help.

968
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,648
He could have burned himself up

969
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:34,815
in there.

970
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,983
Look, I'll take him to work.

971
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,552
He likes that.
He'll be okay there.

972
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,719
Listen. Okay.

973
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,887
Taking him to work

974
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,556
is not going to solve
any of his problems.

975
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,090
Well, neither are you.

976
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,376
Look, I really
appreciate your help

977
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,877
and I'll do all
the follow-up stuff

978
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:47,928
for his hand,

979
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:48,913
but I've got a cousin

980
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:50,198
who's going to put us up

981
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,532
and she's waiting out in the car

982
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,067
and she's got a
bunch of kids home,

983
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,091
so we really do have to go.

984
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,805
Someone going to
answer the phone?

985
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:15,973
Hey, Bob. What's going on?

986
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:17,458
What's happened to you?

987
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,547
What do you mean?

988
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,097
Oh, we were goofing
around on that last run.

989
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,166
You know, sticking our
heads out the window and stuff,

990
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,389
the way dogs like to do it.

991
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,204
It's a good look, Carol.

992
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,805
Hey, Bob, have you
seen Dr. Weaver?

993
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:31,829
Suture Room.

994
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,508
That bounce-back
migraine's here again.

995
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,810
Not now, Jerry.

996
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,662
Only trying to get you
out in time for your train.

997
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:39,614
Curtain 2.

998
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,870
Thank you.

999
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,336
We tend to run out
of Vicryl before nylon

1000
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,737
and the lidocaine with the epis

1001
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:48,072
always low, and the 25-gauge...

1002
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,475
Kerry, excuse me, but
would this be a good time?

1003
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:51,709
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

1004
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,378
I appreciate your staying late.

1005
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,717
Sure.

1006
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,083
Who the hell gave you the right

1007
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,318
to call in a psych resident

1008
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:01,835
on one of my patients?

1009
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,305
The nine-year-old pyromaniac?
Seemed appropriate.

1010
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,672
We were waiting
for Jack Chandler,

1011
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,142
who, as I think you know,
specializes in children.

1012
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,410
Chandler's not on call today.

1013
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,395
He was giving me
a curbside consult.

1014
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,147
You're not even
on the curb, Doug...

1015
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,115
He was going to stop by.
Kerry, he owes me a favor.

1016
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,283
You're asking

1017
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,385
an extremely
distraught 9-year-old

1018
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,387
and his extremely
distraught mother

1019
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,788
to hang around, delay treatment,

1020
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,189
so you can have some
buddy come by and chat?

1021
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,759
So instead you send in
some prepubescent resident

1022
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,093
who upsets the kid so much

1023
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,795
he sets the curtains on fire.

1024
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:31,382
He set the curtains on fire
because you left him alone.

1025
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,801
If Chandler comes
in on a curbside,

1026
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,670
he's not going to write
anything in the chart,

1027
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,055
he's not going to be
responsible For any follow-up.

1028
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,389
Where does that leave the kid?

1029
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:39,640
And where's that kid left now?

1030
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:40,908
His mother took him out of here

1031
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:41,943
AMA.

1032
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,427
And whose fault is that?

1033
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,579
The psych resident

1034
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,013
was not managing his case, Doug.

1035
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,336
You were.

1036
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,319
I'm out of here.

1037
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:52,619
Doug...

1038
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,388
I said that I'm off.

1039
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,522
Doug, come on.

1040
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,790
Wait a minute, okay?

1041
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,359
Did I miss something here today?

1042
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,526
Let's just say

1043
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,527
that the last train to Milwaukee

1044
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,528
is in 48 minutes,

1045
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,930
and I plan to be on it.

1046
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,715
So now's not a
good time to tell you

1047
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:05,849
you've got a blunt
trauma to the chest

1048
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:08,086
pulling up to the back door?

1049
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,142
See you tomorrow.

1050
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:19,753
<i>Dr. Harrison to ICU.
Dr. Harrison to ICU.</i>

1051
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:42,787
You okay?

1052
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:44,589
I'm afraid to move.

1053
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:46,957
Every time I do,
she starts to cry.

1054
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:48,693
It's an amazing sound, really.

1055
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:49,994
Tell me about it.

1056
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,596
I got two of them at home

1057
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,631
and a new one on the way.

1058
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,650
Congratulations.

1059
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:56,817
I didn't even know.

1060
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,985
No one does.

1061
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,987
I guess I just announced it,

1062
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,922
but when you got to move them,

1063
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,058
you got to move them.

1064
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,750
Take your chances.

1065
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,030
Oh, Conni, I'm sorry
about my attitude today

1066
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,198
In that trauma.

1067
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,235
You were pretty
pissy, all right,

1068
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:15,870
but it was worth it

1069
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,927
just to see you take
that green splash.

1070
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,095
Here. You want
to try a hand-off?

1071
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,363
Yeah.

1072
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,514
Oh.

1073
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,305
There she goes.

1074
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,410
Shooting.

1075
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,176
We need a 12-lead EKG.

1076
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,994
Let this be a lesson
to you, Daniel.

1077
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,363
Never try to catch
a running back

1078
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,714
with your chest.

1079
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,166
I can't breathe too well here.

1080
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,784
Well, take it easy.
You're gonna be okay.

1081
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,370
It's just a bruise, right?

1082
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,538
He's hyperventilating.

1083
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,539
Yeah, you would be
too if you took a helmet

1084
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,574
to your solar plexus.

1085
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:56,010
Get a pulse ox.

1086
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,794
BP's falling, 70/40.

1087
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:58,796
Pulse ox is 92.

1088
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,498
Great. Put him on a mask.

1089
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:01,632
Six liters.

1090
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:02,900
Is something wrong?

1091
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,635
Yeah, Daniel, you
should've tackled lower.

1092
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:05,987
Blood gas is back.

1093
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,372
PO-2, 65.

1094
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:08,740
PCO-2, 28,

1095
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,691
pH, 7.48.

1096
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:11,993
Okay, he's hyperventilating

1097
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,510
but his PO-2's way too low.

1098
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:14,545
Shortness of breath.

1099
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:15,746
Acute hypoxia

1100
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,015
in an otherwise
healthy 15-year-old.

1101
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,151
JVD, muffled heart sounds,

1102
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:21,352
crashing BP...

1103
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:22,937
Pericardial tamponade?
Blunt trauma?

1104
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,672
It happens.

1105
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,891
What's a pericarpal tempernard?

1106
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:28,092
Is that something bad?

1107
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,977
I can't breathe too well.

1108
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,879
I can't breathe. Twelve-lead?

1109
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:32,913
No time.

1110
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,815
Pericardiocentesis tray.

1111
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,750
It's a bizarre thing, Daniel,

1112
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,385
which makes you
a very bizarre guy,

1113
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,603
but we like that around here.

1114
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,205
There's bleeding

1115
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:43,708
in the sack around your
heart, so it's not beating right.

1116
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,876
We're going to numb the area

1117
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,578
and then we're going
to insert a needle

1118
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,113
and drain the blood.

1119
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,931
You're going to stick
a needle in my heart?

1120
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:51,999
Don't worry, Dan.

1121
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,702
I've done it a thousand times.

1122
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,353
John, why don't you
move in for a better look?

1123
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:59,207
Sure.

1124
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:03,778
I'm using a subxiphoid approach.

1125
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:06,480
Forty-five degree angle.

1126
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,482
We're aiming

1127
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,784
at the left shoulder,

1128
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,805
drawing back as you
advance the needle.

1129
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,473
Cool.

1130
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,131
See, Dan, there's nothing to it.

1131
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,727
BP's coming up. 100/60.

1132
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,095
Mark, didn't you say something

1133
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,965
about catching a train?

1134
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,299
Oh, no.

1135
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:26,534
Oh, oh...

1136
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:28,969
God, please... um,
thanks. Good night.

1137
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,244
Night.

1138
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:39,029
When were you going to tell me?

1139
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:41,165
I tried, Susie.

1140
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,534
I really did.

1141
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:45,603
Hey, I got another job
for a couple of days.

1142
00:40:45,627 --> 00:40:47,271
Waitressing.

1143
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:48,695
Made 110 bucks.

1144
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,412
School was too hard.

1145
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:57,415
They had all these
different programs.

1146
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:58,449
You had to move

1147
00:40:58,473 --> 00:40:59,750
this file into this file.

1148
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:01,218
It just...

1149
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:03,788
it made me feel so stupid.

1150
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:04,955
All the other
girls in the class,

1151
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:06,590
they already knew how to type

1152
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:07,658
and how to write
business letters.

1153
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:09,092
I always thought
a letter was, like,

1154
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:11,484
a letter, you know?

1155
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:17,000
They had all the right clothes.

1156
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:19,002
I didn't have any of that stuff,

1157
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:20,404
except for what I
borrow from you,

1158
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:21,972
and even then,

1159
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:25,376
it doesn't look right on me.

1160
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,379
I really wanted this.

1161
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,815
For Susie.

1162
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,884
And to show you

1163
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,675
that I could do it.

1164
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:47,732
I didn't tell you

1165
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,300
because

1166
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,892
I knew that I would
disappoint you.

1167
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,144
And because I
thought that just maybe

1168
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:03,503
this time I wasn't
going to screw up,

1169
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:10,643
but...

1170
00:42:20,054 --> 00:42:22,522
What happened to
the waitressing job?

1171
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:37,737
Good night, Chloe.

1172
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:05,965
Hold on!

1173
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,352
Hey, wait!

1174
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:14,590
Damn!

1175
00:43:43,905 --> 00:43:46,150
Enjoying the view?

1176
00:43:46,174 --> 00:43:49,687
I'm glad you came by.

1177
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,922
I wasn't sure you would.

1178
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:54,424
I wasn't sure you'd want me to.

1179
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:55,559
No, no, no. I'm glad.

1180
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,427
I, uh...

1181
00:43:57,451 --> 00:44:00,998
Look, you know, Jeanie, I, uh...

1182
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:04,301
I thought I could
do this but, um...

1183
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:07,237
We can't. I know.

1184
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:11,608
We've talked
about all this before.

1185
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:12,777
It's just...

1186
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:13,878
it's hard.

1187
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:17,536
Yeah, well, so is this.

1188
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:22,141
You got to tell him.

1189
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:30,649
You got to tell him.
