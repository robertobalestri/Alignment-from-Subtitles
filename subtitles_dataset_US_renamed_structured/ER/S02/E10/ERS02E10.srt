Ho ho, ho-ho, ho ♪♪

2
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,841
It's freezing out there, babe.

3
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:31,648
Carol?

4
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,516
What are you doing?

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,552
Oh, the furnace
went out in the night.

6
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,254
I tried to start the
pilot, but I think it's shot.

7
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,556
It's below zero in here.

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,692
It's not so bad when
you start moving.

9
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,359
There's frost on the blankets.

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,630
I thought you said

11
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,432
we weren't going to
try to use that fireplace

12
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,300
until the chimney
sweep checked it out.

13
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,953
No, look. I just have
to pull this thing.

14
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,288
Oh!

15
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,891
Come on.

16
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:07,260
Let's just go out and
get some breakfast.

17
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,061
I'll never get someone

18
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,997
to come here and
open it before Christmas.

19
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,500
Well, let's just have
Christmas at my place.

20
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:15,034
At least I have
heat and plumbing.

21
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,703
I've got plumbing... almost.

22
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:19,372
I wanted to wake up here
on Christmas morning.

23
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,608
You know, the tree was
going to look so beautiful.

24
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:23,109
So it's a little chilly.

25
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,711
We'll put something
under the door, you know,

26
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:26,212
to stop the draft.

27
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,782
That's not a draft.
That's a gale-force wind.

28
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:30,450
We're going to get pneumonia.

29
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:31,918
Put on some socks.

30
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:33,386
Look, old houses are chilly.

31
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,955
Some...

32
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,657
Some houses need show shovels

33
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,894

straight from the 4th floor,

56
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,193
the Recovery Room Choraliers.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,764
Recovery has way too
much time on their hands.

58
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,165
Well, thanks again.
You guys are great.

59
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,567
We can't wait to hear you folks.

60
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,551
Us folks?

61
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,886
4:00 on our floor.

62
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,887
You promised.

63
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:41,888
Who promised?

64
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:42,923
Carol Hathaway.

65
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,224
See you then.

66
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,026
Oh, I'm sorry I'm going
to miss Carol's solo.

67
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,827
You ever heard her
sing? She needs your help.

68
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,029
Uh-uh. I'm off at 3:00,

69
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,031
and I got all the
kids still to buy for.

70
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:52,032
I can't carry a tune.

71
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:53,033
So, who's representing the docs?

72
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:54,267
You need a consult, right?

73
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,403
Uh, yeah. I believe
that the dulcet baritones

74
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,404
of Mark Greene

75
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,473
would be a fine
addition to any ensemble.

76
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:02,208
That's what he
gets for being late.

77
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,577
He's at the attorney's
this morning.

78
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,578
Not letting any grass grow

79
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,813
under that split-up.

80
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:08,614
Couldn't he and Jen
wait till after the holidays?

81
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:10,317
Uh, no. The hospital attorneys.

82
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:13,086
His deposition on the
O'Brien wrongful-death suit.

83
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,821
The pregnant woman last winter?

84
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,656
Oh. Oh! Ugh.

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,042
In case his holidays
weren't cheerful enough.

86
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,277
The important
thing is to stay calm

87
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,146
and stick to the facts.

88
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,548
I am calm.

89
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,200
Well, then, maybe you
should take off your coat.

90
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:28,368
Sure.

91
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:31,204
Mark, this is going
to be a long process.

92
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:32,672
It could be another year

93
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,140
before we reach a settlement.

94
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:35,408
Or go to trial.

95
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,876
We'll try to avoid that.

96
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,578
And why is that again,

97
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:41,881
if there's no obvious
breach of standard?

98
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:42,882
But in a case where

99
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,083
the injuries are inflammatory,

100
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:45,819
like leaving a
newborn motherless,

101
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,520
we'd still prefer to settle.

102
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:48,521
And if we settle,

103
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,656
it goes on my
record permanently?

104
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,676
Looks better than losing

105
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,400
a 1.5 million judgment at trial.

106
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,184
I gotta use the men's room.

107
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,743
Back there.

108
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:10,793
Whoa! Hey, whoa, little guy.

109
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:14,836
Mr. O'Brien.

110
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,434
Dr. Greene.

111
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,219
He's doing well.

112
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:25,174
Yes, he is.

113
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,175
Come on, Mark.

114
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,839
They're ready to begin.

115
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:35,968
What is this?

116
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,003
"Living Nativity
on Ice" v. Zamboni.

117
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,305
What?

118
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,006
First Korean Baptist youth group

119
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,608
waiting to rehearse
at the Skate on State.

120
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,143
Zamboni driver plowed
right into the manger.

121
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,177
Six injured, I think.

122
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,379
What's the bullet on this one?

123
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:47,480
Multiple trauma.

124
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,081
Complaint of pain in
legs, ribs, and head.

125
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,249
Vitals stable.

126
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,251
LOC for approximately
two minutes. GCS 15.

127
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,252
Moves extremities
times four now.

128
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,487
IV saline.

129
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,889
Okay, get X-ray down here
and do a CT On her head.

130
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,947
Uh, check out the lamb.
Put the Virgin Mary in 3.

131
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:03,563
Oh, careful. Looks like
partial thickness burns

132
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:04,664
to forearms and hands.

133
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:06,766
I didn't even want to be a lamb!

134
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,300
Okay, let's get some
cool saline dressing.

135
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:09,469
How'd she get burnt?

136
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:11,203
The Zamboni
shoots out hot water.

137
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,605
Lucky she landed
flat on the ice.

138
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,206
Ow! It hurts!

139
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,443
75 Demerol, 25
Vistaril. I'll be right back.

140
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,412
Somebody help my son!

141
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:21,013
Can you feel this?
Wiggle your fingers.

142
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,382
Ma'am, did he lose
consciousness?

143
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,116
No? All right. Come
here. What's your name?

144
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,185
I'm a wise man. Did
they have names?

145
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,687
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

146
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,255
Right you are. There you go.

147
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,424
Okay, take a seat.

148
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,225
Please tell me you
weren't using a real infant.

149
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,527
Jesus was a doll.

150
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,228
Thank you. Who's this?

151
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,563
Zamboni driver.

152
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,565
Fell five feet from the
driver's seat onto the ice.

153
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,589
LOC on the scene.

154
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,636
Ooh! Smell that breath.

155
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,092
Merry Christmas.

156
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,450
So you're asking to observe
this morning's clamp-and-run?

157
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,052
Yup, because I
missed your last two.

158
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,253
And at the same time,

159
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,454
you're telling me
you didn't finish

160
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,455
last night's discharge
summaries?

161
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,656
I'll catch up right
after surgery.

162
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,825
Plus I kind of implied
to Macy I'd be there.

163
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:29,859
Macy? The patient's wife.

164
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,061
They were really
nervous last night.

165
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,896
He's got a history
of thoracic aneurysm.

166
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,265
They thought his
backache was a strain

167
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,466
from putting up
the Christmas lights.

168
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,867
Ah, which you
chatted about last night

169
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,669
instead of finishing
your charts,

170
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,505
so this morning,
you're going to do

171
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,106
what you were
supposed to do last night.

172
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,574
The patient... No, the patient

173
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,309
will not notice that
you're not there.

174
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,710
Carter, this is
not a social hour.

175
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,180
This is surgery.

176
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:51,481
This is surgery.

177
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,899
The Star of the East

178
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:55,302
is heading up for a
tooth reimplantation.

179
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:56,503
You're overreacting.

180
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:57,904
It's just a couple
of Christmas carols.

181
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:58,905
I don't know any.

182
00:07:58,929 --> 00:07:59,906
"Jingle Bells."

183
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,174
Everybody knows "Jingle Bells."

184
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,010
Never heard of it.

185
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,444
And... I can't sing in public.

186
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:05,479
Why?

187
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:07,080
I hate it when
people stare at me.

188
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:09,182
Oh, I can tell.

189
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,651
Things were pretty wild
around here for a while.

190
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:13,753
It seems to be
under control now.

191
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,855
Yeah? How about with you?
How'd your deposition go?

192
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,257
♪ Fa la la la la... ♪

193
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:18,425
Hey, Mark, that's the spirit.

194
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,493
How about 4:00?

195
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:21,794
4:00. Uh, I... I can't make it.

196
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:23,330
It's a miracle

197
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,065
none of those kids
were critically hurt.

198
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,666
You know, the cops
are charging that driver

199
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,068
right now.

200
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,469
They can charge him with a DUI

201
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:30,737
on a Zamboni?

202
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,155
No, ZUI.

203
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,440
Last year, I gave her
a T-bond for Christmas.

204
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:36,476
She accuses me of
not being romantic.

205
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,678
But, thinking long-term...

206
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,212
That's exactly what I said.

207
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:41,014
You know, I mean, a
diamond may be forever,

208
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,716
but hey, a ten-year
maturity at six percent

209
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,084
is not chopped liver.

210
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,953
This year I had a brainst...

211
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,256
Uh... damn.

212
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,092
Bender, could you,
uh... do me a favor

213
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,195
and open me up a
new brush? Thanks.

214
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,097
This year on Christmas morning,

215
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,598
I'm getting her 10
shares of AT&T.

216
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,766
It's Benton.

217
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,769
Right. Next day,
she gets 20 shares

218
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,270
of General Electric.

219
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,273
On the third day, 30
shares of Dupont, right?

220
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,809
On the fourth day, I'm gonna...

221
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

222
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,011
You gotta repeat this for Carl.

223
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,512
Later, please.

224
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,314
I'm here to tell you
we can all relax.

225
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,649
It seems that our patient
has had second thoughts,

226
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:18,819
and he's withdrawn his
consent for the procedure.

227
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,721
Doesn't he realize

228
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,723
that he was our last
chance to beat the clock

229
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:24,024
before the new year?

230
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:25,458
Can't we change his mind back?

231
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,360
Well, actually, Dr. Benton and I

232
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,062
are going to find
that out right now.

233
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,351
If you care to join me?

234
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:31,921
Sure.

235
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,503
That's a pretty nasty cut
you got there, Mr. Calus.

236
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,073
Stan. And it's my own fault.

237
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:43,076
I've been carving the toys
by hand for a million years,

238
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,945
but business has
gotten so hectic,

239
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,813
I went to a power jig and router

240
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,848
for some of the
more popular items,

241
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,834
like the rolling
ducks on a stick.

242
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,335
Oh, I love those.

243
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,337
What a great job, making toys.

244
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,073
Got rich and fat without
even asking for it.

245
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,208
Sometimes, though,
I miss the old days,

246
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,578
just me and my old
lady packing up the VW

247
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,146
and hitting the craft fairs.

248
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,548
Now I've got a whole crew

249
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,716
working for me 'round the clock.

250
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,586
Still can't keep up
with the back orders.

251
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,255
Well, this hand's
going to slow you down.

252
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,558
Lucky we're down to
shipping and handling.

253
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,125
I hate to disappoint any kids.

254
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,478
When was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

255
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:19,946
Oh ho...

256
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,048
it's been ages.

257
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:24,016
Well, the doctor's
probably going to want you

258
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,052
to have one.

259
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:28,605
You would make a great Santa.

260
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,106
Ah!

261
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,774
I bet you hear that
pretty often, huh?

262
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,532
Eh, this time of year.

263
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,515
So, it goes with
the territory, Peter.

264
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,917
I mean, if you're
going to develop

265
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,118
cutting-edge techniques,

266
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,120
you'd better learn how
to sell it to the masses.

267
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,122
I mean, I know it's
a pain in the ass,

268
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,592
but if you find the simple
metaphor for people,

269
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,294
you could help define
the procedure for yourself.

270
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,796
Hmm. I can imagine. Yeah.

271
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,931
We had the same problem
with endarterectomies.

272
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,733
Nobody knew of them.
Nobody wanted one.

273
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,435
At first, I shied away from
the Roto-Rooter metaphor.

274
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,104
I thought it was
a bit too crass,

275
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,438
but in the long run,

276
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,974
that's what people
can understand.

277
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,008
Now, why don't you see

278
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,209
if you can get the Chamberlains

279
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,276
to understand?

280
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,277
I'll do my best.

281
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,113
Well, here we go.

282
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,115
Mr. Chamberlain. I'd like
you to meet Dr. Benton.

283
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,382
He works with me.

284
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,689
Pleased to meet you.

285
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,240
Elderly victim of a
carjacking coming in.

286
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,809
Head trauma with ALOC.

287
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,810
How nice.

288
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:24,811
Here you go.

289
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,412
This is my Christmas bonus?

290
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,014
A hearty handshake
and a "job well done"?

291
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:31,851
No, that's a check for my share
of tonight's Christmas party.

292
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,252
I love it when the docs pay.

293
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,888
Yeah, especially
when we guilt them

294
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,056
into booking the Knickerbocker.

295
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,623
Hey, is everybody dressing up?

296
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,292
I'm going to wash
behind my ears.

297
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:41,294
Hey, they're pulling up now.

298
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:42,862
Listen, I noticed
that you signed up

299
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:44,530
for Christmas Eve
and Christmas Day.

300
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:45,765
I don't mind working then.

301
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,833
Oh, me either.

302
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:48,301
Kerry Weaver
made the same offer,

303
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:50,403
but Jen has got
Rachel in Dayton,

304
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,205
and I won't get her back
until Christmas night,

305
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:53,406
so I'd just as soon work.

306
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,808
Okay, well, if you
change your mind.

307
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:55,942
Carjack victim?

308
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,143
Unidentified female
pulled from her car

309
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:00,997
at the corner of
Roosevelt and Ashland.

310
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:04,433
Some Salvation Army
bell-ringer saw the whole thing.

311
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,336
Said she hit her head
on the curb pretty hard.

312
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,556
BP's 160/120.

313
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,957
She was awake en
route, but disoriented.

314
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:15,978
We got two IVs of normal
saline, O-2 15 liters by mask.

315
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:19,148
All right, let's do it
on my count... gently.

316
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:23,353
One, two, three.

317
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,121
Cross-table C-spine,
and, uh, get a head CT.

318
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,724
She's going to
be a sore little lady

319
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:28,825
at Christmas Mass.

320
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,560
I don't think
this little old lady

321
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,429
goes to Mass.

322
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,748
What's that?

323
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:36,750
She's a survivor.

324
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:37,751
Of what?

325
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,441
Concentration camp.

326
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:45,140
All right, let's get a
CBC, type and hold,

327
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,743
spin a crit, dip
the urine for heme,

328
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,379
update her tetanus, and
hang a gram of Ancef.

329
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:52,382
The technique that
you gave consent to is...

330
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,450
I don't know techniques.

331
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:58,454
Macy said she wants to
wait, and that's fine by me.

332
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,573
Macy is your wife? Yes.

333
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,392
Well, maybe we
should talk to Macy.

334
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,576
Be my guest.

335
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,978
I don't blame you one bit.

336
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:06,746
You have every
right to have cold feet.

337
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,880
Carter?

338
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:09,281
Dr. Benton,
Dr. Vucelich. I was just...

339
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,084
I bumped into Macy in
the cafeteria having coffee,

340
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:13,686
and I was just explaining to
her that she's not the first spouse

341
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,122
to have second thoughts
on the day of major surgery.

342
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:17,523
I feel like a fool.

343
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,576
Well, you're not.

344
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,410
Flip-flopping this way and that.

345
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,496
I guess I'm pretty
much scared to death.

346
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,498
Hope you don't
think I'm crazy, honey,

347
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,099
but after talking
to Dr. Carter...

348
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:30,003
I know. You're not a doctor yet,

349
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:32,555
but I feel so much better...

350
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,976
So if it's not too late, can
we get on with the surgery?

351
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,976
Yes.

352
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,944
Yes, ma'am, we certainly can.

353
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,496
Is Mr. Carter free to join us?

354
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,449
Yes, I am.

355
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,285
Do you know where you are?

356
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,387
Good news for her.
The police just called.

357
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,056
They found a car matching
the eyewitness' description

358
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,025
off the 290 in a snow
bank near Berkeley.

359
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:55,445
If she's Hanna Steiner,
she's got her car back.

360
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:56,979
Hanna? Are you Hanna Steiner?

361
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,032
Uh... yeah.

362
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,166
You're in a hospital.

363
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,618
You were pulled from
your car at a stoplight.

364
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,786
Oh.

365
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,854
We're just going to
check you out here

366
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,457
and make sure
everything's all right.

367
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,458
Oh no.

368
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:09,809
But you need to stay calm,

369
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,478
'cause you've got...
you've been hit in the head.

370
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,480
Tirzah. What about Tirzah?

371
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:14,481
Tirzah?

372
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:17,967
The baby. Oh, my
God... the baby.

373
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,336
What baby?

374
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,689
My granddaughter.
She was in the car.

375
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:25,841
She was in the car seat.

376
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,494
They didn't say
anything about a baby.

377
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:29,996
Is she okay?

378
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,114
Call the police.

379
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,165
Oh, no.

380
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:33,199
Tirzah!

381
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:34,200
Mrs. Steiner. Mrs. Steiner.

382
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:36,535
Try and stay calm
and lie still, okay?

383
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,337
The police are going to
do everything they can.

384
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:39,471
No! No!

385
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:42,274
Get me back that
police dispatcher again.

386
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,676
It's about the carjacking.

387
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,102
Just try and relax.
Breathe easy.

388
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,001
She's refused the Ativan

389
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,603
and doesn't want to go for a CT.

390
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,273
I think she's still hoping
to hear some good news.

391
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,862
Mmm. Me too.

392
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:00,892
Any news?

393
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,061
Not yet.

394
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,495
We're still trying
to reach your son.

395
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,564
That won't do any good.
They live too far out.

396
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,967
Mrs. Steiner, are you
sure you don't want Ativan?

397
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:08,984
It will calm you down.

398
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,754
I never should
have driven with her.

399
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,472
We need to finish
your evaluation.

400
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,040
If you go for a CT,

401
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:19,262
I promise I'll come find you
as soon as we hear anything.

402
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,765
You really need a CAT scan.

403
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,668
Like a<i> loch in kop.</i>

404
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,876
No, to make sure you
don't have a<i> loch in kop.</i>

405
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,262
Hole in her head.

406
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:36,750
Okay.

407
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,481
I'll go.

408
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,799
Mark, your wife's on the phone.

409
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,968
I'll take it in the lounge.

410
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:48,490
But please... find me
if you hear anything.

411
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,514
I will.

412
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,077
You think they're okay?

413
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,079
She'll love them.

414
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:55,414
You're sure?

415
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:57,883
I mean, they're 22 karat.

416
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:59,752
They're beautiful.

417
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:02,421
I mean, they're not, like,
real rubies or anything.

418
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:05,758
Yeah, but... they're
really, really lovely.

419
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,092
You still here?

420
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,762
I'm leaving right now.

421
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:11,764
They're perfect for her.

422
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,098
Red is her color.

423
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,634
Mmm.

424
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,036
No, Jen. No.

425
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,438
I'm not gonna let you
walk all over me on this one.

426
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:20,639
You should have thought of it

427
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,741
before you started
screwing your coworker.

428
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,443
Hey.

429
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,511
Oh, man. Jen had
the nerve to suggest

430
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:27,913
that Rachel stay
with her in Dayton

431
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:28,914
for two more days.

432
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,115
What for?

433
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,917
Some skating party
Rachel's cousins are having.

434
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,118
Jen is really pushing it.

435
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:34,887
She's the one having an affair,

436
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,488
and I'm supposed to
give up my daughter

437
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:37,506
at Christmas.

438
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,608
She really has
great timing, huh?

439
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,010
Mid-December kamikaze strike.

440
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,511
Maximize pain and suffering.

441
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,697
And I know you don't
want to take it out

442
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:46,998
on Rachel.

443
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:48,184
Of course not.

444
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,751
I'm taking Susie over

445
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,754
to Cookie and Henry's tomorrow.

446
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,791
It's, uh, dreadful
family fare, and...

447
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:56,992
we'd love you to join us.

448
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,993
Thanks, but...

449
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,244
Dr. Greene?

450
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,213
Randi has Mrs. Steiner's
son on the phone.

451
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,214
He's calling from Glen Ellen.

452
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:05,334
I'm on my way. Later.

453
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,370
Somebody hit fast forward?
Carl, you're at warp speed.

454
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,373
You should have seen
my mother darn a sock.

455
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,009
Time?

456
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,643
You're at 55 minutes
and 30 seconds.

457
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,512
Well, gentlemen, we're
about to make a run

458
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,880
for beating the clock.

459
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,566
Personal best still
stands at 57:07.

460
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,033
Peter, you're a lucky man.

461
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,368
Am I?

462
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:25,704
You have a student
who talks to patients.

463
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,639
Must save you a
lot of headaches.

464
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,576
Sometimes.

465
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,177
How many of these
have you assisted on?

466
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,312
This is my fifth.

467
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:35,597
Really? You ready
to finish this one?

468
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,633
Yeah.

469
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,935
Really? And still have
us break the record?

470
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,837
Now, don't say yes
unless you can be sure.

471
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,672
I'm sure.

472
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,607
All right. Carter,
do the suctioning.

473
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,176
Simon, watch the clock.

474
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,962
Come on. 56:14 and counting.

475
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,865
All right, now, go
inside-out on the aorta,

476
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,066
outside-in on the graft.

477
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,084
That's right.

478
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,602
Long bites. Move it along.

479
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,838
Pick up the pace. Come
on, find your stroke.

480
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,424
56:30.

481
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,441
That's it. Don't... Don't...
don't twist the Gor-tex.

482
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,910
Go, go, go. Pull up the slack.

483
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,228
57 on the nose.

484
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,862
Okay. Ready to tie off.

485
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,448
Do it, Carter. Cut it
at three millimeters.

486
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,105
57:06.

487
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,001
Did it.

488
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,003
No, not yet. We still
have to check for leakage.

489
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,455
Release the distal Satinsky.

490
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,623
Looks good.

491
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,642
Proximal clamp.

492
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,642
Looks very good.

493
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,627
Time?

494
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:22,628
57:16.

495
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:24,163
Oh, isn't that too bad?

496
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,497
We didn't break the record.

497
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,871
Would have been a nice
way to ring out the year. Hmm?

498
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,639
Randi, did Mrs. Steiner
come back from CT yet?

499
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:34,840
On her way.

500
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,041
Any news on her granddaughter?

501
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:37,576
Must be 20 miles of highway

502
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,545
between here and
where they found the car.

503
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:40,846
People are sick.

504
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,048
Well, the parents are on
their way in from Glen Ellyn.

505
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,049
And in this weather,

506
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,467
it's going to take them a while.

507
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,692
Oh, my poor roof.

508
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,373
Mlungisi?

509
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,708
Kerry!

510
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,699
Mlungisi.

511
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,836
I came straight
from the airport.

512
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,729
If you'll have me.

513
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:16,938
I was just about
to go on a break.

514
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,491
Uh... everyone,
this is Mlungisi.

515
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:24,389
Hi.

516
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,907
My pleasure.

517
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,477
I'll be back in half an hour.

518
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,212
Fine.

519
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,603
Mark, Mrs. Steiner's back.

520
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:40,839
No?

521
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:43,141
Not yet. They're
still searching.

522
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:46,111
My son and I could
use some help here!

523
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:47,312
We need a doctor!

524
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,446
Uh, Dr. Ross!

525
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,648
Dr. Ross!

526
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:50,782
Right this way.

527
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:52,317
He took a bullet
in his shoulder.

528
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,519
Okay. Are you all right?
Can you walk on your own?

529
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:55,587
Yeah, yeah.

530
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,788
Hang tough, kiddo.

531
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,791
Trauma 1!

532
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,793
She's only been
missing a short time.

533
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:04,796
Now, don't give up.

534
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,800
I guess I don't
have to tell you that.

535
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:10,802
Mm-hm.

536
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,804
It's easier when you're young.

537
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:17,142
You know nothing else.

538
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:21,146
They call you, uh...
"dirty Jew" in school.

539
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,149
You've seen the worst of people.

540
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:25,772
And the best.

541
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,106
This little baby...

542
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,808
She's so sweet.

543
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,911
They just wanted the car.

544
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,815
I don't think they
would hurt her.

545
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,701
But they would.

546
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,437
No.

547
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:49,942
You go on after
you have seen evil.

548
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,276
Oh, you laugh,

549
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,246
you work, you have children.

550
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,666
You don't let it own you.

551
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,003
That's your revenge...

552
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,659
To live.

553
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,311
And then...

554
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,881
something like this,

555
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:18,687
and you know that it
can all be taken away.

556
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,423
We still hope for the best.

557
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,692
Yeah. You hope.

558
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,811
You know what I was thinking
when I was upstairs here

559
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:29,548
in this... this machine,

560
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:31,767
lying so still?

561
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,836
I did something

562
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,507
that I stopped
doing 50 years ago.

563
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,715
I prayed to God.

564
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,716
You know Yiddish, Dr. Greene?

565
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,069
A little from my grandmother.

566
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,005
But you are a religious man?

567
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,042
I'm the son of an agnostic Jew

568
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,843
and a lapsed Catholic.

569
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:02,046
You're no good at all.

570
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,823
I can't ask you, you...
to pray for my family.

571
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,510
Well, I can try.

572
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,618
Yeah.

573
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:31,994
Dreaming of a white Christmas?

574
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,996
Oh, I'm hoping the tarp
stays tied on my roof.

575
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,330
I hope the party's not history.

576
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,531
The drive's already
at a standstill.

577
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,935
All the more reason
to celebrate, right?

578
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:42,805
So I was thinking
4:00 up in recovery...

579
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,941
You've heard me sing.

580
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:46,142
Poor Susie hears the first line

581
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,310
of "Rock-a-bye baby"

582
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,845
and goes to sleep as
a defense mechanism.

583
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,047
Well, you just mouth the words.

584
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,048
That's what I do.

585
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:53,049
While who sings?

586
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,616
I'm working on that. Carter?

587
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,851
No, no, no, no.

588
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,786
Chronic tone deafness
and acute stage fright.

589
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,955
Do you have time now?

590
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,711
Oh yeah. Find me in Radiology.

591
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,828
Carol, Mr. Calus is
ready for sterile dressing.

592
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,581
Mark, who's in there with him?

593
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,550
It's his family.

594
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,718
Don't you think... doesn't
he remind you of somebody?

595
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:15,487
Are you kidding?
He's the spitting image.

596
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:17,256
I mean, I know it's
ridiculous, but still...

597
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,791
No, no. He looks just like him.

598
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,927
You know, when he was
old, right before he died.

599
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:23,328
Before who died? Jerry Garcia.

600
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:26,320
That's who we're
talking about, isn't it?

601
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,839
Oh, Carter, she'll love them.

602
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:34,857
You think?

603
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,759
Yeah, they look just like her.

604
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:37,827
They're not too much?

605
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:38,828
No. They're fun.

606
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,095
I know, Harper and I

607
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,331
haven't been seeing
each other that long...

608
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,366
They're great.

609
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,901
I saw them, and
I just thought...

610
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,803
you sure they're not too much?

611
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,204
Carter...

612
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:53,642
are you telling me these...

613
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,693
are these real?

614
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:55,694
They're too much.

615
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:56,945
No!

616
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,348
I mean, they're
beautiful. She'll love them.

617
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:00,482
I went overboard.

618
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,750
No, of course not.

619
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,519
You thought of her,
she'll be touched.

620
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,320
Yeah? Yeah.

621
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,572
Susan, we need
a doctor out here.

622
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,176
Somebody help us!
Our priest has been shot!

623
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,677
Here, here. Put him here.

624
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,679
You're all right, B-Pop.
You're gonna be all right now.

625
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,147
You're at the hospital now.

626
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:16,315
What happened?

627
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,100
We found him at the church.

628
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,701
LG shot him up like a dog.

629
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,237
How much blood did he lose?

630
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,838
A lot, man. 911
didn't even show up.

631
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,356
We drove him in ourselves.

632
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,191
Okay, we'll take
care of him now.

633
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,361
Jeanie, you're on.

634
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,196
You're going to be okay, man.

635
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,198
They shot a priest?

636
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,867
I am out of here.

637
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,769
Bet I beat you out the door.

638
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,270
See y'all at the party.

639
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:39,739
Careful on the roads.

640
00:24:39,763 --> 00:24:41,240
Mark, I hope it's not too late

641
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:44,110
for me to withdraw my
offer to work the holidays.

642
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,612
No, no. Looks like
you have a visitor.

643
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:49,115
Yeah. I think I
may skip the party.

644
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,450
I'll be right there, Mlungisi.

645
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:54,787
Kerry, you didn't expect him?

646
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:56,789
Uh-uh. A complete surprise.

647
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:57,990
I love surprises.

648
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:00,126
Mlungisi's full of them.

649
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,177
So, how do you, um, know him?

650
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,701
I, uh...

651
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:10,875
I had a farm in Africa.

652
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,956
Sinus tach.

653
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,957
Good bilateral breath sounds.

654
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,125
No tracheal shift.

655
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,459
Doctor, please...

656
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,077
Father, please, try
to relax. Pulse ox?

657
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,345
96.

658
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:22,214
Good. He's not hypoxic.
Where the hell's X-ray?

659
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:23,232
On their way.

660
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,333
Here you go.

661
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,686
I have to speak to
Diablo, the boy outside.

662
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,821
Father, not now.

663
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:29,888
Please...

664
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:32,341
I need to talk to
him before I die.

665
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,826
You're not going to die.

666
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,944
Please.

667
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,028
I'm gonna find that kid.

668
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:37,384
Okay, okay. Okay.

669
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:40,966
Squad car's on its way in

670
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,901
with an infant that
fits the description

671
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:44,803
of Hanna Steiner's grandchild.

672
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:45,804
Do we need warming blankets?

673
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:47,540
I don't think so.

674
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:48,941
They found her in
this triple-X theater

675
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,076
on Ashland.

676
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,310
Police aren't sure
of her condition,

677
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,711
except that she's
screaming her head off.

678
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:53,735
That's a good sign.

679
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,286
I got her.

680
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,144
Lungs are working.

681
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,962
Tell the grandmother.

682
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,431
No, let's check
her condition first.

683
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:13,465
Take her to T-1.

684
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,466
Get the warmer.

685
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,490
It's already done.

686
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:28,030
No signs of trauma.

687
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:32,189
Good one. Here.

688
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:36,572
She's alert and interactive.

689
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,106
Makes good eye contact.

690
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,107
Good breath sounds.

691
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,442
Let's get a core temperature.

692
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,443
What?

693
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,711
A core temperature.

694
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,130
No apparent injury.

695
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:48,834
Mad as hell.

696
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,435
Tirzah!

697
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:51,887
Mrs. Steiner.

698
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,889
Tirzah!

699
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,457
I knew it was you.

700
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:56,481
Please.

701
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,962
All right. Okay. Go ahead.

702
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,964
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, my darling.

703
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,801
Oh, sweetheart, bless you.

704
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,302
Oh, sweetheart.

705
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,304
Yeah, shush, shush, shush.

706
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:12,024
She's... she's hungry is all.

707
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,526
I don't believe you, B-Pop.

708
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,464
No. Listen to me.

709
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:20,032
Shooting.

710
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,033
We have to step away.

711
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,034
No.

712
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,557
AP chest.

713
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:27,706
Get the shoulder vest.

714
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,108
Man, you're trying
to protect the LGs.

715
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:30,109
Man, I know you are.

716
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,727
I know they did
this to you, B-Pop.

717
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:36,265
I saw him. I saw him.
He wasn't from the 'hood.

718
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,235
You're trying to keep the
truce, B-Pop. I know, man.

719
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:40,335
Father, stop talking.

720
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,359
Shooting again.

721
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,662
Diablito. Stay still, Father.

722
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:52,369
It wasn't the LG.

723
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,302
I swear to God.

724
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:58,621
You need to go now.

725
00:27:58,645 --> 00:27:59,604
Malik?

726
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:00,806
Let's go.

727
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,007
No, man. No.

728
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:03,008
Come on.

729
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:04,175
B-Pop, man.

730
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,378
Let's go.

731
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:08,663
For him.

732
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,666
For Diablo.

733
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,802
I need a wet read
on those. Top priority.

734
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,020
Give them to me.

735
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:16,477
Thanks.

736
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,510
Sorry I left you with all
the last-minute deliveries.

737
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,044
Oh, no problem. I like to drive.

738
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,147
You call that driving or flying?

739
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,750
It's nice that you're all
willing to help out your dad.

740
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:31,203
The whole brood will
be charging me overtime.

741
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:32,404
See you back at the homestead.

742
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:33,405
Got your maps?

743
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:34,840
The naughty and the nice.

744
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:38,643
Okay, Mr. Calus,
I will be right back

745
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,634
with your tetanus shot.

746
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,616
And I would just like to say

747
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,919
how much I've enjoyed
taking care of you today.

748
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:48,903
Well, that's
awfully nice to hear.

749
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,739
I've been surrounded by
bah-humbuggers all day.

750
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,040
No one's in the spirit.

751
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,942
They won't even sing
a few Christmas carols,

752
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,761
But you have been the exception.

753
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:59,598
Well, you can't
count on other people

754
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:00,933
to give it to you.

755
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:02,584
Know what I mean? The spirit?

756
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,020
It's in you.

757
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,810
You're right.

758
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,527
You are absolutely right.

759
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,852
Thank you.

760
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:22,037
I'm going to sing
some Christmas carols.

761
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,361
Anybody care to join me?

762
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,704
It's 4:00. I'm going
up to Recovery.

763
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,858
Last chance to spread
some holiday cheer.

764
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,448
What?

765
00:29:54,393 --> 00:30:00,209
And God bless us, everyone.

766
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,211
Pressure's still falling.

767
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,412
All right, let's get him up.

768
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:04,479
What about x-rays?

769
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,583
Can't wait. Father cannot wait.

770
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,751
Watch it.

771
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,086
Coming through.

772
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,455
Diablo...

773
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,457
Move! Move! Watch it!

774
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,594
Look out!

775
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:20,995
Get him up.

776
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,264
Man, what's going on?

777
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:23,532
Damn! He's bradying down.

778
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,534
We're losing his
pulse. Get him back.

779
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,202
What's going on?

780
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,170
All right. Bag him.
I'll start compressions.

781
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,372
Malik? I got you.

782
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,040
Back to trauma.

783
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,409
B-Pop! Where are you taking him?

784
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,544
Hurry up!

785
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:37,979
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
No room at the inn.

786
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,681
Pulse is gone.

787
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,117
Damn it! He's
bleeding out. Curtain 2.

788
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,452
Mark! Mark, 2!

789
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:46,455
Out of the way!
Move out of the way!

790
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,590
Run the IVs wide open.

791
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,093
Rapid infuser. Thoracotomy tray.

792
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,527
Scalpel.

793
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,713
Rib spreader.

794
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,949
Man. What's going on,
man? What's wrong?

795
00:30:57,973 --> 00:31:00,785
Suction. Malik,
hold the retractor.

796
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,954
Suction! Come on!

797
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:06,491
Oh, damn it.

798
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,209
Cross clamp him now.

799
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,629
All right. Satinsky!

800
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:14,266
Bullet severed the aorta.

801
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,935
Start internal compressions.

802
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:21,062
Come on! Hurry up in there!

803
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,079
Damn.

804
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:28,414
Thank you!

805
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:29,970
Damn.

806
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,808
Hey! Watch out!

807
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:41,993
Where's the priest?

808
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:44,418
Curtain 2.

809
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,788
Widened mediastinum.

810
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:51,904
Time of death: 4:17.

811
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:54,539
Oh, man...

812
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:56,375
Oh, man, no.

813
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,711
Oh, man. Come on. Do something.

814
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:01,246
Do something else.

815
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,598
Like, try and do something, man.

816
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,939
It won't help. I'm sorry.

817
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:11,055
Oh, man.

818
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,092
Well, get... get him a priest.

819
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:15,761
You guys can do that, right?
You guys can get him a priest?

820
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:18,797
Lydia, can you,
uh... run upstairs

821
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,632
and try to find the chaplain?

822
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:22,305
He'd want a priest.

And suddenly there
was with the angel

846
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,445
a multitude of the heavenly host

847
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:42,613
praising God and saying

848
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:45,416
"Glory to the
God in the highest,

849
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,887
and on Earth, peace
and good will toward men."

850
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:50,988
LOL with sudden back pain.

851
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:52,256
She's diaphoretic,
short of breath.

852
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,357
What's her history?

853
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,226
Hypertension. She's
220/140 right now.

854
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,297
Call Mark. Get
Carter down here now.

855
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:00,965
Aye-aye, sir.

856
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:03,167
My back. It's ripping apart.

857
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:04,452
Doctor, help her.

858
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,654
When did this pain start?

859
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,722
20 minutes ago.
We were shopping.

860
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,073
Loss of pulses.

861
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:11,642
Aortic regurge.

862
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,011
Let's get a chest
film, an angiogram.

863
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,746
Propranolol, one
milligram IV bolus.

864
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,015
Set up an art line.

865
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,084
Is it a heart attack?

866
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:23,554
No, sir. Your wife's
EKG is normal.

867
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:24,555
I'm ordering some tests now

868
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,157
to see if she has a
dissecting aneurysm.

869
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:27,592
Pressure's coming down.

870
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:31,696
Start sodium nitroprusside,
50 micrograms per minute.

871
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,781
Titrate to a diastolic of 100.

872
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,949
Alert the O.R.

873
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,317
What do we got?

874
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,318
Acute aortic dissection.

875
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,120
Want me to call up to the O.R.?

876
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,922
Done. I need you
to talk to Mister, uh...

877
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,924
Rubadoux.

878
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,058
Okay. Explain the procedure.

879
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,393
Get her consented
for the clamp-and-run.

880
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,760
You understand?

881
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,062
Okay.

882
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,263
Does my wife need an operation?

883
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,065
She might, sir.

884
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,266
If you'll just come with me,

885
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,867
I'll be happy to
explain it to you.

886
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,370
Okay. I got to go with
the doctor, sweetheart.

887
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,607
I'll be right back.

888
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,977
Just down this way.

889
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:06,080
Were we as bad as
we thought we'd be?

890
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,717
It was worse. It was great.

891
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,708
Mr. Calus, I'm so sorry...

892
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,691
Mark, have you seen Mr. Calus?

893
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:20,049
Yeah he was just in there.

894
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:36,026
This shows what
Dr. Benton feared is true...

895
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,861
Your wife has a
dissecting aneurysm.

896
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,467
The wall of the
aorta is tearing,

897
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:43,534
and with your wife's age

898
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,203
and her history
of hypertension...

899
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,037
But she's very active.

900
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,140
Still, surgery's a risk.

901
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,874
What are the odds?

902
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,110
About 50/50.

903
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:53,911
But if your wife's
aorta continues ripping,

904
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:56,080
then she has no odds at all.

905
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:59,317
Well, sounds like we
have no choice here.

906
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:00,518
Okay, I'll sign.

907
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:04,489
Well, you have a choice
of a new surgical technique,

908
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:05,840
the clamp- and-run procedure.

909
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,008
This has the benefit
of being completed

910
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,277
in a fraction of the time
the standard surgery takes.

911
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,379
Why is that better?

912
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:15,416
You always run a risk

913
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,285
of heart attack or
paralysis with this operation.

914
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,270
It's new?

915
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:20,504
Mm-hmm.

916
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:22,106
Developed by one of
the top vascular surgeons

917
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,107
in the country,

918
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,942
and he works here.

919
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:30,147
Newer is better?

920
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:33,117
I don't know. I don't know.

921
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:36,820
Well, it's up to you.

922
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,039
But...

923
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:41,330
You... you'd go
with the new thing?

924
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,379
I would.

925
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,971
You would. Okay. All
right, where do I sign?

926
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,356
See if the church
wants to stop by

927
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,657
to pick these up.

928
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,860
Don't want to hand them
over to his parishioners?

929
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:04,649
Right? He's dead.

930
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:06,817
Oh, man, they did
it man, all right?

931
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:08,474
Those guys are going to pay.

932
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:12,273
He said it wasn't them.

933
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:16,144
He was just trying
to keep the truce.

934
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:17,378
I know those<i>
cabrones</i> killed him.

935
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,603
No. He said they didn't.
Did he ever lie to you?

936
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:22,833
Did he?

937
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:23,934
B-Pop...

938
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:28,706
see, he thought one
man can change things.

939
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,807
He was wrong.

940
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,109
So you shoot them
and they shoot you,

941
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,773
and that's what
the Father died for?

942
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,131
You're right, Diablo.

943
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,957
One man couldn't do it.

944
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,262
Help him now.

945
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,782
Please, will you
tell them to go on?

946
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,183
They won't listen to me.

947
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,820
Your mother does have
to stay for observation.

948
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,254
That's why we're staying too.

949
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,191
But you will spoil the
children's Hanukkah.

950
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,542
No. We brought Hanukkah
here, if that's all right, doctor.

951
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:09,229
We brought a menorah...

952
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,549
Okay. Okay. I think
I can find a place.

953
00:38:11,573 --> 00:38:13,884
James. I haven't
seen you in a long time.

954
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,919
How are you?

955
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:17,355
Well, she's
definitely a candidate.

956
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,689
Obviously, she's high risk.

957
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,724
Has she consented?

958
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:21,525
She's being prepped right now.

959
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,993
Well, unfortunately,
I've had one of these,

960
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:24,328
so Simon will assist

961
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:25,730
and you will have
a second chance

962
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:28,966
at breaking the record, Peter.

963
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,200
I'm ready.

964
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,053
We'll see. Shall we, gentlemen?

965
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,371
Oh, no!

966
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,372
I am so disappointed.

967
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,373
What's wrong?

968
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,441
We're canceled.

969
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:39,376
The Gold Coast area's snowed in.

970
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,377
No Christmas party?

971
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,745
The roads are pretty bad.

972
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,480
Are they still going to bill us?

973
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:46,283
Oh, I wish my house was ready.
I'm only a few EL stops away.

974
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:47,751
So what's not ready?

975
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:50,387
Uh, no furniture, no
walls, and no roof.

976
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,455
I got the fireplace working.

977
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,556
You did?

978
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,157
Yeah. I figured I'd
surprise you with it.

979
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:55,759
Sounds perfect.
What should we bring?

980
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:57,695
Mark, hey! Party at Carol's.

981
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,296
Oh yeah? I'll try
and make it later.

982
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,164
Oh, hang on. I'll
go get little Susie.

983
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,265
Hang on.

984
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,266
What's your address again?

985
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,301
We'd better call the others.

986
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:06,203
I guess it's BYO everything.

987
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,437
We'll stop at the market.

988
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:09,406
I'll see you there.

989
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:45,659
♪ Amen ♪♪

990
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,395
And now what do we play, Sammy?

991
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,730
Dreidel.

992
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,732
And what do those letters mean?

993
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,767
"A miracle happened there."

994
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,571
Yeah. Today we
had our own miracle.

995
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:02,276
Tirzah came back
to us safe and sound,

996
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,996
and also Dr. Greene
and I said our prayers,

997
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,083
and that's a miracle too.

998
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,985
Yeah.

999
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,988
You know, I thought that...

1000
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:18,325
that God and I had
forsaken each other,

1001
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,961
and then I found out

1002
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:26,317
that he was always
with me... in each of you.

1003
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,008
Bless you.

1004
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,643
And now, who goes first?

1005
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,583
Me!

1006
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,451
Oh. What did you get?

1007
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:45,185
What did you get?

1008
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,488
What's that again?

1009
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,097
You see that?

1010
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,888
Don't you ever dance like that.

1011
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,071
Hey, it's the champion.

1012
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,173
Everybody, the man
who broke the 1995 record

1013
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,109
for the clamp-and-run procedure

1014
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,110
and saved a life.

1015
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,778
Carter...

1016
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,214
Hey, where can I put this?

1017
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,049
In the back room.

1018
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,018
What a hero.

1019
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,253
Oh, they're outrageous.

1020
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,621
I like yours.

1021
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,323
You think they'd
notice if we switched?

1022
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,692
No! I mean, I think they would.

1023
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,484
Hey. Look who's drunk.

1024
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:31,499
Leaving?

1025
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:34,535
Oh, no, no. I just
needed my coat.

1026
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,427
Yeah. It's chilly in here.

1027
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,245
I thought about
you today, Peter.

1028
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,562
Your first Christmas
without your mother.

1029
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,349
I hope it's not too hard.

1030
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:53,487
She had her favorite
Bible verse in Luke.

1031
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,523
Had me memorize it
before I could even read.

1032
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,525
On Christmas,
she liked to hear it.

1033
00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:01,595
"Keeping watch over their flocks

1034
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,436
by night."

1035
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:08,874
Yeah. That's the one.

1036
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,361
So, I um...

1037
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:20,305
I guess it's your first
Christmas alone too, huh?

1038
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:34,461
Well, um...

1039
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,818
have a good one.

1040
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,589
You too.

1041
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,161
Wait for the toast, now.

1042
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:51,717
I know I've got
more cups up here.

1043
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:57,556
Hey, will this do?

1044
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,342
What?

1045
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,560
Uh...

1046
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,584
I love you.

1047
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,883
Aah!

1048
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:15,585
Oh!

1049
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:17,438
I do. I said it.

1050
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:18,439
I do.

1051
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:20,441
I... I want you to
have my babies.

1052
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,442
Shep...

1053
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:22,676
No, no, I mean,

1054
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,812
I think that we would
have really good ones.

1055
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,212
I think they would look nice.

1056
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,380
You know, I think that

1057
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,249
we should spend every
Christmas together.

1058
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,551
You know, forever.

1059
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:31,985
I mean, don't think about it.

1060
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,286
Just say yes.

1061
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,287
Shep, stop.

1062
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,656
And I know this is sudden,

1063
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,057
I know it's out of the blue,

1064
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,059
but I said it and I
don't take it back.

1065
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,295
You know? I think this... you...

1066
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,697
this is the best.

1067
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,200
You don't have to say
anything back, okay?

1068
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,135
You just...

1069
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:54,708
just stay... just
the way you are.

1070
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,377
Don't move.

1071
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,285
Find any more? Whoops.

1072
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:04,201
Say the first part again.

1073
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,403
I love you?

1074
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:07,593
Mm-hmm.

1075
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,949
I love you.

1076
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,633
No, honey, Mommy's right.

1077
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,569
If you hang your
stocking at Grandpa's,

1078
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:22,870
Santa will find it.

1079
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:26,306
So I hear your cousins
are having a skating party.

1080
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,543
You want to stay for that?

1081
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,913
Okay. Well, then, I'll see
you in a couple of days,

1082
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:34,781
and you and I are
going to celebrate

1083
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,518
our biggest most
special day of the year.

1084
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,588
That's the first annual
Rachel and Dad

1085
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:47,627
post-Christmas, post-Hanukkah
pre-New Year's Day celebration.

1086
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,129
Well, that's the good part,

1087
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,231
because you and I
are going to make it up.
