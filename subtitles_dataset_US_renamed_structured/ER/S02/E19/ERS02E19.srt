1
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:33,860
Hey, Carol?

2
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:35,595
Hmm?

3
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,363
Carol, I got an idea.

4
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,933
Two more minutes.

5
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,768
It's beautiful out.

6
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,303
Let's call in sick.

7
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:47,206
Take a day trip somewhere.

8
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,608
A trip?

9
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,110
Yeah. We'll... We'll play hooky.

10
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,311
We'll just jump in the car,

11
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:53,847
and we'll head North

12
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,949
and find a lake
and just sit there.

13
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,984
Mm...

14
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,319
I can't skip work.
I need the hours.

15
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,856
Please?

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,891
The thought of
having to cart around

17
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:07,594
the wretched of the
Earth all day long

18
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:08,962
with Reilly yapping in my ear

19
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,899
about his stupid
beer can collection.

20
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,568
I can't. Not today.

21
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:18,872
Oh... You go. You go.

22
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:20,306
I don't want to go without you.

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,074
I mean, that's the whole idea.

24
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:25,979
I want us to get away together.

25
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,914
We'll just go someplace

26
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:30,082
where there aren't
any sick people, and...

27
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:33,853
just... just cows.

28
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:36,322
Healthy cows.

29
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,624
Good cows.

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,027
Someplace where
we can, you know,

31
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:45,297
make love in the grass.

32
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,500
In front of the cows?

33
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,768
Sexy cows.

34
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:57,710
We could take a
trip this weekend.

35
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:00,179
Yeah?

36
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,270
Sure.

37
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,989
Well... I might be persuaded

38
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:12,358
to be a little late for work.

39
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,376
<i>Next.</i>

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,095
I repacked Mr. Otto's abscess.

41
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,263
Is it granulating?

42
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:17,330
Quite nicely, thank you.

43
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,165
Give Mr. Otto my
best. What else?

44
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,600
Mrs. Mendoza in 2.

45
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,302
She's had two days
of vomiting, diarrhea,

46
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,703
and periumbilical pain.

47
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,105
Her vitals? Normal.

48
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,107
The onset began after
dinner in Mexico City.

49
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:28,541
She and her husband
came straight in

50
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,575
from the airport.

51
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,576
White count?

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,212
12,000. No rebound or guarding.

53
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,746
Well, it sounds like
Montezuma's Revenge.

54
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,915
Give her Loperamide

55
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,516
and start her on
a clear liquid diet.

56
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,717
Do you want to see her?

57
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,119
No, you can, uh, send her home.

58
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:40,303
Peter...

59
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,438
You won't be scrubbing in

60
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,307
on Dr. Heizenbach's jejunostomy

61
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,675
this morning.

62
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,527
Why not?

63
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,744
He won't work with you.

64
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,230
The word's out

65
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,697
about your difficulty
with Doug Ross.

66
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:53,699
It's spread to
the surgical floor.

67
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,186
The prevailing view is that
you betrayed a colleague.

68
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,853
Is that what you think?

69
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,929
I think maybe you're
in for a chilly summer.

70
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:06,379
We still on for tonight?

71
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,781
If you'd tell me
where we're going.

72
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,148
No, it's a surprise.

73
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:11,150
Well, how am I going
to know what to wear?

74
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:12,251
Dress nice.

75
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,653
Ah, Carter...

76
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,655
you've got a call
confirming your reservations

77
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,357
for the Moonlight Dinner
Cruise on Lake Michigan.

78
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:19,492
Thanks, Jerry.

79
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,327
Ah, sounds romantic.

80
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,730
Oh, remind me to bring
my seasickness pills.

81
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:24,831
Harper!

82
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:25,954
Dale!

83
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,035
I've been looking for you, kid.

84
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,103
What are you doing here?

85
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,237
Trauma Sub-I until June,

86
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,338
then I start my Residency.

87
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:33,339
You matched here?

88
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,674
I did.

89
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,176
In medicine? Surgery.

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,444
John Carter.

91
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,713
He matched in surgery here too.

92
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,064
Dale and I went
to college together.

93
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,466
Ah, and you're coming from...

94
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,935
Boston.

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,053
Meaning... Harvard?

96
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:48,405
Go, Crimson.

97
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:49,873
So the last time
you e-mailed me,

98
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,073
you were about to take out

99
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,108
your first appendix.

100
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,109
That's right.

101
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,778
You took out an appendix?

102
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,646
Yeah. They let us
do appys, lipomas,

103
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,980
pilonidal cysts...

104
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,849
All that small stuff.

105
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,050
God, it's great to see you.

106
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,074
You too.

107
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:58,975
I don't know, Doug.

108
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,910
You, me, Inga, Hulda,

109
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,312
and a Chinese restaurant.

110
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,846
What's not to know?

111
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,448
Inga's not really my type.

112
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,849
That's what you said
about Kathy Snyder.

113
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,651
Yeah, well, I am
going to get out there,

114
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,652
just at my own pace...

115
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,686
Word to the wise...

116
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,854
Prostates don't last forever.

117
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,855
Hey, Dr. Greene,

118
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,290
does this loan
application belong to you?

119
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,291
It's mine.

120
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,659
Buying a car?

121
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,294
No, you know that
kid I misdiagnosed?

122
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,695
I'm helping out with
his cancer treatment.

123
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,896
Hey, Mark, I have to bail

124
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,148
on M and M's this afternoon.

125
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,284
Can you change the meeting?

126
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,019
No, and I don't
have a lawyer yet.

127
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:27,253
Do what you have to do.

128
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,254
Thanks. I'm on till 2:00.

129
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:29,255
What's that?

130
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,456
She's meeting with a judge.

131
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,824
Chloe wants visitation rights.

132
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,459
God bless the child.

133
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,728
Good morning, guys.

134
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,062
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

135
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,620
Traffic was a bitch.

136
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,639
Hey...

137
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:47,840
Peter...

138
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,864
Let me just clear
this out the way...

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,438
Mrs. Garvey, I understand
you're having chest pains...

140
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,640
Where the hell have you been?

141
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,941
And irritability.

142
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,809
I've waited so long, the
pains have gone away.

143
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,794
She just got here.

144
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:09,395
I'm burning with fever.

145
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,897
The temp's normal.

146
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:13,049
Oh, sure, after sitting in
your drafty waiting room.

147
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,600
Your pain's gone?

148
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,602
Oh. It's coming back.

149
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,736
Okay, let's get that EKG.

150
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,905
What's that?

151
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,940
It monitors the electrical
activity of your heart.

152
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,175
How?

153
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,510
The leads carry impulses
from your heart to the monitor

154
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,678
where we can read them.

155
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:26,946
I don't understand.
Explain it again.

156
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,982
We just want to make
sure that you're okay.

157
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,183
Don't patronize me.

158
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,018
You doctors are all the same.

159
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,519
I came in here for stitches.

160
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:34,921
I had to come back five times,

161
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:37,356
and my leg's never
been the same.

162
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,408
This place is filthy!

163
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,609
Mrs. Garvey, your
EKG is abnormal.

164
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,277
We're going to have
to draw some blood.

165
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,262
Why?

166
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:43,263
To check your cardiac enzymes.

167
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:44,363
What are those?

168
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:45,731
Elements in your blood

169
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:47,733
that'll tell us if you've
had a heart attack.

170
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:49,477
I don't understand.
Explain it again!

171
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,640
I may be the only
fourth year in the country

172
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,840
who hasn't done an
appendectomy yet.

173
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:55,908
Uh, I doubt it.

174
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,109
I'm about to start my Residency,

175
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,511
and I'm three steps
behind the curve.

176
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:00,180
GSW to the chest coming in.

177
00:07:00,204 --> 00:07:02,182
ETA two minutes.

178
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,516
Let me run the code.

179
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,651
Carter...

180
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,902
No, I'm ready, and I
need the experience.

181
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,903
All right, everybody, listen up!

182
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,138
Carter's going to run the code.

183
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,574
All right, everybody. Gown up!

184
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,159
What do you want
us to do, Carter?

185
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,594
Uh... Malik, you start the IVs.

186
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:16,796
We have IVs from the field.

187
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,065
Scratch that. Malik, you scribe.

188
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,099
Man, I don't wanna scribe.

189
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,767
Do it.

190
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,402
Okay, A... Airway.
Dr. Greene will intubate.

191
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,904
B... Breathing.
Haleh, call Respiratory.

192
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:26,556
Tell them to get
their ass down here.

193
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,756
Chuny, you set up the Dynamap.

194
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,857
Aye, aye.

195
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,794
C... Circulation. You!
On the rapid infuser.

196
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,196
D... Disability. Benton!

197
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,331
Dr. Benton.

198
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,650
Check the DTRs and
the Babinski, if that's okay.

199
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:38,651
All right. What's left?

200
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,969
Foley.

201
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,738
All right. Who wants to
hook up the Foley cath?

202
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,107
You're the only one left.

203
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,441
What's coming in?

204
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,609
Gunshot wound.

205
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,377
Dale! Hook up the Foley cath,

206
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,513
and Harper, just
jump in as needed.

207
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,747
They're here.

208
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,731
All right, man your stations.

209
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,434
Female found down,
GSW to the chest.

210
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,835
Traumatic full arrest.

211
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,137
Heart sounds?

212
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:59,722
No. Asystole. Gave
atropine and epi in the field.

213
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,391
Oh, man, she got
it right in the heart.

214
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,892
Let's get the
rapid infuser going.

215
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,927
Let's get some O-neg down,
and let's get a gas cooking.

216
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,928
Let's move it, people!

217
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,663
Monitor's going. Flatline.

218
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,515
Let's go with the epi,
five milligrams, IV Push.

219
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,100
Pulse ox? 40.

220
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,603
40? That's the lowest
pulse ox I've ever heard.

221
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,637
Where the hell's Respiratory?

222
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,038
You know, she
looks kind of stiff.

223
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,039
Let me see.

224
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,123
Look, her jaw won't move.

225
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:19,292
She looks really cyanotic.

226
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,492
Boxcars in the eyes.

227
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,645
Let's get the O-neg
going! Let's go!

228
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,847
Should we even be doing this?

229
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,148
Pickman, how long was she down?

230
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,616
It could have been a long time,

231
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,217
but I thought I
should run her in.

232
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,519
From the degree of lividity,

233
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,303
I'd say she's been
dead at least three hours.

234
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,788
Let's move with
the O-neg! Let's go!

235
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,790
I agree with Dale.

236
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:34,991
All right, Let's call it.

237
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:35,992
No, I wanna crack her!

238
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:36,993
Time of death...

239
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:37,994
No, I'll do it.

240
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,034
Time of death... 10:32.

241
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:43,221
What a gyp.

242
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,052
She's got an engagement ring,

243
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:48,053
but no wedding band.

244
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,255
She had a little boy too.

245
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,256
No...

246
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,596
Yeah. 47 brought him in.

247
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,484
The boy wasn't hurt?

248
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,685
Well, There doesn't seem to be

249
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,686
anything physical,

250
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,088
but he hasn't spoken

251
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,122
since they picked him up.

252
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,723
It could be
post-traumatic shock.

253
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,758
Did his mother make it?

254
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:09,759
Mm-mm.

255
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,760
Anybody know what happened?

256
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,011
Yeah, the neighbor said

257
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,512
she heard the mother
and her boyfriend

258
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,513
fighting this morning.

259
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,315
Poor kid must have
seen the whole thing.

260
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:18,907
What's his name?

261
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,788
Where is the boyfriend?

262
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:22,789
In the wind.

263
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,457
Hey, buddy, I'm Doug,

264
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,993
and that's Carol right there.

265
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,210
What's your name?

266
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,835
I'm going to listen
to your heart, okay?

267
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,034
Doug... his name's Jeremy.

268
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,035
Jeremy...

269
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,421
Can you hear me?

270
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,091
Good reflexes. It's non-organic.

271
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,659
I'll call Psych.

272
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,727
Why don't you see

273
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,462
if you can track
down a relative?

274
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,730
He witnessed a murder.

275
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,898
The boyfriend could come back.

276
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,055
Okay. We'll get the
cops to post a guard.

277
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,826
Hey...

278
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:01,794
Peter, come quick.

279
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:02,795
What?

280
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,796
It's Mrs. Mendoza,

281
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,997
Who?

282
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,598
The woman I sent home
with Montezuma's Revenge.

283
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:08,067
She's back. Pain's
moved from mid-abdomen

284
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,068
to the right lower quadrant.

285
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,069
Are you a doctor?

286
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,436
I'm a surgeon.

287
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,072
Oh, my God! She's
in so much pain.

288
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,140
It's her appendix.

289
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:15,574
You sure? Don't
worry, Mr. Mendoza,

290
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,777
We're gonna take it out.
Let's get her up to Surgery.

291
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,779
We were here earlier, but
that nurse sent us home.

292
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,246
We never even saw a doctor.

293
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,448
Don't worry, Mr. Mendoza,
we're going to take care of her.

294
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:25,885
Clear! Clear!

295
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,895
So did Psych come
down to that boy?

296
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,764
Yeah. She's in
there with him now.

297
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:39,498
Jerry, will you fax
this for me please?

298
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:41,100
A loan application? Sorry.

299
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:42,518
No more personal use of the fax,

300
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,320
per the Weaver.

301
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,455
Jerry... just do it.

302
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,640
Jerry, call Pathology

303
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,676
to take that lady's body
out of the trauma room.

304
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,627
These video people
need to get in there.

305
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,628
What video people?

306
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,963
You didn't read the memo?

307
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,864
No.

308
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,366
I want to start
videotaping the traumas

309
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,468
so we can critique our work.

310
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,270
I don't think this
sounds like a good idea.

311
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,305
Well, David Morgenstern
thought it was.

312
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,173
He wrote the memo.

313
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,042
On a trial basis.

314
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,644
Fine.

315
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,045
Path's backed up.

316
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,048
They asked if we can
keep that DB down here.

317
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,049
Put her in Exam 3.

318
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,850
These guys need to get to work.

319
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,385
Come on.

320
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,554
Gown me quick! Is that the appy?

321
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,555
Knife.

322
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,556
What, I can't do it?

323
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,990
No.

324
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,459
I've seen dozens.

325
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,244
I said no. Carter,
go cover the E.R.

326
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,069
All right, here we go.

327
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,652
Retract the fascia.

328
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:34,219
Can you see?

329
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:35,220
Suction.

330
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,406
Pulse is up to 120.

331
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,495
Here we go.

332
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,409
Ah, damn it.

333
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,509
Belly's full of pus.

334
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,693
She perfed.

335
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:42,828
She done perfed good.

336
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,398
All right, let's
load her with amp,

337
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:46,399
gent, and Flagyl.

338
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:47,799
Give me a liter of warm saline.

339
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,402
We got to irrigate
before she goes septic.

340
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:50,403
What a mess.

341
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:51,404
Yeah, it's too bad

342
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,105
she didn't come in sooner.

343
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,312
Damn.

344
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,442
Mrs. Garvey...

345
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,210
You've got some nerve.

346
00:11:58,234 --> 00:11:59,311
Mrs. Garvey...

347
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,346
"Patient is uncooperative,

348
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,413
"demanding,

349
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,182
prone to exaggerate symptoms?"

350
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,383
Can I have my chart back?

351
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:05,384
Give me a pen.

352
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:06,385
Mrs. Garvey...

353
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,520
I want this changed.

354
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:10,640
"Doctor is unprofessional,

355
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:11,841
openly hostile."

356
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,542
Mrs. Garvey,

357
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,094
your enzymes
suggest a heart attack.

358
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:16,846
We need to do an echocardiogram.

359
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,214
What's that?

360
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,665
It's like an ultrasound
of your heart.

361
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,067
Why do I need one of those?

362
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,619
We need to make sure that
your artery is not blocked.

363
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,888
I don't understand.
Explain it again.

364
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,141
This is your heart.

365
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,494
This is an artery
going into your heart.

366
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,963
If it is blocked,
it can explode,

367
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,465
causing a massive heart attack,

368
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,521
which would kill
you within minutes!

369
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,726
You are a sick woman.

370
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,740
People said they heard fighting.

371
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,941
Did your mom and her boyfriend

372
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,943
have a fight this morning?

373
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,177
Is that what happened, pal?

374
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,178
Is that what it was?

375
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,379
Detective?

376
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,747
Yeah.

377
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,411
Can I talk to you
outside, please?

378
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,020
What are you doing?

379
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,021
Trying to talk to him.

380
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,055
What did you say?

381
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,757
I just asked him what happened.

382
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,258
This boy's had a
psychological trauma

383
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,760
that's left him
practically catatonic,

384
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,063
and you could have
set him back weeks.

385
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,380
I didn't know that.

386
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,338
Well, now you do. Okay?

387
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,389
Hey, where's your e-mail pal?

388
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:18,190
He took a hernia up to the O.R..

389
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,325
You're kidding.

390
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,327
Yeah, about an hour ago.
He should be back soon.

391
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:22,395
Seems like a great guy.

392
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,396
He is.

393
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,797
So are you guys went out?

394
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,332
Uh, we never exactly went out.

395
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:28,233
Didn't go out, but you, um...

396
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:30,891
Once. One night, anyway.

397
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,789
Harper, guy in 6 needs a rectal.

398
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,491
Ooh, I have to take these bloods

399
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,492
up to the lab.

400
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,493
See ya.

401
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,494
Carter?

402
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,528
Pass.

403
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,431
Abdominal pain.
Could be surgical.

404
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,233
Haleh, have you seen
that cute guy from Harvard?

405
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,334
Yeah. He just came down.

406
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,335
Try the desk.

407
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,503
All right.

408
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,038
Whoa! I'll take
it. I'll take it.

409
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,140
Thanks.

410
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,975
Max, try the 15
millimeter for me.

411
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,010
Tilt down.

412
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,078
Get the whole bed in the frame.

413
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,380
Good. Pan left.

414
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,381
Iris...

415
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,448
Oh, Dr. Greene.

416
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,983
I would've thought
we were small potatoes

417
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,684
for an infomercial director.

418
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,353
I do educational tapes,
equipment rentals.

419
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,389
I'll take your money
any way I can.

420
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,424
Would you zoom into a
medium shot for me now, Max.

421
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,826
How's your eye?

422
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,994
Oh, fine.

423
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,697
Nice profile.

424
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,066
You sure you
won't go on the air?

425
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,268
I wouldn't feel right plugging
your hair growth products,

426
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,669
since I don't believe
in them myself.

427
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,939
Well, you're more
secure than most men.

428
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,941
And you looks like you're
in pretty good shape.

429
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:25,941
You exercise?

430
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,744
Run, push-ups, a little. Why?

431
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,146
I'm just about to go national
with a new exercycle,

432
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,132
and I haven't found
a pitchman yet.

433
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:35,267
You, uh, interested?

434
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,174
He's had periumbilical pain

435
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,793
localized to the
right lower quadrant.

436
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,195
Rebound and guarding,
nausea and vomiting.

437
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,763
What's his white count?

438
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,386
9,000. I'm thinking appendix.

439
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,855
Appys usually
present a bit lower,

440
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,423
but they can fool you.

441
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:58,524
Let's take him up.

442
00:14:58,548 --> 00:14:59,759
Can I do the procedure?

443
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,661
Does Benton let you do appys?

444
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,095
We've talked about it.

445
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,431
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

446
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,132
Mr. Kennerly, you're
going to the O.R.,

447
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,434
but there's no reason to worry.

448
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,491
Everything's going to be fine.

449
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:13,906
You clean her out yet?

450
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,507
I've still got to
drain the abscess.

451
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,876
She's tachy. 180.

452
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,243
Temp's 104.

453
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,411
I'll get a cooling blanket.

454
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:20,613
This is making
me nervous, Peter.

455
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:22,048
Just hold on.

456
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:24,349
Peter, isn't that your
med student next door?

457
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,919
What?

458
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:28,888
What's going on over there?

459
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,639
Another appendix.

460
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,807
When it rains, it pours.

461
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,743
Somebody close those blinds.

462
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,378
Run of five. Your
time's about up, Peter.

463
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,813
Ah, just give me two minutes.

464
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,080
Too late!

465
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,783
She's fibrillating.

466
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,651
Goddamn it.

467
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,086
Charging at 200.

468
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,072
Come on, don't do this to me!

469
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:47,096
Clear!

470
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,374
There are three enzymes

471
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,576
that are released by the heart

472
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,577
after a heart attack...

473
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:54,196
CKMB, AST, and LDH.

474
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,264
By graphing the
levels of each enzyme,

475
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,365
we can determine

476
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,069
that you had your
heart attack back here

477
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,388
at approximately
4:00 this morning.

478
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:04,878
Oh, thank you, doctor.

479
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,094
She's the one.

480
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,095
Susan!

481
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,463
Yes, Kerry...

482
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:12,932
One of the nurses alerted me

483
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:15,484
that Ethel was about
to sign out ANA,

484
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,019
which, in her condition,

485
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,521
might well have killed her.

486
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,423
I thought it best to indulge her

487
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,425
in order to save her life.

488
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,426
Good thinking.

489
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,427
I know it's frustrating

490
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,195
dealing with difficult patients,

491
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,897
but you have a tendency
to become anger-locked

492
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,434
and inflexible.

493
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,335
Thank you for pointing that out.

494
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,870
If you feel yourself
getting dug in,

495
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,472
just call me.

496
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,429
I'm here to help.

497
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,710
Retractor.

498
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,768
Expose the internal oblique.

499
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,150
Can I have some suction?

500
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,171
Good. Now, cut it open.

501
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:53,889
I'm in.

502
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:57,459
Okay, now, put your
hand in the peritoneum,

503
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,829
and feel around until
you find the appendix.

504
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,830
I got it.

505
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,416
Okay. Let's see.

506
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,568
Well, that is the pinkest

507
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,571
most healthy
appendix I've ever seen.

508
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,772
But he had all the symptoms.

509
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,430
They can fool you.

510
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,361
Well, as long as we're here...

511
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:16,845
Better not.

512
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,315
Besides, I think I see the cause
of Mr. Kennerly's bellyache.

513
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,418
What?

514
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,619
Toothpick...

515
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,287
in the terminal ileum.

516
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,089
I think if you pull
on the gold tassel,

517
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,113
it'll slide right out.

518
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:32,995
Congratulations, Mr. Carter,

519
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,047
on your first toothpick-ectomy.

520
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,191
Now, let's start irrigating.

521
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,575
Mr. Mendoza...

522
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,910
Yes?

523
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:52,648
Your wife is out of
surgery, but she's very sick.

524
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,382
Her appendix burst
before I could remove it,

525
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,987
and, uh, the bacteria
invaded her bloodstream.

526
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,022
We're giving her antibiotics
to fight the infection.

527
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,590
I expect her to pull through it.

528
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,661
Are you saying
that she could die?

529
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,662
It's a possibility.

530
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,396
When we first came in,

531
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,633
was there no way to tell
that it was the appendix?

532
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,869
Well, the symptoms and the
story suggested food poisoning.

533
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,505
That woman sent us home
without ever seeing a doctor.

534
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,975
She consulted a doctor...

535
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,677
who ordered your
wife discharged.

536
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,535
How could this happen?

537
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,908
Hey!

538
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:36,909
How's the kid doing?

539
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,210
Oh, the same.

540
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,845
Think I could take
a peek in there,

541
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,846
give him this?

542
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,336
Yeah. Sure.

543
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,549
Did you draw that yourself?

544
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,274
I did.

545
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:50,289
Hey...

546
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:51,290
Where is he?

547
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,159
I don't know. Jeremy?

548
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,193
Oh, man.

549
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,327
Jeremy?

550
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:56,628
Oh, no.

551
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:57,652
Jeremy!

552
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,282
Jeremy! Jeremy...

553
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,483
Hey, have you seen the kid?

554
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,484
What kid?

555
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,485
The one that won't talk.

556
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,509
No.

557
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,224
Jeremy! Oh, God...

558
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,958
Jeremy!

559
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,627
Jeremy...

560
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,628
Hey, sweetie...

561
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,513
Hey, come on,

562
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:17,082
let's go back to
your room, okay?

563
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:18,299
Come on.

564
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,974
Okay?

565
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:27,626
The Pedes attending's
name is Keller,

566
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,027
and there's a med
student named Amber

567
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,829
who said she'd sit
with him for a while

568
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,631
until his aunt came
to pick him up.

569
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,633
Okay, you got it. Thanks.

570
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:35,634
Hey, um...

571
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:37,552
who does this belong to?

572
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,605
I told you to hold onto him.

573
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,173
I just turned
around for a second.

574
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:43,776
We picked him up in the
middle of Michigan Avenue.

575
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,977
He's zonked out of his gourd.

576
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,045
He's tachy, diaphoretic.

577
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:47,746
Could be coke, PCP.

578
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,403
All right, well, let's
get him a room.

579
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:52,150
Hey, Dr. Ross...

580
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:53,185
Yeah. What's this?

581
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,888
Some guy dropped it off for you.

582
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,890
Want something from
Psycha-Deli? I'm starving.

583
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:58,974
No.

584
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,375
Could someone
release the guy in 4?

585
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,977
I gotta get out of here.

586
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,078
Sure. You okay?

587
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,279
I'm having a walking
anxiety attack.

588
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,047
Call me.

589
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,683
Hi. You're all wired up.

590
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,951
Oh, great.

591
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,085
I'm gonna show you

592
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,737
how all the bells
and whistles work,

593
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:12,938
but I want to eat something.

594
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,073
How about you?

595
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:15,140
Uh... I'm not really hungry.

596
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:16,764
Oh. Okay.

597
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,267
So what's wrong with her?

598
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:22,948
What is this?

599
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,516
I don't know. Check it out.

600
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,907
Yowza!

601
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:30,255
"25,000 in ca..."

602
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,457
It was a gift from the
old man. 10-1, it's dirty.

603
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,727
Looks like your cancer
treatment fund just got richer.

604
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,128
It's going back.

605
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,697
Penance doesn't mean
anything if it's that easy.

606
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,099
Yeah, what do you
know about penance?

607
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:42,101
I used to date a
lot of Catholic girls.

608
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,125
You want their numbers?

609
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,705
Her lungs are
filling up with fluid.

610
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,106
I have to put in a swan.

611
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,241
How is she?

612
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,576
She might not make it.

613
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,610
Oh, God...

614
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:52,811
How could you miss the signs

615
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,879
of appendicitis?

616
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:55,814
Periumbilical pain,
localizing to the right.

617
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,215
She told me the
pain was diffuse.

618
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,717
Did you check for
rebound and guarding?

619
00:20:58,741 --> 00:20:59,918
I told you I did.

620
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,820
Well, I'm asking you
if you actually did.

621
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,722
Yes, and if you had any doubts,

622
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,708
you should've
examined her yourself.

623
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,243
Well, I trusted you to do that.

624
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,411
You know how difficult

625
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,246
appendicitis is to diagnose.

626
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,587
I asked you if you wanted
to see her, and you said...

627
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,527
The appendix that wasn't.

628
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,729
Well, there'll be plenty
more ahead of you.

629
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,565
I wish I had at
least one behind me.

630
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,765
It is cause for concern,

631
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,866
what with the pyramid system.

632
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,268
Pyramid system?

633
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,770
From now on, all surgical
interns will be ranked.

634
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,172
Those who fall
in the lower third,

635
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,597
won't be asked
back a second year.

636
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,182
Come on. You gotta
help me out here.

637
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,886
Hey, come on, bud, cooperate.

638
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,121
There's the Rolling
Stones. That's a cool one.

639
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,656
"Ban the bra."

640
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,126
"All the way with LBJ."
What's that about?

641
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,660
I won't hurt your
buttons. I promise.

642
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,296
I'll give your
buttons right back.

643
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,498
You just gotta take this off.

644
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,317
Hey! Security!

645
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:07,469
Let go of her!

646
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:09,838
This sucker's strong!

647
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,178
Hey!

648
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,412
Shep, I don't think
he's breathing.

649
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,413
Shep! Shep!

650
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,614
No pulse. He has no pulse.

651
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,021
Get the crash cart.

652
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,453
Get CPR!

653
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,022
Come on!

654
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,791
Come on!

655
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,343
What are you doing
to my crash cart?

656
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,694
Where's the ET tube?

657
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,596
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait! He's got a pulse.

658
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,581
He's back.

659
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,137
I got it!

660
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,406
Security! Security!

661
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,146
Hey, did they call us in?

662
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,181
Oh, relax.

663
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,549
We still have a few minutes.

664
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,550
Where's mom?

665
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,551
Uh, she went to Northfield

666
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,786
to see Sally.

667
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,420
Called that one right.

668
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,022
This is very
upsetting for her...

669
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,290
and for me.

670
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,160
When you have to choose
between your own daughters,

671
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,361
it's not right.

672
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,513
What do you mean?

673
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,514
I'm not going in.

674
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,249
Dad!

675
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:12,984
I don't want to take sides.

676
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:15,387
For three weeks, you have
been promising to back me up,

677
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,506
and you decide to
change your mind now?

678
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,141
You haven't spent
five minutes with Chloe.

679
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,197
You haven't met Joe.

680
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,962
Unbelievable.

681
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,365
I'm telling you, your
sister is like a new person.

682
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:29,367
She went out and got
a job the first morning.

683
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:30,769
She insists on
paying for the food.

684
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,137
Joe is a good guy.

685
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:36,008
Did you check his rap sheets?

686
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:37,009
He's a cop.

687
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,967
What?

688
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,338
I'm not going.

689
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,706
Look, it's all set.

690
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,307
Inga's counting on you.

691
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,308
I'm not going.

692
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,309
What's the problem here?

693
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,745
I was married for 11 years.

694
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,779
Uh-huh.

695
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,180
To be faced suddenly
with dating again...

696
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,181
Okay, you're over-thinking this.

697
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,583
You just got to follow your id.

698
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,584
It's more complicated than that.

699
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,585
No, it's not.

700
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,520
Okay, what is about
to pass between us

701
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,588
must remain

702
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,756
in the strictest of confidence.

703
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,024
Okay.

704
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,224
When I first met Jen...

705
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,682
Mm-hmm?

706
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:19,901
When you first met Jen...

707
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,737
I'd never had sex before.

708
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,438
Right. You were 17, right?

709
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,873
16.

710
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:28,509
And through all those years,
I've always been faithful.

711
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,578
Mm-hmm.

712
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,913
Are you telling me

713
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,514
that you've only
had sex with Jen?

714
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,683
That so unusual?

715
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,837
In the 20th century? Uh...

716
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:41,406
Yeah, you're right.
See? I'm a freak.

717
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,408
Well, that's a little strong.

718
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:44,676
No, no. It's true.

719
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,111
I've only had sex with my wife,

720
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:49,848
and the thought of being
intimate with a stranger, I...

721
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:51,099
What if she can't arouse me,

722
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,218
or, you know, I
can't please her?

723
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,153
The thought alone
scares me to death.

724
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:58,290
Well, you're right.
Inga's not for you.

725
00:24:58,314 --> 00:24:59,323
Uh...

726
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,616
<i>County, this is unit 52.</i>

727
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,650
<i>We have a 16-year-old male</i>

728
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,918
<i>beating victim</i>

729
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,753

<i>broken tib-fib,

731
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,757
Dr. Ross, 16-year-old trauma.

732
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,493
<i>BP's 80/50, resps
are shallow at 53.</i>

733
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,494
<i>Do you copy?</i>

734
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,562
We copy, 52. What's your ETA?

735
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,832
<i>We're a ways out.
I'd say 15 minutes.</i>

736
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,899
Copy that.

737
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,534
Dr. Ross, I'd like
to run this trauma.

738
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,936
Sorry, Carter, I promised Dale

739
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,793
he could run the next trauma.

740
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,899
Jerry, page me in 10 minutes.

741
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,498
These Kurley B lines...

742
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:41,499
What you looking at?

743
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:42,601
Pulmonary edema.

744
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,869
Man, I'm hungry. You
guys had lunch yet?

745
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:46,671
We were just
going to go in a few.

746
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:47,939
Care to join?

747
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,341
Well, I really should go up
now. I got some labs coming.

748
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:51,542
Well, Doc Magoo's?

749
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:52,944
Why don't we do the lunch room?

750
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,434
It's Nuremberg chicken day.

751
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:00,184
On October 10, 1994,

752
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,621
Chloe was arrested for
drunk and disorderly conduct.

753
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,423
At this time, she swore that
she would seek treatment.

754
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:06,557
Six months later,

755
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:08,593
she was arrested for
driving under the influence.

756
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:09,995
Dr. Lewis,

757
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,796
we are here to
explore the possibility

758
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,197
of you and your
sister settling this

759
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:14,265
without the court's help.

760
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:16,434
I take it you're not interested.

761
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,836
No, Your Honor.

762
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,403
And on the issue
of visitation rights?

763
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:20,788
No. I don't trust her.

764
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,073
Based on?

765
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:24,342
Based on her history of
drunkenness, addiction,

766
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:25,743
and false claims
of rehabilitation,

767
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:26,744
as outlined here.

768
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,946
I have a copy.

769
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,483
Chloe, is there anything
you'd like to say?

770
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,886
Well, everything Susan
said about me is true,

771
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,622
but I've never stayed in rehab
more than a week before now.

772
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:40,525
And you've been free
of alcohol and drugs for...

773
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:41,609
Five months.

774
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:47,449
Um, here are the
urine test results.

775
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,516
You've barely started

776
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,452
taking responsibility
for yourself.

777
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:53,755
How do you expect to take
responsibility for a child?

778
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,024
I ask myself that a lot,

779
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,944
but I am on the right track now,

780
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:01,680
and I never, ever
want to go back

781
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:02,780
to who I was,

782
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:05,917
and I feel that with
the help of God

783
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,286
and my friends...

784
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,524
and... my family...

785
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,294
that I can be a good
mother to my baby.

786
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:19,897
And you've been employed
as a claims adjuster in Phoenix

787
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,265
for the past four months.

788
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:22,334
Yep.

789
00:27:22,358 --> 00:27:23,958
Here are the affidavits.

790
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:27,394
They're holding a job for
me, and I got a job here.

791
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,141
Um...

792
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,159
could you step outside, please?

793
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,783
I want to speak
to Dr. Lewis alone.

794
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:46,007
I am going to allow your sister
three overnight visits a week,

795
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,976
starting tonight,

796
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,778
pending resolution
of the adoption issue.

797
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,380
What's more, I'm telling you now

798
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,282
that if you proceed
with the custody fight,

799
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,084
you will lose.

800
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,218
Chloe's the mother,

801
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,653
and as far as I can see,

802
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,221
she presents no
danger to a child.

803
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,222
Given that,

804
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,290
I want you to consider

805
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,492
the cost of proceeding...

806
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,510
Not just financially,

807
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:07,879
but in terms of the disruption

808
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,531
to your life, to Chloe's life,

809
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,339
and to the baby.

810
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,073
We should've gone fishing.

811
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,676
We could be sitting on the
pier with our toes in the water,

812
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,211
drowning a couple of worms.

813
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,412
Instead, here we are,

814
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,214
two urban casualties
of the button man.

815
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:31,019
My throat's fine, by the way.

816
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,089
We're not raising our kids here.

817
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,323
We're... we're not?

818
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,781
No. Definitely not.

819
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,339
Okay.

820
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,222
What happened here?

821
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,357
Appendix ruptured. She's septic.

822
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:54,926
I took a look at her chart,

823
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,060
and lo and behold,

824
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,162
you sent her home
without examining her.

825
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:00,215
Well, nothing in the PA's
exam suggested appendicitis.

826
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,239
I disagree.

827
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,391
"Abdominal pain,
cramping, fever."

828
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,226
You should've laid hands on her.

829
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,361
That's what a surgeon does.

830
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,562
You were quick to assign blame

831
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,796
when Doug Ross made a mistake.

832
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,733
But when your
ass is on the line,

833
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,568
you hide behind excuses.

834
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,369
If this hits the fan,

835
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,272
don't expect your colleagues
to line up with support.

836
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,779
Reap as you sow.

837
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:32,330
$7.43.

838
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,331
I got it.

839
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,332
No...

840
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,133
No, no. You get it next time.

841
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:37,477
Why don't you go ahead.

842
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:42,907
Oh! Damn it. Labs are up.

843
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:43,942
They can wait 10 minutes.

844
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,142
Better not.

845
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,278
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up to you.

846
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:48,382
Your soup's gonna get cold.

847
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,901
16 years old,
multiple lacerations

848
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,302
and bruises to face,
chest and abdomen.

849
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,704
Possible fractured left
tib-fib and facial fracture.

850
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:56,754
Excuse me!

851
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,557
Yo, anybody seen
Dale? You got that?

852
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:00,908
This guy sure
pissed somebody off.

853
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,311
Kids at the scene said he
got jumped out of a gang.

854
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,312
Can I do something?

855
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,746
You want to run it, run it.

856
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,781
Airway?

857
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,983
Patent. No tracheal deviation.

858
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,869
Bruises on chest and abdomen.

859
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,971
Let's get a C-spine,
chest and head CT.

860
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:14,422
Pupils?

861
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,925
Uh...

862
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,360
round, equal and reactive.

863
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,361
What's your name?

864
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,630
Virgil.

865
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,799
BP is down 60.

866
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,801
Carter?

867
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,469
He's bleeding from somewhere.

868
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,005
Where?

869
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,239
Good breath sounds.

870
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,307
That clears the chest.

871
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,975
There are no marks on his back.

872
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,143
Must be the belly.

873
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,144
Lavage kit!

874
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,147
Lavage kit, please.

875
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,182
Number 11 blade.

876
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,183
You ever done this before?

877
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:42,184
Not until today.

878
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,501
Well, Mr. Carter,

879
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,525
I see you're finally
getting a procedure.

880
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:47,928
Okay, go.

881
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,762
Make sure you're
into the peritoneum.

882
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:55,763
I'm in.

883
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,787
Hook up the saline.

884
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:02,753
And... extension tubing.

885
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,577
Almost looks like he
knows what he's doing.

886
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,943
How is she?

887
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,179
A little better.

888
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,938
I put a catheter in her artery
to make it easier to draw blood.

889
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,209
I don't see any other doctor
sitting by her bed all day.

890
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,515
Thank you for taking
care of my wife.

891
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,789
Mr. Mendoza, um...

892
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,905
when you asked earlier

893
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,539
if the appendicitis
could have been caught,

894
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,865
I didn't, uh, give
you a full answer.

895
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,569
I'm the doctor who
discharged your wife.

896
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,084
If I'd examined her

897
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,284
I probably would have caught it,

898
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,187
but...

899
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,190
I didn't.

900
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,860
I made a mistake.

901
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,117
I'm sorry.

902
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,324
Nothing. No blood in the belly.

903
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,725
BP's down to 40.

904
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:15,759
Where the hell's the bleed?

905
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:16,760
You check his back?

906
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:18,762
Take a look.

907
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:20,331
Here we go.

908
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,499
This doesn't make sense.

909
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,900
Maybe it's a faulty
pressure cuff.

910
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:24,869
Foley's clear.

911
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:26,004
Whoa! Spoke too soon.

912
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,005
Must have blown a clot.

913
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,039
Where is that damn wound?

914
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:29,063
What's that?

915
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,728
That is a very small
puncture wound,

916
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,263
probably an ice pick.

917
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,731
Went right by me.

918
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,266
Me too.

919
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,935
Let's get this kid
upstairs, patch him up.

920
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,637
Where do you think
he took it, Carter...

921
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,172
Kidney or renal artery?

922
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,307
Uh, renal.

923
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:46,942
Want to come up and find out?

924
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:47,943
Sure.

925
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,210
Nice catch.

926
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,412
Thank you.

927
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,413
What's going on?

928
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:52,948
Oh, stumbled
right into a trauma.

929
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:53,949
Ice pick to the kidney.

930
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,305
We're taking him up now.

931
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:20,013
Hi.

932
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,061
This is weird, isn't it?

933
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,463
Uh, yeah.

934
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,032
You haven't really met Joe yet,

935
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:28,332
have you?

936
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:29,367
Hi, Susan.

937
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,535
Hi, Joe.

938
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,004
I brought extra
diapers, and, um...

939
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:34,139
some baby Tylenol

940
00:33:34,163 --> 00:33:35,339
in case she gets a fever,

941
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:36,340
and, uh...

942
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:38,109
Oh. Mr. B.

943
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,045
She can't go to
sleep without him.

944
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:41,512
What's her bedtime routine?

945
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:44,983
Um, well, a bath, and then, um,

946
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,918
we read two picture books,

947
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,220
and, uh, a bottle while
she's getting rocked,

948
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:51,422
and usually, I sing to her.

949
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,791
All right. I better go.

950
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:55,493
We were hoping
you'd stay for dinner.

951
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:57,662
No, I don't think so.

952
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:58,997
Oh, please.

953
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:02,100
I know little
Suzy'd want you to.

954
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,656
She doesn't know who I am.

955
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,160
Come on.

956
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,895
First, let's review

957
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,096
a relatively simple trauma

958
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,498
led by our own Mr. Carter.

959
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,001
Note the uneven distribution
of personnel, screen right.

960
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,419
Everyone clumped together

961
00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:22,437
like a herd of wildebeest

962
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,607
getting in each other's way,

963
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,475
while the left side
is under-utilized.

964
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,110
How's it going?

965
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,211
Very enlightening.

966
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,529
Next, we'll see an example

967
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:32,630
of poor trauma hygiene.

968
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,865
Observe Mr. Carter
wiping his nose

969
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,318
with his gloved hand

970
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:38,619
just prior to
grabbing the scalpel.

971
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,243
Let's look one more time.

972
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:45,827
The... wipe, and now, the grab.

973
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,895
One more time.

974
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,514
Wipe...

975
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:51,800
and grab.

976
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,234
Good.

977
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,854
Now, let's take a look at
a more organized trauma

978
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:58,656
led by Dale earlier in the day.

979
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,092
You want to have dinner tonight?

980
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:02,182
Love to.

981
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,395
<i>Are you saying</i>

982
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:05,596
<i>that you have never had sex</i>

983
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,597
<i>with anyone but Jen?</i>

984
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,632
<i>Is that so unusual?</i>

985
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:08,900
<i>Uh, in the 20th century?</i>

986
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,185
<i>See? You're right. I'm a freak.</i>

987
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:13,188
I may have gone too far back.

988
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,489
<i>What if she can't arouse me,</i>

989
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,491
<i>or I can't please her?</i>

990
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,762
<i>The thought alone
scares me to death.</i>

991
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,181
<i>Well, you're right.
Inga's not for you.</i>

992
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,198
Oh, man.

993
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,705
Oh, my God.

994
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:41,432
Mrs. Mendoza's doing better.

995
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:42,433
Yeah, I know.

996
00:35:42,457 --> 00:35:43,668
I spoke to her husband.

997
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:46,104
He said that you told
him it was your fault.

998
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:47,627
It was my fault.

999
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:54,345
Peter, do you hate me?

1000
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,014
No.

1001
00:35:56,038 --> 00:35:57,815
You don't even look
at me when we talk.

1002
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,999
It's been like this all year.

1003
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:02,019
Look, I'm sorry that I hurt you,

1004
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,960
but I thought by
now, we'd be past it.

1005
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,297
I am past it.

1006
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,001
Way past it.

1007
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,473
You have to admit, it was funny.

1008
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:23,741
It was the most
humiliating moment

1009
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,942
of my life.

1010
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:28,045
Uh, Dr. Ross, this came for you.

1011
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,714
Bad news?

1012
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:32,182
Well, I've been denied a loan

1013
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:33,384
by a company whose motto is,

1014
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,219
"We lend money to anyone."

1015
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:36,921
There's always your dad's dough.

1016
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,188
Then I'd have to thank him.

1017
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:39,657
Penance has its price.

1018
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:40,725
Ready?

1019
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:41,726
As I'll ever be.

1020
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,860
How's your appetite?

1021
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:44,801
Uh, good.

1022
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:55,372
Look...

1023
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:56,473
Oh, thanks.

1024
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:57,474
It's strong.

1025
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:58,475
It's all right.

1026
00:36:58,499 --> 00:36:59,577
I hate to bring up

1027
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:00,678
the elephant in the room,

1028
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:03,113
but I think you did
a wonderful thing.

1029
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,314
You mean taking care of Suzy?

1030
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,315
I didn't have a choice.

1031
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,786
Even so, you gave
Chloe a chance.

1032
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,987
When she first came to AA,

1033
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:11,589
she had as low an
opinion of herself

1034
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:13,157
as anyone could,

1035
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:15,927
but she wanted to get well.

1036
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:17,161
I thought you were a cop.

1037
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:19,730
I'm also a
recovering alcoholic...

1038
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:20,765
Nine years.

1039
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:22,199
To be honest,

1040
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:23,935
the program frowns
on old-timers like me

1041
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:25,502
getting involved with newcomers,

1042
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,538
but we fell in love.

1043
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:30,374
We won't get married
for a while, though.

1044
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,877
Not till Chloe
gets her year cake.

1045
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:33,901
If she makes a year.

1046
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,356
Hey...

1047
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,457
Hi.

1048
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,459
I thought you were going
to go home and change.

1049
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:49,861
I did, but I changed my mind.

1050
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:50,862
You don't want to go?

1051
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:51,863
No.

1052
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:52,864
I already bought the tickets.

1053
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:54,265
Well, normally that
would bother me,

1054
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:55,867
but considering the
occasion, I don't really care.

1055
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,451
What occasion? My dumping you.

1056
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,852
You're dumping me?

1057
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,055
Yeah, and I gotta tell you,
I feel pretty good about it.

1058
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,206
What's going on?

1059
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,591
You know.

1060
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,743
No, I don't. I don't know.

1061
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,028
Get out of here.

1062
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,197
Look, we both know

1063
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,764
that you lured Dale
and me upstairs

1064
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,200
so that you could
do a procedure,

1065
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,568
which is all you care
about these days.

1066
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,602
That's not true. Yeah, it is!

1067
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,088
You're a weasel!

1068
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:18,889
All that matters to you
is making suck points

1069
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,190
with surgical Residents.

1070
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,642
Look, let's go
someplace and talk... No.

1071
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:25,246
Harper, please.
No. It's too late.

1072
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,990
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1073
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:44,348
Hey...

1074
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:45,616
Hey, you ready?

1075
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,717
Almost. Where's Reilly?

1076
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,752
He's at Magoo's

1077
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:49,520
with that cute tech he's after.

1078
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:50,888
The boy doesn't waste much time.

1079
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,356
Yeah. Good luck.

1080
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,374
Hey, doc,

1081
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,743
you hear?

1082
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,744
No, what?

1083
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,779
That kid that saw
his mom get shot?

1084
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,147
He finally started talking.

1085
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,900
Turns out that the boyfriend
was slapping mom around,

1086
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,901
so the kid runs,

1087
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,087
gets a gun from the drawer

1088
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,321
He's gonna protect
his mom, right?

1089
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,722
Only he's not such a good aim.

1090
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,724
No...

1091
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:12,659
Yeah. Killed his own mother.

1092
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,683
Nice world, huh?

1093
00:39:25,814 --> 00:39:27,491
I feel like I just
plucked the virtue

1094
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,226
of a virgin.

1095
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,784
I'm so glad you did.

1096
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,103
Want to do that again?

1097
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,172
I need a minute to recuperate.

1098
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:42,473
Okay.

1099
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:46,076
You let me know.

1100
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,895
In the meantime,

1101
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,597
we can play back the tape

1102
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,188
and critique your technique.

1103
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,640
Relax, sweetie. I'm kidding.

1104
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:10,984
You're awful quiet.

1105
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,152
Just thinking about that kid.

1106
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,855
He will never get
over what happened.

1107
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,657
He will be, for
the rest of his life,

1108
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,058
damaged goods.

1109
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,660
He'll probably end
up like the button man.

1110
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,061
No, he won't.

1111
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,062
Oh yes, he will.

1112
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,481
He is a button
man in the making.

1113
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,483
Hey, what's going on here?

1114
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,574
Idiots!

1115
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:33,657
Unit 47 requesting police
backup at 46th and Hutchins.

1116
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,825
Couple of guys

1117
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,769
bonking each other over
the head with cue sticks.

1118
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:38,729
Hey!

1119
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:39,747
Jeez!

1120
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,748
Come on!

1121
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,749
What are you doing?

1122
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,916
What's wrong with you, huh?

1123
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,722
You son of a bitch!

1124
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,557
Hey, Shep! Shep!

1125
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,727
Get back here! Shep!
What are you doing?

1126
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,016
Shep!

1127
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,768
Shep! Shep, stop!

1128
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,503
Stop!

1129
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:03,727
For God's sake, Shep! Stop it!

1130
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,029
Get off of me!

1131
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:19,269
Hi.

1132
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:21,405
Hi. I'm looking for Ray.

1133
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,740
He's not here.

1134
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:24,542
Okay.

1135
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:27,878
Oh, come on in.

1136
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,736
Okay.

1137
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:33,750
I'm Karen.

1138
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:36,237
I'm Doug.

1139
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:37,838
Can I get you
something to drink, Doug?

1140
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:38,839
Uh, no, thank you.

1141
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:39,840
Do you have any idea

1142
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,141
when Ray's gonna be back?

1143
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,142
Not tonight.

1144
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,278
I'm his son.

1145
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:45,446
Oh, I know.

1146
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,403
I saw you the night
you came into the bar.

1147
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:53,221
Oh, that's right. He said
that you were his boss.

1148
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,622
Yeah.

1149
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,762
I try to remind him of
that every chance I get.

1150
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,661
So are you his boss?

1151
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,980
Why don't you just come
right out and ask me?

1152
00:42:03,004 --> 00:42:04,014
Ask you what?

1153
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:05,299
Do I sleep with your father?

1154
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,650
Do you?

1155
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:08,653
I'm not going to answer that.

1156
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:12,756
Well, I only say that
because it's unusual

1157
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,757
that your boss would be

1158
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,126
living in your apartment.

1159
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,127
What's this?

1160
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:18,862
Scotch.

1161
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:21,031
Who said I lived here?

1162
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,368
What are you doing here?

1163
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:26,337
I'm staying here tonight.

1164
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:27,376
What are you doing here?

1165
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,680
I have no idea.

1166
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,642
What's this?

1167
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,943
Names, dates,

1168
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,946
case numbers that Dr. Vucelich
dropped from his study.

1169
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,499
I'm going on record to
show that the man is a fraud.

1170
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:57,167
Why are you doing this, Peter?

1171
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:59,603
Like you said, it's, um...

1172
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:03,212
easy to make excuses
for not doing the right thing.

1173
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,732
No more excuses.

1174
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:15,602
She takes four
ounces of milk at night,

1175
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:19,673
heated for 40 seconds at 50%.

1176
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,842
Okay.

1177
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,232
I'm so glad you stayed.

1178
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,281
I know everybody thinks
you've changed, Chloe,

1179
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,250
and I hope to God that you have,

1180
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,552
but forgive me

1181
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,387
if I'm not rejoicing just yet.

1182
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,755
Maybe I can't be objective,

1183
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,045
because I've been so
angry at you for so long.

1184
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:41,445
I mean, do you really think
you can be a good mother

1185
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:42,568
to this little girl?

1186
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,466
Yes.

1187
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,756
More than anything,
that's what I wanna be.

1188
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,797
Well, I can finish up in here.

1189
00:43:57,268 --> 00:44:00,381
Thanks.

1190
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:10,558
I'm so glad Suzy's got an aunt

1191
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:12,626
that'll always be there,

1192
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,496
who's smart and a doctor

1193
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,365
who's going to give
you good advice.

1194
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,234
Yes.

1195
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:22,098
Hey, you wanna say good night?

1196
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,306
Yeah, yeah.

1197
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,330
