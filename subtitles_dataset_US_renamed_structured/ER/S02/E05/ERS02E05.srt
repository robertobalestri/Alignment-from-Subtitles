1
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:15,809
Morning.

2
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,076
Morning.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,412
Are we alone?

4
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,314
I'm alone. Are you?

5
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:22,749
Thought I heard a woman's voice

6
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,250
during the night.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,568
You eavesdropping?

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,388
Ah, just, you know,
kind of hard to miss.

9
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:31,023
Didn't sound like Hulda.

10
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:33,109
You want a bagel?

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,377
Fresh?

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,380
Baked this morning
by elfin hands.

13
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,983
Works all day,
entertains all night,

14
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,354
and he gets up at
sunrise, goes to the bakery.

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,988
What's your secret?

16
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,013
I'm a virtuous man.

17
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:51,877
Good morning, Jer.

18
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,046
And a delightful morning to you.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,415
Fresh buttered popcorn?

20
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,716
Oh, I'm watching
my triglycerides.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,084
Turfed the
slip-and-fall to Ortho.

22
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,386
Well done. Popcorn?

23
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,455
Oh, yum.

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,524
Hello! Isn't it a wonderful day?

25
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:07,660
Good morning, ER!

26
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,062
Are the nitrous
tanks leaking again?

27
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:12,031
Better. It's Weaver's day off.

28
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,134
And if that's not
cause for celebration,

29
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,036
I don't know what is.

30
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:20,473
Perfect.

31
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,508
May I have this dance?

32
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:22,509
Oh, mm.

33
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,533
You guys are bad.

34
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:31,884
Turn it up.

35
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,819
♪ Oh, happy day ♪

36
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,171
♪ Oh, happy... ♪

37
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,906
Hi. Just getting on?

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,174
Yeah. You?

39
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,576
No. No.

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,743
I spent all night in the O.R.

41
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,745
A woman with a bowel
obstruction crashed.

42
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,046
Big mess.

43
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,748
And I floated my first
Swan-Ganz catheter.

44
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,883
Wow. You've done a
lot of procedures lately.

45
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,320
Yeah, cut-downs, chest tubes,

46
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,988
opened a coley,
closed an appi...

47
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,091
Benton's bum
finger's the best thing

48
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,759
that ever happened to me.

49
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,927
I even got to staple a stomach,

50
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,028
and Benton just
had to stand there

51
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,430
and watch. Okay?

52
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,048
The look on his
face was classic.

53
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:03,300
Just...

54
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:07,837
Carter. I have a new
procedure for you.

55
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,272
Foreign body extraction.

56
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,758
What, uh... kind
of foreign body?

57
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,176
Flashlight. Claims he fell on it

58
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,748
while changing a fuse... naked.

59
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,416
Adoption proceedings can't begin

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,852
until 90 days after abandonment,

61
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,755
so assuming we proceed,

62
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,824
the Hallorans would
petition for custody

63
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,961
in early January.

64
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,130
However, they would
like to take Susie

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,665
sooner than later.

66
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,467
How much sooner?

67
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,602
End of the week.

68
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,138
They feel the change
would be less traumatic now

69
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,274
than in a month or two.

70
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,425
Right.

71
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,344
I mentioned your wish

72
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,012
to continue to be
part of Susie's life

73
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,913
as her aunt,

74
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,816
and they are willing
to think about it.

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,285
Right.

76
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,190
Yes?

77
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,025
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Halloran are here.</i>

78
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,895
I'll come out.

79
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,964
They're nice people,
but there's no reason

80
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,265
to feel that you have to comply

81
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,568
with their timetable
and conditions.

82
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:15,238
You need to feel comfortable
with the arrangement...

83
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,724
I know.

84
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,593
And you should take
all the time you need.

85
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,237
I don't think time will
make it any easier.

86
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,006
Ready?

87
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,820
Mm-hmm.

88
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,872
Oh, what are their first names?

89
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,329
Kevin and Lisa.

90
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,715
Lisa, Kevin.

91
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,651
Yeah.

92
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:51,073
Thank you. Oh, we're so excited.

93
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,030
I'd like you to
meet Susan Lewis.

94
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,445
Hello.

95
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,431
Nice to meet you, Susan.

96
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,683
This is Susie.

97
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,619
She's so beautiful.

98
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,842
Thank you.

99
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:09,926
Do you want to hold her?

100
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,334
Oh. Yes.

101
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,115
Oh.

102
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,021
Oh... You are so precious.

103
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:25,180
So precious.

104
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,147
Not my shift. Not my shift.

105
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,883
Why are all these
old charts still here?

106
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,851
Dr. Weaver usually
weeds them out.

107
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,620
You can sure tell
when she's not here.

108
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:28,621
Yeah.

109
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:29,622
Where's Susan?

110
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,690
She took a personal day.

111
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:31,791
Huh?

112
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:34,594
Let there be no doubt,
flu season has arrived.

113
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,295
I have half the board.

114
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,362
One more. Chia-Chia Loew.

115
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,598
Oh, yeah, let me see him.

116
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,299
The little boy with AIDS?

117
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:41,601
Yeah. He spiked a fever.

118
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,970
He can't even sit
up. I put him in 3.

119
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,138
Kid in 2's done.

120
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,940
You get the French
fry out of his nose?

121
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,142
Yeah. I had to listen to his
mother talking 20 minutes.

122
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,744
I'll be glad when
this splint is off

123
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,745
and I'm back in surgery.

124
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,946
Hey, look at the bright side.

125
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,347
You've been given
a chance to perfect

126
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:58,150
your cozy bedside
manner. Here's another.

127
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,185
Great.

128
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,436
All yesterday,

129
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,004
he is in bed, throwing up.

130
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,806
He stopped talking.

131
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,210
Mm-hmm. The first
thing we need to do

132
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,011
is get his fever down
and stop the vomiting.

133
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,312
Yes.

134
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,580
In order to know

135
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,983
the right kind of
medicine to give him,

136
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,352
we're going to have to
do a lumbar puncture.

137
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,954
That's where we
take some of the fluid

138
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:18,955
from around the spine

139
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,757
and we test it to
see what's wrong.

140
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,158
That's what we're
going to do, okay?

141
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,161
Yes, uh... you make him well?

142
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,063
Well, we can't cure the AIDS,

143
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,530
you knew that,

144
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,801
but we'll do what we can
to make him feel better.

145
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,958
Thank you.

146
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,314
It's a piercing sort of pain,

147
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,783
like a spike through the temple.

148
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,051
Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,619
How long have you
been having migraines?

150
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,421
All my life. You ever get them?

151
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,456
No.

152
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,590
You?

153
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,691
No.

154
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,460
Count your blessings.

155
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,428
I'm going to ask the doctor
about giving you some Imitrex.

156
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,431
Oh, I had that once.
Gave me chest pain.

157
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay. In that case, Toradol?

158
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,152
Can't.

159
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,687
Gives me hives,

160
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:11,356
but they gave me something
here that worked wonders.

161
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,492
Began with a "D."

162
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,527
What was it?

163
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:16,762
Demerol?

164
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:17,952
That's it.

165
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,900
Okay.

166
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,903
We'll be right back.

167
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,072
She's sweet.

168
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,073
She's a junkie.

169
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:28,074
What?

170
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,175
It's a snow job.

171
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,577
She's faking migraines
to get a quick fix.

172
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,978
How can you tell?

173
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:34,780
If you hang around
as long as I have,

174
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:35,781
you can smell them.

175
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:36,915
Have you ever
seen the turkey file?

176
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,873
Hey, Dr. Benton. It still works.

177
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,488
Just kidding.
Different flashlight.

178
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,557
Thought that splint
was supposed to stay on

179
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:45,791
till tomorrow.

180
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:47,093
You got that circled
on your calendar?

181
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,760
You know, I handled
a lot of dislocations

182
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:49,962
when I did my Ortho rotation.

183
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:50,996
Not interested.

184
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,098
You're risking
permanent joint laxity,

185
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:53,199
osteoarthritis...

186
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,433
Goodbye, Carter. Tendinitis...

187
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:58,104
Dr. B., got a lady
here beat up bad.

188
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,105
Can you hear me, hon?

189
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,106
What happened?

190
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,173
Anonymous call.

191
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,774
Found her on the
floor of her house.

192
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:03,775
Multiple contusions,

193
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,977
bruises to the face and chest,

194
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,212
conscious but unresponsive.

195
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,046
Okay, let's lift her
on my count, people.

196
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,482
Nice and easy. Here we go.

197
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,350
One, two, three.

198
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,835
Do we have a name?

199
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,370
I.D. says Vickie Mazovick.

200
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,205
Vickie, squeeze my hand.

201
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,108
No blood in the canal.

202
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,126
Negative Babinski.

203
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,127
What's wrong with her?

204
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,178
Maybe psychotic.

205
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,645
Vickie, talk to me.

206
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,514
Tell me who did this to you.

207
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,982
All right, can you feel this?

208
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,001
Responds to pain.

209
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,019
Leave me alone!

210
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,053
Damn.

211
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,387
Maybe should have
kept the splint on, huh?

212
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,523
Extensive bruising to the ribs.

213
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,342
Get X-ray. Carter,
how's her chest?

214
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,909
Good bilateral breath sounds.

215
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,312
She's crying.

216
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,513
It's a good sign, I guess.

217
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:43,849
It's okay, sweetie.

218
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:46,118
It's okay.

219
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,086
Damn!

220
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,622
What was her last name again?

221
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:50,889
Krupke.

222
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,391
Krupke, Krupke. Aha.

223
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,260
Krupke, Lottie.

224
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,695
Also known as Kamen, Laura,

225
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,131
also known as Kimball, Myrna.

226
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:02,467
Addicted to narcotics,
alcoholic, bipolar.

227
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,936
God, this is sad.

228
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,403
No, what's sad is
when they con you

229
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,405
out of five or six doses
before you catch on.

230
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:09,574
Then you really
feel like a chump.

231
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:11,010
Nurse Hathaway?

232
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:13,612
Uh, Carol.

233
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,448
E. Ray Bozman. I'm
your nurse trainee.

234
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,616
Oh, yes, right. Come on in.

235
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,851
Grab a lab coat
under the counter.

236
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,085
I'll be with you in a second.

237
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,521
Mark? I've got to do an LP

238
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:23,588
on a 4-year-old.

239
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:24,690
I could use a hand.

240
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:25,924
Harper, you ever seen an LP?

241
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,592
No, but I'd like to.

242
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,528
I don't really want to babysit

243
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:30,896
a med student right now.

244
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,297
Well, it's either Harper

245
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,432
or the guy wearing
Morgenstern's lab coat.

246
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:37,725
Harper, let's do it.

247
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,176
Yeah, they seemed like
nice people, didn't they?

248
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,211
Yeah?

249
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:50,215
Smart, funny, not so
perfect. They're obnoxious,

250
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:53,452
and they have a little boy.

251
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:58,590
Yeah, huh? You could
have a big brother.

252
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:05,597
Someone to look out
for you, teach you stuff.

253
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:08,534
Oh, Susie...

254
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:12,237
This is so hard.

255
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:16,675
I just don't think I'd be
a good enough mother.

256
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,979
We have ways of screwing
kids up in my family.

257
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:26,851
I just want you to be happy.

258
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,556
I love you. You know that?

259
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,814
I do.

260
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh, God.

261
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:38,930
Orbit's okay. No fracture.

262
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,132
She's got a cracked rib.

263
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,417
Two cracked ribs,
two healed fractures.

264
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,569
Old shoulder
fracture, humerus...

265
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:45,870
Hey, you put your
splint back on.

266
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:46,894
Wise choice.

267
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,074
She said anything yet?

268
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:50,109
No.

269
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,310
Uh, actually, she did to me.

270
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,911
She told me she
wanted to go home.

271
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,913
Not a good idea. She's
been here three times before.

272
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,515
First time, she said
it was her husband,

273
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:57,983
but wouldn't press charges.

274
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,384
How about the
second and third time?

275
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,086
Said she fell down the stairs.

276
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,589
All right, call the
social worker.

277
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,190
Give Mrs. Mazovick
some Vicodin for the pain

278
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,992
and tell her to follow
up with her doctor.

279
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,393
You're not going to talk to her?

280
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,117
Not my job.

281
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,336
All right, kiddo.
Let's get started.

282
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,138
Okay, here we
go. Let's get going.

283
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,939
Hi, Chia-Chia.

284
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,208
Hold onto the
back of his thighs.

285
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:24,844
With your other hand,

286
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,645
you hold him on
the back of his neck.

287
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:27,813
Lean over.

288
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,649
Mm-hmm. Hold on tight.

289
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,084
No. No.

290
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,552
Now, buddy, your mom tells me

291
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,588
you like to play with
the neighbor's dog.

292
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,106
Mama. It's okay.

293
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,191
No, no, no.

294
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,935
You have to hold him tight.

295
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,034
Okay.

296
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,987
Shh. Shh.

297
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,839
Shh, shh, shh.

298
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:56,491
That's just to numb it. The
next one won't be so bad.

299
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,868
Now, when I was a kid...

300
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,036
I had a dog named Louis.

301
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,388
No, no, no.

302
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:12,729
Louis the dog.

303
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:19,920
You're doing great.

304
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,592
There we go.

305
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,859
Doing great.

306
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,310
He stopped moving.

307
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,446
Yeah.

308
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,620
He's surrendered.

309
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,680
Just a little more.
Not much longer.

310
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,649
Jerry, if anybody calls for me,

311
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,318
I'll be up in the
O.R. with Dr. Hicks.

312
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,342
Okay.

313
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,089
Is it lighter in here?
Did they repaint?

314
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,890
The Weaver has lifted.

315
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,459
Ah. Cake?

316
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,760
Uh, sure.

317
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,899
Subtle.

318
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,365
What's going on?

319
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,516
Uh, birthday party.

320
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,650
Oh, yeah? Whose birthday?

321
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,285
Bob's.

322
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,270
Bob's not working today.

323
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,840
Well, it's still her birthday.

324
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,675
Well, in that case,
how about a piece?

325
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,066
Sorry. It's all gone.

326
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,515
Hey there.

327
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,116
Man, was that no fun.

328
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,318
What?

329
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,586
LP on a little kid.

330
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,887
Always rough.

331
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,056
I'm on my way to resect a bowel.

332
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,491
Want to get some
lunch after that?

333
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,460
Sorry. I got to ride
herd on this kid.

334
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,461
How about dinner?

335
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,463
Possibly. Possibly?

336
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,464
Possibly.

337
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,131
Possibly.

338
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,133
Carter... Mm-hmm?

339
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,168
You and Harper,

340
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,470
something extracurricular
happening there?

341
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,471
Mmm...

342
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,005
Dr. Greene.

343
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,207
Loretta, how have you been?

344
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,810
Oh, lousy. I threw my back out.

345
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,811
How?

346
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,546
At work.

347
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,748
Jerry, can you start a chart?

348
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,916
Lydia? Come on. Coming.

349
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,253
So this is like a mid-life
career shift for you?

350
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,021
Yeah. I tend to shift a lot.

351
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,155
I've been a UPS delivery man,

352
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,057
a short-order cook,
a rodeo clown,

353
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,526
and then, in the mid '80s,

354
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,428
I got into the
human-potential movement.

355
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,229
Doing what?

356
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,899
Lectures,
inspirational speeches.

357
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,333
I'm a nurturer.

358
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,669
I like helping
people, so nursing

359
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,871
seemed like the
next logical step

360
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,539
in my life progression.

361
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,707
Okay, Mr. Keller.

362
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,375
You can take a seat right here.

363
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,644
There you go.

364
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,813
Great.

365
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,347
All right, I want you
to shave his head,

366
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,348
clean and irrigate the wound.

367
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,550
I'm going to start a chart

368
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,951
and get a doctor to stitch him.

369
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,968
Okey-dokey.

370
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,387
Dr. Ross. I went to pick up

371
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,388
Chia-Chia's lab results.

372
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,389
Mm-hmm.

373
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,390
They did a cell count,

374
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,391
differential, protein, glucose,

375
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,392
Gram's stain, and culture,

376
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,593
but they ran out of fluid

377
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,994
before they did
the India Ink stain.

378
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,396
I don't believe it.

379
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,265
Is that the test for the
cryptococcal meningitis?

380
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,666
Yes, yes.

381
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,285
Okay, tell me if this hurts.
Keep your leg straight.

382
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,220
It's okay.

383
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,022
I don't see any sign
of a slipped disc.

384
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:59,224
Just a muscle strain.

385
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,625
You need to stay off your feet.

386
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,227
No problem.

387
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,662
I mean bed rest, Loretta.

388
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,164
Emphasis on "rest."

389
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,499
Gotcha. Ooh.

390
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,134
It still hurts like
hell, though.

391
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,202
Can we give her something?

392
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:11,303
Yeah, I'll write
her a prescription

393
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,321
for Feldene.

394
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,356
Ooh, that ought to do the trick.

395
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,707
Dr. Greene?

396
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,377
Dr. Lewis is here to see you.

397
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,950
Loretta, take care.

398
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,020
It figures this
would happen today.

399
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:29,755
I was supposed to
have a job interview.

400
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:30,856
Really?

401
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,657
Yeah, answering phones

402
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,593
for a place that makes
clothes and stuff.

403
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,595
The social worker
put me up to it.

404
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,046
Sounds like a good job.

405
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,566
I never get these
things, though.

406
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,084
They take one look at
me, they know the score.

407
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,253
I wonder how.

408
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,956
We have a closet
full of clothes here.

409
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,158
You could see if
there's anything

410
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,159
right for an interview.

411
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,360
What do you got clothes for?

412
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,361
Whoever needs them.

413
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,562
Where do you get them from?

414
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,563
Dead people, mostly.

415
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,564
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

416
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,632
No, there's some nice stuff.

417
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,773
We get some pretty
rich dead people.

418
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,222
Okay. We need to do
another lumbar puncture

419
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:06,225
on Chia-Chia. Another?

420
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,227
Mei-Sun, I'm sorry, and if
there were any other way,

421
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:09,261
I would do it.

422
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:10,863
It's just going to
be a small amount.

423
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,064
Not as much as before.

424
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,271
Okay?

425
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,850
I'm sorry.

426
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,007
I met with a lawyer today

427
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,709
about putting Susie
up for adoption.

428
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,211
Really? Is it definite?

429
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,731
Before I make my final decision,

430
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,332
I need to know
what my options are

431
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,500
here at work.

432
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:49,902
If I keep her, there's no way

433
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,571
I could continue to do
my residency full-time.

434
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,323
Could I do it part-time?

435
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,526
Uh, I'll look into it. Have
you heard from Chloe?

436
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,961
No.

437
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,329
Look, it's been nuts
around here lately.

438
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,346
You want to get some coffee?

439
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,731
No, Mark, I don't.

440
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,867
I need to know if a
part-time schedule's doable.

441
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,202
I've only heard of
that in Pediatrics.

442
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,303
So it's not?

443
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,288
I don't know.

444
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:10,289
I'll talk to Morgenstern

445
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:12,491
and see if we can
work something out.

446
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:13,526
I appreciate it.

447
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,810
You beeped me out
of a bowel resection

448
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:15,811
to sew up a drunk?

449
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,145
Benton said you
liked doing procedures.

450
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,302
Ha. Very funny.

451
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,016
Whoa.

452
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,017
Oh, my God.

453
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,018
Almost done.

454
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,054
E. Ray...

455
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,455
why did you shave
his entire head

456
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,822
for a four-centimeter lac?

457
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,990
Mr. Keller and I

458
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,342
have been talking

459
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,144
about how to effect
positive change in one's life

460
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,613
and how changing the physical

461
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,556
can be a symbolic first step
in transforming the inner self.

462
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,620
You Benton?

463
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,788
Mm-hmm.

464
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,989
McGillis. Social Services.

465
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:46,659
I'm confused about
your chart notes

466
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:49,161
on Vickie Mazovick, the
woman who got beat up.

467
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:50,362
Mm-hmm.

468
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:51,797
You didn't note
whether she had injuries

469
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,798
to her hands and arms.

470
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:53,799
She didn't.

471
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,933
Could you note that, please?

472
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,401
It could be significant.

473
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,636
If I thought it was significant,

474
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,071
I would have written it down.

475
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:02,925
It suggests she
didn't defend herself,

476
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,893
which suggests she's given up,

477
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,028
which means statistically

478
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,663
she's reached a stage

479
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,587
where she's in
danger of being killed.

480
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,224
You didn't note what she said

481
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,458
when you asked
her what happened.

482
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:21,927
I didn't ask her what happened.

483
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:23,295
Did you suspect abuse?

484
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,897
Of course I did.
I saw the chart.

485
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:26,865
Then you're supposed to ask.

486
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,500
So, what did she tell you?

487
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,734
Nothing.

488
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,003
So what makes you think

489
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,304
she's going to tell me anything?

490
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:35,796
It's worth a try,
don't you think?

491
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,046
Oh, this would look good on you.

492
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,904
Maybe not.

493
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,520
It doesn't really quite fit.

494
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,456
What do you
mean? It looks great.

495
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,590
Do you think so?

496
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:57,095
Oh, yeah, but it,
uh... needs something.

497
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,264
You see some stuff
working here, I bet.

498
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,582
Oh, like you don't?

499
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,934
My clients don't die on me...

500
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,642
except for that one guy.

501
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,402
That's it.

502
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:18,450
Do you think so?

503
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:21,253
Mm.

504
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,254
Doing another LP?

505
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:23,622
Yeah, lab forgot
to do an India Ink,

506
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:25,023
so I'm gonna tap
out a couple CCs

507
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,124
and do the test myself.

508
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:27,259
How's he holding up?

509
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:28,749
Not well.

510
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,132
This is going to be quick.

511
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,806
It's only going to
take a few minutes.

512
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,608
Hi, Chia-Chia.

513
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,611
How's it going?

514
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,317
Yeah, get him over on his side.

515
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,905
Mrs. Mazovick? I'm Dr. Benton.

516
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,506
I need to ask you
a few questions

517
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,740
about how you got hurt.

518
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,509
I fell.

519
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,744
Mrs. Mazovick, there are
people that can help you.

520
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,135
I don't want any help.

521
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,750
Okay. Uh...

522
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,652
I'm still going to
have to report it

523
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,221
to the police.

524
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,345
Won't do any good.

525
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:33,147
Put three drops in there
and then a drop of ink.

526
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,154
Then you slide it
under the microscope.

527
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:44,937
You okay?

528
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,472
Yeah, I'm fine.

529
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,108
You did really well in there.

530
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,745
Better the second
time than the first.

531
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,347
Does it get easier?

532
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,005
No. Catch that light.

533
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,620
I thought Pediatrics
was the happy specialty.

534
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:04,056
Most of the time.

535
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,681
Okay. Here you go.
What do you see?

536
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,931
Hmm. Yeast cells.

537
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:15,601
Some larger
capsules around them.

538
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,285
Cryptococcus.

539
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,905
He has cryptococcal meningitis?

540
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,214
Yeah. He's getting near the end.

541
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,535
I need somebody
to call the police

542
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,870
to report a suspected
case of domestic abuse.

543
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:35,871
You got it.

544
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,607
Carter, where you going?

545
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,409
Oh, Dr. Morgenstern is
doing a hemicolectomy.

546
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,811
He asked me to
make the incision.

547
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:45,948
Hmm. Uh-uh. Not today.
Guy in 6 cut his finger.

548
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,016
Uh-oh.

549
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,934
Please! Please! I need help!

550
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,353
Get a gurney! You're
going to need help.

551
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,354
I've got it, Carter.

552
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:52,355
What if you have
to do a cutdown?

553
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,789
I've got it! Where are you hurt?

554
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,042
It's not me. It's my
husband. He's in the car.

555
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,644
What happened?

556
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:00,713
He was on his motorcycle
outside our apartment,

557
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,448
and a truck hit
him and took off.

558
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,550
All right, let's get him
out. Let's get him out.

559
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,718
Come on.

560
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,053
Oh, man, that's a lot of blood.

561
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,688
Is he dead?

562
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:09,822
No, he's still breathing.

563
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:11,557
I tried to get him
here as fast as I could.

564
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,959
I ran red lights.

565
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:13,960
You did the right thing.

566
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,127
He's hypovolemic.

567
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:16,361
He's gonna need
at least six units.

568
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,563
Wait a minute! Where's his arm?

569
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,804
It's in the back seat!

570
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:23,418
Oh, my God.

571
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,604
It is the same thing
he had before?

572
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:29,675
Yes, he's, um...
He's had a relapse.

573
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,276
He's very sick.

574
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,780
Now, the best way
to treat him now

575
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,048
Is to give him

576
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:39,384
a high concentration of
medication intrathecally.

577
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:40,653
Which means?

578
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,287
It means that we're going to do

579
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:44,156
the same procedure
as the spinal tap,

580
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,624
but in reverse.

581
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,609
Again?

582
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,695
It's the only way to
get a high enough dose

583
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,168
of the medication.

584
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:55,156
One more time.

585
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:59,405
No, it has to be a full course.

586
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:00,973
That means two times a day

587
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:03,993
for 10 days.

588
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,761
We'll admit him
into the hospital.

589
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,913
We'll put a
catheter in his back.

590
00:23:07,937 --> 00:23:10,971
That way, he won't have to
have the puncture each time.

591
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,188
It will stop the
vomiting and the fever?

592
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:19,408
If he responds to
the medication, yes.

593
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,493
Once his body

594
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:21,744
has fought off the meningitis,

595
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:22,878
it'll be able to work harder

596
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,570
against the AIDS.

597
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:39,445
If you think this is the
best thing for Chia-Chia.

598
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:41,668
I do, yes.

599
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,637
I work at Daly Plaza,

600
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,038
and my wife works at
the Merchandise Mart,

601
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,641
so we got together
for a picnic lunch

602
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:53,743
by the fountain
at, uh, lunch hour.

603
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,043
Sounds nice.

604
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,246
It was, until I decided
to cut the French bread

605
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,114
with my Swiss Army knife.

606
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:03,786
I knew I should
have gotten soft crust.

607
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,021
How long have you had
that mole on your arm?

608
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,022
Oh, a while.

609
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,724
Actually looks a little bigger

610
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,493
than the last
time I looked at it.

611
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,494
If you want,

612
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:12,695
I can excise it
and run tests on it,

613
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,696
just to be safe.

614
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,797
What does that involve?

615
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,098
Give you an anaesthetic,
surgically remove it.

616
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,768
Won't take long.

617
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:19,769
All right.

618
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:20,903
Yeah? Great.

619
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,305
I'll just run it past
the Attending,

620
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,674
and I will be right back.

621
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,398
Yes!

622
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,014
Hang three units O-neg.

623
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:33,015
Put it on the infuser.

624
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,199
He's still bleeding.

625
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,334
Inflate the BP cuff to 150.

626
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:36,568
What's going on, Peter?

627
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:39,688
Hit-and-run amputation.
He's hypovolemic.

628
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,873
Where's the arm?

629
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,057
Wrapped and on ice.

630
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,341
Get a vascular
surgeon down here.

631
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,594
Someone call the
Reimplantation Team.

632
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,029
Don't get a pulse.

633
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,030
He's bradying down.

634
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,031
Tube him.

635
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,015
Not with this finger.

636
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,149
ET tray.

637
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:52,217
Epi?

638
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,452
Atropine.

639
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,120
One milligram, IV push.

640
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:56,310
Number eight.

641
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:01,610
I got a pulse.

642
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:02,911
BP's 50 palp.

643
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,029
Well, that's something.

644
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:05,798
Okay, hang another
two units O-neg.

645
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:08,417
Pack. We'll move him
as soon as he's tubed.

646
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,651
All right. Let's move him.

647
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,626
Cookie, the door.

648
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,894
Who is it?

649
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,362
It's me, Mom.

650
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,563
Oh, do you have the baby?

651
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:22,731
Yeah.

652
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,200
Just a second.

653
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:31,973
Smile.

654
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,692
<i>Mom...</i>

655
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,410
<i>you bought a video camera.</i>

656
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,612
<i>Well, if you're going
to be a grandma,</i>

657
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,319
<i>you may as well do it right.</i>

658
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,584
<i>Thing cost a fortune.</i>

659
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,920
<i>No wonder there's
a trade deficit.</i>

660
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:47,423
<i>Mom, would you do that later?</i>

661
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:48,891
<i>Don't be such a grouch.</i>

662
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,293
<i>Turn around. Smile for Grandma.</i>

663
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,794
<i>Well, I need to sit down.</i>

664
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,131
<i>Sit. Give me the little termite.</i>

665
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,465
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

666
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,599
<i>Okay. Yeah. There you go.</i>

667
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:01,186
<i>Look up, up, up.</i>

668
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,588
Uh...

669
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,856
I need to talk to you guys.

670
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,924
Look. Hi!

671
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:06,958
Mom?

672
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,627
<i>Oh, she's so cute. Mom?</i>

673
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,761
<i>A-booga-booga-booga.</i>

674
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:10,779
<i>Look at that.</i>

675
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:11,847
Dad. Oh, honey.

676
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,782
<i>I'm listening.</i>

677
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,968
I met with a lawyer
today about...

678
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,204
giving Susie up for adoption.

679
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:21,390
But she's not even your baby.

680
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:25,927
Mom, Chloe is never coming back.

681
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,130
Would you turn that thing off?

682
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:31,950
I don't know how you
could even consider that.

683
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:34,887
You really don't want to
give her away, do you?

684
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:35,955
No, of course I don't.

685
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:37,356
It kills me to
even think about it.

686
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,624
Then don't.

687
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,226
How am I supposed
to raise her alone

688
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,728
and finish my residency?

689
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:45,114
People do these things
all the time, don't they?

690
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:47,882
Dad, I work 12-hour
shifts, five days a week.

691
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,586
And I am not going to put
her in day care for that long.

692
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,020
Well, there must be
something you can do.

693
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,446
Well, could you guys keep
her three days a week?

694
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:01,813
Maybe we could do
it. Three days a week?

695
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,849
Oh, sure. We all
know what that means.

696
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,450
I'll be doing all the
work, running around...

697
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:06,552
Wait a minute. I'm here.

698
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:07,920
You haven't left this
house in six years.

699
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:09,487
You hardly ever even
leave that damn chair.

700
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,890
I'm retired. You make me
sound like some kind of a nut.

701
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,124
It's not normal.

702
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:14,693
Well, at least I
don't drink all day.

703
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,378
Two vodka gimlets for
breakfast? That is a lie.

704
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,596
Whose Path report is this?

705
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,597
Finger lac in 6.

706
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:19,598
I saw a growth on his arm,

707
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:20,632
convinced him
to let me test it...

708
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:21,833
Melanoma.

709
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:23,969
Bingo, and I found an
axillary lymph node on exam.

710
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:25,637
It needs to be excised.

711
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:26,939
I already spoke with Peirrera

712
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:27,973
over in Surgical Oncology,

713
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:30,009
and he agreed to
let me do the biopsy.

714
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,710
Peter, cop's in
with Mrs. Mazovick,

715
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,545
in case you want to talk to him.

716
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,403
Right.

717
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,551
I just picked up an
interesting case, I think.

718
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,585
Yeah? Yeah.

719
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:41,987
I excised a mole on
a 36-year-old male.

720
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:42,988
Turns out it's melanoma,

721
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:44,256
and I get to biopsy
the lymph node.

722
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,858
A 36-year-old has cancer,

723
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,294
and you get to do the biopsy.

724
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:51,852
Well, congratulations.

725
00:27:58,094 --> 00:27:59,071
Well,

726
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,405
I hope you have an easier time

727
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,640
convincing Mrs. Mazovick
to make a statement

728
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,708
than I did.

729
00:28:02,732 --> 00:28:03,875
And who are you?

730
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:04,877
I'm Dr. Benton.

731
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:07,012
I was in charge of
her case, Officer...

732
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:10,315
Mazovick.

733
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:11,979
Come on, babe. Let's go.

734
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:15,871
What goes through your head

735
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,824
when you're beating her?

736
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,409
Hmm?

737
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,278
What a big man you are?

738
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,764
Michael, please.

739
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,289
Please.

740
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,023
Your husband just
went up to the O.R.

741
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,393
They're trying to
reattach his arm.

742
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,695
They can do that?

743
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,297
Well, they can try.

744
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:44,099
With complete amputation,
the success rate's small.

745
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,267
But we only have insurance left

746
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,535
for three days.

747
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,869
I wouldn't worry
about that right now.

748
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:48,970
They'll cover it.

749
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,439
But Jason lost his
job three months ago,

750
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:51,640
benefits, too,

751
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:54,109
and I'm a waitress, no benefits.

752
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,178
Is there somebody
I can call for you?

753
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:59,315
Oh, no, no, thanks.

754
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:02,318
I keep having this weird thought

755
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:03,719
that Jason's dead

756
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,153
and you're just not telling me.

757
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,422
He isn't, is he?

758
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,023
No. He's in the O.R.

759
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,993
You're just feeling the stress.

760
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,028
Carrie,

761
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:15,730
would you like to
come and lie down

762
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,832
in the lounge?

763
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,817
No.

764
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,741
No, thank you.

765
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,839
How are you doing, Mr. Forchet?

766
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,377
I'm starting to worry
a little bit, actually.

767
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,029
Is something wrong?

768
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:32,414
Dr. Carter, they said
you might need some help

769
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,982
with a lymph node biopsy?

770
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,551
Ah...

771
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,385
A biopsy?

772
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,221
Do I have cancer?

773
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,924
Mr. Forchet, your
mole was identified

774
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,547
as a malignant melanoma.

775
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,896
Oh, my God.

776
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,098
No, no. The good
news is that we caught it,

777
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,833
which means we can
start treatment immediately.

778
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,486
What's the worst-case scenario?

779
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,622
There's really no
way to gauge that

780
00:29:56,646 --> 00:30:00,091
until we stage the
cancer and see if it's...

781
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:03,028
uh, spread...

782
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,597
which is why we're
going to do the biopsy.

783
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:06,999
I can't believe this.

784
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:09,134
I mean, I came in here
for a cut on my finger,

785
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:11,625
and...

786
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:14,239
I need to call my wife.

787
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,573
I, uh...

788
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:20,467
How am I going to tell her?
What am I going to say?

789
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:36,194
It's okay.

790
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:37,830
I can't believe
this is happening.

791
00:30:37,854 --> 00:30:40,265
I know. I know. That's it.

792
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:43,535
Just let it out and
work through it.

793
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:50,842
So in your opinion,
the injuries resulted

794
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:51,877
from some kind of battery?

795
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:52,945
Yep, no question.

796
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,145
Are you willing to testify

797
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:55,213
if we need you?

798
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:56,214
Well, I guess.

799
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:57,215
You think that's
going to happen?

800
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,283
It's up to her, you know?

801
00:30:58,307 --> 00:30:59,284
She won't make a statement.

802
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:00,318
There's no other witnesses.

803
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,553
Not much I can do to help her.

804
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:02,654
And the fact that he's a cop,

805
00:31:02,678 --> 00:31:03,722
does that make a difference?

806
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,779
No, not to me.

807
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:11,063
You seen these?

808
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:12,263
First time she came in,

809
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,299
missing two teeth, broken jaw.

810
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:16,835
Second time, bruises
across her back and buttocks,

811
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:17,936
third time, broken arm,

812
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,157
and these? These are from today.

813
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,826
She used to work
Dispatch at the 14th.

814
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,328
You know her?

815
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,963
Used to.

816
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:28,947
Doug? Hey.

817
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,148
I signed for that amphotericin B

818
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:31,149
you ordered for Chia-Chia.

819
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:32,184
I got it. Thank you.

820
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,452
What's the plan?

821
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,053
The plan is to do
everything I can

822
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:37,255
to buy that kid and his mother
some more time together.

823
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,057
He didn't respond to the
amphotericin the last time.

824
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:40,859
This time I'm gonna
give it to him intrathecally.

825
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:41,860
That's a pretty rough procedure,

826
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:42,861
especially on a four-year-old.

827
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:43,928
What are you saying, Mark?

828
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,130
I'm just wondering

829
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,431
if the treatment's too extreme

830
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:47,832
for the best prognosis
you can hope to get.

831
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:50,173
Not in my opinion.

832
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:53,827
Okay. Okay.

833
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,915
Yeah, hey.

834
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,850
Hey, can you see?

835
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:24,085
Can you see?

836
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:28,240
Do you remember the
nice lady from this morning?

837
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:30,058
Do you want to go on the slide?

838
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,716
Let's go on the slide.

839
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,221
What do you think?

840
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,158
You designed that yourself?

841
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:49,660
Yeah. You can swim in it,

842
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:51,879
or you can wrap a
scarf around your waist

843
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,148
and wear it out on the town.

844
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,733
Who does she mean by "you"?

845
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:56,867
I'm meeting with
investors next week

846
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,652
about designing a whole line.

847
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:02,356
I'm going to call it Randi-Wear.

848
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,474
Catchy.

849
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:05,109
Oh, well, you want to invest,

850
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:08,012
now is the time.

851
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:09,347
On that note,

852
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:10,781
I will bid you all
a fond good eve.

853
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,783
It's been a wonderful
Weaver-less day.

854
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:13,907
Nighty-night.

855
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:17,644
Is he single?

856
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:22,426
Yeah.

857
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,829
Carrie, your husband's
out of surgery.

858
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,693
They were able
to reattach his arm.

859
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:35,689
You...

860
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,077
You said the chances of
that happening were small.

861
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,812
Well, we're not out
of the woods yet.

862
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,979
We still have to wait

863
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,923
and see if the tissue
can survive the trauma.

864
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:48,886
Do you have any Valium
in there or something?

865
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,022
Well, I can't give you
anything without a prescription,

866
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,623
but I can start
a chart for you...

867
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,241
No, that's okay. No.

868
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,745
I'm gonna... try
a cigarette first.

869
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:58,946
You can't...

870
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,365
smoke in here.

871
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,523
Oh, yeah.

872
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,372
Carrie?

873
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,307
This is good news.

874
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:14,133
Yeah. It's great.

875
00:34:21,343 --> 00:34:23,421
Excuse me. Mrs. Loew?

876
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:24,422
Uh, yes?

877
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:25,556
I'm Dr. Greene.

878
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,142
I'm the Attending
Physician here in the E.R.

879
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,377
I'd like to talk to
you about Chia-Chia.

880
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,478
Uh...

881
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,046
something is wrong
with Chia-Chia?

882
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,514
No, no, no.

883
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,216
I was talking with Dr. Ross

884
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,051
about the treatment
you agreed to.

885
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,019
I wanted to make sure
that you understood

886
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,521
everything that was involved.

887
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,256
Yes.

888
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,260
The side effects of the
medicine can be very painful...

889
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,213
worse, sometimes, than the
symptoms of the meningitis.

890
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:50,380
Worse?

891
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:51,448
Yes.

892
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:54,285
I want to be sure that you know

893
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:55,953
that if you don't want
to go through that,

894
00:34:55,977 --> 00:35:00,624
we can give you medicine
to make him comfortable.

895
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:02,426
You can take him home.

896
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,146
But, uh... he will be sick.

897
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,101
Mrs. Loew, the fact that the
medicine failed once before

898
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,638
means that there's
a strong possibility

899
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:15,728
that it may fail again.

900
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,311
Even if we could
cure the meningitis,

901
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:24,014
your son's AIDS
is very advanced.

902
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:29,987
With or without
treatment, realistically,

903
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,245
we're really only looking
at a matter of days.

904
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:37,383
I'm sorry.

905
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:50,241
You need to decide
how you and your son

906
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:53,132
want to spend those days.

907
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,372
But, uh, Dr. Ross...

908
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,324
But...

909
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:08,147
he...

910
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,652
he said...

911
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,359
You went over his aftercare?

912
00:36:41,383 --> 00:36:42,459
I did.

913
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:44,195
Mr. Lubow needs
his boil drained.

914
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:45,496
And we got a fresh
trauma pulling in.

915
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,797
Carter, you take him.

916
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:49,166
Lydia, did you take
the syringe in Room 2?

917
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,368
No. Why?

918
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:52,103
I just lost five
milligrams of morphine.

919
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,337
What do we have?

920
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,638
This cop is beat up pretty bad.

921
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,140
He's missing teeth.

922
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:57,875
Look like his jaw's broke.

923
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,410
Busted ribs.

924
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,577
What's his name?

925
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:01,578
Mazovick.

926
00:37:01,602 --> 00:37:02,880
How did it happen?

927
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:05,854
He was in pursuit of a
suspect and took a bad fall.

928
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,603
All right, let's get
his clothes off.

929
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,988
Let's get an oral
surgeon down here

930
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:12,406
and wire his teeth.

931
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,625
We got a mandible
fracture. Call X-ray.

932
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,062
Crepitus on the right.
Absent breath sound.

933
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,596
Collapsed lung?

934
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,697
Chest-tube tray coming up.

935
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:21,999
All right, prep and drape him.

936
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,289
See you around, Doc.

937
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:29,539
Number 10 blade?

938
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,942
Yeah.

939
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,144
"Christopher Robin had
wheezles and sneezles.

940
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,745
"They bundled him into his bed.

941
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:38,215
"They gave him what
goes with a cold in the nose

942
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,717
and some more for
the cold in his head."

943
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,120
A.A. Milne?

944
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,554
<i>Now We Are Six.</i>

945
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:46,457
Eeyore was my favorite.

946
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,558
Tigger.

947
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:50,461
So it's time to get started?

948
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:51,495
Yeah, would you just

949
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,631
slide that tray
over here for me?

950
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:55,832
Hey.

951
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,167
We were just getting started.

952
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,469
I want to take him home.

953
00:37:58,493 --> 00:37:59,970
Now?

954
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:01,422
Yes.

955
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,757
We... we discussed this.

956
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,559
Now, this is a
painful procedure,

957
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,395
but it's the best shot we have

958
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,645
of buying him more time.

959
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:10,881
I don't want him
to have more pain.

960
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:13,722
I want him home with me.

961
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,650
Okay.

962
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,833
Do you think I make
a bad decision?

963
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:31,857
No, I think you're
making the right decision.

964
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,224
Thank you.

965
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,792
Hmm.

966
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,461
I'm gonna get the medication

967
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,586
to make sure he's
comfortable at home.

968
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:04,201
Carol, you got to come see this.

969
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,680
It won't stop coming out.

970
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:12,932
It won't stop...

971
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,114
Well, found my missing morphine.

972
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:21,218
I have to get this clean.

973
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:23,720
It's Jason's favorite.

974
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:29,260
There was so much... blood.

975
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,761
I guess we'd better
find her a bed.

976
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,229
Yeah, and some Narcan.

977
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:38,068
He said it'd be easy, but
the ax wasn't sharp enough.

978
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:39,920
What did she say?

979
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,156
Something about an ax.

980
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,761
We only had three
days left on the policy.

981
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:48,862
Oh, my God.

982
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,064
What?

983
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,999
Her boyfriend's arm.

984
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,568
They chopped it off?

985
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,487
Chop, chop.

986
00:39:56,511 --> 00:40:00,757
Oh, Lordy.

987
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:04,961
Five bucks says she's in there.

988
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,264
"Carlisle, Denner, Dougherty..."

989
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:10,367
"Diehl, Carrie."

990
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,503
Oh, man.

991
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:14,571
She's been in here
half a dozen times.

992
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:17,741
Drug seeking, narcotics OD.

993
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:19,610
I missed it.

994
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:20,977
And husband.

995
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,521
Honey, you were burned.

996
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,466
Five bucks.

997
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,119
Mark, you went behind my back.

998
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,387
You lost perspective.

999
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:31,388
You had no right

1000
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,723
to go to my patient
and to tell her

1001
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:33,724
what you thought she should do.

1002
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,125
I have an obligation
to make sure

1003
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:36,426
patients have the
information they need

1004
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,561
to make decisions
about treatment.

1005
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:38,762
That's my job.

1006
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:40,564
I'll tell you, why don't
you just spare me

1007
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,065
your Attending Oath of Office?

1008
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:43,433
We're talking about
a 4-year-old here.

1009
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:44,468
A 4-year-old

1010
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:45,803
with end-stage AIDS,

1011
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:47,404
who you wanted to put
through a torturous procedure

1012
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:48,672
the last few days of his life.

1013
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,707
You don't know that.
Nobody knows that.

1014
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:51,074
Oh, no, of course not.

1015
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:52,943
There's always the
possibility of a miracle, Doug.

1016
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,344
I thought we were
practicing medicine here.

1017
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,146
I'll tell you something,
if it was your kid,

1018
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,303
if it was your kid, you
would bet on a miracle.

1019
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,113
Lydia, I got it!

1020
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,280
The job? Yes!

1021
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,915
Oh, Loretta, that's great.

1022
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,986
You are looking at a
real live receptionist.

1023
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,822
Oh, I knew you could do
it. I am so happy for you.

1024
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,424
I beat out five other girls.

1025
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,392
Of course, I had to
do the guy, but hey,

1026
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,996
I got the job!

1027
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,569
You okay?

1028
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,104
Oh, I'm a mess.

1029
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,805
Yeah, me too.

1030
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:44,211
You were a big help
today. Thank you.

1031
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,514
I was going to thank you.

1032
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,349
For what?

1033
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,550
For giving you a front-row seat

1034
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:50,817
to the...

1035
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,392
the limitations of
modern medicine?

1036
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,159
For what it's worth,

1037
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,533
I think you were right
to keep trying today.

1038
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,965
All my medical school
professors told me

1039
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:09,086
that County was full of
burnouts that didn't care.

1040
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,078
Well, they got the
burnout part right.

1041
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:18,077
What do you do
after a day like today?

1042
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:23,572
I tend to drink, but I'm
not the best role model.

1043
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:32,176
I wouldn't mind a drink.

1044
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,013
♪ Blackbird singing
In the dead of night ♪

1045
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:41,118

wings And learn to fly ♪

1046
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:00,204
Hello.

1047
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:01,671
Hello.

1048
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:03,740
Stopped by your apartment.

1049
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:05,609
Am I interrupting?

1050
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,134
No. Pull up a swing.

1051
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,018
I talked to Morgenstern.

1052
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:17,287
He said he'd
present your request

1053
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:19,245
to the Residency Committee.

1054
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:22,426
Sounds like he
wasn't too thrilled.

1055
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,028
You ever seen
Morgenstern thrilled?

1056
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,153
No.

1057
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,969
He agreed to consider
it. That's something.

1058
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,506
Thank you.

1059
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,597
You're welcome.

1060
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:46,116
I'm keeping her.

1061
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,619
That's terrific.

1062
00:43:48,643 --> 00:43:50,209
I'm so glad.

1063
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:55,659
You need any
tips on parenting...

1064
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:58,828
You're the last person I'd call.

1065
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:01,498
Thank you.

1066
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:03,400
Oh, would you hold her?

1067
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:06,102
Sure. Come here.

1068
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:09,839
Ah. Yes! Hello.

1069
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:12,108
What's your Aunt
Susie doing, huh?

1070
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:14,178
Look at her. Hello.

1071
00:44:14,202 --> 00:44:15,179
Look at her go.

1072
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:16,480
Hello.

1073
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:18,415
She's silly, isn't she?

1074
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:19,983
Ah!

1075
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:20,984
She's silly, isn't she?

1076
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:23,920
Ah!

1077
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:26,390
Your Aunt Susie's loopy.

1078
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,741
Can you believe she's a doctor?

1079
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:31,000
Can you? No.
