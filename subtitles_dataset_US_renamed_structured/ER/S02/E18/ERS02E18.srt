00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,988
<i>News time, 4:31.
I'm Gail Reissmeyer,</i>

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,558
<i>bringing you traffic and
the weather on the ones.</i>

3
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,660
<i>Rain all over Chicagoland today.</i>

4
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,061
<i>The rain continues
to come down...</i>

5
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,362
Nice.

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,831
<i>Causing flooding on I-94
and other expressways.</i>

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,334
<i>The WMAQ weather
calls for the rain to continue</i>

8
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,768
<i>into tonight</i>

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,171
<i>and it stays in our
forecast through tomorrow.</i>

10
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,107
<i>Bring your umbrella,
your raincoat, and your...</i>

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,297
Son of a bitch.

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,109
Son of a bitch!

13
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,662
<i>Please leave a
message at the tone.</i>

14
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,130
<i>Mark?</i>

15
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:45,998
<i>Mark, if you're there,
it's Kerry Weaver.</i>

16
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,200
<i>Could you pick up?</i>

17
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,568
<i>We got a little problem here.</i>

18
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:49,619
<i>Neal Hansen's on tonight</i>

19
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,104
<i>but his mother-in-law died,</i>

20
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,305
<i>so Morgenstern...</i>

21
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,107
The answer is no, Kerry.

22
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,508
I am not coming in.

23
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,712
I don't really care if his
mother-in-law died, okay?

24
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,782
I've been on three
nights in a row.

25
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:06,920
Well, tell Morgenstern
that I can't,

26
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:08,588
and give the shift to Doug Ross.

27
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:11,057
He can use the money.

28
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:14,710
What do you mean, whiplash?

29
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,862
No evidence of fracture

30
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,063
or dislocation.

31
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:18,331
Vertebral bodies are
in good alignment.

32
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:19,565
There is, however,

33
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,534
reversal of cervical lordosis,

34
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,936
suggesting the possibility

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,939
of acute cervical
ligamentous injury.

36
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:30,143
My headache just tripled
during that dissertation.

37
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,945
Does the name Evelyn
Wood mean anything to you?

38
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:32,946
You know, Doug,

39
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,447
I like you in that collar.

40
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,649
It's a good look.

41
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:39,185
Bold yet spiritual.

42
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,386
No, I'm stopped,

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,521
stopped dead at the stoplight

44
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:42,622
and this Pakistani cab driver

45
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,190
plows into me.

46
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,258
I get out.

47
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:46,659
He doesn't speak
a word of English.

48
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:47,960
I look at his photo ID

49
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:49,429
and it's some sandy-haired
guy named Kroopf.

50
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,863
Kroopf?

51
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,665
Isn't that kind of
a German name?

52
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:53,899
Can I have your shoes?

53
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,934
What?

54
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,102
Can I have your shoes?

55
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:57,403
Mine are sopping wet.

56
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,671
Sure, Mark. Absolutely.

57
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:00,372
You know, I'll just walk home

58
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,396
barefoot in the rain.

59
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,827
Just so you know, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,162
I would have taken that shift.

61
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,496
No problem at all, Doug.

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,566
I've only worked graveyard
the last three nights,

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,368
got off at 8:00 this morning,

64
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,602
drove to Milwaukee

65
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,020
to spend the day with Rachel,

66
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:17,223
only to have Jennifer tell me
that she got the dates mixed up.

67
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,876
See, Rachel, it turns out,

68
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,745
is on some Brownie
troop camping trip,

69
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,012
so I drove back,

70
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,014
three and a half hours this time

71
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,485
because of the heavy
rain and flooding on I-94,

72
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,052
and here I am

73
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,388
refreshed

74
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,478
and full of enthusiasm
for my work.

75
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,060
You on tonight?

76
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,362
Uh-huh.

77
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,485
Go with God.

78
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,118
Susan, why are
all these patients

79
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,252
in the hallway?

80
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,453
No beds. Oh, great.

81
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,255
You're on tonight,
right? No, wrong.

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,257
I have dinner with
my lawyer at 7:00.

83
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,992
Dr. Lewis, a Peter
Kreidman called.

84
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,360
Can't make dinner till 7:30.

85
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,628
Oh. 7:30.

86
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,830
Listen, Susan, can you
change that to tomorrow night?

87
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,964
Hansen's out,

88
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,099
Doug has got whiplash,

89
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,467
Benton's in some
marathon surgery

90
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,668
and Kerry and I,

91
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,070
we're gonna be a
little shorthanded.

92
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,538
No, Mark. I'm sorry. I can't.

93
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,106
You know, I think
Chloe's gonna try

94
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,508
and fight this
adoption, you know?

95
00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,875
I can't miss this.

96
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,078
Mark. You made good
time. I was afraid I'd miss you.

97
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,913
You're leaving too?
I've been on 14 hours.

98
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,915
I've been on for
the last three nights.

99
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,716
Look, I'd stay, but
Morgenstern wants me

100
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,253
to present our QA at
the JCAH in the morning.

101
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,355
Whoever's been handling
it kind of dropped the ball.

102
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,157
I'll be up all night
pulling it together.

103
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,858
It's a real mess.

104
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,593
Yeah, I was handling it.

105
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,562
Oh. Well, I'll walk
you through it

106
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,330
once I get it straightened out.

107
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,533
Shall we make rounds?

108
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,035
Mr. PCP, sleeping it off.

109
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,537
Probably need another six hours.

110
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,705
Second-degree burns, both hands.

111
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,408
Taking out her pot
roast, forgot the hot pads.

112
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,110
Gangbanger in a fistfight.

113
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,245
Fistfight? That's quaint.

114
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,013
Waiting on x-rays.

115
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,615
38 years old, AIDS.

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,317
Hand and foot
spasms, CMV retinitis,

117
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,152
PCP pneumonia, GI lymphoma,

118
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,587
waiting on ICU.

119
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,621
Rule-out MI.

120
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,956
Waiting on a Cardiology consult.

121
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,224
Calls himself Bobby Darin,

122
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,426
claims he got a shark bite
while swimming in the pool

123
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,629
at the Four Seasons
Hotel. Waiting on Psych.

124
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,731
Ten-centimeter laceration

125
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,432
sustained while
sliding into second.

126
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,600
Needs sutures.

127
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,535
Abdominal pain,
probably food poisoning,

128
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,104
but Surgery's
ruling out an appy.

129
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,039
Presented with
severe shoulder pain

130
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,273
and nosebleed.

131
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,860
Platelet count, 15,000.

132
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,629
TPA patient on dopamine.

133
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:10,797
Pulmonary edema.

134
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,231
Intubated on a nitro drip.

135
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,332
Waiting on ICU.

136
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:15,435
Bicycle versus postal truck.

Multiple rib fractures.

00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,005
Bilateral hemopneumothoraces.

139
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,573
Critical but stable.

140
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:22,475
Let me guess. ICU?

141
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:23,843
Uh-huh.

142
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,278
Anaphylactic shock,

143
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,013
and...

144
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:28,581
septic shock.

145
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:32,218
I think that's about it.

146
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:35,171
How are things in Glocca Morra?

147
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,813
Unbelievable, huh?

148
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,681
It's been like this
since the rain started.

149
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,583
Who else is on besides me?

150
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,418
A few Residents, a Psych intern,

151
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,953
and maybe Carter.

152
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,343
Good night.

153
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,259
LOL with burned hands,

154
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,394
admitted to burn service,

155
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,129
films on that gang
kid were negative,

156
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,531
sent him home,

157
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,533
and the rule-out appy was
ruled out and discharged.

158
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,735
Excellent, Haleh, you
get three gold stars.

159
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,736
Carter?

160
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,470
I have sutured the leg lac in 4,

161
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,673
the knee lac in
3, the arm lac in 2,

162
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,875
and the head
lac in 1. That's it?

163
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,944
All right. we have
seven waiting for ICU.

164
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,012
No. Make it eight.

165
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,279
Bounce-back hip replacement

166
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,648
with DVT and PE.

167
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,084
Okay. We have 33 in the
ER and 41 in the waiting room.

168
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,385
Make that 42.

169
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,454
Paramedics pulling
in with an altered LOC.

170
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,423
So your mission,

171
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,925
should you choose to accept it,

172
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,993
which you will, because
you have no choice,

173
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,895
is to move these folks out

174
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,031
so we can move
these folks in, okay?

175
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,567
I want quick turnover.
No big workups.

176
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,836
No unnecessary labs,
x-rays, or consults...

177
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,971
But, Mark...

178
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,205
And no comments.

179
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,240
Carol, Carter, let's
go meet the incoming.

180
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,309
Randi, I want a
turkey sandwich, okay,

181
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,578
from the cafeteria,

182
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,112
because Jerry,
he's not here yet.

183
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,413
Sorry. I'm late,

184
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,849
and I can't be responsible
for him, Dr. Greene.

185
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,051
But, but... Randi...

186
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,988
Get me out of here!

187
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,823
Hi, Chuny, you're late.

188
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,959
I'm on at 8:00.
Yeah, well, it's 8:04.

189
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,260
What do we got?
Omar Gandera, 15.

190
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,763
Strolling down by The
Loop, drunk out of his mind.

191
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,498
Vitals are stable, BP 120/80.

192
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,667
Fell on his knees. He's
gonna need some stitches.

193
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,502
You guys got a
party going on here?

194
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,937
Don't start with me, Doris.

195
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,405
How much did you drink, Omar?

196
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,207
Don't touch me! Get out of here!

197
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,409
Can I give Mrs. Layton
another 50 of Demerol?

198
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,177
How long's it been? Three hours.

199
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,848
All right, well, if you
help with this kid.

200
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,183
All right, on my count.

201
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,352
One, two, three...

202
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,687
Put me down!

203
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,856
Buckle him up tight.
He got out of ours.

204
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,190
Party on.

205
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,692
Let me out of here!

206
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,027
Sinus tach at 110.

207
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,562
All right, Carter, what
do you want to do?

208
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,197
BP's still 120/80.

209
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,700
CBC, Chem-7, blood
alcohol, tox screen,

210
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,624
ABG and saline. Wide open.

211
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,107
Carter, she said tie him tight.

212
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,307
I did!

213
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,343
Labs are back on
that kid with the fever.

214
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,178
Yeah? Any films? Uh, not yet.

215
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,813
All right, well, go
sit on Radiology,

216
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,548
and don't bug me
until you got everything.

217
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,716
Carter,

218
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,551
get the labs going,
and I'll be back.

219
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,554
Oh, yeah, we're
having some fun now.

220
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,024
There are non-displaced
oblique fractures

221
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,159
of the third and fourth
metatarsal shafts

222
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,628
with no significant
angulation or comminution.

223
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,829
The foot's busted, okay?

224
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,452
Splint him and ship him out.

225
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,268
Chuny, what are you
doing with this guy?

226
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,636
Gonna fix his feet.

227
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,738
Uh-huh. What'd he do?
Stick them in a blender?

228
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,074
No more mixed drinks.
Put him on the back burner.

229
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,476
We've got people who
are a lot worse than he is.

230
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,778
Excuse me, doctor.

231
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,746
Could you just come
and look at my mother?

232
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,881
In a minute.

233
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,215
What a mess, huh?

234
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,217
It's not helped by the
fact that you were late.

235
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,219
Are you the doctor in
charge? The one and only.

236
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,605
I'm Ruth Huggins. My son
has a horrible cut on his hand.

237
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,442
We're gonna get to
him. I'll bring him in.

238
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,861
Jerry, can you take Mrs.
Huggins to the waiting room?

239
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,128
Sure. But, please,
it's bleeding.

240
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,697
We've been waiting
out there... Come on.

241
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,699
Jerry, don't let people
sneak in like that, okay?

242
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,167
Whoever's out there
has been triaged.

243
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,002
We'll see them
as soon as we can,

244
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,088
but no one gets in
here without a chart

245
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:56,511
unless they're dying. Right.

246
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,593
Malik?

247
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:01,894
Mrs. Votey,

248
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,597
you're having weakness
in your right arm?

249
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,533
Yesterday and again today.

250
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:09,735
Everything's sort
of out of focus.

251
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,021
At one point today,
she couldn't even speak.

252
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,923
Scared my students
half to death.

253
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,508
My mother teaches self-defense.

254
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,776
To seniors.

255
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,078
Squeeze.

256
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:23,583
Maybe I could just wait
here for my regular doctor.

257
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:24,717
Dr. Randall. Jack Randall.

258
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:25,785
I know him.

259
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,886
Mrs. Votey, you
might be experiencing

260
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,955
what we call TIAs,

261
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,757
transient ischemic attacks.

262
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:35,127
They can be a warning
sign of impending stroke.

263
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:36,662
I'll call Dr. Randall,

264
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:38,897
but in the meantime, I'm
going to admit you upstairs,

265
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,333
where they can work you up.

266
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:44,036
Start her on heparin,
800 an hour, call Randall

267
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,771
and get her
admitted to Medicine.

268
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,072
You want a CT first?

269
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,258
Let them do it.
We need the room.

270
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,726
I don't get it.

271
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,361
He's still altered, but
his tox screen's negative.

272
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,096
I have to pee. Ethanol?

273
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,397
None detected.

274
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,433
PH? 7.30.

275
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,335
Omar, what'd you drink?

276
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,492
I gotta pee. Omar!

277
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,690
Gotta pee.

278
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:06,025
Go ahead and pee, Omar.
There's a tube in your bladder.

279
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,593
Paramedics five minutes out.

280
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:09,445
Drive-by shooting.
Who's on call for Trauma?

281
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,248
Benton. You want me to
call him? No. Call Thoracic.

282
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,950
Thoracic? You heard me.

283
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,084
Call Morgenstern,

284
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,869
tell him that we are
closing the Trauma now.

285
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:17,970
Lytes?

286
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,521
Not back yet.

287
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,106
What the hell's wrong
with the lab tonight?

288
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,798
Same thing that's wrong with
us. There's just too many patients.

289
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:27,012
Okay.

290
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,766
Let's say he has a gap.

291
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,501
Methanol, uremia,

292
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,352
DKA.

293
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,175
Ethylene glycol?

294
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,774
You think he drank antifreeze?

295
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,108
Well, gotta rule it out.

296
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,233
All right. Get a Woods lamp.

297
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,198
Really jammed in there.

298
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,333
What?

299
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,834
I said, it's really
jammed in there.

300
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:51,504
Carter, what are you doing?
Foreign body in the canal.

301
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:52,960
Have him lie down.

302
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,410
Do you know what it is, sir?

303
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,810
What?

304
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,446
A bead.

305
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,680
So Carter,

306
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:03,682
you having fun paying
your penance in the ER?

307
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:04,683
Ha.

308
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:06,385
I'm off Surgical Service.

309
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,854
I'm working nights in the ER.

310
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,456
What's not to be happy about?

311
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,991
Still, it is better
than not graduating.

312
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:14,393
I thought Dr. Hicks
might suspend me.

313
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,328
Believe me, she
would if she could have.

314
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:17,829
I can't believe I
was that stupid,

315
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:19,315
sneaking off and
drinking on call.

316
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,983
I can. You're a medical student.

317
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,084
Hmm.

318
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,686
Superglue?

319
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,321
Yes.

320
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,755
Just touch the bead.

321
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,346
Hit the skin, you're in trouble.

322
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,429
Don't move! Don't move!

323
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,763
Dr. Greene?

324
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,671
Paramedics are here.

325
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,408
Got it.

326
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,489
How old is she? 18 months.

327
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,891
Two gunshots to the right
upper leg, through and through.

328
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,376
Hypotensive. Can't get a line.

329
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,595
It's okay, baby. We're here.

330
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,380
Cops got the boy who did it.

331
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,448
Black kid, 14 years old.

332
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,617
Shot him dead.
Can't say I'm sorry.

333
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,220
Yeah, cops never mind
shooting a black kid.

334
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,788
And he didn't much mind
shooting this one, did he?

335
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,592
CBC, type and cross for two.

336
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,709
Get a unit of O-neg.

337
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,744
Right foot's cold. No pulse.

338
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,245
That's the femoral artery.

339
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:08,714
I'll call for x-rays.

340
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:11,617
Sixteen-gauge Jamshidi.
One percent with epi.

341
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:14,086
Faint pulse.
Dynamap's not reading.

342
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,303
120 of saline.

343
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,408
Okay. Fill these tubes.

344
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,193
Haleh, page Netzley.

345
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,129
Malik, you're gonna take her

346
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:24,697
up to O.R. You got it.

347
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,832
Dr. Greene, about
closing the Trauma,

348
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:28,400
Morgenstern gave the big "N-O."

349
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,685
Yeah? Well, get him
on the phone for me.

350
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,871
He went back up to Surgery.

351
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,973
All right, well, I'll find him.

352
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,730
Mark, bingo on Omar.

353
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,929
You got it?

354
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,463
Mommy.

355
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,332
Daddy.

356
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,650
Daddy.

357
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,018
Ethylene glycol it is.

358
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,086
What's that?

359
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,889
Antifreeze. Get
Renal down here stat.

360
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,225
Let's give him IV ethanol.

361
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,525
We don't have any.

362
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:54,827
What?

363
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,162
I checked.

364
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:57,496
Pharmacy's out.

365
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,332
St. Luke's is sending us some,

366
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,500
but it won't be here
for another hour.

367
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:02,601
There's a bottle of bourbon

368
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,171
out in that shopping
cart in the hall.

369
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:06,339
Bourbon?

370
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:08,307
120 cc oral loading dose.

371
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:09,909
Thirty cc's POQ one hour.

372
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,143
Otherwise,

373
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,312
he's got brain damage
and renal failure.

374
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,770
Bourbon shooters it is.

375
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,815
E labs are finally back
on that coma in 2. It's DKA.

376
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,917
Start an insulin drip,
0.1 per kilo per hour.

377
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,152
Mrs. Votey... Who?

378
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,552
The karate lady.
She had another TIA.

379
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,954
She's supposed to be
admitted to Medicine.

380
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,555
Yeah, but Dr. Randall
said to discharge her.

381
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,757
Discharge her? What, is he nuts?

382
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,058
Page him 911

383
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,027
and tell him to
get in here, now.

384
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,051
Here you go. Whoa!

385
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,014
Who let this dog in here?

386
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,501
Try and take it
away and it bites you.

387
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,236
That puker in 4 is still at it.

388
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,339
Give him 10 of Compazine
and a liter of saline.

389
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,440
Mr. Nathan in 5...

390
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,208
Morgenstern made
it. He's up at the front.

391
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,509
The turkey sandwich?
Sorry, I forgot.

392
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,760
I can get it almost immediately.

393
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,095
Who are we talking about?

394
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,796
Mr. Nathan in 5,
high white count,

395
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,031
temp's 101, Thanks.

396
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,299
Still has left
lower-quadrant pain.

397
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,701
Probably diverticulitis.
Make him NPO.

398
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,202
Give him amp, gent, Flagyl,

399
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:11,870
and get an abdominal series.

400
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,138
That's right. Bring him in.

401
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,373
Answering the phones?

402
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:15,974
I'm here to help. Yeah?

403
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,176
Well, then why don't
you close up the Trauma?

404
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,344
Sorry, Mark. No can do.

405
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:20,579
County's only
looking for excuses

406
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,014
to put us out of business.

407
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,181
Well, it's 10:30.

408
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:25,183
We've got enough
business to last a year.

409
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,184
32 in the ER,

410
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,319
49 in the waiting room.

411
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,621
Look, Mark, I'm sorry...

412
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:30,890
Mark, got a little Benton
fracas going on in Trauma 2.

413
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:33,225
Board of Commissioners
wants to close a county ER,

414
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,493
save 80 million a year.

415
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,529
Every time we close,
we're sending a message

416
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:38,063
that we're not
capable of providing.

417
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,364
Yeah, well, we're not.

418
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:42,100
I now have nine ICU
patients draining my staff,

419
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:43,903
we've no monitored beds.

420
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,704
Here are the films on Robinson.

421
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,940
I have... I can't even
help half the patients here.

422
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,408
It's insane.

423
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:51,076
Look, I've talked to the
critical care coordinators.

424
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,646
We can move six patients
from ICU to Telemetry,

425
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,114
but we're staying open.

426
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,915
So what? He's oxygenating well.

427
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,417
The tube heads medially,
striking the mediastinum.

428
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,919
Peter, Shelley, what's going on?

429
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,755
Why didn't you page
me when this came in?

430
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,657
Shelley's handling it.
I'm on call for Trauma.

431
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:07,126
We didn't need you. If
you don't want my help...

432
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,677
Gentlemen, please. Ladies...

433
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,113
I don't hear anybody
helping anybody here.

434
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,314
Now, what's going on?

435
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,333
Third-year Surgical
Resident Leung

436
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:16,135
placed the chest
tube anteriorly.

437
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,636
Which has relieved
the pneumothorax.

438
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,972
But which will in no way
drain the hemothorax.

439
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:22,058
Which can be repositioned
when we prep for a lap.

440
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,427
Excellent idea.
Let's all scrub in.

441
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,528
Come on, folks.

442
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:26,762
Let's go.

443
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:27,896
Mark, hang in there.

444
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,732
If you need anything,
give me a call.

445
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,399
How about a turkey sandwich?

446
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,301
Too late. Cafeteria
closes at 10 now.

447
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,771
County cutbacks.

448
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,806
It's called a growth plate.
It's a piece of cartilage

449
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,875
that doesn't turn to bone
until you're grown up.

450
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,909
Dr. Greene.

451
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,311
Carter. Chloe.

452
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,213
Hi, Mark. I, uh... came
here to see Susie,

453
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,616
but John says
she's not on tonight.

454
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,684
No, she isn't.

455
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,818
Chloe was curious

456
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,219
about how to read an x-ray.

457
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,622
I guess the interest in medicine
must run in the family, huh?

458
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,458
Yeah, right.

459
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,225
Junior gymnast in
5. Fractured patella.

460
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,416
Time to break the bad news.

461
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,699
Man, that hand is so little.

462
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,334
Look at that.

463
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,203
Yeah, it's probably
four or five years old.

464
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,929
Little Susie's hand's
about that big, right?

465
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,381
So Susie probably told
you what's going on with us.

466
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,067
Yeah, she mentioned some things.

467
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:23,335
I understand

468
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,970
why she's upset with me.

469
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,772
I never thought I could change.

470
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,107
Why should she?

471
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,826
I just want her to see that
things are different now,

472
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,728
that I'm different now.

473
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,679
She tell you that I'm engaged?

474
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,337
No, she didn't.

475
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,002
He's a great guy.

476
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,604
Steady.

477
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,105
He's as smart as Susie is.

478
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,407
He's the only person
I've known, besides Susie,

479
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,525
who's ever taken
the time with me,

480
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,645
to get to know
me, you know, to...

481
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,315
That thought that there
was something in me

482
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,251
worth finding out. I don't know.

483
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,738
It's really busy out there.
I gotta get back to work.

484
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:03,859
Hey, Mark. Um, the
thing is, I really miss her.

485
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,562
I'm sure you do,
and I know it's hard,

486
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,865
but as far as babies go,
Little Susie's doing great.

487
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,605
Yeah, I miss her too.

488
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,276
Jerry? Uh-huh?

489
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,044
Put out a page on Steve Flint.

490
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,482
How's our score?
Bleak, bleaker, bleakest.

491
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:30,085
No, wait, we can
mark this one off.

492
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,387
Omar Gandera.

493
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,688
Renal finally got here.

494
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,656
They're gonna take him upstairs.

495
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,157
Did you call Psych for him?

496
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,360
Yeah. They said to
call back in a week.

497
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,528
Oh, great.

498
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,863
Kid OD'd on antifreeze

499
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,031
and Psych can't
quite fit him in.

500
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,199
Exam 2's open.

501
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,834
Good work, Chuny.

502
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,202
Somebody help me, please!

503
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,705
All right, Chuny, park that
guy. Jerry, clear Trauma 2.

504
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,039
Get a doctor here, please!

505
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,708
What happened? I
don't know. It's his chest.

506
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:53,876
What's your name? Corky.

507
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,744
You all right? Yeah.
It's just my dad.

508
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,046
He's sick. He's really sick.
Was he vomiting blood?

509
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,633
You got some on your
shirt. No, I just cut myself.

510
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,367
What do we got? Possible MI.

511
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,669
What's your father's name?

512
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:05,004
Louis. Louis Etheridge.

513
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:08,073
Louis? Louis? Mr. Etheridge?

514
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,075
Is he on any medications?

515
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,810
I don't know. Maybe.

516
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,245
Louis?

517
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:14,597
Need air...

518
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,281
Tachy at 120. BP, 160 palp.

519
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,850
EKG, portable chest.

520
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:20,736
ABG, first-day CCU labs.

521
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,104
Fifteen liters O-2, four of MS,

522
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,206
titrate a nitroglycerine drip.

523
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,975
O-2 sat's 100.

524
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,193
Are you nauseous, Mr. Etheridge?

525
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:30,028
Yes. Yes. Please, help me.

526
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:31,062
Inferior MI?

527
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,898
Has he had any heart trouble?

528
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,317
No, that's not it.

529
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,953
What is it, Corky?
It's okay to tell us.

530
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,688
Dr. Greene, what
the hell are you doing

531
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,890
pulling me down here in
the middle of the night?

532
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,258
Wait outside,
please, Dr. Randall.

533
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,860
Corky, what's wrong
with your father?

534
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,529
I need to talk to
you. In a minute!

535
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,864
Corky?

536
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,604
I don't know. He's just sick!

537
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:54,987
Double lumen
IVs. Get a TPA tray.

538
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,931
Let me know when
the 12-lead's done.

539
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,375
You got me out
of bed at midnight

540
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,510
for absolutely no reason.

541
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,711
Your patient's just
around the corner.

542
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,145
Why don't we step this way?

543
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,381
I gave the order to have
her discharged hours ago.

544
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,883
Yeah, well, she's had three
TIAs in the last two days.

545
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,585
She needs to be admitted.

546
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,954
Stroke Council, AHA,
1995 recommendations:

547
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,123
Hospitalize for
four or more TIAs

548
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,725
in a two-week period.

549
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,527
Or for findings suggesting
a worsening course.

550
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,844
I know the paper.

551
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,131
Her HMO will not
authorize her admission.

552
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,232
There we go. She's one
of your HMO patients.

553
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,817
They're the only ones
who have patients anymore,

554
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,168
in case you haven't noticed.

555
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,204
So we're supposed to
wait until she strokes out

556
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,872
so they can keep
their costs down?

557
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,724
You don't have to wait
for anything, Dr. Greene.

558
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:33,847
She is discharged.

559
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,933
That bounce-back migraine
in 4 is still complaining of pain.

560
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,669
Try a milligram of
DHE and 10 of Reglan.

561
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:45,937
What's the story?

562
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,440
His father's an alcoholic. Yeah?

563
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,175
Corky says his mother's
been putting Antabuse

564
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,376
in his father's coffee.

565
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,044
While he's still
drinking? Uh-huh.

566
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,379
And not telling him?

567
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:55,647
Right, so he's still drinking

568
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,549
and now he's having
an Antabuse reaction.

569
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,051
That could've been fatal.
The kid knew all along?

570
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:01,687
Hey, Corky! Mark,

571
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,488
the kid's scared enough, okay?

572
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,375
Yeah, well, he should be.
His father could have died.

573
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,615
Call the mother
and get her in here.

574
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:12,097
Excuse me, doctor. I
know you said to wait,

575
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:14,333
but my son's hand,
it really is a bad cut.

576
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,501
Mrs. Huggins, your son

577
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,935
has been triaged
as a minor injury.

578
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,170
There are much more urgent cases

579
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,171
ahead of you.

580
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,772
You have to wait
in the waiting room.

581
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,974
Jerry, I asked you to keep
these people out of here.

582
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,877
Now, I am running over to Doc's
to pick up my sandwich, okay?

583
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,812
I'll be back in two minutes.

584
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,153
Get this dead guy out of here.

585
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,978
Hey, give me that, give me that!

586
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,880
Call for help,
okay? Call for help.

587
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,082
Okay!

588
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,650
You all right?

589
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,817
You all right?

590
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,069
Hang on in there!

591
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,270
We're gonna get you out.

592
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,474
Hang on! We'll get you out!

593
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:56,608
We're getting help!

594
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,265
Hang on!

595
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,042
Leita, try and crawl out.

596
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,577
If you just crawl
out the window,

597
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,178
we can get you out.

598
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,346
Anything?

599
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,915
We're still waiting
for the other unit

600
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,583
to show up with the
extrication equipment.

601
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,351
I can't get the mother
or daughter out.

602
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,653
The mother's unconscious.

603
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,488
All right, well, tell
her to grab your hand.

604
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,512
You can pull her out.

605
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,074
Over here!

606
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,612
I got it.

607
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:37,082
Her leg is stuck.
She can't move.

608
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,484
All right, I'll try to get in.

609
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,320
One, two, three.

610
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,421
Come over to this side!

611
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,245
All right, hold
it. I'll be back.

612
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,662
Let me in. Let me in.

613
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,831
Let me get in.

614
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,788
I can't reach her.

615
00:22:57,693 --> 00:22:59,704
Let me get in. Let me get in.

616
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:02,373
Grab my hand. Come
on, grab my hand.

617
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:04,375
Grab my hand. I can
get her out of there.

618
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,477
I can grab ahold of
her. Let me get in there.

619
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,578
I almost got her hand.

620
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:08,980
I can get her out of there.

621
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,871
Move!

622
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,809
Let me get her out, okay?

623
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,058
We'll bring her in.

624
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,093
Why don't you go
dry off, all right?

625
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:24,051
Get the Trauma rooms ready.

626
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,138
Jerry.

627
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,841
I wouldn't ask if I were you.

628
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,209
Jerry?

629
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,676
Folding chairs for
the waiting room.

630
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,312
Maintenance ordered
them four hours ago.

631
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,779
Oh, God.

632
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:42,814
All right, let me know

633
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,449
when those accident
victims get in, okay?

634
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,085
I'm gonna go grab some coffee

635
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,253
and dry scrubs,

636
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,994
and clear those Trauma rooms.

637
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,380
Hey, you don't have
any coffee filters in there,

638
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,548
do you?

639
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:00,949
Are you kidding?

640
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,574
No. And we can't even do
the folded paper towel trick.

641
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,192
Mr. Carter, you are in luck.

642
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:13,828
Now, if we had a hair dryer,
it'd really be our lucky day.

643
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,097
How do you do this?

644
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,031
Well, you got to get
the coffee grounds out

645
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,567
without ripping the paper.

646
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,102
No, I mean this.

647
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,336
Patients stacked up everywhere

648
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,504
and no end in sight.

649
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,639
It's like the O'Hare
of emergency rooms

650
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,673
in there.

651
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,476
It was a lot easier
when I was younger.

652
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,377
I was newly married.
I'd just had a baby.

653
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,147
Jennifer used to come down

654
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,449
in the middle of the night
with chicken sandwiches.

655
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,917
She'd have Rachel
in the car seat

656
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,919
and we'd picnic between
the waiting-to-be-sutured

657
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,288
and the bounced-back migraines.

658
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,389
Yeah, I guess it
helped, having a family.

659
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,481
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

660
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,719
What are you gonna do?

661
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:54,474
That is really bad.

662
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,523
I'm gonna go change.

663
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,559
That's a lovely little pup

664
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,260
you got there, Mrs., uh...

665
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:04,862
Excuse me. Ms. Decksley.

666
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:06,865
Absolutely charming.

667
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:08,350
Hey, Stinky,

668
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,451
want a few little stitches?

669
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,353
Shut that yappy
little mouth of yours.

670
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:15,123
You're not a dog lover,
huh? This is not a dog.

671
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,992
This is a small, furry
object suitable for punting.

672
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,226
Mm-hmm.

673
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,428
I bet you can't get him
over that desk back there.

674
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,629
Don't tempt me.

675
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,432
But tempting, that's
what I do for a living.

676
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,734
I'm a lap dancer.

677
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,170
Okay.

678
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,637
So I hooked up

679
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,106
with this polyester guy tonight

680
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,209
and I slipped right
off his knee and bam!

681
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,044
Sliced my butt on his spurs.

682
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,847
I mean, why would you wear
cowboy boots with polyester?

683
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,583
I don't think I would.

684
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,785
Are you gonna stitch me up next?

685
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,021
Because this
cut, it really stings.

686
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,222
You want something for the pain?

687
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,079
Drugs? Sure.

688
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,914
Any word from outside?

689
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:57,249
Yeah. They radioed over.

690
00:25:57,273 --> 00:25:59,050
Probably be about
another 10 minutes.

691
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,318
Jerry, call ICU.

692
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,120
This ventilator guy has
been down here for days.

693
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,389
Okay. Uh, do you
want me to page Benton

694
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:05,924
for that rule-out appy in 4?

695
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:06,958
No, I'll check it out.

696
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,459
Lydia, get those
labs on Cromley.

697
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,694
I thought you were trying

698
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:10,929
to get that girl out.

699
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:12,931
So did I, but I can't
even get the lab

700
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:14,666
to get a CBC in
under three hours,

701
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,467
I can't get an x-ray
shot in under two,

702
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,903
and I can't get any ICU beds

703
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:18,904
to open up.

704
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,571
Mark, Jennifer's on the phone.

705
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:22,274
Jen, what's up?

706
00:26:22,298 --> 00:26:24,776
<i>They brought Rachel
home. She's not feeling well.</i>

707
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,445
It's 1 in the morning and they
drove her back from the lake?

708
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:28,613
<i>Yeah, because her stomach hurts.</i>

709
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:31,082
Stomachache and
what else? <i>She threw up.</i>

710
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,784
Well, does she
have a temperature?

711
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,286
Maybe it's altitude sickness.

712
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,189
Well, how do I know
where the lake is?

713
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:40,125
You didn't even tell me she
was going on a camping trip.

714
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:44,429
Jen, I don't want
to fight right now.

715
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:46,198
Listen, just put Rachel in bed,

716
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:47,699
keep her on clear fluids,

717
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:49,701
and I'll call you
in the morning.

718
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:52,971
Well, what do you want
me to do from down here?

719
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,873
Well, I'm sorry you called too.

720
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,864
Jerry, get Carter in here.

721
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,981
She's gonna be okay.
Get this out of here.

722
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:04,466
You want me to page Benton?

723
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,633
Yeah, might as well.

724
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,070
The ankle's deformed.
No cap refill or pulses.

725
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,637
BP's 80 palp. Pulse, 110.

726
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,840
Hey, Doc, listen.
Fracture dislocation.

727
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:15,526
We need to reduce.
Let's sedate her.

728
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,801
Prep 35 migs
Ketamine, 0.3 atropine.

729
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:21,266
I was just trying to
get her out of there.

730
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,618
Start another line. Hang
half a gram of Ancef.

731
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,520
Bolus 20 per kilo? Yes.

732
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:26,754
CBC, chem seven,

733
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,856
UA, portable chest,

734
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,024
and get an ankle.

735
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:32,544
We got her out, damn it.

736
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,845
Let's hear it.

737
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:35,380
Pulse, 140. BP, 90/60.

738
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,515
Probable flail chest

739
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,316
but good bilateral
breath sounds.

740
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,352
Fractured left femur.
Abdomen's rigid,

741
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:41,586
x-ray's on the way.

742
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,688
O-2 sat, 90. Blood ordered?

743
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:44,822
Two units O-neg are up,

744
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:46,124
type and crossed for eight.

745
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:47,125
Heart rate's 30.

746
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,893
Atropine, now.
Good work, Carter.

747
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,828
Prep for a lavage.
You okay with that?

748
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,230
I'm okay with that, yeah.

749
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,365
Shooting.

750
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:54,566
Clear!

751
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,667
Grab a C-spine

752
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:58,203
and a post-intubation
chest next door.

753
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:00,372
Ketamine's onboard. She's out.

754
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,074
You wanna wait for the films?

755
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,075
No. Let's do it.

756
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,243
Countertraction.

757
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,645
That's it. Back in.

758
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:09,047
She's coding!

759
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,015
Where the hell is Benton?

760
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,184
Page him stat.

761
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,387
All right, everybody off! Off!

762
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:16,721
Okay, sinus brady.

763
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,790
Mig of atropine.
Mix up dopamine.

764
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:20,325
I paged him 911.

765
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:22,327
Muffled heart sounds,
neck vein distention.

766
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:23,528
I don't have a pulse.

767
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:25,897
Thoracotomy tray.
Chuny, do compression.

768
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,232
Tamponade?

769
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:29,356
Yeah. It could be a
cardiac laceration.

770
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,688
10 blade.

771
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,524
Did you page him? Twice.

772
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,525
Rib spreader.

773
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,192
O-neg's here. Four more units.

774
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,850
Throw them on the infuser.

775
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,933
Oh, yeah.

776
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,135
Sac's tense with blood.

777
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,291
Metz!

778
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,257
She's bleeding out.

779
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:54,959
Rib punctured the heart.

780
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,494
Keep your finger over the hole

781
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:57,695
and do compressions.

782
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,439
Should we wait for Benton?

783
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:04,035
Let's try a 16
Foley, 30 cc balloon.

784
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:05,336
Foley?

785
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,605
Yeah. Clamp the
end. And saline, not air.

786
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,407
Last thing she needs
is an air embolism.

787
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:10,442
She's in fib!

788
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,777
All right, internal paddles.

789
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,679
One second.
Carter, pay attention.

790
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:15,980
There we go.

791
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,884
The catheter is going
into the hole in the heart.

792
00:29:18,908 --> 00:29:21,586
Okay. Now fill the balloon.

793
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,056
Two units O-neg in.

794
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,243
Excellent.

795
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,200
All right. Now, traction.

796
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,415
What do we got?

797
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,650
Charging.

798
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,153
Charge 20.

799
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,756
Zapping.

800
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,157
Sinus.

801
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,492
Got a pulse.

802
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,031
Let's get her up to the O.R.

803
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,100
Where the hell have you been?

804
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,268
We have a double trauma
and you don't even respond?

805
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,838
I was closing on a
mesenteric infarction.

806
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,306
Yeah, with how
many other Residents

807
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,507
who could have closed for you?

808
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,810
Well, it was my
surgery. I was busy.

809
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,011
No, no, Peter.

810
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,179
Down here is busy.
In there is busy.

811
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,415
In there is where we
ignore everything else.

812
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,084
I ignore my
patients for in there.

813
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,585
I ignore my child for in there,

814
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,853
my marriage for in there.

815
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:14,077
Don't ever pull this again!

816
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,266
Ybe the rain will
keep the people home.

817
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,822
I thought it stopped raining.

818
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,587
Nope.

819
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:29,922
Going...

820
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:31,389
Going...

821
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,541
Gone.

822
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:35,010
Is there a problem? 2:00.

823
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,311
The bars are closing.

824
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,946
They're getting in their cars.

825
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,947
Going too fast.

826
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:39,948
Swerving.

827
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:40,949
Crashing.

828
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,384
Paramedics are rolling out.

829
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,485
Scooping them up.

830
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,587
And dropping them
off on our doorstep.

831
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,289
Dr. Greene,

832
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,091
that was a 911 call
from our waiting room.

833
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,159
It's a jungle out there.

834
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,626
I know.

835
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,828
Doctors Lewis, Ross,
Weaver, and Treloggen

836
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,498
will be on in four
hours and 58 minutes.

837
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,500
They will not be pleased.

838
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,924
And by the way, Jerry,
that light bulb's out.

839
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,173
Carter, did you discharge
that ankle sprain?

840
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,274
About an hour ago.

841
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,509
Rule-out MI in 4?

842
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,743
Uh, Cardiology took him up.

843
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:10,579
What about that Huggins kid,

844
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:11,779
the one with the cut hand?

845
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,047
The one with the mother?

846
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,182
Yeah.

847
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,418
No. He's still in
the Suture room.

848
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:19,121
There's a metallic foreign body

849
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,655
of 14 millimeters

850
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,490
located one centimeter medial

851
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,525
to the distal femoral condyle.

852
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,692
Morning, Harry.

853
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,395
Labs back on that OD in 6.

854
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:28,397
Excellent. Stick
them on the chart.

855
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:30,732
Films are back on
that busted collarbone.

856
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,690
Excellent. Stick
them on the chart.

857
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,572
Mrs. Huggins.

858
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,874
This is my son, Danny.

859
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:39,875
Hello, Danny.

860
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,710
Hi.

861
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,545
Mark, I need to
see you a minute.

862
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,546
Can't it wait?

863
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,217
No, I don't think so.

864
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,841
Excuse me.

865
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,890
Why Trauma 1?

866
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,258
She's not doing so well,

867
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,659
and there's no exam rooms.

868
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,194
Is her son with her?

869
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,483
Yeah.

870
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,067
Carol, why don't you
take Corky outside?

871
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,568
You drink coffee yet?

872
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,671
He's not supposed
to, but he does.

873
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,728
Me too. Come on.
Let's go get a cup.

874
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,243
Mrs. Etheridge, I'm Dr. Greene.

875
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,978
Corky didn't tell
you about his father

876
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,847
because I told him not to.

877
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,783
I told him not to tell anybody.

878
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:25,420
His condition tonight
was very serious.

879
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,089
Antabuse is a
deterrent to alcohol.

880
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,594
Mixing them can be fatal.

881
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,164
It's not that I want him to die.

882
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,833
It's just that when he drinks,

883
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:39,934
it can get pretty bad.

884
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,606
There's blood on Corky's shirt.

885
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,708
Does your husband
beat him as well?

886
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,610
No. Corky got in the middle.

887
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,247
I think it's from my nose.

888
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,115
There are places you can go,

889
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,251
Mrs. Etheridge.

890
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,886
Shelters

891
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,790
where you and
your son can be safe.

892
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,246
I know.

893
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,296
In cases of domestic violence

894
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,855
I'm legally obligated
to inform the police.

895
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,261
I know that too.

896
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,319
Jerry, call the police.
Domestic violence case.

897
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,320
Sure.

898
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,622
Carol,

899
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:35,557
order a facial series and
clean up the abrasions.

900
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,581
Okay.

901
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,921
Did he want to talk
about it, say anything?

902
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,291
No. Not a word.

903
00:33:58,187 --> 00:33:59,331
Bend your finger.

904
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:01,600
He was helping me hang a mirror.

905
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,335
It weighed a ton.

906
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:05,504
Needless to say, we dropped it.

907
00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:07,339
Seven years of bad luck.

908
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:09,408
Nah. I don't
believe in that stuff.

909
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:10,742
It's a fairly deep cut,

910
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:12,444
but I don't see any
tendon damage.

911
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,296
See? That's good luck.

912
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,881
What time did it happen?

913
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:16,915
After dinner.

914
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,038
After<i> Hard Copy,</i> Mom.

915
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,687
Unfortunately, I
can't stitch it up.

916
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,189
What?

917
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:26,258
After six hours,

918
00:34:26,282 --> 00:34:28,360
the risk of
infection is too high.

919
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:30,561
We've been sitting
here half the night,

920
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:32,163
and now you can't
even do anything?

921
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:33,365
I'll put him on antibiotics

922
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,267
and you can bring
him back in three days

923
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:36,268
for delayed closure.

924
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,932
Do we have to wait again?

925
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:41,940
Carol,

926
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:43,909
did they admit that
bowel obstruction in 5?

927
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,743
Yeah. He's under
the knife as we speak.

928
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:48,046
The room's free. Good work.

929
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,249
Whoever's got
gastrointestinal distress,

930
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:53,385
rise and shine.

931
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,452
Mm.

932
00:34:54,476 --> 00:34:55,520
Loretta.

933
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:56,621
Hi, Dr. Greene.

934
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:58,823
Wow. These gurneys aren't bad.

935
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,992
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

936
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,029
I mean, no. You
know, of course, I'm not.

937
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:06,064
But it's Jimmy.
He's got a fever.

938
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:07,332
He's been throwing up.

939
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,733
Come on, baby. Wake up. Come on.

940
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:10,235
Swing your feet over there.

941
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:11,903
How you doing there, fella?

942
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:13,905
I puked twice in
the waiting room.

943
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:15,140
He's kind of embarrassed.

944
00:35:15,164 --> 00:35:18,410
There were six other men
in line for the bathroom.

945
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:20,211
Yeah. It's a little
crowded out there.

946
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:21,580
Sorry.

947
00:35:21,604 --> 00:35:23,782
So your stomach feels okay?

948
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:25,383
Open your mouth.

949
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:26,718
There you go.

950
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:29,053
Tongue down. Ah...

951
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:31,756
Yeah, I don't think
it's anything serious.

952
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,892
Your garden-variety
24-hour virus.

953
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:36,260
Nothing by mouth for six hours.

954
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:37,729
Then, sips of clear liquids,

955
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:39,097
and if he keeps those down,

956
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,699
you can try a little
toast and applesauce

957
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:41,716
for dinner.

958
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,284
Okay. Thanks, Dr. Greene.

959
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,886
I'm sorry you had
to wait so long.

960
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,287
Oh, it wasn't so bad.

961
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,245
We got in before a
lot of the others did.

962
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:51,860
Chuny,

963
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:53,862
you want to help
me grab some stuff?

964
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,229
Sure. What do you need?

965
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,065
Uh, gauze, syringes, Ace wraps,

966
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,634
saline, suture sets,

967
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,871
eye patches.

968
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:04,238
4-0 nylon.

969
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,239
Check.

970
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,240
Skin staplers.

971
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,241
Check.

972
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,242
Tetanus boosters.

973
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,277
Double-check.

974
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:12,097
Haleh, Lydia, what are you doing

975
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:14,621
for the next couple of hours?

976
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,622
He's kidding, right?

977
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,324
Can we treat them
without a chart?

978
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,125
How's the hospital
going to bill them?

979
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,562
Does that metal detector work?

980
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,364
You aren't going to make
an announcement or anything,

981
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,365
are you?

982
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,933
And start a stampede?

983
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,836
These are some of
the more minor cases.

984
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,805
Explain to them
what we are doing.

985
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,275
No labs or x-rays
without a chart.

986
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,032
Richard Tomco?

987
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,264
Anderson?

988
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,688
Anderson?

989
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:51,887
Mark, we know this guy.

990
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:53,789
What do you want
this time, Ricky?

991
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:55,090
Percocet? Demerol?

992
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:56,357
No, no, I'm telling you,

993
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,359
this time, it really hurts.

994
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,627
Yeah. Yeah, it's abscessed.

995
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,896
Pretty nasty in there.

996
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,364
Five cc's Marcaine,
27-gauge needle.

997
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,033
Do you have any allergies?

998
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,723
Uh-uh.

999
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,371
Open up.

1000
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,207
Okay.

1001
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,210
You're going to be
numb for about six hours.

1002
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,612
Dental clinic's on
the second floor.

1003
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:18,780
Opens at 9.

1004
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,282
Do I need stitches?

1005
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:21,449
No, I don't think so.

1006
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,117
When was your last tetanus shot?

1007
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,319
Probably high school.

1008
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,388
Okay. We're gonna
give you one now,

1009
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,855
but I want you to come back

1010
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,425
if there's any redness or
swelling or red streaks, okay?

1011
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,894
Impetigo. Write him for Keflex.

1012
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,228
Uticaria,

1013
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,532
0.2 Susphrine sub-Q.

1014
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:40,168
Subungual hematoma. Drain it.

1015
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,770
Do you think he's, you know,

1016
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,538
lost his grip on reality?

1017
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,239
No. I think he's having fun.

1018
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,675
Vaginal bleeding.

1019
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,476
Haleh, do you think
we can do a pelvic

1020
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,011
in the waiting room?

1021
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,245
Just kidding.

1022
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,747
Take her back, spin a crit,

1023
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,850
dip a urine and do an ICON.

1024
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,185
Sudden-onset blindness.

1025
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:59,576
Woke up this morning,
couldn't see a thing.

1026
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:01,790
Carter?

1027
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:03,358
Differential includes
retinal detachment,

1028
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:06,094
central retinal artery
occlusion, CVA.

1029
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,629
Diabetic retinopathy, retinitis,

1030
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,098
macular degeneration.

1031
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,399
She's too calm.

1032
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:12,667
I think it's psychogenic.

1033
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,768
Lydia,

1034
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,703
try and find that
opticokinetic drum.

1035
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,705
If the eyes move
when the drum spins,

1036
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,096
she's faking.

1037
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:28,516
Brought you some coffee.

1038
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,918
Molly and Sarah
were roughhousing...

1039
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:31,519
Don't ever buy bunk beds...

1040
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,121
And then Molly got
pulled off the top.

1041
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,528
Okay. Your arm hurts, Molly?

1042
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:39,577
Did you hit your
head or anything else?

1043
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:41,178
Do you want me
to order an x-ray?

1044
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,815
No, we don't need it. Ms.
Taylor, one of the ligaments

1045
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,901
in Molly's elbow
slipped out of place.

1046
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:47,402
I'm gonna fix it.

1047
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,636
She's gonna cry,

1048
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,889
but it'll only hurt
for a second.

1049
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:52,907
Ow!

1050
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,008
Jeffrey fed his brother

1051
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,410
a couple of those
little button batteries.

1052
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,544
You sure?

1053
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,546
Yeah. I saw the second
one go down myself.

1054
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,814
Why'd you do that, Jeffrey?

1055
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,016
Because he likes
them. He likes them.

1056
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,351
Well, he's gonna
need some x-rays,

1057
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,452
Mr. Alexander.

1058
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:05,754
If they're stuck
in his esophagus,

1059
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,154
there's potential
for a perforation.

1060
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,156
Carter? Carter,
hold on for a second.

1061
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,726
Can I borrow this?

1062
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,950
Try that.

1063
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,701
What do you know?

1064
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:21,135
It's below the diaphragm.

1065
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,337
No need to worry.
Check his stool.

1066
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,072
They'll probably
pass in a day or two.

1067
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,674
That's great. Thank you.

1068
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,931
You're welcome.

1069
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:33,515
He was right.

1070
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,849
Psychogenic.

1071
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:35,950
Lois,

1072
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,552
I'm gonna give you
some eye drops.

1073
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,353
I think they're gonna help you

1074
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,855
with your vision, okay?

1075
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,056
So just lean your head back.

1076
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,324
Always give the patient

1077
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,927
a way out.

1078
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,429
One more.

1079
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,697
Okay. That ought to do it.

1080
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,865
Oh, wow, yeah.

1081
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:51,866
Yeah?

1082
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,934
I can see everything.

1083
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,135
It's still a little
blurry, though.

1084
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,136
Yeah, well, uh,

1085
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,337
by the time you get home,

1086
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,539
everything should be fine.

1087
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,373
Mark, Mrs. Lipshultz, 83,

1088
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,864
flushed, headachy.

1089
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,279
Oh, and nauseous.

1090
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,715
Sorry.

1091
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,183
That's all right.

1092
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,384
They're Doug's shoes.

1093
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,176
Uh, give her 10
of Compazine, I.M.

1094
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,226
What's bothering
you, Mr. Buchanan?

1095
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,663
Where does it hurt?

1096
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,387
Here.

1097
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,541
How you doing, Mr. Buchanan?

1098
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:32,123
It's my back.

1099
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:33,357
It's killing me.

1100
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:35,693
Not your shoulder?
No, no, no. My back.

1101
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:36,928
BP, both arms.

1102
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:38,062
Don't worry, Mr. Buchanan,

1103
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:39,870
We're gonna take
care of everything.

1104
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,075
Where can I get one
of these things, huh?

1105
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,990
Her arm feels absolutely fine.

1106
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,424
What do you say?

1107
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,709
Thank you.

1108
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:54,067
You're very welcome.

1109
00:40:57,056 --> 00:40:58,399
We still have an eye pain,

1110
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,600
a neck pain, an abdominal pain,

1111
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,502
and a boil that
needs to be lanced.

1112
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,371
Be there in a minute.

1113
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,907
I know it's early,

1114
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,375
but I knew you'd be up.

1115
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,576
<i>How did you know?</i>

1116
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,945
Because<i> Bananas
in Pajamas</i> is on.

1117
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,414
No, no. Don't
turn it up, Rachel.

1118
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:16,517
You'll wake up Mommy.

1119
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:19,054
Listen, I'm glad you're
feeling better, sweetie.

1120
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:21,389
I'll see you next weekend?

1121
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:22,523
<i>Okay.</i>

1122
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:23,624
Love you.

1123
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,648
<i>Love you too.</i>

1124
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,598
Hey, breakfast?

1125
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:31,799
Thanks.

1126
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,101
Breakfast?

1127
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,891
Thank you.

1128
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,063
Mm.

1129
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:44,212
Be careful. It's ugly out there.

1130
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:46,013
Not as ugly as
it's been in here.

1131
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,265
Good night. Good night.

1132
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:50,401
Oh, what a night.

1133
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,171
Hey. You ever have to sleep

1134
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:54,238
in one of these things?

1135
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,639
Listen, Doug,

1136
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,809
I'm gonna put your shoes
by your locker, okay?

1137
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,477
Because mine are
probably dry by now.

1138
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,013
Thanks for the
great work, Carol.

1139
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:04,148
Hey, that's why they
pay me the big bucks.

1140
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:05,616
Hey, Peter,

1141
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,151
we're gonna have to find

1142
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:09,821
some way to work together.

1143
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:11,978
Yeah. I guess we are.

1144
00:42:13,715 --> 00:42:15,259
So how was dinner?

1145
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,844
I fired him.

1146
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,279
What?

1147
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:20,081
I have to find a new
lawyer this morning.

1148
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,348
The guy was a lightweight.

1149
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,335
He said Chloe could
possibly have a case

1150
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,005
if, in fact, she
does have a job,

1151
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:29,791
yadda, yadda, yadda.

1152
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:30,992
What do you think?

1153
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:33,294
I've seen her go through
hundreds of jobs, Mark.

1154
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,918
What am I supposed to think?

1155
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,670
Hey, Kerry.

1156
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:43,804
Oh, hi, Mark.

1157
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,274
I think I finally made
sense of that QA Review

1158
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,409
but I know you're
on your way out.

1159
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,810
We can go over it later.

1160
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:51,912
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1161
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,504
Good night.

1162
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,291
Thought it would've
stopped by now.

1163
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:05,649
Yeah.

1164
00:43:07,486 --> 00:43:08,996
Tonight was great.

1165
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,387
The waiting room.

1166
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:13,985
When I started med school,

1167
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,987
that's what I thought
it was gonna be like.

1168
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:18,356
Really helping people.

1169
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,574
At least, that's what I
thought it was supposed to be.

1170
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,599
That is what it's
supposed to be.

1171
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,650
What are you gonna
do today, Carter?

1172
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,919
I don't know.

1173
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,187
What are you gonna do?

1174
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,727
I don't know.
