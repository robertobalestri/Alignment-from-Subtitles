1
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,850
Mark? Mark, are you asleep?

2
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,769
Wake up, sleepy
one. It's your wife.

3
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:26,870
What?

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,204
Where?

5
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,539
On the phone.

6
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:33,465
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,689
Hello?

8
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,992
Jen? Jen?

9
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,795
Did I hang up?

10
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:57,116
Hi, Rachel. Hi, honey.
Is Mommy calling me?

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,052
Doug already gone?

12
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,920
Still sleeping.

13
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:02,439
Of course it's me.

14
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,357
What do you mean I sound funny?

15
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:06,025
Can I talk to Mommy?

16
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,282
How does this look?

17
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,580
My ankle.

18
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:14,284
Well, can she talk while
she gets your Froot Loops?

19
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,660
Uh, the ankle
looks... uh, healed.

20
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,592
Uh, listen, Rachel,
is uh, is Mommy, uh,

21
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:26,363
does she seem a little mad?

22
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,598
Jen, hi.

23
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,267
You're up early.

24
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,269
Wow, what a nice surprise.

25
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,970
Yeah. Hmm...

26
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:47,016
Oh, yeah. We're on a
roll now, aren't we, Susie?

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,451
Yes.

28
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,309
Okay.

29
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:57,026
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Here we go.

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,995
Here we go.

31
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,965
Oh, boy. Good timing.

32
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,835
Okay, diapers.

33
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,059
Uh...

34
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,330
Um...

35
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,846
That's why God created
convenience stores, huh?

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,915
Yeah. Oh.

37
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,117
Yeah, it'll be okay, Susie.

38
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,402
I promise, okay?

39
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:24,604
I don't want a loaner. I
want my own damn car.

40
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:27,006
Well, that's why Walter told
you to replace that starter.

41
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,942
Careful of those surgeon hands.

42
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,644
Jackie, look, I
can't be late today.

43
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:33,312
Oh? Doing a big
brain transplant?

44
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,014
It's my first gastroplasty,

45
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:37,751
and my whole day is backing up.

46
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:38,918
Mine too, okay?

47
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,937
I was counting on
you to take me to work.

48
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,539
So look, just let
Peanut take the car...

49
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,140
No, no, no. Peanut
doesn't touch my car.

50
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,176
Where is Walter?

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,761
How the hell long does it
take to do a test drive, anyway?

52
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,680
It's a Porsche.
He'll be a while.

53
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,683
And don't blame your
bad mood on Walter.

54
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,318
He tried to warn you.

55
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,741
About what?

56
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,838
Messing with a married woman.

57
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,844
Where's the loaner?

58
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,621
Oh, how can you sleep?

59
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:16,711
How can you sleep?

60
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:23,229
All right.

61
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,781
Uh, no. No thanks.

62
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,339
Doc?

63
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,588
You're my doc.

64
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:35,025
Come on. You, you
really saved my life.

65
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,893
You fixed my feet, remember?

66
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,228
Oh. Uh-huh. Right.

67
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,096
Listen, you used some Demerol.

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,748
Demerol. You used some Demerol.

69
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:43,617
Well, I don't have
any right now, so...

70
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,819
Okay. Well, listen,

71
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,854
I'm going to stop by
and see you again, okay?

72
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,055
I'm sure you will. Take care.

73
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,590
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

74
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,180
All right. Thanks.

75
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,047
Hey.

76
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,071
Hey!

77
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,884
You forgot these.

78
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,588
Oh! Oh, my God. Thanks.
Thank you. I'm in a rush.

79
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,457
Oh, oh. Is...

80
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,725
Is this a little boy

81
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,093
or a little girl?

82
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,196
Don't! Don't! She's
afraid of strangers.

83
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,397
Oh, yeah, yeah.

84
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,355
We're late. Thank you.

85
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,890
Oh, Carter, come on.
I've got gridlock already.

86
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:24,891
Where is Dr. Benton?

87
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:25,992
Three more night floats.

88
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,410
Well, can't we just
admit them now

89
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,512
and get Benton to
sign off on them later?

90
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,182
It's not up to me. Ask HAL.

91
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,751
<i>Surgical co-sign incomplete.</i>

92
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,720
Carter, what about
this gangrenous toe?

93
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,755
Waiting on Dr. Benton.

94
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,958
Carol, bet you're
glad to hear my voice.

95
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:42,959
Can you come in today?

96
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,160
No, it's not a dress code.

97
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,594
It's a suggestion.

98
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,862
Your appearance
should make patients

99
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,264
feel comfortable.

100
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,532
And what number of earrings

101
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,034
do you think wouldn't
upset my patients?

102
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,253
Two would be my
recommendation...

103
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,521
One in each ear.

104
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,289
So I shouldn't count
the one in my navel?

105
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,457
Or, uh...

106
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,059
anywhere else.

107
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,878
What is this?
Patients in the hall?

108
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,280
A diverticulitis, rule-out appy,

109
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,831
lap choly,

110
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:06,833
all waiting to be admitted.

111
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:08,034
Well, they can't wait out here.

112
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,552
Where's Dr. Benton?

113
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,603
He's, um...

114
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:11,854
Dr. Hicks.

115
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,505
Could you help
Mr. Carter with his admit?

116
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,575
Not right now.
Where's Dr. Benton?

117
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,062
On his way, on his way.

118
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,188
Yo!

119
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,390
This section is for surgeons.

120
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,658
Oh yeah?

121
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,459
Yeah. You need a
surgical sticker to park here.

122
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,028
And where's yours?

123
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,164
It's a loaner. Look, man, move.

124
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,565
I don't have time
to call security.

125
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,667
Look, find your own spot.

126
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,252
You can't park here.

127
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,088
Well, I am parked here,

128
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,914
so what are you going
to do about it... Doctor?

129
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:21,996
Shit! Damn!

130
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,319
Oh, my God, I am so late.

131
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:25,489
Slow morning, huh?
Thank goodness.

132
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:29,660
Susie! You look
100% cotton today.

133
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:30,699
Who makes this?

134
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,747
You know, I'm going to
run her upstairs real fast.

135
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,749
I'll be back in five.

136
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:38,018
Where is everyone?

137
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,035
Outside.

138
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,742
Some rush-hour traffic thing.

139
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:46,510
Uh...

140
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,133
Go on, I got her. Thanks.

141
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,513
Head-on collision.

142
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,948
Chest to steering
wheel. Head to dash.

143
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,968
GCS, 10. BP, 90/50. Pulse, 120.

144
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,436
Facial lacs, splint
to the left tib-fib.

145
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,470
Right ankle's funky too.

146
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:58,488
Any more coming in?

147
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:01,091
Child passenger. Ross has it.

148
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:02,125
Careful with this line.

149
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,149
I had to stick her
10 times to get it.

150
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,332
Where'd they take my mom?

151
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,068
Hey! Doctors are taking
care of your mom, okay?

152
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,069
How are you?

153
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,671
Only injury is a
bruise on his hip.

154
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,872
Kid was wearing a seat belt.

155
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,474
Well, he could
use one right now.

156
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,741
Okay, I'll check him out,

157
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,199
see if he's as
strong as he acts.

158
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,820
We got another one.

159
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,839
I'll pick you up, I guess...

160
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:33,840
about 8:00?

161
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:34,858
Okay.

162
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,649
Yeah? All right.

163
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:43,221
So, dinner last night went okay?

164
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,903
Let's get a CBC, type
and cross six units.

165
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:47,937
Get four units O-neg.

166
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,938
IV's infiltrated.

167
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,173
I'll start a central line.

168
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,941
Good morning, Susan.
We were starting to worry.

169
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,143
I'll do the IJ.

170
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,094
Let's get x-ray in here.

171
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,145
Cross-table C-spine,

172
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,632
chest, pelvis,
lower extremities.

173
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,900
Let's see what Dr. Greene needs.

174
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,753
Pulse, 120. Resps, 28.

175
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,121
Check the board, Susan.

176
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:06,189
I think you're assigned to
the bounce-back bellyache.

177
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,190
Pulse ox 90.

178
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:11,483
Increase oxygen, 15 liters.

179
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,632
Ooh.

180
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,935
There. That is a much
better look for you.

181
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,737
Dr. Weaver hasn't seen
you yet today, has she?

182
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:21,738
No. Why?

183
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,473
I just want to be there.

184
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,992
I thought you'd finished
your ride-alongs.

185
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:27,326
I did.

186
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,327
Ooh.

187
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:32,165
We were just going shopping.

188
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,784
Shep has to cook for
the station tomorrow.

189
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,335
Shep? His name is Shep?

190
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,019
You're saying the man cooks too?

191
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,822
Elvis had a dog named Shep.

192
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,273
They all cook.

193
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:42,759
Those dual-function gentlemen...

194
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:43,993
Hard to resist.

195
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,596
♪ When I was a lad And
old Shep was a pup ♪

196
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,115
♪ Over hill and
meadow they'd roam... ♪

197
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,985
Little more curl
to the lip. Yeah.

198
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,987
Please don't encourage him.

199
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,940
I need a GI cocktail for
Mr. Perry in Curtain 3.

200
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,644
Uh, can you give
me another minute,

201
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,879
and then I'll get
her up to day care?

202
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,681
Sure. We're having a ball.

203
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,416
How'd it go with the attorney?

204
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,717
I have to wait three months

205
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,719
before I can claim abandonment.

206
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,055
Well, maybe Chloe will
have second thoughts.

207
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,590
She left her own baby.

208
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,159
She's not entitled
to second thoughts.

209
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:19,830
Okay, Mr. Perry, I
ordered some medications.

210
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,264
If your pains are
gastrointestinal,

211
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,298
you'll get some relief.

212
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,733
The man had a heart attack.

213
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,436
Rita, stop. It was heartburn.

214
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,804
Given your husband's
diet last night,

215
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,940
gastritis seems likely.

216
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:32,542
He gets three-alarm chili
over spicy fries all the time.

217
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:33,944
Never bothered him before.

218
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,144
It could have been

219
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,847
the burrito grande during Leno.

220
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,082
She's a little freaked. My
old man had a coronary.

221
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:42,352
Uh-huh. You'll
need to lay off these.

222
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,020
There is a chance
your pain could be

223
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,454
cardiac related,

224
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,063
but we'll run some tests
to rule that out, okay?

225
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,260
How long will that take?

226
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,929
A few hours. You
have to be somewhere?

227
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,614
No, I was just wondering

228
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,952
when you serve
lunch around here. Mm.

229
00:10:58,976 --> 00:10:59,976
Ah!

230
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,109
Hi.

231
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,411
Hey, hi. I had fun last night.

232
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,013
I told you you'd
like the mosh pit.

233
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,581
Are we still on for tonight?

234
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,849
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,851
Let's do something a little
less crowded, like food.

236
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,452
Food's good. Okay.

237
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,770
Carter?

238
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:20,906
Hi. Weaver nixed your
MRI on the John Doe

239
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,442
with the possible hand fracture.

240
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,709
I hate to agree with management,

241
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,111
but I think she's got a point.

242
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:26,612
You're right. You're
absolutely right.

243
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:29,382
I don't know what
I was thinking.

244
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:32,490
MRI? Huh.

245
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,620
How is it?

246
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,423
Completely healed,
you were in x-ray so long.

247
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,612
Need some more ice?

248
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:41,661
Is there a fracture?

249
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,095
No.

250
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,665
Oh! Looks like a dislocation
of the interphalangeal joint.

251
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,934
Tip of your index finger.

252
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,336
I know where it is, Carter.

253
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,038
Uh-huh. Well, it's
great there's no fracture.

254
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:53,105
I mean, you can forget

255
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,106
about today's gastroplasty, huh,

256
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,408
but a fracture,

257
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:57,410
that could have kept you
out of surgery for months.

258
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,011
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What are you doing?

259
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,613
Have to numb it
and get it reduced,

260
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,815
make sure there's
no tendon damage.

261
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,217
You want me to
call somebody else?

262
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,985
Get on with it.

263
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,286
Must hurt like crazy.

264
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,504
Yeah.

265
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,124
Slammed it in the
car door, did you?

266
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,691
Yeah.

267
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:13,999
Carter, is Dr. Benton...

268
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,948
Uh, they need you in
Trauma 1, Peter, right away.

269
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,587
All right.

270
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,220
I can't find it either.

271
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,222
BP's falling. 70/30.

272
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,724
This guy's in fib.

273
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,192
Pulse 150. I can barely feel it.

274
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,343
What do we got?

275
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,295
Multiple trauma.
Hypovolemic shock.

276
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,812
Can't get a central line.

277
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,448
Cutdown time.

278
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,472
Carter will do it.

279
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,761
He's ready.

280
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,841
You're ready.

281
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,532
Okay, let's go.

282
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,748
Not the ankle, femoral,
and don't cut too deep.

283
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,217
The saphenous
is superficial here,

284
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,519
and believe me, you do
not want to transect it, okay?

285
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,626
Yeah.

286
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:02,475
Any luck with sitters?

287
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:03,559
I've got a few leads.

288
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,395
She needs a change, Joanie.

289
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,197
You know we don't recommend
extended care for infants.

290
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,184
Well, um, it's only temporary.

291
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,785
Chloe kind of
left me in a lurch.

292
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,971
Well, us too. Susie's bill
is three weeks overdue.

293
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,973
Uh, no, it's my bill, and
I'll pay you tomorrow.

294
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,808
All right, well, just
try and make it up

295
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:22,712
a couple of times today, okay?

296
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:23,713
Yes. Okay.

297
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:27,149
Okay. Bye-bye. Mmmm...

298
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,786
Yeah.

299
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,910
Save her noon bottle for me.

300
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:38,862
♪ Good morning to you
Good morning to you ♪

301
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,755
♪ Good morning to you
Good morning to you ♪

302
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,804
Uh, Randi, I have
a baby-sitter coming

303
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,240
around 4:00 for an interview.

304
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:51,841
Could you keep
an eye out for her?

305
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:52,842
You bet.

306
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,444
Did anyone find
you a lab coat yet?

307
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,845
Doesn't fit.

308
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,047
Tonight, it's going to
be just the two of us.

309
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,048
No Hulda?

310
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,350
She's off to Helsinki.

311
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,251
People come and go so quickly.

312
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,655
We will drink beer
and watch the Bears.

313
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,273
Dr. Ross, what
do we do with this?

314
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:08,508
She said she
didn't have to wait.

315
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:09,642
That's right.

316
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,444
This is a "Go directly
to Dr. Ross" card.

317
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:12,461
Is anybody in Iso?

318
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,413
I don't think so.

319
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,317
Hey, Mei-Sun.
How's our boy today?

320
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,274
Okay?

321
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,239
How are things going?

322
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,507
Uh, keeping busy.

323
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,208
I haven't seen Chloe lately.

324
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,377
None of us have.

325
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,144
How's she doing in school?

326
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,513
Well, you got a few minutes?

327
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,547
Mark, sorry to interrupt.

328
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,732
There's a patient
threatening to sue.

329
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:33,933
Wants to see whosever in charge.

330
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,334
Is it okay if I handle it?

331
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:36,886
Would you?

332
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,154
Bless you.

333
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,507
What were you saying?

334
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,543
No, I was just saying
how busy we've all been.

335
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:44,710
Excuse me.

336
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,812
I got a weak-and-dizzy
to check on.

337
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:47,997
I want to thank you

338
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,299
for giving me a chance
with that cut-down earlier.

339
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,901
I think it went pretty
smooth, don't you?

340
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,519
That was lidocaine
without epi, right?

341
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,676
Does it matter?

342
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,042
Joke. I'm joking. No epi.

343
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,043
How's it feel?

344
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,277
It's numb.

345
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,079
Okay. Get ready,
because I'm going to pull it.

346
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,614
Just do it.

347
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,018
Okay, point and flex.

348
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,386
Looks pretty good.

349
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,388
Check lateral stability.

350
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,623
Tendons are okay.

351
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,125
Congratulations. What a relief.

352
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,427
Yeah. It's wonderful.

353
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,429
You're welcome.

354
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,464
<i>County General, this is unit 47.</i>

355
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,932
Go ahead, 47.

356
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,901
<i>Calling for a noon radio check.</i>

357
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,937
We just did the a.m.
check an hour ago.

358
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,239
Go ahead. Switch to Med 4.

359
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,174
<i>I'm sending you
some calibrations.</i>

360
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,144
Read calibrations, 10-2.

361
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,513
<i>Great. I'll see you
when I see you, County.</i>

362
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,815
Noon check? What was that about?

363
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,952
I'd say he wanted
to hear your voice.

364
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,087
Car door, huh? Get it splinted,

365
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,823
and you're going to need an MRI.

366
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:47,990
The x-rays looked good.

367
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,058
I don't think it's broken.

368
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,460
If you end up with a leave,

369
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:52,061
you're going to completely
screw up my schedule.

370
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,229
The guy was a maniac.

371
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,331
He destroyed $6,000
worth of prosthetics.

372
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:59,668
Listen, uh, how
about I buy you lunch?

373
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,354
Well, maybe a little soup.

374
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,392
I got a call for a
pickup... Dvorak Park.

375
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,060
Park bench, southwest corner.

376
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,561
She was laid out just like this.

377
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:12,031
All right. Let's get her inside.

378
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,466
Uh, this was pinned to her.

379
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,869
It's got some cash inside.

380
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,472
I, uh, took out my fare.

381
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,962
Yeah. Great.

382
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,545
My, my. What do you know?

383
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,580
She's pregnant at 14.

384
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:31,717
And her mom's along.
We keeping you up?

385
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,387
Susie woke up
six times last night.

386
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,687
How did you ever raise four?

387
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:36,688
Graveyard shift,

388
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:38,157
no OT for the first four years,

389
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,792
and a husband
who works flex time.

390
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,727
Just shoot me now.

391
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,029
Pay close attention.

392
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:44,363
You'll practice
this drill a lot.

393
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,565
I was starting to think
we'd never get out of here.

394
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,633
Today's all-city
finals... Volleyball.

395
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,335
Amy's the only
freshman playing varsity.

396
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,353
Mom...

397
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,721
Sorry to keep you waiting.

398
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,189
Well, I knew if Amy was willing

399
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,591
to come on a tournament
day, then it must be pretty bad.

400
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,575
She claims that it's cramps,

401
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,743
but I'm always wary,

402
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,079
because I had
appendicitis when I was 12...

403
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,197
I'm not 12.

404
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,249
Well, if you'll
just step outside,

405
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,184
I'll examine Amy and
see what's going on.

406
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,655
I'll stay. I always do.

407
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,540
We've, uh, found that kids

408
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,274
after a certain age

409
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,109
develop a better
rapport with doctors

410
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,545
if they're seen one-on-one.

411
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,397
I, um, I like your earrings.

412
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,332
Thanks.

413
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,235
My daughter and I
don't have any secrets.

414
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,504
Harper, why don't
you get started,

415
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:29,058
and I'll show Mrs.
Tubbs to the lounge.

416
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,626
No, no, you did the right thing.

417
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,828
It's just an ear infection,
but you can't be too careful.

418
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,329
I'm going to get him
some augmentin.

419
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,032
Is okay with his HIV?

420
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,690
Mm-hmm. It's fine.
I'll be right back.

421
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,805
Uh, I need to talk to you
about my assignments.

422
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,674
It's a random rotation.

423
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,942
Well, I've been
randomly rotating

424
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,210
through headaches
and gas pains all week.

425
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,129
I'm only getting
the boring cases.

426
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,948
Look, maybe I am
going light on you.

427
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:53,582
I've noticed that you have

428
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,001
a lot of personal obligations,

429
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:56,402
and I thought you
might need slack.

430
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,603
I've got a kid with chickenpox.

431
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:58,604
Where should I put him?

432
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:00,006
Uh, put him in the Iso Room.

433
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,409
Okay, this way.

434
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:04,710
I don't need any slack.

435
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:06,712
If there's anything affecting
my ability to do my job,

436
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,047
I'll let you know.

437
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:09,448
No, hey don't go in there!

438
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:10,616
There's somebody
already in there!

439
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,051
He's not on the board.

440
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:14,053
He's a patient of mine.
He's a kid with AIDS.

441
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,439
He doesn't need to be
exposed to chickenpox.

442
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,841
No kidding! So maybe you
could let us in on the secret

443
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,075
that he's here.

444
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,513
Lydia, why don't you see
if Exam Room 4 is open?

445
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,865
Doug, next time make sure
that your patient's on the board.

446
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,033
Kerry...

447
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,924
want to take a look at this?

448
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,548
It's not appendicitis, is it?

449
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,764
How long have you
been sexually active?

450
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,166
I told him that
stuff wouldn't work

451
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,468
without a condom.

452
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,203
Well, it didn't.

453
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:51,007
Don't tell my mom.

454
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:54,176
Amy, by law, I'm not
permitted to tell your parents.

455
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,045
Good.

456
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,229
Okay, you can slide up now.

457
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:58,965
We'll talk about your options

458
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:00,233
when all your results are in.

459
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:01,734
Since you had unprotected sex,

460
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,369
we'll need to do tests

461
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,204
for gonorrhea,
chlamydia, and HIV.

462
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,339
I don't have that.

463
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:07,740
Have you had more
than one partner?

464
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:08,757
No.

465
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:09,947
Has he?

466
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,851
Amy, whatever the results are

467
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,503
or whatever you decide to do,

468
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:24,841
you're going to need
someone's support.

469
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:28,132
Your mom seems to care.

470
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,817
She was delivered by taxi?

471
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,086
No name, but her
whole history's there.

472
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,671
End-stage multiple sclerosis.

473
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:40,773
Partially paralyzed,
incontinent,

474
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,791
sight impaired,
possible dementia.

475
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,893
Beautifully brushed hair.

476
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,529
And she likes an
open window at night.

477
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,530
She's also got pneumonia.

478
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,131
Did you call the cops?

479
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,401
Then what else can we do?

480
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:52,902
Admit her.

481
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,209
I'll call upstairs.

482
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,545
Mr. Carter.

483
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,048
Looks like you and I have
a gastroplasty in an hour.

484
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:08,184
Are you up to speed
with the procedure?

485
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,585
Mmm.

486
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,420
Yes, I... yes, I am.

487
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,422
Good.

488
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,057
I'll see you both there.

489
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,791
Peter, I know
you can't scrub in,

490
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,735
but there's a lot to
learn by watching.

491
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,918
No, I don't understand.

492
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,220
If you have three
discharges and one admit,

493
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:31,591
you should have two open beds.

494
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,158
Yes. She has MS.

495
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:37,029
She's also got pneumonia,
so Neuro can't take her.

496
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,866
Well, when can
you get back to me?

497
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,400
Excuse me.

498
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:44,837
I got a Deluxe Jalapeño fried
for a Tom Perry in Curtain 3.

499
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:45,838
There.

500
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:47,006
Thanks.

501
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,540
Ah, Mrs. Tubbs. It'll
just be a few moments

502
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:49,541
I saw the ultrasound machine.

503
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:50,576
I know what's going on.

504
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,643
She's pregnant, isn't she?

505
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,245
I can't discuss this
with you right now.

506
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:54,847
Oh, no, of course
not. I'm her mother.

507
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:55,848
I know that, but...

508
00:20:55,872 --> 00:20:57,249
The one who spent
14 years sacrificing

509
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,650
so that she could
have every chance,

510
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,853
The one who's going to
foot the bill for this baby

511
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:03,122
or have to face our priest
when she doesn't have it,

512
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:04,356
so sure, ignore me.

513
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,692
No, I understand that this is...

514
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:08,094
No, you're not a
mother, are you?

515
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:09,612
No, I'm not, but...

516
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:10,935
Then don't dismiss me.

517
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,857
And don't try to keep
me away from my baby.

518
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,237
Call Security.

519
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:19,338
No, there's no need.

520
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,406
The girl's privacy...

521
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,043
She's ready to tell her mom.

522
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,211
Sometimes it's the boring case

523
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:29,904
that turns into
the real challenge.

524
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,020
If you're considering violence,

525
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,454
count me in.

526
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:36,656
Oh, it's not just me!

527
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,062
There is no
politically correct way

528
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:44,630
to describe that woman.

529
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:47,016
I'll see if I can find her.
Anybody seen Dr. Weaver?

530
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,353
Follow the trail of
partially digested residents.

531
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,488
Dr. Lewis?

532
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,622
Childcare called.

533
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,923
Should they hold
Susie's noon bottle?

534
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,409
It's almost 1:00.

535
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:58,411
She must be starving.
No, tell them to feed her.

536
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:00,012
I'll be up as soon as I can.

537
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:01,213
Go on up. Take a break.

538
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,415
You're allowed to have a life.

539
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,549
I'm waiting on some labs.

540
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,817
Weaver has you playing her game.

541
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,452
You think if you
ace all the details,

542
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:08,921
then she's gonna
stop nit-picking?

543
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:11,090
Probably not.

544
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:12,208
You know, Susan,

545
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:13,642
you didn't put your X's

546
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,761
in the middle of the box.

547
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:17,229
I know it's trivial,

548
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,534
but could you say "sahntimeter"
instead of centimeter?

549
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,035
And couldn't you second-guess
yourself sometimes,

550
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,721
instead of me
always having to do it?

551
00:22:58,778 --> 00:22:59,755
What does that mean,

552
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,356
they may have a bed after 7?

553
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,690
What, are they building it?

554
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,892
I called all the nursing homes

555
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:04,893
in the neighborhood.

556
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:05,994
Nobody's AWOL.

557
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,796
Well, we know she
didn't walk to the park

558
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,830
and call her own taxi.

559
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,301
<i>County General, this is Unit 47.</i>

560
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,804
This is County
General. Go ahead, 47.

561
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,205
<i>We're at the scene
at Archer Courts</i>

562
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,706
<i>with an adolescent female.</i>

563
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,810
<i>GSW to the chest,
guessing a 9 mm.</i>

564
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,278
<i>She's unresponsive,</i>

565
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,815
<i>Shallow resps at eight.
Pulse, 130. BP, 90/50.</i>

566
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,383
Have you started fluids?

567
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,918
<i>Two IV's going wide open.</i>

568
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,719
Copy that. What's your ETA?

569
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,954
<i>Just about to pull out.</i>

570
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,523
<i>We ought to be there...</i>

571
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,691
<i>Damn!</i>

572
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,126
What's going on?

573
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,929
<i>They're shooting at
us! Gunfire at the scene.</i>

574
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,396
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

575
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,832
<i>No, somebody's down out there!</i>

576
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,433
<i>I'm going after them.</i>

577
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,835
47?

578
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,369
<i>Don't do that, man.</i>

579
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,138
Shep! Shep!

580
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,413
So, I pull the trocar

581
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,548
through the stomach.

582
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,283
CDH 29.

583
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,652
What other options
would we have?

584
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,286
Roux-en-Y.

585
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,789
Anastomose the
jejunum to the stomach.

586
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,624
Benini and Forse claim

587
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,426
that vertical-banded
gastroplasty

588
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,162
preserves the
gastroduodenal continuity.

589
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,396
Ho. Where did you read that?

590
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,965
<i>Gastroenterology.</i> This month.

591
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,333
Okay, I gave it a shot,

592
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:22,170
but that rainforest
crap is driving me nuts.

593
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,171
Toilets flushing.

594
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,506
That's how they make that sound.

595
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,730
Peter, you're not sterile.
Would you mind changing it?

596
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,479
Any requests?

597
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:33,136
Silence is fine.

598
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,439
Okay. We're ready.

599
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:42,662
RL 90 stapler, please?

600
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,385
It's all yours, Mr. Carter.

601
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,035
Any words of wisdom
for your student

602
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,038
before he staples
his first stomach...

603
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,828
or have you done one of these?

604
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,512
No, I, I haven't.

605
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:07,516
You only get one chance,
and there's no undoing it.

606
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,283
Calm and steady.

607
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,774
Advance the pin button.

608
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,811
Line up the gap indicator.

609
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,494
Mm-hmm. Release
the trigger safety.

610
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,371
Fire.

611
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,160
Nice.

612
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,793
Are you kidding?

613
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,027
All the single-parent
kids I see?

614
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,929
It's a huge job. You
should be scared.

615
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,930
And I'm worried about

616
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,264
what's best for little Susie.

617
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,265
Have you told Mark yet?

618
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,467
No, and I'd rather you didn't.

619
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:44,836
Okay, if you do
consider adoption...

620
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,003
I already saw a lawyer.

621
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:47,706
There's a neurosurgeon
up on eight.

622
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,641
His name's Kevin Halloran,
and he's a great guy.

623
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:51,376
He and his wife
have adopted already,

624
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,211
and they've been looking.

625
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:56,497
No. I mean I was
thinking of adopting Susie.

626
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,838
Oh. Okay.

627
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:05,223
Feeling better?

628
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,590
Hey, doc!

629
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:09,311
I was, but the hospital
food didn't sit too well,

630
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,512
so I ordered me up some
takeout to settle my stomach.

631
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,519
You have to stop eating.

632
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,484
For how long?

633
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,171
We'll try an hour,
see how you're doing.

634
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:21,606
Your cardiac workup's negative,

635
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,475
but if you keep gorging
yourself like this,

636
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,343
it won't stay that way.

637
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,344
It's hard for him.

638
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,713
He... he really loves his food.

639
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:30,515
Well, if he eats
himself to death by 40,

640
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,921
he'll miss a lot of meals.

641
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,937
Could you order me up
another of those drinks?

642
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,171
It seemed to help before.

643
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,324
Promise not to
chase it with an eclair?

644
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,727
Ha ha! An eclair.

645
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,631
No. I'm at County General.

646
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:50,034
The paramedic unit was
calling from Archer Court.

647
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,891
We need some help here!

648
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,327
Single GSW to the chest.
BP, 100/60. Pulse is 102.

649
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,213
Resps at 32. Diminished
breath sounds on the right.

650
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,499
We would have called in,
but our radio got shot out.

651
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,701
Is there another victim?

652
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,136
A guy on the street
playing possum.

653
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,337
He didn't want to get shot.

654
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,872
That sounds smart.

655
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,774
Okay. Here we go.

656
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,076
Watch yourself there.

657
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,527
Hang on.

658
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,862
All right, on my count.

659
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,931
Ready? One, two, three.

660
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:22,534
Whoa! That's a big 12-year-old.

661
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,369
She's got a hemothorax.
Set up a chest-tube tray.

662
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,704
28 French?

663
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,728
That sounds about right.

664
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:34,679
It's a little crowded
in here, 47.

665
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:36,097
Why don't you
take out your stuff

666
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,004
and wait in the hall?

667
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,040
How's our mystery guest doing?

668
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,476
The same.

669
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,677
She stopped moaning.

670
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,915
Okay. We're moving her.

671
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,250
You found a bed?

672
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,219
Not yet, but it's
a big hospital.

673
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,220
Got it?

674
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,221
Yep.

675
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,056
Let's go.

676
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,059
Listen to me, lady. I've
been waiting a long time.

677
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,259
Now, you've got to tell me...

678
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,661
Sir, if you would
just simmer down...

679
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,529
But she is my
niece! Where is she?

680
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,131
Buddy, buddy, what
can we do for you?

681
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,933
He's the uncle of
the girl you brought in.

682
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,367
Oh, she's here. She's okay.

683
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,969
Sir, your niece was shot.
She's being stabilized...

684
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,704
Not Poovey! I got to see her!

685
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,209
If you could calm down... Sir!

686
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,210
Where is she? Poovey!

687
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,410
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

688
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:24,846
200 cc's in the Thora-Seal.
Bleeding slowed.

689
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,030
Good bilateral breath sounds.

690
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,142
Oh, mercy.

691
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,813
She must be carrying a kilo.

692
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,432
Hey!

693
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,416
Hey!

694
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,990
He may have a gun, you guys!

695
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,758
You dumb, dealing
son of a bitch!

696
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:57,278
Were you shooting
at us? Were you?

697
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,313
Were you shooting
at us? Watch out!

698
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,449
Huh? Did you shoot at that kid?

699
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,085
Huh? Did you
shoot? Out of our way!

700
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,421
Did you shoot that little girl?

701
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,946
I am gonna kick
your ass. Come here.

702
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:15,769
Did you shoot that kid? Huh?

703
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,417
Did you? Huh?

704
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:20,618
Take him in. Take him in.

705
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:21,619
Huh?

706
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:23,854
Got them both. Got them both.

707
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:27,658
Don't inhale this
stuff. It'll mess you up.

708
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:40,938
Susan?

709
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:41,939
Yeah?

710
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:42,940
Your baby-sitter's here.

711
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:44,342
I sent her to the snack bar.

712
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,343
Oh, that's fine.

713
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,944
But, half an hour
ago. Sorry, I forgot.

714
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:48,012
Oh, my God.

715
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,813
Uh, Lily, could you
give 30 cc's of this

716
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,982
to Mr. Perry in Curtain 3?

717
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,484
You bet. Go on. Go.

718
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:54,907
Okay, thanks. Thanks.

719
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:58,923
What do you think?

720
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:01,714
Right feels lucky.

721
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:10,018
Can I help you?

722
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,185
Well, I hope so.

723
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,187
I'm Mark Greene,

724
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,255
Attending in the
ER. Maybe we spoke.

725
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,823
Nothing in there.

726
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,824
We're looking for a room.

727
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,925
A bed would do.

728
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,910
You know, I think a room
would be much better.

729
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:22,212
Dr. Greene, you know
the proper channels.

730
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:23,213
Yeah, I tried them,

731
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:24,214
and this nice lady

732
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:25,616
still had no room for the night.

733
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,384
There. What do we have here?

734
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,753
Hey, look. There's a bed.

735
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:31,539
And it has an open window.

736
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,579
Oh...

737
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,378
This is perfect. We'll take it.

738
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,180
Do you want me to call
the admitting supervisor?

739
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,381
Not unless you want to explain

740
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,183
why you were too
lazy to handle an admit

741
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,767
45 minutes before
the end of your shift.

742
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,878
Thank you.

743
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:53,127
I think she likes it.

744
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,512
Three hours a day
would be perfect.

745
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:55,913
I wouldn't do
more than that yet.

746
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,515
Oh, yeah. That would
help me so much.

747
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,516
I just can't stand

748
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,118
to have Susie in
daycare for so long.

749
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:01,218
I hear you.

750
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:02,620
I thought about
putting Theresa in one

751
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,922
for about two minutes.

752
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,124
Not my child, though I'm sure

753
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:07,659
the one here is very nice.

754
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:08,976
Oh, yeah. It is. It's great.

755
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,260
Yeah.

756
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,746
Yeah, she's still
breast-feeding.

757
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,481
There's a lot of salt in those.

758
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,751
Oh, right.

759
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,820
Well, uh, where should we start?

760
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,821
I'm on days till Monday.

761
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,272
Until Monday?

762
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:24,742
Yeah. My shift changes
every three weeks...

763
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:25,926
12-hour days, 12-hour nights.

764
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,348
You mean you'll be needing
help at different times.

765
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:32,116
We can work it out in advance.

766
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,935
I didn't understand
that on the phone.

767
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,536
Well, when I'm on nights,

768
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,106
I do expect to patchwork
a little extra help.

769
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,542
I'm so sorry. I can't help.

770
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,010
Theresa and I have a schedule,

771
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,612
and I thought I
could work Susie in,

772
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,664
but I can't reshuffle
week to week.

773
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,765
I understand.

774
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:49,083
It's just not

775
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,985
a very flexible time
for us right now.

776
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,553
I mean, you know babies.

777
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,688
They're such little
creatures of habit.

778
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:55,840
They need their patterns

779
00:31:55,864 --> 00:32:00,266
to develop a sense
of... a sense of security.

780
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:06,417
Honey? Honey! Is it his heart?

781
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:08,052
I knew it when I saw it!

782
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:09,053
Did he drink this?

783
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:10,054
Yes.

784
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,055
The whole thing?

785
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,557
What's going on here?

786
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:16,027
We have got to pump
his stomach now.

787
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:18,852
Whose patient is this?

788
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,922
Hold still, Mr. Perry.

789
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,256
You need this to inactivate

790
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,040
any Donnatal left
in your stomach.

791
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,360
What happened?

792
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,545
Mr. Perry here

793
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,180
just got treated
to a gastric lavage.

794
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,381
After ingesting

795
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:40,185
500 cc's of Maalox,
lidocaine and Donnatal.

796
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,736
He drank the whole bottle?

797
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,737
She gave it to us.

798
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,155
I gave him an ounce.

799
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,841
But you left the bottle in here?

800
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:48,893
Poor physician instructions
are not your responsibility.

801
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,495
You don't know anything
about my instructions.

802
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,097
Because there was
nothing written on the chart,

803
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:53,498
and you were
nowhere to be found.

804
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:55,267
Your patient's in
respiratory arrest,

805
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,285
and you disappeared.

806
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,719
I told Randi...

807
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,922
It's not the clerk's job
to keep track of the staff.

808
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,012
Kerry, Susan, outside.

809
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,835
It would have made no difference

810
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,069
to that patient's condition

811
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,138
if I'd written a
book on his chart.

812
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,772
Obviously, I did not order him

813
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,174
to guzzle a quart
of GI cocktail.

814
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,176
So this time it didn't matter
that you were careless.

815
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,679
Shall we wait till someone dies,
and then you'll be responsible?

816
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:24,746
All right, that's enough!

817
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,748
Let me finish with this patient,

818
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:28,532
and I'll see you
both in the lounge.

819
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:38,176
Still working?

820
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,011
Yeah.

821
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,713
Actually, I got to
cancel on tonight.

822
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:44,282
Dr. Hicks wants me to
monitor our gastroplasty

823
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:45,450
in the recovery room.

824
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:46,785
Wow. Grown-up stuff.

825
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,319
I'm sorry about tonight,

826
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:50,122
because I was
looking forward to it.

827
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:51,623
Rain check.

828
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:54,126
Wow. Those are really nice.

829
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,460
Hmm. Thanks.

830
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,462
How did you get them so even?

831
00:33:57,486 --> 00:34:03,135
Just practice. You'll get there.

832
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:04,770
Am I in your light?

833
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:05,921
Um...

834
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:09,630
No. No.

835
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:20,074
Anything wrong, doc?

836
00:34:24,046 --> 00:34:26,207
We'll do it soon.

837
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,676
Doc?

838
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,177
Uh, no, sir.

839
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:32,069
No, everything...
Everything's fine.

840
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,371
Please sit down.

841
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:38,553
What just happened
in front of that patient

842
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,290
can't ever happen again.

843
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:42,691
You two have to
start working together.

844
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:44,359
I depend on both
of you too much.

845
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,044
I'm to blame for this situation.

846
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,696
I haven't backed you up, Kerry,

847
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,148
on some of the more
unpleasant aspects

848
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,149
of your job,

849
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,084
I may have left the impression

850
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,820
that I don't support the
work that you're doing,

851
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,823
so let me go on record:
I am behind Kerry 100%.

852
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,559
If you disagree with
anything she's doing,

853
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:05,163
assume that she's
acting with my approval,

854
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,998
but if this department

855
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,634
impedes any resident
from doing their best,

856
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:12,292
then as chief, you
have to respond.

857
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:15,112
Any questions?

858
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,299
That's it.

859
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:25,083
Kerry, hold on.

860
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:28,353
Susan is one of the
most gifted doctors I know.

861
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:31,206
If she's having trouble
working with you,

862
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,375
it's a problem I
expect you to solve.

863
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:35,644
Fine. I'll accept your
criticism anytime,

864
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,262
but not in front of a resident.

865
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:39,297
Okay. It won't happen again.

866
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:40,849
It undermines my authority

867
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:41,850
and is completely inappropriate.

868
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,051
I imagine that's how Susan felt

869
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,075
when she was being
critiqued in front of a patient.

870
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,060
Um, I'd like to apologize

871
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,711
for what happened earlier today.

872
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,181
It was, um... inexcusable,

873
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:58,783
and I am sorry.

874
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:01,642
Uh, apology accepted.

875
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:08,426
What happened earlier today?

876
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,762
It was a, uh, misunderstanding.

877
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:13,765
Are you having fun being
where the buck stops?

878
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,433
Bring on the TV and beer.

879
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:16,935
Well, actually, I...

880
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:19,104
Hope you don't mind a threesome.

881
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:20,705
No problem.

882
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:22,369
See you later. Let's go.

883
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,113
Ortho concurred.
No tendon damage.

884
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:30,314
Keep that finger
in a splint ten days,

885
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:32,117
and you shouldn't need a leave.

886
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:33,284
That's good news.

887
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:35,787
Get yourself a physical
therapy regimen.

888
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:39,124
You know Jeanie Boulet, right?

889
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:41,048
I'll take care of it.

890
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,216
Multiple trauma just pulled up.

891
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,217
I'll get it.

892
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,141
I'll join you in 2.

893
00:36:58,017 --> 00:36:59,861
35-year-old worker,
recycling warehouse.

894
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,264
Fell 15 feet off a
catwalk onto a machine.

895
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:05,734
BP's 50 palp, pulse, 56. No
spontaneous resps, GCS, five.

896
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:07,501
Moves extremities times four.

897
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,770
What is that thing?

898
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,955
Some kind of a crusher.
Coworkers tried to dismantle it.

899
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,124
No distal pulse
in that extremity.

900
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,260
Hot date tonight?

901
00:37:15,284 --> 00:37:16,594
Almost.

902
00:37:16,618 --> 00:37:18,429
When did her husband show up?

903
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,031
Half an hour ago,
according to the nurse.

904
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:22,300
Social worker's on her way.

905
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:25,687
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I
didn't want to send you away,

906
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,371
but I couldn't shampoo your hair

907
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:30,374
the way you like it.

908
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:33,544
Or get your pills straight.

909
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:37,215
Or change the bed.

910
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,317
I never thought
the day would come

911
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,720
when I couldn't pick you up.

912
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:43,021
Even after the boys were gone,

913
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:45,273
you were always a feather.

914
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:49,177
I can't afford the kind of
place that you should have,

915
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:52,230
But I... But I...

916
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:55,533
I, I thought it would be...

917
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:57,702
I thought it would
be better for you here.

918
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,559
I... I...

919
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,633
I missed her too much.

920
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,238
Damn it! We're losing the arm.

921
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,373
Where's the hell's maintenance?

922
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,842
Here. I found these.

923
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,595
BP's 50 palp. This
guy's bleeding out.

924
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:24,996
No, he's not.

925
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,564
No internal injuries.
Lavage is negative.

926
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:27,887
Come on!

927
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:31,774
No pelvic fracture.

928
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,040
CBC's normal.

929
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,442
Come on!

930
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:40,594
Anion gap, metabolic acidosis.

931
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,812
Hey, this place
use any chemicals?

932
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:43,681
Nobody spoke English,
but it was a real dump.

933
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:47,768
Recycled junk everywhere,
a lot of old x-ray cartridges.

934
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,904
Blood gas shows
decreased AV differential.

935
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:50,905
Could be cyanide.

936
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:51,906
Doesn't make sense.

937
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,907
Why not?

938
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,008
Stripping x-rays.

939
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,952
They could be using
cyanide illegally.

940
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,446
Got it!

941
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,464
Ho!

942
00:38:59,488 --> 00:39:02,467
We need a pressure
dressing here.

943
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:03,617
How are those retinal veins?

944
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,837
Ah, bright red.
Get a cyanide kit.

945
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:07,377
300 sodium nitrate.

946
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:14,000
Hang the thiosulfate, 50 cc's.

947
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:24,372
And he's pinking up.
Guess you were right.

948
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,140
Remind me never
to arm-wrestle you.

949
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:30,995
Oh, damn. We're an hour
over. I had dinner plans.

950
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:32,447
Oh, Susie!

951
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,231
What time is it?
Daycare closes at 7:00.

952
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:35,433
Can you call them for me?

953
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,802
You can go. I'll
take him up to O.R.

954
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:40,043
No, that's okay. I'll stay.

955
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,045
Stay on top of it

956
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:50,381
and see what the social
worker comes up with.

957
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:51,616
Carol, long day?

958
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,951
Yeah, for my day off.

959
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:53,952
Is Susan still around?

960
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,153
I don't think so.

961
00:39:55,177 --> 00:39:57,155
She had to get out of
here early, you know,

962
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:58,356
picking up little Susie and all?

963
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,158
She seems to be
spending a lot of time

964
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:01,592
with that baby lately.

965
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:03,427
Well, yeah, since
Chloe flew the coop.

966
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:04,428
Chloe's gone?

967
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:05,764
Where have you been?

968
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:09,222
I've got to get that.

969
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:14,722
<i>County General, this is 47.</i>

970
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,324
It's the other
one, the other one.

971
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:17,525
What is his name?

972
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,027
County General. I read you, 47.

973
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:20,027
Raul.

974
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,712
Is he dating anyone?

975
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:23,197
<i>Calling in</i>

976
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,549
<i>for a radio check
on our new set.</i>

977
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:28,842
I hear you loud and clear.

978
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:33,725
If, if there's nothing
else, I'll sign off.

979
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:36,594
<i>Just thought that you
ought to answer your phone.</i>

980
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:37,878
<i>47 out.</i>

981
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,282
I was wondering if
we should get that.

982
00:40:50,566 --> 00:40:52,076
Hello?

983
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,178
<i>Nurse Hathaway, look, I'm, uh...</i>

984
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,816
I'm sorry if I got in your
way on that last call.

985
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,767
<i>You didn't get in my way.</i>

986
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,736
<i>I thought I made you angry.</i>

987
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,737
You didn't.

988
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,822
So let me just ask you,

989
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:06,557
if you weren't mad,

990
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:11,813
were you, uh, maybe, worried?

991
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,147
Worried about what?

992
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,182
You running out in
the middle of sniper fire,

993
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,485
or chasing an armed
man through the ER?

994
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:20,254
You were worried!

995
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,625
I mean, I thought
something was going on here.

996
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,894
I thought maybe I
was getting to you.

997
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,946
<i>I know you're getting to me.</i>

998
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:33,818
<i>That's great. You were worried.</i>

999
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:35,174
All right. So what if I was?

1000
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:38,322
Oh.

1001
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:40,858
Uh, hello.

1002
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:42,960
I, uh, thought you
were flying out today.

1003
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:44,128
Fog.

1004
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:45,896
No Doug yet.

1005
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,364
No? Good.

1006
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:51,201
I mean, uh, would you like
to go out for a drink quick?

1007
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:52,387
A quick drink.

1008
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:54,389
I'm not dressed.

1009
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:55,623
Yeah, I've noticed
that about you,

1010
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:58,476
but if you got dressed,
then we could go out.

1011
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,929
Mark, are you flirting with me?

1012
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,032
No. I was just going
out for a drink anyway...

1013
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,469
I was just, uh, going
to drop off my dinner.

1014
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,538
So, you know, I thought...

1015
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:11,873
Why don't we go?

1016
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,040
Okay. I come.

1017
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,041
Okay.

1018
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:18,513
Now, uh, don't be long, okay?

1019
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:24,084
Oh, great.

1020
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,721
Mark, you've got the cards out.

1021
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:29,891
No. I, uh...

1022
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,648
Something wrong?

1023
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,431
Mark, should I...?

1024
00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:37,665
Doug, hello.

1025
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,401
Hello. Hello.

1026
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:44,572
Uh, my friend Hulda and
I, we were just going...

1027
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:46,974
Relax, Mark.

1028
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:50,278
I think Hulda and I
can read the situation.

1029
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,046
I'm Linda.

1030
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,017
Did we have a scheduling mix-up?

1031
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,485
Looks that way.

1032
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:00,855
Uh, so, one, two, three, four.

1033
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:01,956
Let's have a drink.

1034
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,458
Sounds great.

1035
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:04,992
Or play bridge.
Nice even number.

1036
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:08,279
Thanks, but no thanks.
I got to call my wife.

1037
00:43:08,303 --> 00:43:10,548
So, let me count.
That makes three.

1038
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:12,016
Am I right?

1039
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,089
Mark, it's early.

1040
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:16,554
Uh, have fun.

1041
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:17,743
Good night.

1042
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,702
<i>Hi. I'm not here.</i>

1043
00:43:31,726 --> 00:43:33,304
Hi, Susan. Mark.

1044
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:35,073
I found out about Chloe.

1045
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:38,709
<i>I guess we haven't
been talking much.</i>

1046
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:42,713
<i>Listen, if you need
anything, call, okay?</i>

1047
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:46,050
<i>I'm at Doug's.</i>

1048
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:47,852
<i>Miss you.</i>

1049
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,289
<i>Hello?</i>

1050
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:11,159
Um... yeah. Hi.

1051
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:12,793
Dr. Halloran, this
is Susan Lewis.

1052
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,330
I hope I'm not calling too late.

1053
00:44:15,354 --> 00:44:18,154
I heard that you and your wife
are looking to adopt a baby?
