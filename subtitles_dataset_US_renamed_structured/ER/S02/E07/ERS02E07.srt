1
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:31,023
Where's your little girl?

2
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:32,191
I don't have one.

3
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:33,560
Where's your little boy?

4
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:35,929
I'm all by myself.

5
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,363
Are you sick?

6
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:38,932
No, no, no.

7
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,435
Then why are you here?

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,071
For a job.

9
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,289
You don't have a job?

10
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,025
Do you see those
pretty fish over there?

11
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,180
Did you lose your job?

12
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,530
My daddy lost his job.

13
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,466
Did you get a new job?

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,917
Yes, I did.

15
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,221
Giving big shots
to little girls.

16
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,272
Mommy!

17
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,674
Big shots.

18
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,876
There you go.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,377
Mrs. Riblet...

20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,879
weak and dizzy all over.

21
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,380
Be still, my heart.

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,414
Do you smell something?

23
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,815
Yeah. Uh-oh.

24
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,284
Ma'am. Ma'am...

25
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,552
Smoking's not
permitted in the hospital.

26
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,654
This is my glaucoma medicine.

27
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,318
My grandson grows it.

28
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,558
Oh, no. No, thanks.

29
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,127
Put that there.

30
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,379
You know, why don't
we put these away

31
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:27,597
so that we don't get busted.

32
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,165
Smells like primo stuff.

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,300
Yeah?

34
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,023
God, I miss the '60s.

35
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,221
New computer?

36
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:36,556
Yeah, CD-ROM.

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,825
I'm connecting us up by
modem to Mount Sinai.

38
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,826
Pooling our resources.

39
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,260
A couple more things to go over.

40
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:42,662
Dr. Benton goes
nuts if you're late

41
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,664
or you don't answer a
page on the first beep.

42
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,065
He's also got a
pretty bad temper.

43
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,367
I'll have to remember that.

44
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,568
And never, ever,
ever contradict him

45
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:49,803
in front of an Attending.

46
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:50,804
Who made brownies?

47
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:52,438
Wendy Goldman.

48
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:53,457
Hi.

49
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,858
Hi.

50
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,259
Damn.

51
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,861
What's wrong?

52
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,262
I think I deleted Radiology.

53
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,464
Well, did you back it up?

54
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,299
Was I supposed to?

55
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,801
Try Alt Q. That sometimes works.

56
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:05,935
Hit-and-run pulling up,

57
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,236
10-year-old girl.

58
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,505
Where's Ross?

59
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,106
Job interview.

60
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,175
Hit and run, no witnesses.

61
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,893
Found unconscious,
responsive to pain.

62
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,762
BP 140/90, Resp low at 10.

63
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:18,364
Tubed her in the field.
Multiple facial lacs.

64
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,666
Possible fracture to
right lower extremity.

65
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,234
Get Radiology down here!

66
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:22,235
Trauma 2.

67
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,536
What's her name?

68
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,821
Lunch box says Molly Phillips.

69
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,157
Somebody call her parents.

70
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,260
All right, nice and
easy. Keep bagging her.

71
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,662
Here we go, people, on my count.

72
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,118
One, two, three.

73
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:38,284
All right, people,
let's learn something.

74
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,686
Carter.

75
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,721
How do you check
for a spinal cord injury

76
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,055
on an unconscious patient?

77
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,975
Look for absence of
deep tendon reflexes. Do it.

78
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,126
Poor little thing.

79
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,029
Harper, what film
do we want first?

80
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,515
Chest?

81
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,218
I'd do a cross-table lateral
to rule out a C-spine fracture.

82
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,202
Deep tendon reflexes

83
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,570
are present bilaterally.

84
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,888
Babinski is normal.

85
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,657
Harper, let's talk head trauma.

86
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,259
What study should we do?

87
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,493
Um...

88
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,894
Come on, Harper, pay attention.

89
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,713
Pressure's falling, 50/30.

90
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,047
What do you hear?

91
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,571
Uh... Um...

92
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,769
Diminished breath
sounds on the right?

93
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,371
Is that a question
or a statement?

94
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,755
I appreciate air movement
bilaterally. No pneumo.

95
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,423
No, Carter, that's
upper airway sounds.

96
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,876
I see a tracheal shift
to the left. So do I.

97
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,977
Tension pneumo.

98
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:21,961
Good call, Harper.

99
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,079
I'll teach you

100
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,280
how to do a needle
decompression.

101
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,144
Carter, run the
blood up to the lab.

102
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:32,138
Our new Urgent Care Facility

103
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:33,340
could use someone
with your experience.

104
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,774
Urgent Care's a smart move.

105
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,943
Most of our emergencies
are run-of-the-mill stuff,

106
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,011
sprained ankles, concussions.

107
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:39,412
Right up my alley.

108
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,414
But you'll spend most of
your time on ear infections

109
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,415
and well-baby checkups.

110
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,616
Hey...

111
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,352
Private practice is changing.

112
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:46,552
We're chasing PPO contracts

113
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,254
to compete against the HMOs,

114
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:49,456
but we won't sacrifice

115
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,457
our commitment to children.

116
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,958
That's what Pedes is all about.

117
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:52,959
We're a family here.

118
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,361
The kids you take care of today

119
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:55,761
will be the parents

120
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,530
of the kids you'll
see in 20 years.

121
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:58,531
We believe in continuity

122
00:03:58,555 --> 00:03:59,532
and commitment.

123
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,566
So do I.

124
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,103
So do you want
to join our family?

125
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:05,171
Yes, I do.

126
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,729
How's she doing, Peter?

127
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:04,797
She's stable.

128
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:08,001
We're just going
over her films now.

129
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,235
Nasty break.

130
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,437
Anybody want to take a crack

131
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:11,438
at reading it?

132
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:12,472
Type three tibial

133
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:14,441
and fibular shaft fracture,

134
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:15,491
with complete displacement.

135
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,910
30% chance of
nonunion. Excellent.

136
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,112
Were knee and
ankle films ordered?

137
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:20,313
I don't believe so.

138
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,564
With tibial shaft fractures,

139
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,066
knee and ankle
films are necessary

140
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,685
to rule out injuries
from transmitted forces.

141
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,922
She's right as rain,
Peter. Order the films.

142
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:30,923
Come with me.

143
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:31,924
Got a couple

144
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:32,925
of interesting Colles fractures

145
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,126
you might want to look at.

146
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,328
Have you ever seen

147
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:36,992
a middle ear bone fracture?

148
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:42,235
Hey...

149
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,236
How'd the interview go?

150
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,270
Great.

151
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:45,471
Yeah, well, what did they say?

152
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,472
They said I was great.

153
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:47,740
Did you get the job?

154
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,242
90 grand a year and nobody dies.

155
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,476
Hallelujah. <i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

156
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
I'll see you around.

157
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,806
You okay?

158
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,295
Sure.

159
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,511
This what you really want?

160
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,569
Do I have a choice?

161
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,721
Molly...

162
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,324
Molly, do you know
where you are?

163
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,825
You're in the hospital.

164
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,460
You were hit by a car.

165
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,150
We're taking very
good care of you.

166
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,491
You like my ring?

167
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,842
I know you're scared,
but I'll stay with you.

168
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,509
We called your parents.

169
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,978
They'll be here very soon.

170
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,396
Okay...

171
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,497
Let's extubate her.

172
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:45,498
Carter?

173
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,516
What's her tidal volume?

174
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,534
500 cc's, gases are good.

175
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,270
All right. Excellent.

176
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:51,871
Okay, we're going
to take this tube out.

177
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:53,422
Squeeze my hand.

178
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,980
Make sure the cuff is down
before you extubate her.

179
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,329
Good.

180
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,730
Now, what I want you to do

181
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,199
is pretend like you're
about to blow out

182
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,801
your birthday candles, so
take another deep breath,

183
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,035
and when I say go,

184
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,587
blow out real hard, okay?

185
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,888
Go.

186
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:11,991
Nice!

187
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,009
Good job.

188
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,677
Good job.

189
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,345
Okay, let's send
her for a head CT.

190
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,602
I'll be in Exam 2.

191
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,183
What's your name?

192
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,717
What?

193
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,441
What's your name?

194
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,922
I'm Harper.

195
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,923
This is John.

196
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,613
Hi, Molly.

197
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,003
Other eye...

198
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,506
Your optic discs
are perfectly normal.

199
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,009
Are you sure that
you have glaucoma?

200
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,845
My medicine must be working.

201
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,948
How long have you
been lightheaded?

202
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,415
I wouldn't call it lightheaded.

203
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,451
It's more like I float.

204
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,719
How long have you been floating?

205
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,554
About two weeks.

206
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,923
And how long have you
been smoking marijuana?

207
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,513
About two weeks.

208
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,429
Having trouble?

209
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,431
I lost Radiology.

210
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,566
That's bad.

211
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,567
No kidding.

212
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,568
You have a file-recovery disk?

213
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,903
No.

214
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,494
Hmm. Let me have a go at it.

215
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,328
Hmm, there are a couple
of damaged clusters,

216
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:23,762
but everything looks intact.

217
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,098
Jerry, could you keep
Mrs. Riblet's valuables

218
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,055
while she gets a CT?

219
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,620
Help yourself, honey.

220
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,822
Sure thing.

221
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,057
Can't I stay and watch<i> Geraldo?</i>

222
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,558
And disappoint Radiology?

223
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,559
What are you doing here?

224
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,961
Mozart ring a bell?

225
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,730
Fantasy of the opera,
<i>The Magic Flute?</i>

226
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,731
No.

227
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:42,732
The charity ball?

228
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,399
You promised you'd go.

229
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,835
That's tonight?

230
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,036
Yeah, the tickets
cost my company

231
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,771
300 bucks.

232
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,205
So here's your costume...

233
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,373
Don Giovanni.

234
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,676
No, no, no, no, no, it's tights.

235
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,710
I'll just wear a tux.

236
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,811
No.

237
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,013
Pick me up at 7:00.

238
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,413
That'll give you
an hour to change.

239
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,715
Yeah, right.

240
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,716
What are you going as?

241
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,717
Carmen.

242
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,718
Don't be late.

243
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,687
Yeah.

244
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,023
I think you're
going to need this.

245
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,047
Hmm...

246
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,916
Mrs. Wilson is being admitted
with coffee-ground emesis.

247
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,150
Patient has been
admitted 14 times

248
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,953
in the last three years
with the same symptoms.

249
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,554
I'd like you to
order all her charts

250
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,355
and write a summary
of all her discharge notes

251
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,080
by tomorrow.

252
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,232
You got the computer fixed?

253
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:34,734
Yeah, Linda Farrell.

254
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,335
You smell like dope.
Where have you been?

255
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,670
With a patient.

256
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,071
Are we hooked up to Mount Sinai?

257
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:40,940
Yep, beating the
crap out of them.

258
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:41,941
What are you doing?

259
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:42,942
Playing "Doom II".

260
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,376
How long does it take to play?

261
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,377
Months.

262
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,378
I've done thoracotomies

263
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,815
that were less bloody.

264
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,816
He just doesn't understand

265
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,150
the educational value.

266
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,018
Die, bastard, die!

267
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,338
Come on!

268
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,872
How are you feeling?

269
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,575
Okay. I knew you'd come.

270
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,411
Oh, sweetie, sweetie,
of course we would.

271
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,446
I want to go home.

272
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,847
Your daughter will
be in the hospital

273
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,848
at least several days.

274
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,372
Excuse me.

275
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,903
Will both of you stay with me?

276
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,105
Of course, sweetheart.

277
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,441
And, Daddy?

278
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,665
You'll come back
to live with us.

279
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,315
Well...

280
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:24,417
We'll talk about that later.

281
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:25,451
How could you let her

282
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,553
ride her bike in the rain?

283
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,755
Don't blame me for this. Ahem.

284
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,156
Well, who else let her do it?

285
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,374
I do the best I can.

286
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,743
Maybe if you spent
more time with her

287
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,944
and less time at the office

288
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,112
with Sarah...

289
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,581
Um, the plastic surgeon
will be here soon,

290
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,366
if either of you
have a photo of Molly

291
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,367
it will help him repair

292
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,511
the laceration on her cheek.

293
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,090
Same picture.

294
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,491
Lake Geneva, it
was a great vacation.

295
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,482
I just need one.

296
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,500
Hey, pumpkin.

297
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,770
You handled that very well.

298
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,061
I had practice in my own family.

299
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,032

312
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,767

316

My brother got trapped.

318
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,045
Come on.

319
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,787
Here you go.

320
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,304
Give me your hand.

321
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,261
Hang on, we're coming in!

322
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,329
Are you hurt?

323
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,498
My leg's stuck.

324
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,533
All right, hang in
there. Don't panic.

325
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,734
We'll get you out of here.

326
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,836
What's your name?

327
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,837
Ben.

328
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:35,541
Hey, Ben. I'm Doug.

329
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,443
Let's see if I can...

330
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:41,280
move some of this
stuff out of the way here.

331
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:42,881
Ugh! Ah!

332
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,684
How the hell did you
get caught in here?

333
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,218
We were up at the canal,

334
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,253
and the water started
coming real fast.

335
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:50,472
Just get it out,
please! Just get it out!

336
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,592
Mom told us to stay
out of the tunnel!

337
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:55,394
It isn't my fault, Joey.
The water just pushed me!

338
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,096
All right, settle down, fellows!

339
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,464
It's nobody's fault.

340
00:13:58,488 --> 00:13:59,932
Are you okay?

341
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:02,768
I'm cold, and my leg hurts.

342
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,570
All right, let me
take a look at it.

343
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,105
It's your lucky
day. I'm a doctor.

344
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,774
Let me check this.
Now, does this hurt?

345
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:10,042
Ow! Yeah, a lot.

346
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,443
All right, try not to move it.

347
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,112
Is it broken?

348
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,313
It might be.

349
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,582
Oh, no!

350
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,219
Don't cry, Ben.

351
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:21,587
Yeah, Ben, don't cry!

352
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,556
This is nothing compared
to what I've seen.

353
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,257
Get him out, okay?

354
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,127
Please, please,
get me out of here!

355
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,929
This is going to
be a piece of cake.

356
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,330
When I was a kid,

357
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:36,002
I used to build forts
in these tunnels.

358
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,169
You did?

359
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,239
Yeah.

360
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:41,707
Of course, you've
got to watch it,

361
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:44,443
because when it rains,

362
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,067
the water comes up really quick.

363
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:48,948
Joey, listen to me,

364
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,550
you go find a
phone, you call 911.

365
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:51,651
Okay.

366
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:53,252
You tell them to
send a rescue squad.

367
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,453
All right, Joey? Go.

368
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,422
Go! Go! Go!

369
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,024
Where's he going?

370
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:00,793
Well, this grate...
this grate is locked.

371
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,194
I'm going to need a little help.

372
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:04,864
You said you could do it.

373
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:05,865
What's that light down there?

374
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,488
I don't know.

375
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,335
All right, I'm going
to check it out.

376
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,370
Wait, don't leave!

377
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:12,939
It's okay, I'll be right back.

378
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,406
Wait, just don't.

379
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,209
Ben, listen to me. I'm going to
get you out of here. I promise.

380
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,811
But you gotta do
me a favor, okay?

381
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,113
You gotta trust me.
Can you do that?

382
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,949
Okay.

383
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:24,116
Okay? All right.

384
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,118
Now, here's the first
thing I need you to do.

385
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:29,021
You got to curl up
like this, into a ball.

386
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:31,023
Real tight like that. As
tight as you can, okay?

387
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,158
That's going to keep you warm.

388
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,227
Now, I'm going to
see what that light is,

389
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:37,697
and I'll be back as
fast as I can, all right?

390
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,966
Like a ball. Like that.

391
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,468
Now, sit tight.

392
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,492
All right!

393
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:18,738
Ben! Ben!

394
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:20,239
Ben, can you hear me?

395
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:21,796
Yeah!

396
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:25,444
All right! Are you okay?

397
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,268
Yeah. Did you find something?

398
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,311
Come on!

399
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:49,824
Aah!

400
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,835
Help! Is anybody there!

401
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:06,340
Ben! Ben!

402
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:11,290
It was locked!

403
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:14,026
I'm so cold.

404
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,077
That's all right, buddy.

405
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,567
Can you wiggle your toes?

406
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,982
No.

407
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,016
That's okay.

408
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,217
Let's see, how
about your fingers...

409
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,586
Can you move those for me?

410
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,587
There you go.

411
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,421
Can you feel me
squeezing your hand?

412
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,423
A little.

413
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,392
Good! All right, all right.

414
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,194
Now, all you gotta do is
just think warm thoughts.

415
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,731
You gotta think Hawaii,

416
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,199
and you gotta think...

417
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,036
the Sahara Desert.

418
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,060
You got to think about...

419
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,424
Hey! Hey! Hey!

420
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:46,976
Hey, come here! Come on.

421
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,810
Listen to me, you've
gotta stay awake!

422
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,580
You've gotta stay
awake for me, all right?

423
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,614
It's okay, all right?

424
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,615
I'm so tired.

425
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,950
I know that.

426
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,352
Why don't we just sing a song?

427
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,987
You know songs, don't you?

428
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,754
No.

429
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,911
Well... all right, yeah.

430
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,159
Yeah, how about, uh...

431
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,363
How about "Take Me
Out to the Ball Game?"

432
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,731

Please, don't!

442
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,386
You've gotta sing

462
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,445

463
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,236

464
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,107
Hey, Ben!

00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,409
Ben!

466
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,013
Ben!

467
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,618
Ben!

468
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,756
You all right?

469
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,494
Hey! Hey, buddy!

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,100
I... I sang it four times.

471
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,535
I knew you could do it.

472
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,016
Hey... Hey, hey, hey.

473
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,618
You stay awake.

474
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,819
You've gotta stay awake for me.

475
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,253
Come on, You've
gotta stay awake.

476
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,590
All right, this is
gonna do the trick.

477
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:19,260
We'll use this jack
to get your leg out.

478
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,462
So you a Cubs fan?

479
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,463
Yeah?

480
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,831
Who's your favorite player?

481
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,433
Who's your favorite player, Ben?

482
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,434
Hey! Hey! Come on!

483
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,370
Who's your favorite player?

484
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,607
M-Mark Grace.

485
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,042
Mark Grace?

486
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,512
What are you, nuts?

487
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,269
Shawn Dunston's the man.

488
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,652
The best shortstop in the game.

489
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,853
I'll tell you what I'll do.

490
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,655
Next season, I'll take
you to Wrigley Field.

491
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,690
Hey, come on! Stick with me.

492
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:49,992
Stay here!

493
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,392
I'll take you to
Wrigley Field...

494
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,730
Come on, damn it!

495
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,086
We'll get a couple of dogs...

496
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,336
and we'll compare Grace
to Dunston, all right?

497
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,839
There you go.

498
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,474
Hey, stay up. Stay awake.

499
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,842
Keep your head up!

500
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,144
Keep your head above water.

501
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,145
All right,

502
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,980
so you think

503
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,364
that you know a
lot about baseball,

504
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,755
do you?

505
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,559
All right, ask me a question.

506
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:25,310
Come on. Ask me a
tough one. Let's go.

507
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:26,611
Stay with me. You stay up.

508
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:27,635
You stay up!

509
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,382
The most home runs.

510
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:33,485
The most home runs?

511
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,519
Hank Aaron beats Babe Ruth.

512
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,853
That's nothing.

513
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,655
That's an easy one
Here we go. You ready?

514
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,341
Okay, we got it.

515
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,244
We got it! All right, come here.

516
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,445
You've gotta push your leg out.

517
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,113
You ready?

518
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,548
I... I can't feel it.

519
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,950
That's okay. I'm gonna help you.

520
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,084
All right, here we go.

521
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,487
Ow! Ow!

522
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,755
All right, ready?

523
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,507
It's okay. Come here, come here.

524
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:56,908
All right, listen.
Give me your hands.

525
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,977
You gotta hold on right here.

526
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,412
Hold on with both hands.

527
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:01,563
You hold on,

528
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,432
and you gotta keep your
head up above water.

529
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,700
You understand me? Yes?

530
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:07,736
I can't. I can't
hold... Yes, you can!

531
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,039
I can't hold it...

532
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,407
I can't...

533
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,742
I'll knock out these hinges.

534
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,944
No, I...

535
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,246
I can't!

536
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,380
Yes, you can!

537
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,381
I can't! Yes!

538
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,450
I can't! I...

539
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,451
Yes, you can!

540
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,204
Damn it, you hold on, damn it!

541
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:26,221
You hold on!

542
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,590
You hold on!

543
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,926
You hold on! You understand me?

544
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,496
Hold on! Here we go!
We're almost there!

545
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,855
No, I can't...

546
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:49,711
No! Ben! No! Ben!

547
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,268
Aah!

548
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:17,623
Ben!

549
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,945
Ben!

550
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:24,363
Ben!

551
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:25,387
Aah!

552
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,366
You're not dying on me, Ben!

553
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,875
Not now!

554
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,366
Hey! I shot the Hell
Knight with my plasma rifle,

555
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,868
but he nailed me
with a rocket launcher.

556
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,692
Watch out for the fireballs.

557
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,005
Excuse me, Dr. Benton?

558
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,006
Yeah.

559
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,007
I sorted through the charts

560
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,641
and compiled all the
discharge summaries.

561
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,909
I think your patient has

562
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,712
a paraesophageal hernia.

563
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:31,913
If you need anything else,

564
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,617
I'll be in the Suture Room.

565
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,206
Where are we going?

566
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,174
We're moving you
to a nicer room.

567
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:43,231
My lunch box.

568
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:46,545
There you go.

569
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,613
Don't you be scared, okay?

570
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:48,647
I'll stay with you

571
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,684
till we take you upstairs.

572
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,285
I made it in school.

573
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:54,720
It's beautiful.

574
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,355
It's for... you.

575
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:57,356
Thank you.

576
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,357
Ah! Nice.

577
00:24:58,381 --> 00:24:59,358
Yeah.

578
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:00,359
Hi, sweetie.

579
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,893
Plastic surgery called.

580
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,295
They'll be down
in a few minutes.

581
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,097
Oh, we won't be needing
your surgeon after all.

582
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:06,699
Excuse me? My plastic
surgeon's on his way.

583
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:08,334
Who? Fred.

584
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:09,335
Fred Mendoza?

585
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,469
He'll cost a fortune.

586
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:11,470
It's only your daughter's face.

587
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:12,471
Maybe we could...

588
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:13,472
I hate him.

589
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,473
That's why you called him.

590
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:16,007
He's the best in Chicago.

591
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,331
For lopsided breasts.

592
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,215
Touchy subject.

593
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:39,687
My God!

594
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,002
Is he all right?

595
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:45,221
Mouth-to-mouth's not working!

596
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,888
His airway's blocked!

597
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,457
Paramedics should
be here any minute.

598
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:49,641
That Medevac
copter will take us.

599
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:51,385
That's a TV news chopper.

600
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,864
Is my brother going to die?

601
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:55,865
No, he's not!

602
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,533
No, he is not!

603
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:58,534
Come on.

604
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,102
What are you doing?

605
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,060
I'm a doctor. I need
to clear an airway.

606
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:07,743
You got a pen?

607
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:08,744
What?

608
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,501
A pen? Do you have a pen on you?

609
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,243
All right...

610
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,315
All right, here we go.

611
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,300
Come on.

612
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,334
All right.

613
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,636
Come on!

614
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,905
Breathe, damn it!

615
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,361
All right, we got him.

616
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,930
Come here. Help me up.

617
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:46,598
Get him up, get him up.

618
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:48,734
I got it.

619
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,819
I got him.

620
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,668
What do you got?

621
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,471
I got a 12-year-old
trapped in a culvert.

622
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:10,606
Possible fracture to
the left lower extremity.

623
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,941
So don't jostle him!

624
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,077
He's hypothermic. Could
cause an arrhythmia.

625
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:20,516
I'm Dr. Ross from County ER!

626
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,917
I need a number six ET Tube.

627
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:22,901
There we go.

628
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:24,769
I need a portable
O-2 and an ambu-bag!

629
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,037
You got it!

630
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,439
We picked up the paramedic call.

631
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:28,707
What happened?

632
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,343
He saved my
brother. He's a doctor.

633
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,512
Okay, let's roll on this.

634
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,180
We're at the scene
of an incredible rescue

635
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:36,315
in Grant Park.

636
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:38,250
It appears that a doctor

637
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:39,969
has saved a little
boy from drowning.

638
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,070
All right, we got
it, doc! Call Mercy.

639
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,390
Wait! Wait! Wait! Mercy's
not a Level 1 trauma center.

640
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,825
It's the nearest
treatment facility.

641
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:49,761
This boy needs a
surgeon. Probably an ICU.

642
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:51,330
We gotta follow
base station protocol...

643
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:52,648
What's your transport time?

644
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,650
In this weather,
maybe 12 minutes.

645
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,917
Where's your pilot?

646
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:56,919
Hey, Jimmy! Over here!

647
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,554
Sorry, doc. We gotta move!

648
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

649
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:02,691
We're losing time!

650
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,626
What's your flying
time to County ER?

651
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,627
15 minutes.

652
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,946
Can you take us?

653
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,165
The chopper's not equipped
for medical transport.

654
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,866
This boy is hypothermic.
He needs special care.

655
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,850
Mercy's closer.

656
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,052
Yeah, by three minutes,

657
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:14,653
and then he dies
because there's no ICU.

658
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:16,271
Or else he dies in
a news chopper...

659
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,073
Look, I don't have
time to argue with you.

660
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:22,094
I will take full
responsibility for this!

661
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,483
This boy is gonna die!

662
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:26,899
Let's do it. It's a great story!

663
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:27,923
Let's go!

664
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:29,835
What are you doing?

665
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:30,886
I need supplies.

666
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,856
I need a portable defibrillator.

667
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,257
I got a spare!

668
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,092
You're taking a
hell of a chance.

669
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,116
Damn right. Let's go.

670
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:41,630
Go!

671
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:42,787
Go! Go! Go!

672
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,173
All right, on my
count. Here we go...

673
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,707
One, two, three!

674
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,243
All the way in.

675
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:55,244
Not enough room for cameras.

676
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:56,278
Here, take that.

677
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,412
There's no room in here!

678
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,613
Give me the camera!

679
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,614
All set!

680
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:03,051
Get a minicam van
and meet me at County!

681
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,987
Here! Here!

682
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,710
Close the door!
Let's go, let's go!

683
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,983
Patch your headsets
back to the station.

684
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,019
How's he doing?

685
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:21,043
He's okay.

686
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:24,173
<i>You filming this?</i>

687
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,574
We're live from Chopper Five

688
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,609
with Dr...

689
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:27,810
What's your name, doctor?

690
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:28,978
<i>Doug Ross.</i>

691
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:30,478
<i>Dr. Doug Ross
from County General.</i>

692
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,913
Just minutes ago,

693
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,250
Dr. Ross rescued a
boy from a storm drain.

694
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,051
I can see

695
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,119
you're attaching some electrodes

696
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,254
to the boy's chest.

697
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,855
What are those for, doctor?

698
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,674
What are those for, Dr. Ross?

699
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,143
Patch me through to County.

700
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:46,378
Dr. Ross has just asked me

701
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,996
to patch him through
to County General.

702
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,915
You need a red key.

703
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,717
Look out for the lost soul.

704
00:29:51,741 --> 00:29:53,118
Use the rocket launcher.

705
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,653
Look, Mount Sinai's shooting us.

706
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:55,654
Cheaters! Get them! Get them!

707
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:57,188
You do it.

708
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,189
I need a bulletproof vest.

709
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,125
Blast him with a BFG 9000.

710
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,361
Oh, look, his guts
are all over the place.

711
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,796
Quiet, you guys.

712
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,283
This is County
General. Go ahead.

713
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,884
<i>This is Chopper Five
from Channel Five news.</i>

714
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,286
<i>We've got a Dr. Ross up here</i>

715
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,754
<i>flying in a hypothermic kid.</i>

716
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:12,921
Doug Ross?

717
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,356
<i>That is correct.</i>

718
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,724
Hold on, Chopper Five.

719
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,275
Mark, Doug is on a news chopper

720
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:18,343
bringing in a hypothermic kid.

721
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,361
What?

722
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,385
It's on the MICN.

723
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:24,383
What's he doing
on a news chopper?

724
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,201
Look. There's Dr. Ross.

725
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,986
Turn up the volume.

726
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,021
Where's the remote?

727
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:30,045
Doug, do you read me?

728
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:32,524
<i>Mark, is that you?</i>

729
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:33,792
What are you doing?

730
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:35,093
<i>I've got a 12-year-old
with hypothermia.</i>

731
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:36,294
<i>I gotta warm him up fast.</i>

732
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:37,813
<i>I'm doing the best I can.</i>

733
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:38,847
<i>What's our ETA?</i>

734
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,248
<i>About three minutes.</i>

735
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,650
<i>We're seeing a rescue in action.</i>

736
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,018
<i>Live from Chopper Five.</i>

737
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,620
<i>Stay with us as
Dr. Doug Ross struggles</i>

738
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,524
<i>to save the life of this child.</i>

739
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:50,592
<i>And what are you doing?</i>

740
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,395
<i>How's he doing?
How's he doing, doctor?</i>

741
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,080
Malik, we need
heated saline IVs.

742
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,167
Warm up half a
dozen to 106 degrees.

743
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,336
Wendy, get heated
blankets and a mattress.

744
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,371
Jerry, call Benton.

745
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:03,972
Tell him we may
need him down here.

746
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:04,973
Heated peritoneal lavage?

747
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,007
Yeah, that's right.

748
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,409
Let's go. Now!
Come on, let's go!

749
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,611
<i>Is there anything you can
do to warm him up now?</i>

750
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,635
<i>How's he doing, doctor?</i>

751
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,549
<i>What's wrong? Why is
the monitor doing that?</i>

752
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:15,973
He's having runs of
abnormal heartbeats.

753
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,687
And what are you doing?

754
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,789
Trying to stabilize his rhythm.

755
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,274
Come on.

756
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,342
<i>He's in V-fib!</i>

757
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,894
<i>Come on!</i>

758
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,412
<i>What are those
paddles for, Dr. Ross?</i>

759
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:29,681
<i>To stabilize his beat.</i>

760
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:30,899
<i>They didn't charge
the batteries! God!</i>

761
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,584
Oh, my God.

762
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,636
<i>I need your help.</i>

763
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,271
<i>Turn the camera off.</i>

764
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,645
<i>Turn off the camera!</i>

765
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,045
<i>We've momentarily lost
contact with Chopper Five.</i>

766
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,112
<i>This is Warner Saunders</i>

767
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,447
<i>bringing you rescue in action...</i>

768
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,432
All right, squeeze the
bag when I count to five.

769
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,100
Here we go... one, two, three,

770
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,869
four, five.

771
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:52,604
Like this? Yeah, there you go.

772
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,473
One, two, three,
four, five. Yeah.

773
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:55,874
One, two... We're
going to lose this.

774
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:56,875
Oh, God!

775
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,210
Three, four, five.

776
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,045
Mark?

777
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:02,046
Mark, where are you?

778
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,047
Where the hell's County?

779
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:04,449
You told me to turn it off.

780
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:06,050
Get County on the line.

781
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:08,453
Tell them we're gonna need
a crash cart on the roof now!

782
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:09,588
<i>You got it.</i>

783
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:11,089
Come on! How far out are we?

784
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:12,090
<i>I can see it.</i>

785
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:13,725
One, two, three...

786
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:14,826
Keep bagging him.

787
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,361
Squeeze it like that! Like that!

788
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:17,780
Keep bagging him!

789
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:18,981
For you, Dr. Greene.

790
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,048
It's Morgenstern.

791
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:21,616
Hey...

792
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,419
Yeah, I... I did think
it was kind of risky.

793
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,621
No, we're watching Channel Five.

794
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,124
Oh, they're trashing
us on Channel Eight.

795
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,160
Listen, you do not
need to come in, okay?

796
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:34,462
Yeah, everything
is under control.

797
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,964
<i>We have an unconfirmed report</i>

798
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:38,099
<i>that resuscitation
efforts may have failed.</i>

799
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,901
<i>It's always a danger
up there in that copter</i>

800
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,369
<i>in the Windy City,</i>

801
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,688
<i>and bouncing around
a child with hypothermia</i>

802
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:44,890
<i>can cause a fatal
cardiac arrhythmia...</i>

803
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:46,224
She's right outside?

804
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,692
Jerry, turn that off.

805
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,460
Ugh! TV doctors.

806
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,396
Jerry, get security
to escort Dr. Mahoney

807
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,831
to a less conspicuous place.

808
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:55,818
Let's get the life
pack and drug box.

809
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,253
Any sixes?

810
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:59,877
Nope. Go fish.

811
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,425
How are you doing?

812
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:04,960
My stomach hurts a little bit.

813
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,416
Yeah?

814
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,932
Ow.

815
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:12,134
Let's get a CT of her
abdomen along with her head.

816
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,802
Probably just a bruise
from the accident.

817
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:14,970
Where are her parents?

818
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,138
They're in the coffee shop.

819
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,328
I get next game, okay?

820
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,076
Coming through!

821
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,060
Coming through.

822
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,229
Doctor, is he dead?

823
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:25,764
Please, get out of the way.

824
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,566
Dr. Greene, can you
confirm or deny this report?

825
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,000
Malik, can you get security

826
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:30,768
to get these people
into the press room?

827
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:31,987
Do you question
Dr. Ross' decision

828
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,922
to fly the child here?

829
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:35,056
Not for a second.

830
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,680
Come on, move now.

831
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,360
Let's go.

832
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,296
Hurry!

833
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,600
We're ready.

834
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:01,350
Move it! He's hypoxic.

835
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,485
All right, let's move!

836
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,086
Clear the blades,
and we'll shock him.

837
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,087
Let's go!

838
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,490
Where's the crash cart!

839
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,514
Go!

840
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,530
All right, the paddles!

841
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,631
Chopper Five has just landed

842
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,333
on the roof of County General.

843
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,335
Doctors are taking out paddles.

844
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,870
Charging! 100.

845
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,071
Clear!

846
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,406
Several doctors are
trying desperately

847
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,923
to revive Ben Larkin.

848
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:27,459
150! Clear!

849
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,928
So far their
efforts are failing.

850
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:31,580
0.4 epi.

851
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:32,614
Charging 200.

852
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:34,950
Will he make it?

853
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:36,885
Shock him again! Let's go!

854
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,420
One more time.

855
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,622
All right. Charging 200!

856
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,845
Clear.

857
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,842
All right, let's get him inside.

858
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:45,910
We'll try it again.

859
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:47,112
Are we going to lose him?

860
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:49,414
We got warming
blankets, we're all set.

861
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:51,271
Hurry! Hurry!

862
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:55,909
Damn...

863
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,577
Go!

864
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,745
Shock him again,

865
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,446
and then we'll try
rapid rewarming.

866
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,315
Hurry up!

867
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,117
Get that gurney out of there!

868
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,118
That little girl?

869
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,319
Molly? She crashed in the CT.

870
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,453
Pressure dropped,

871
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:14,454
and now she's unconscious.

872
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:15,756
Said her stomach hurt.

873
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,758
Could have blown
a mesenteric clot.

874
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,394
Harper, get four units O-neg.

875
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,495
Stay with us, Ben.

876
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,431
Paddles. Paddles!

877
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,099
Charging 200.

878
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:30,271
Clear.

879
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,806
Charging 300.

880
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,158
Clear.

881
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,862
I got a faint pulse.

882
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,497
Pulse ox is 80.

883
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:40,598
He's hypoxic.

884
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,266
Let's change him
over to a Shiley.

885
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,435
Dr. Greene, the
press is going berserk.

886
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,937
They want a statement.

887
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,538
Yeah, well, we're a
little busy right now.

888
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,940
Tell them that he's
holding his own.

889
00:35:48,964 --> 00:35:50,140
Right.

890
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:53,110
Let's get a CBC, lytes,
blood gas and coags.

891
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,846
What's his core temp?

892
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,113
82 degrees.

893
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:57,314
That's too low.

894
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,784
Put him on heated,
humidified O-2.

895
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:02,904
Heated saline.

896
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:04,772
Let's start him on lidocaine,

897
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:05,973
0.8 mgs per minute.

898
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,597
Hope he doesn't
go back into V-fib.

899
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,660
Doug, you're a mess. Go
change into some scrubs.

900
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:17,339
You're freezing, Doug. Go
get some coffee and warm up.

901
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,292
Hey, I need you here. Go change.

902
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,982
I should never have put
him on that damn chopper.

903
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:30,765
Got it, Carter?

904
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:31,799
I'm almost in.

905
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,000
Got the O-neg.

906
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,623
Hang it.

907
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,004
Oh, my God! What happened?

908
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,989
Get her out of here.

909
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:39,156
Somebody call my husband!

910
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,491
We think Molly has
internal bleeding

911
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:41,515
from the accident.

912
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:43,661
Whoa!

913
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:44,929
Molly!

914
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,031
Somebody get
her out of here now!

915
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:48,833
Molly, no! Molly, no, please!

916
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:50,034
All right, give me some suction.

917
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,791
My God, no!

918
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:59,716
All right, number
five ET Tube, please.

919
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,252
It's in.

920
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:09,336
Bag her.

921
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,121
Give her 0.3 of epi

922
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,057
and 0.6 of atropine now.

923
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:15,242
Come on, Molly.

924
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,527
Come on, Molly.

925
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:18,528
Come on.

926
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:20,231
Come on.

927
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:22,889
Epi's in.

928
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,602
Dr. Ross!

929
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:26,603
Hey, Joey.

930
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:27,671
He saved Ben.

931
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:28,873
We're his parents. How is he?

932
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:29,940
It's too soon to tell.

933
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:31,142
The news said his heart stopped.

934
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,443
It's going now. How's he doing?

935
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,645
Coags look good.
Lytes are normal.

936
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,846
Blood pH is 7.37.

937
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,847
Thank God for small miracles.

938
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:37,848
How's the patient?

939
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:38,849
He hasn't gone into DIC.

940
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:40,151
That's a good sign.

941
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,153
There are reporters crawling
all over this place like ants.

942
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,088
What's his temp,
Wendy? 85 degrees.

943
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:45,089
Not warming up fast enough.

944
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:46,423
Heated pleural lavage?

945
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,826
We could try, but I don't
think his heart would take it.

946
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,644
We could bypass it and
warm his blood directly.

947
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,446
That'd be the fastest
way. What do you think?

948
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,248
You're the Attending.

949
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,649
Wendy, call Cardiac Surgery,

950
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,051
tell them to send
down a perfusionist

951
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,886
with a bypass pump
and a heating unit.

952
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,276
Lily, go get Benton.

953
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,560
Peter, Mark needs
you for bypass access.

954
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:10,353
Gotta stop the bleeding
first. Thoracotomy tray now!

955
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,754
We have to go to
the waiting room.

956
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,054
No, no, I wanna stay.

957
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:20,012
No. We have to go.
Come on. Come on.

958
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,699
10 blade.

959
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,083
Retractor.

960
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,250
Carter, start compressions

961
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,186
while I cross-clamp the aorta.

962
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,522
Uh, yeah, I got it. I got it.

963
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,623
She's clamped.

964
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,725
What happened?

965
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,059
Abdominal bleed. She coded.

966
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,660
Start an atrial line.

967
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:42,196
Carol, I need two
15 French cannulas

968
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,263
and space...

969
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,320
Mark, little girl's coding in 2.

970
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,103
Molly Phillips. Hit and run.

971
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,670
Recent onset abdominal pain.

972
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:52,272
Her pressure crashed,
and she went into asystole.

973
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,473
We've infused
four units of O-neg,

974
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,674
given her two rounds of epi,

975
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:55,675
and then cross-clamped her.

976
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:56,676
Mesenteric rupture?

977
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,978
Probably.

978
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,579
There's nothing you
could have done about it.

979
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,580
Peter, I'll take over.

980
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,216
Hypothermic kid in Trauma 1.

981
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,651
Needs femoral
lines for a bypass.

982
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,653
Infuse another unit.

983
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,188
Peter, it's about damn time.

984
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,411
Cut down!

985
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,951
We're trying internal paddles.

986
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:21,952
Charge to 10.

987
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:22,970
Charging.

988
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,042
Clear.

989
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,608
Charge 20.

990
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,510
Charging.

991
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,899
Clear.

992
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,314
20 again.

993
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,816
Charging.

994
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,485
Clear.

995
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,853
As I remove the obturator,

996
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,838
be ready to hook up the
cannula to the bypass.

997
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:43,173
What's his
temperature? 86 degrees.

998
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:45,376
He's going into
V-tach. Rate's 180.

999
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,961
Give me 100 of procainamide.

1000
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,064
Come on, Ben, you can make it.

1001
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,698
Hold on, buddy.

1002
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,822
Hold on.

1003
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,254
Time of death, 21:25.

1004
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:29,508
I'll go talk to her folks.

1005
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,233
Doug?

1006
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,235
Doug, your friend's awake.

1007
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,658
Hey...

1008
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,894
Hey...

1009
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,244
You're in a hospital.

1010
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:13,636
Don't try and talk.

1011
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,118
Doug...

1012
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,142
You made it.

1013
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,659
Pretty nasty cut.

1014
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,227
Yeah.

1015
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,762
Could probably
use a few stitches.

1016
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,432
We can do that
in a little while.

1017
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,868
What's his temperature?

1018
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,836
93. Vitals stable.

1019
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,971
93. Way to go.

1020
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,289
You made it.

1021
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:40,645
How about that, kiddo?

1022
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,557
Excuse me.

1023
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,692
Are you the parents

1024
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,094
of the little boy in the tunnel?

1025
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,595
How does it feel

1026
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,597
to know that Mercy Hospital
was clearly three minutes closer...

1027
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,398
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.

1028
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,399
I'm sorry.

1029
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,400
I'm talking with these people.

1030
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,424
No, you're not.

1031
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,192
Hey. How are you feeling?

1032
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:30,658
You made it.

1033
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,364
Just like you promised.

1034
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
Thank you.

1035
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:39,788
It's all right.

1036
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,836
Hey, you remember Wrigley Field.

1037
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,876
We got a date.

1038
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,995
Sit down. Let me finish.

1039
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:54,764
That one was crooked.

1040
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:55,765
Yeah? Well, next time,

1041
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:57,740
you can do it yourself.

1042
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,254
Hey, Mark, thanks.

1043
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,440
For what?

1044
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:04,642
You did all the hard work.

1045
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,810
I don't think

1046
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,613
I could have gone
up in that helicopter.

1047
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:10,664
I just got lucky.

1048
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,899
No.

1049
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,590
You know about kids.

1050
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:20,195
As good as new.

1051
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:23,694
Where are you going?

1052
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:26,129
Check for reporters.

1053
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:27,553
All clear.

1054
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:35,739
Get some sleep.

1055
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:37,741
My car's in Grant
Park with a flat.

1056
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:38,842
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

1057
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,976
I'll grab you a cab.

1058
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,011
Come on.

1059
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,212
I guess I missed the opera.

1060
00:43:42,236 --> 00:43:43,647
Linda will understand.

1061
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,748
Here, take my coat.

1062
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:45,849
Thanks.

1063
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,850
Grab a bite?

1064
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,323
Yeah.

1065
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:51,405
There he is!

1066
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,406
Dr. Ross... Dr. Ross!

1067
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,607
Over here, Dr. Ross? Over here.

1068
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,607
Can we have a statement,

1069
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:55,592
please, Dr. Ross?

1070
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,127
Can you tell us

1071
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:58,712
how you're feeling right now?

1072
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,846
Can you tell us

1073
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,832
how long the child will
be here in the hospital?

1074
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:03,450
Dr. Ross, can you
give us a statement?

1075
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,451
Can you tell us

1076
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,475
how does it feel to
be a hero, Dr. Ross?

1077
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,929
Just a moment of your time...
