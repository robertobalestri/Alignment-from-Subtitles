1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,331
<i>Previously on</i> E.R.:

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,103
- What about in vitro?
- It's a long shot.

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,303
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,141
There's nothing
going on between us.

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,394
- We work together and that's it.
- I know, I just...

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,645
I... I thought we
could have a drink.

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,389
My real name is
Claudia. I'm a cop.

8
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,276
How long you planning
on being pissed at me?

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,385
- You know, I don't know.
- You wanna come home with me...

10
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:31,891
no strings attached, just
for one night, we could...

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,877
- Lucky bastards.
- Who?

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,953
You didn't hear? Five workers
at Jumbo Mart won the lottery.

13
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,384
Ninety million dollars.

14
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,651
That's 18 million apiece
before taxes, the lucky bastards.

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,385
- Heard they all quit their jobs.
- Can you blame them?

16
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,828
No, but there was something
about starting my shift with a coffee...

17
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,934
a Slim Jim and a smile
from Babu behind the register.

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,594
Frank, where's Dr. Banfield? I need
her to sign the December Q1 reports.

19
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,504
She and the others are at a department-
chairs meeting. She's leaving at 2.

20
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,440
Two? That's mid-shift.

21
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,580
Boss lady never leaves
early. What gives?

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm not her social secretary.

23
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,677
- Minivans? Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

24
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,183
- If I drive it, they will come.
- Who will come?

25
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,855
My future wife, kids,
and our dog, Buster.

26
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,856
- You named the dog?
- I'm putting it out to the universe.

27
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:36,087
I always dreamed of a house in
the burbs, picket fence, big backyard.

28
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,095
Why tie yourself
down? You got it all.

29
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,996
A great job, money, not to
mention, that cool motorcycle.

30
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,933
No wife is gonna let you
ride that thing. Trust me.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,835
You know what
you're having? A thrisis.

32
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,171
- A what?
- Midlife crisis for thirtysomethings.

33
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,212
Are you looking at your life,
wondering what's it all about?

34
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,211
- Yeah.
- Questioning your values...

35
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,281
and what you're doing?

36
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,286
- Totally.
- You gals watch too much Oprah.

37
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:06,155
- Auto versus bicycle, three minutes out.
- Okay, how do you spell "thrisis"?

38
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,121
Jody Nugent, 16, hit by
a car while on her bike.

39
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,163
- Wearing a helmet?
- Where's my stuff?

40
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,892
Abdominal pain, shoulder
contusion and forearm lac.

41
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,560
- How fast was the car going?
- My bag. Where's my bag?

42
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,333
- Happened on Halstead. Limit's 30.
- Like drivers obey.

43
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,703
- I need my bag.
- Do you know where it is?

44
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,868
- Must have left it on the rig.
- I need it.

45
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,844
- Don't worry, I'm gonna get it.
- Scanner ready, Trauma 1.

46
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,813
- You need me on this?
- No. We're good.

47
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,680
- How about me? MORRIS:
Join us when you get in.

48
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,879
- Hey.
- Hi.

49
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,521
Listen, about the other
night, I should apologize.

50
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,923
- For what?
- I was drinking.

51
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,861
- I was drunk, and if I did anything...
- Tony, we had sex.

52
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,059
- So I did something.
- Mm-hm. I had a good time.

53
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,329
From what I remember, I did too.

54
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,996
Oh, and then you
asked me to marry you.

55
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,569
I'm kidding.

56
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,672
- So we're cool?
- Yes, we are cool.

57
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,748
Because sometimes people in
this kind of situation get weird...

58
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,212
and things get messy,
and... You mean Sam?

59
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,515
- And work.
- I got it. No drama.

60
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,714
Good.

61
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,037
- I don't see any rash.
- Look at the base of the hairs.

62
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,538
I see these little white things.

63
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,074
- Something's moving.
- Moving?

64
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,972
He's got lice.

65
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,239
Uh, we could treat
with permethrin.

66
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,780
Not good enough. We
gotta get rid of all the nits.

67
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,884
- How? Pick them off?
- Gotta be shaved.

68
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,986
How am I supposed
to shave my own back?

69
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,486
- Dr. Martin will do it for you.
- I will?

70
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,715
Mm-hm.

71
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,655
Get a prep razor and a can
of... Two cans of shaving cream.

72
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,590
Relax, buddy. Don't
scratch so much.

73
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,788
- Dawn, you got this, right?
- Oh, hell no.

74
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,456
- Nurses'll get you back.
- I got one over here.

75
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,898
Hey, what you guys got?
- Barbara Feingold.

76
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,267
Ground-level fall, good
vitals, says wall pain on the left.

77
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,637
- I'm Dr. Gates. Do you have any pain?
- When I breathe.

78
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,074
She hit the edge
of the bathtub. Ow!

79
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,908
- Are you okay?
- Sprained my back trying to pick her up.

80
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,414
- Too much dead weight.
- Did you just call me fat?

81
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,348
Get a chest X-ray,
CBC and a pulse ox.

82
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,818
- Didn't call you fat.
- I'm still a size 8.

83
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,650
If you're using
the metric system.

84
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,587
I wanna thank
you for everything.

85
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,990
No need. I'm just glad
we avoided surgery.

86
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,789
You're not the only one.

87
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:26,764
Hey, uh, thank you for
sorting my phone out.

88
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,526
I told you it was easy.

89
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:34,141
Hey, no offense, but I don't wanna see
you in here again anytime soon. Okay?

90
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,543
Hi, Dr. Brenner. I hope
you had fun in Australia.

91
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,308
Thanks.

92
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,345
- Do I know her?
- Back from your holidays?

93
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,955
Yeah, three days ago. I called
you when I first got back...

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,182
and I thought we could go out,
have some dinner and catch up.

95
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,621
Yeah. Sorry, I was busy.

96
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,059
Frank, is the PNB back on
Exam 2? I mean, the BNP.

97
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,494
Bought you a souvenir.
It's in my locker.

98
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,134
You didn't have to go to
any special bother for me.

99
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,861
He didn't. He got something
for everybody. Watch this.

100
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,404
Dr. Brenner, can you help
me with a vadge bleed?

101
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,667
- Did you get an icon?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,311
Welcome back, Dr. Brenner.
BRENNER: Thank you.

103
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,040
- Uh, it's good to be here.
- Put it away, Crocodile Dundee.

104
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:18,242
Uh, Neela, have you heard
anything from Hopkins?

105
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,716
Uh, not yet, but thanks
for putting in the call.

106
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,823
Yeah, well, chief of surgery
was a med-school classmate.

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,755
I understand you're also
interviewing at, uh, Yale and Duke.

108
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,861
- Yeah, that's right.
- All good choices.

109
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,488
Frank, I will be unreachable
for the rest of the day.

110
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:38,196
- Dr. Banfield, um, is everything okay?
- Yes. Why?

111
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,000
- I... I don't know, I just...
- I'm fine.

112
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,700
Yeah. Everything's fine.

113
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,108
- I guess my bike skidded on some ice.
- Kind of cold to be biking anywhere.

114
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,082
- Still need a pulse ox.
- I'm not getting any good waves.

115
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,414
Ah, a finger probe is loose.

116
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,081
- I should get that.
- Five centimeter lac.

117
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,453
Distal neuro-circ intact.

118
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,562
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- No hemotympanum.

119
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,595
- Can I get that?
- What labs do you want?

120
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,700
Uh, trauma panel,
ETOH levels, Chem-7.

121
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,201
- Dr. Morris?
- What she said and a urine tox.

122
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,807
- Sam, I can do the foley if you want.
- She's not gonna need it.

123
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,374
- Is this our driver?
- She was on a bicycle.

124
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,206
- I don't have my license yet.
- I thought they said MVC.

125
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,575
- How's the belly?
- Some pressure over the liver.

126
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,046
I'll take the ultrasound.

127
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,742
The driver of the car that
hit your patient is here.

128
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,047
Alert, open-fibula
fracture in Curtain 2.

129
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,713
- How is he? Is he okay?
- He's the one that should be worried.

130
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,085
- Okay, whose phone is that?
- It's mine. I should answer it.

131
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,391
- We already called your parents.
- Why did you do that?

132
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,760
Archie, please.

133
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,663
That's my boyfriend.
That's his ring.

134
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,795
You can call him later. Get her
upstairs for a head and belly CT.

135
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,134
Sam, Curtain 2 when you're done.
- Sure.

136
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,470
Her ultrasound looks good.

137
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,181
Need help?

138
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,449
- Labeling the bloods?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,584
- How's anesthetist training going?
- Fine.

140
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,196
- It's really cool that you're doing that.
- Uh-huh.

141
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,162
Word is you're really
kicking ass up in the O.R.

142
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,598
Yeah, it's great.
It's real great.

143
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,037
It must be tough
juggling everything. I...

144
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,467
You wanna help me, Daria?

145
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,976
Would you see that these get to,
uh, the lab? I gotta help Dr. Morris.

146
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,147
- Deep breath, Mrs. Feingold.
- I can't. It hurts.

147
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,218
All right, titrate
four of morphine.

148
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,048
- This the fall?
- She slipped getting out of the tub.

149
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,452
I grabbed the towel
bar, but it was loose.

150
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,855
Someone didn't fix
it like he promised.

151
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,019
I told you to call the super.
That's what he gets paid for.

152
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,493
Blunt left chest with dyspnea.

153
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,124
- It was a good thing you were there.
- I wasn't exactly there.

154
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,529
- All right, tell me, where does it hurt?
- Here?

155
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,732
- Ow!
- No crepitus.

156
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,468
Harry lives next door, he
heard me yelling for help.

157
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,876
Not hard to hear. She has a
voice that cuts through steel.

158
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,481
You took your damn sweet time.

159
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,242
I thought you two were married.

160
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,885
- Divorced.
- Three times.

161
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,887
You've been married and
divorced three times to each other?

162
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,423
What can I tell you? I'm
a glutton for punishment.

163
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,028
- All right, any pain in the stomach?
- Not really.

164
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:20,361
But I do have a pain in my ass,
and he's standing two feet away.

165
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,935
- Hey, Chuny, you got any Ancef?
- Yeah, try the cart, first drawer.

166
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:29,207
- Hey, how's Alex?
- Good. He's getting better every day.

167
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,278
- That's great to know.
- Yep, it is.

168
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,936
HemoCue, 12.9.

169
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,048
Okay, call X-ray,
see if they're free.

170
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,447
- Any of you married?
- No.

171
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,744
- Never.
- Not yet.

172
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,787
- Someday.
- What are you, a bunch of losers?

173
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,892
With all due respect, you've
been divorced three times.

174
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,927
- It's complicated.
- Ow!

175
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,393
All right, Mr. Feingold,
let me check you out.

176
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,794
- I am fine. MARQUEZ:
X-ray's ready to take her.

177
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,595
She's gonna be upstairs for
a while. Now's a good time.

178
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,102
Stop playing the martyr.
Go with the doctor.

179
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,263
You see that? She
still bosses me around.

180
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,536
Hollis. That's her middle name.
Holler. Holler, holler, holler.

181
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,648
- Call me with the lactate. Thanks.
- If it isn't Chicago's latest millionaire.

182
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,444
- Yes, yes. Hi, Frank.
- Babu, congratulations.

183
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,110
I think I'm having a heart attack.
- A heart attack?

184
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,620
Yeah, my heart is going:
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

185
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,555
Any shortness of breath,
pain radiating down your arm?

186
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,924
- Tightness in your chest?
- No, no, no. Nothing like that.

187
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,120
When did it start?

188
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:28,064
Just now when the lottery
people handed me the check.

189
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,294
Phew. And it was
a very big check.

190
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,406
Dr. Grady, Daria needs help
suturing bike girl in Trauma 1.

191
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,303
I'll be right there.

192
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,274
I think you're excited and
your adrenalin's kicked in...

193
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,346
making your heart beat fast.

194
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,141
So...

195
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,277
I'll be okay?

196
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,647
It's a big day. Enjoy it.

197
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,417
Thank you, Dr. Grady.

198
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,424
Hey. Come by later,
donuts are free all day.

199
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,628
I'm taking my break
now. Bab, wait up.

200
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,460
Okay. You've got four
healthy-looking follicles here.

201
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,692
Only four.

202
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,702
- Only takes one.
- Ah, right you are.

203
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,774
Okay, I don't know if, um, Cate
has explained all of this to you...

204
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,843
but using ultrasound guidance...

205
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,538
I am going to aspirate the
fluid from each of those follicles.

206
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,343
And then our embryologists will
isolate the eggs for fertilization.

207
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,714
All right, let's
get this over with.

208
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,516
- She's gonna be out for this, right?
- That's up to you.

209
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,320
- Knock me out. I wanna be totally out.
- All right.

210
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,191
- Do you have any other questions?
- No.

211
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,495
You want some Valium
so you can relax a bit?

212
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,030
- No.
- I do.

213
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,831
- We'll get started shortly.
- Okay.

214
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,240
Labs on your bicycle
girl. Here's a shocker.

215
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,644
- No drugs or alcohol in her system.
- Are her parents on the way in?

216
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,911
They're over in Rogers Park.
So with traffic, that'll be a while.

217
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,079
You don't have lice. They can't
pole-vault over from Curtain 3.

218
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,054
- Need some help.
- What's up?

219
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,885
The driver who hit
Jody, I gave him Ancef.

220
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,553
He's having an allergic
reaction. Diffuse urticaria.

221
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,063
- Trouble breathing?
- A little.

222
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,359
BP 85/60.

223
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,054
Ever been allergic
to medicine before?

224
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,434
I want my phone.

225
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,007
What the hell's going on in there?
- You have to stay still.

226
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,841
Okay, 0.3 epi sub-Q, 50
diphenhydramine, 125 solumedrol.

227
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,245
And 5 of albuterol if
his lungs don't clear.

228
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,044
- I got it here.
- Be right back.

229
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,380
- You have to stay still.
- Guys, what's going on?

230
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,792
- We're trying to suture the forearm lac.
- Yeah, but she will not sit still.

231
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,019
Get off me! You said
I could have it later!

232
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,629
Grady, Curtain 2, go.

233
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,855
Stop. We don't have
time for this nonsense.

234
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,432
Get off of me! Let me go!

235
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,560
- Daria, two of Versed, soft restraints.
- It's mine. I want it now.

236
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,706
- Ow! God!
- Are you okay?

237
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,468
- God!
- Hi. Hi.

238
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:54,137
I'm sorry. I know. I'm okay.

239
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,474
Ow. Aah.

240
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,640
I love you.

241
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,057
- Now, this might sting a bit.
- Aah.

242
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,423
Thank you, Sam.
Girl totally freaked out.

243
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,655
- Happens.
- Over a cell phone?

244
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,393
- My fault. I should learn to duck, right?
- Wouldn't hurt.

245
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,770
- You think this is gonna leave a mark?
- No. Not at all.

246
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,746
- Thanks for doing this.
- Yeah, you already said that.

247
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,476
Yeah, but I know how
busy you nurses are.

248
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,018
You know, the last thing you
need is a doctor as a patient.

249
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,121
- You know what, Daria?
- What?

250
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,352
Can I ask you something?
It's kind of awkward.

251
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,428
Okay.

252
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,295
- Are you seeing somebody?
- No.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,127
Huh.

254
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,100
Wow, I could have
sworn that you were.

255
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,031
You have that glow.

256
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,671
Anyway, there's this guy
who works in the hospital...

257
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,440
and I think the two of
you would really hit it off.

258
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,607
- It's so nice of you, but...
- He's really cool.

259
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,616
I'm gonna give him
your number. I am.

260
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,987
You know, as long as
you're free and everything.

261
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,125
- Can I think about it?
- Sure.

262
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,888
Sure, but don't wait too long.
Don't wanna change your mind.

263
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,497
We were only trying to help you.

264
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,626
I got scared.

265
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,067
I mean, I don't like being
here, and then I saw the driver.

266
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,264
And I guess I just freaked out.

267
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,802
I'm so sorry.

268
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,773
We're finished here. I'll
get the sling for your arm.

269
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,981
- Is the driver still here?
- We're keeping an eye on him.

270
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,711
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Should be.

271
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,721
The girl's boyfriend. I
couldn't get him to wait.

272
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,756
Oh, it's okay, Frank.

273
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,723
- Hey, baby, you okay?
- Mm-hm.

274
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,328
I didn't know where you were.

275
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,397
I was so worried when you
didn't answer my calls, my texts.

276
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,002
Her phone was getting quite a
workout. Guess that was you.

277
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,105
- Yeah, hi, Tommy Cole.
- Dr. Morris.

278
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,864
What were you doing on a bike?

279
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,271
I could give you a ride
anywhere, any time.

280
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,572
- I didn't wanna bother you.
- Baby, you could never do that.

281
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,816
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Could have been worse.

282
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,678
I'm thirsty. Can I get
something to drink?

283
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,846
Is it okay if I get her a pop?

284
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,616
Cafeteria's on the third floor.

285
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,226
Okay. I'll be right back.

286
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,927
Did you take off your bracelet?

287
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,462
Um...

288
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,705
- No, they...
- It probably came off when she got hit.

289
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,204
Oh, well, I'll get
you another one.

290
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,435
Or maybe I should
buy a dozen, huh?

291
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,605
My klutzy girl.

292
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,118
Seems like a nice guy.

293
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,586
Yeah. He's the
best. I'm really lucky.

294
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,389
- Any pain right on the bone?
- Not so bad.

295
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,962
How about here on the sides?

296
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,124
Bingo.

297
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,598
Valentine's Day, 1959.

298
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,104
Fifty years ago next month.

299
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,469
Barbara and I got
married for the first time.

300
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:14,273
She was a looker. I don't
know what she saw in me.

301
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,315
Unusual marrying and divorcing
the same woman over and over.

302
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,746
And over.

303
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,183
Well, it takes a
lot of passion...

304
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,856
to keep making up and
breaking up and making up.

305
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,616
I bet.

306
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,489
So, uh, what's with you
and this pretty nurse...

307
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,789
you were trying
to make nice with?

308
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:35,958
Sam. Yeah. We were together,
but, uh, it's been over a while now.

309
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,933
Seven weeks.

310
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,005
You sure?

311
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,165
You're still counting weeks.

312
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,377
I spent half a century
with Harry Feingold.

313
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,810
What's four weeks of
rib pain compared to that?

314
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,274
And you kept taking him back?

315
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,180
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

316
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,479
Even though your head
screams "don't do it."

317
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,555
You girls must know what I mean.

318
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:00,022
- Huh. Kind of.
- Stubborn, hot-headed...

319
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,220
and she has this way
of pushing all my buttons.

320
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,727
Yeah, I know the kind.

321
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,160
Though I must admit, I have
made my share of mistakes.

322
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,397
I caught him with his secretary.

323
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,973
Such a cliché.

324
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,133
I'd stopped by
his office one day.

325
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,836
And the way she
handed him his coffee...

326
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,243
At that moment, I
knew. I just knew.

327
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,179
The problem is, I
can't live without her.

328
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,219
But the problem with that
is, I can't live with her either.

329
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,846
So this is it, we are done.

330
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:36,155
Sometimes it's impossible for two
people who love each other to be together.

331
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,893
This is it. We're done for good.

332
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,669
I keep trying to get it right,
but I keep screwing it up.

333
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,603
You want my advice to
avoid 50 years of agita?

334
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,211
Walk away.

335
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,283
CT results on Morris' bike girl.

336
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,716
Alex, I heard you.
Four days at Sugarbush.

337
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,289
I'm not sure I want you
shushing down mountains...

338
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,584
after all you've been through.

339
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,091
I'll be home later. You
can argue with me then.

340
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,561
Bye.

341
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,862
Alex wants to go snowboarding?
Sorry, hard not to overhear.

342
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,130
- School trip. He's not gonna go.
- I was hoping we could talk.

343
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,742
I can't right now.
Maybe, uh... Maybe later.

344
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,902
Thank you so much for that
boomerang. Alex is gonna love it.

345
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,207
Thought he might. Hey,
uh, how's Mr. Feingold?

346
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,284
Muscle strain. He's back
in 2 bickering with his ex.

347
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,885
That is one strange pair.

348
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,318
- Malik, you're my last hope.
- No way, no how.

349
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,287
- Last hope for what?
- To shave hairy lice guy.

350
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,587
- He's still here?
- Come on, Dawn. You've seen worse.

351
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,493
The thought of touching
him makes my skin crawl.

352
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,225
- Grady, shave hairy lice guy.
- Yes!

353
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,927
- But he's not my patient.
- He is now.

354
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,129
This is so unfair.

355
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,574
- What's his problem?
- Lice.

356
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,438
Oh, lovely. Is my abdominal
series back on Decker?

357
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:02,139
You realize if you were still at
Jumbo Mart, you'd be a millionaire now.

358
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:06,184
- You worked at the Jumbo Mart?
- Uh, yeah, a few years ago.

359
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:09,083
Sorting things out. Wanted to
make sure medicine was right for me.

360
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,089
- Thank God she came back.
- Thanks, that's sweet.

361
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,749
You never made the right change.

362
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,020
If I won the lottery, this
is the last place I'd be.

363
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,598
Oh, you wouldn't stay here
for the work or the people?

364
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,292
No, I'd be off traveling
around the world.

365
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,439
First up, the seven wonders of
the modern and ancient world.

366
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:31,544
And then, it's off to a secluded island
where you stay in huts over the water.

367
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,204
Now, there is nothing like being
lulled to sleep by the sound of the sea.

368
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,977
Well, personally, I think the pyramids
are overrated, and I get seasick.

369
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,813
Well, what would
you do if you won?

370
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:45,015
Invest in a high-yield interest-bearing
account at an FDIC-insured bank.

371
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,786
Wow, that's... That's really
thinking out of the box.

372
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,727
Don't come crying to me for a loan
when you've blown through your millions.

373
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,458
- Jody's CT results.
- Thanks.

374
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:59,333
- Daria. Think about what I asked you?
- Not yet.

375
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,408
Well, I hope you don't hate me
for this, but I gave him your number.

376
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,505
- You did?
- I just have a feeling about you two.

377
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,475
Yep. He's gonna call.

378
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,381
You okay?

379
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,152
We're friends, so I'm
just gonna ask you.

380
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,233
- It's about Tony.
- Oh, yeah? What about him?

381
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,667
I have a feeling that
he's dating someone else.

382
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,734
- Have you heard anything?
- Nothing.

383
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:41,540
Oh, good. Could you imagine if it
was somebody here at the hospital?

384
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,512
That would be too cruel. Right?

385
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,884
Shut up and stop
touching me, Opie.

386
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,718
Hello, Dr. Morris.
How you doing?

387
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,054
Officer Diaz, look at
you. Back in uniform.

388
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,959
- We caught big fish in that drug case.
- Congratulations.

389
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,725
So it's back on the beat until I
start the detective's academy.

390
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,028
Oh, great.

391
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,226
Maybe you can help me.

392
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,895
I'm taking statements in
an auto-versus-bicycle case.

393
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,202
Yeah, on Halstead. I treated
the driver and the girl who got hit.

394
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,642
I've been talking to the driver
upstairs. I'd like to see the girl...

395
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,715
- Jody Nugent, if I could.
- Sure, she's in Trauma 1. Come on.

396
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,714
You have any drugs
or alcohol involved?

397
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,820
No. It sounds like he
was speeding, ran a light.

398
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,650
I don't think so. It doesn't
look like it was his fault.

399
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,452
- Really?
- Do you think I'm stupid?

400
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,821
- I didn't say...
- I know Matt Zullo lives there.

401
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,122
Hey, is there a problem here?

402
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,766
Oh, hi. No, we were
just, you know, talking.

403
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,334
- And you are?
- Uh, Tommy Cole, ma'am.

404
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,561
My boyfriend.

405
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,773
Well, all your scans
and tests were good.

406
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,500
You can go home as
soon as your parents arrive.

407
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,007
- Great.
- All right.

408
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,474
This is Officer Diaz.

409
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:50,343
- She wants to ask you a few questions.
- I don't remember much.

410
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:54,612
- That's okay. Tell me what you do.
- Yeah, just tell them what happened.

411
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:58,413
Actually, Tommy, it would be
best if you stepped out of the room.

412
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,985
But he's not leaving.

413
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,756
Dr. Morris is Jody's doctor
and I invited him to stay.

414
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,828
Okay, yeah. I'll
be right outside.

415
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,877
Well, it's like I said.

416
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,814
I was riding my bike and I
must have skidded on some ice.

417
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,115
- Sounds scary.
- Yeah.

418
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,523
The driver said it seemed like
you deliberately rode into traffic.

419
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,855
He's wrong.

420
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,363
Two eyewitnesses said you rode
your bike into the street then stopped.

421
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,298
And there was no way for
the driver to slow down in time.

422
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,233
- Is that true?
- No.

423
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,374
Maybe you were distracted?
Something on your mind?

424
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,407
Having any problems
at home or school?

425
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,876
Everything's good.

426
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,984
How about with Tommy?

427
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:08,552
Jody, what really happened today?
Were you trying to hurt yourself?

428
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,794
Hey, so you guys done or what?

429
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,058
Yeah, we're done.

430
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,062
So you think we
could handle triplets?

431
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,003
- It's a non-issue.
- Twins, okay. But triplets?

432
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,203
Even if all four
follicles produce eggs...

433
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,510
the chance of three of them becoming
high-grade embryos is next to zero.

434
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,210
One step at a time.
We've made it this far.

435
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,550
Yeah, well, this is the hard
part. We have to be realistic.

436
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,191
Who says I'm not?

437
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,055
Don't be disappointed
if it doesn't work out.

438
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,027
Of course I'll be
disappointed, but I'll be okay.

439
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,960
Cate, what we have now,
especially these last few months...

440
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,899
I already feel
pretty damn lucky.

441
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:56,236
- Sure, you do.
- No, I'm serious. You and me.

442
00:22:56,408 --> 00:23:00,209
It's enough. You
know that, right?

443
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,044
- You don't think it's gonna work out?
- I didn't say that.

444
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,584
If you didn't want me to do IVF,
you should have said way before now.

445
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,747
- I can't win here.
- No. No, you can't.

446
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,093
I'm sorry.

447
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,457
Baby, I'm already rearranging
furniture in my mind...

448
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,900
thinking about where
to put a crib. But you?

449
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,302
You're the most
pragmatic person I know.

450
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:32,172
The fact that we're here, in the face
of all kind of discouraging evidence...

451
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:36,372
means that deep down, you
believe we have a chance too.

452
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,677
I don't know what made
me think this could work.

453
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,411
You don't have to understand it.

454
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,655
Just hold on to it.

455
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:54,263
- Triplets would kill us.
- You. Not me.

456
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:00,428
- Jody's not telling the whole story.
- Probably won't with her boyfriend.

457
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,303
Coffee? Can't vouch for
how long it's been sitting here.

458
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,636
Sure.

459
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,609
You know, maybe I should
go back in there and try again.

460
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,306
Or maybe when Jody's
parents get here, she'll say...

461
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,474
What? Bad idea?

462
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,644
If there was something I didn't
want my parents to know...

463
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,813
You exercised your
right to remain silent.

464
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,789
My father says me interrogating
suspects as a detective...

465
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,020
will be karmic payback.

466
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:29,400
You're getting really good at that.
Much better than the other interns.

467
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,562
Forget it. Hairy lice guy? Very
lame trying to butter me up.

468
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:37,198
- What? I wasn't doing that.
- It was pretty obvious.

469
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,711
- How am I gonna get out of this?
- Oh, I don't know, be resourceful.

470
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,347
Joey, let me help you with that.

471
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,316
- This is so frustrating.
- Can't do much if she won't talk.

472
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,319
Maybe Psych can
get it out of her.

473
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,654
I'm sorry, I have to roll. If
anything changes with Jody, call me.

474
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,925
- Or just call me.
- I will.

475
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,589
Excuse me, we're here for
our daughter, Jody Nugent.

476
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,395
- Dr. Morris, these are Jody's parents.
- Oh, hi. I treated Jody.

477
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,595
How is she?

478
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:09,867
She has a separated shoulder
and a minor concussion.

479
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,910
You should be able to take
her if our psychiatrist clears her.

480
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,239
Psychiatrist?

481
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,382
I have some concerns
about what happened.

482
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,881
- What kind of concerns?
- Our daughter's not nuts.

483
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,520
No, I didn't say that,
but her story doesn't fit...

484
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,452
- Her story? Now she's a liar?
- That's not what I'm saying.

485
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,025
Now, look. Our daughter got hit
by a car and we wanna see her now.

486
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,752
Of course.

487
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,635
Hey.

488
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,439
- You wanna talk?
- Yes.

489
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,948
I've been thinking. I
don't wanna give up on us.

490
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:52,915
Tony...

491
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,078
I don't wanna be one of those
couples who never get it right...

492
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,486
and never work
through the tough times.

493
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,489
We have something
worth saving...

494
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,891
and I'd be an idiot if I didn't
try to convince you of that.

495
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:08,467
Did you realize that before or
after you had sex with Daria?

496
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,571
It was one time, Sam.

497
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,078
And it didn't feel right.

498
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,272
It just... It made
me miss you more.

499
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:27,318
- Oh, flattering, really.
- It was a mistake.

500
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,419
Mm-mm.

501
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,582
The mistake is thinking we can
put the past behind us and start fresh.

502
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,022
- We can.
- No, we can't.

503
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,254
Because you're
never gonna change.

504
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,194
You broke up with me. You
couldn't move out fast enough.

505
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,494
- Lucky for you I did.
- I told you. It didn't mean anything...

506
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,002
- Tony... Sorry.
- Oh, God.

507
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,970
Don't be. We're done.

508
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,576
He's all yours.

509
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,620
- Cefazolin's in.
- Okay, chase it with 50 of fentanyl.

510
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,248
I'm gonna need some
saline for the cervical wash.

511
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,724
- Ready?
- Ready.

512
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,093
Starting the propofol infusion.

513
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,928
How long before
we know something?

514
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,729
By the time she's waking up...

515
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,964
we'll be able to say how many
eggs we have to work with.

516
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,070
If it's bad news, I wanna
hear it from you, okay?

517
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,739
It won't be bad news.

518
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,646
Pressure's down to 70/30.

519
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,013
Barb, doll, I'm here.

520
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,489
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure. Spleen looks good.

521
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,958
- No tension pneumo.
- What happened?

522
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,996
Hypotensive, we're not sure why.
- Check the belly?

523
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,100
- We already did. BRENNER:
No cardiac tamponade.

524
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,963
- Think it's an MI?
- A heart attack?

525
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,661
It could be. Twelve-lead EKG.

526
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,482
- The O-neg's here.
- Should I hang it?

527
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,839
Start the dopamine. She's not bleeding.
- She is.

528
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,376
There's an echo-free
area posterior to the spleen.

529
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:03,676
A hematoma you missed. Hang
some blood, prep for intubation.

530
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,977
- Surgery's here. HARRY:
She needs surgery?

531
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,017
Broken rib may have
ruptured her spleen.

532
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,282
- A central line and then the O.R.
- Push etomidate and sux.

533
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,915
- That's a nice catch, Tony.
- Yeah, nice.

534
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,725
Give her some medicine
so she'll go to sleep...

535
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,728
while we put in
a breathing tube.

536
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,833
Don't leave me, you hear?

537
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,671
I'm sorry for
everything. I need you.

538
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:28,734
I love you.

539
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:33,838
I know. Me too, my love.

540
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,449
- Betadine and steri-drapes.
- Yankauer.

541
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:45,019
- So Jody's leaving.
- What?

542
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,591
You cleared her medically
and Psych gave the okay.

543
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,988
Why didn't you find me?

544
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,596
Her parents were anxious.
I didn't know what to do.

545
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,028
How about a nice hot bath?

546
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:58,034
- We might wanna keep Jody overnight.
- You said she was okay.

547
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,935
I was gonna have Ortho see her,
get her plugged into physical therapy.

548
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,702
- Is that necessary?
- It'll be more convenient.

549
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:08,540
- We'd really like her home with us.
- I understand.

550
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,546
You'll have to sign
discharge papers.

551
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:13,413
I'm sorry you had to
go through this all alone.

552
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,609
Well, I was here.

553
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,756
- When aren't you around?
- Yes, thank you for coming.

554
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,516
- Mr. Nugent?
- Yeah?

555
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,421
Can I have a moment?

556
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,795
I'm sorry, but I can't help but
think there's something going on.

557
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,199
Like what? She's a good girl.
She never gives us any trouble.

558
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,205
Would she confide in you or
your wife if she had a problem?

559
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,933
Yes.

560
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,877
I mean, well, she used to.

561
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:46,314
Ever since she's been going with
Tommy, she doesn't talk to us much.

562
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,919
It's important to stay
in your daughter's life.

563
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:53,320
My wife says if I complain, it'll
just push them together even more.

564
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,121
Tells me that I forget how
all-consuming first love can be.

565
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,789
- Honey, I need you over here.
- Yeah.

566
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,298
Excuse me.

567
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,734
Hey, so how about I
bring over some DVDs?

568
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,339
We can just hang out, chill.

569
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,102
Okay, I'll tell your folks.

570
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,504
- You take care of yourself, Jody.
- Uh-huh.

571
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,776
And this is my card. My cell
number's right there on the back.

572
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,478
If you have any problems,
day or night, call me. All right?

573
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,248
I was thinking, what you said.

574
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,129
The traffic was
going really fast.

575
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,427
- I saw the red light.
- The red light?

576
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,248
- I wanted to...
- Not tonight, son.

577
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,367
- I could just follow you home.
- I said no.

578
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,809
- She needs to rest.
- Jody, what were you gonna say?

579
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,606
Never mind.

580
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,809
So maybe tonight's
not the best movie night.

581
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:56,717
But, um, I'll see you
tomorrow. Okay? Love you.

582
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,655
Okay, let's get you out of here.

583
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:03,353
- Mr. Nugent...
- We've got it from here.

584
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,725
- Sats down to 72.
- Elevated neck veins.

585
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,332
Open up a chest-tube tray.

586
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,560
A positive pressure can
exacerbate a pneumo.

587
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,170
What are you doing to her?

588
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,636
Broken rib may have
collapsed her lung.

589
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,867
- End-tidal CO2 is good.
- Two units in the central line.

590
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,535
- I need a...
- Thirty-two French and a vascular clamp.

591
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,079
- Run of V-tach. Get the crash cart.
- Wait.

592
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:34,983
- 0-silk. Thora-Seal.
- All right. Pulse ox up to the 90s.

593
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,753
- Strong carotid pulse.
- That's good.

594
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,421
- Yes, it is.
- Thank you.

595
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,326
Frank, you paged me?

596
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,528
Morris wants you to
take ankle sprain in 3.

597
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,696
Your buddy's waiting
for you in Curtain 1.

598
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,001
Really? Who?

599
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:51,900
Hello, my friend.

600
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,410
Babu, are you having
more heart palpitations?

601
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,516
Oh, no. It is my hand.
I think it's broken.

602
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,707
What happened?

603
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,116
People have been
shaking my hand all day.

604
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,086
- They're happy for you.
- But they squeeze so hard.

605
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,418
Your hand's not broken.

606
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,254
- It is not?
- No. And you know what I think?

607
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,523
I think you're nervous about
winning all that money...

608
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,531
and your anxiety is
presenting as physical pain.

609
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,966
I am overwhelmed.
My life is good.

610
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,606
I have the store, my
family, my book club.

611
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,708
Now everything has to change.

612
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,571
I hate change.

613
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:29,442
Take your time. You don't
have to decide anything today.

614
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,379
You're right. I'll sleep on it.

615
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,747
She denied suicidal ideation.
She's got no history of depression.

616
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,824
No vegetative symptoms. No
anorexia, no anhedonia, insomnia.

617
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,655
- The stress with her boyfriend?
- They're working it out.

618
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,627
She seems to have
good family support.

619
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,596
- I talked to her before she left.
- Did she say something?

620
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,565
- Not exactly.
- Not exactly.

621
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,330
No, well, she started
to. This is a hunch, okay?

622
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:56,441
I gave her numbers for outpatient
counseling if she needs it.

623
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,940
No, we have to intervene.

624
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,476
- Send the police to her house?
- No, but something.

625
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,977
- Like what?
- I don't know.

626
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,981
She was trying to tell me
something. Another five minutes...

627
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,120
Look, I know you're
frustrated. Our hands are tied.

628
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,786
What's the matter? Headshrinker
can't help you with your "thrisis"?

629
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,586
It's not that.

630
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:19,463
You know what, Frank?
I'm going out for a while.

631
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,760
- For how long?
- I'm not sure. Let Brenner know.

632
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,836
- Finally.
- Yeah, you said it.

633
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,270
What a gross job.

634
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,706
- Poor Grady.
- Better him than me.

635
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,972
- What about Grady?
- He's giving hairy lice guy a shave.

636
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,344
Well, no, he's not. I just saw
him with an ankle sprain in 3.

637
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,509
Then who's in there?

638
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,821
- Joey?
- How'd you get roped into this?

639
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,549
Grady gave me a hundred bucks.

640
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,987
Oh, man. Tsk.

641
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,037
Hey, sir, you'll
have to turn back.

642
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,144
I'm a doctor. Maybe I can help.

643
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,042
Please, you don't understand.

644
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,912
You're making a mistake. I
need to be with my daughter.

645
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,712
Reidy, what the hell happened?

646
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,879
Repetitive blunt trauma to
the head, neck and chest.

647
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,556
- Is he gonna make it?
- He's pulseless and apniec.

648
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,194
He's had one round
of epi and atropine.

649
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,933
Jody?

650
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,880
Archie, what are you doing here?

651
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,423
I couldn't just let it go.

652
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,891
I was gonna call you.
There was no time.

653
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:02,390
- Did Jody do that?
- Nope. Her father.

654
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,162
Tommy showed up at the
house. I guess things escalated.

655
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,739
The dad heard a commotion
outside and saw Tommy attack her.

656
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,946
It's gonna be okay.

657
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,587
He said he'd love me forever.

658
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:45,136
- How could he do that to me?
- I think he did it to Daria.

659
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,711
Ugh. I know.

660
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:51,542
- You know what? I'm being stupid.
- No, no, no. Don't say that. Come on.

661
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:56,051
I mean, hello, I broke up with him.
I don't have a right to feel like this.

662
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,713
- Didn't I mean anything to him?
- Of course you did.

663
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,382
You have every right to
feel whatever you wanna feel.

664
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,221
Daria? Really?

665
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,058
I mean, okay, she's cute and
she's smart and whatever...

666
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,494
but, God, really?

667
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,363
Say the word, me and the
nurses will take her out back...

668
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,969
and rough her up.

669
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,628
I already kind of did.

670
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,832
I had a guy cheat on me.

671
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,339
- What'd you do?
- Cried a lot, hated the other woman.

672
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:25,143
Until I realized that I should
be mad at my boyfriend, not her.

673
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,184
And when I really thought
about it, he did me a favor.

674
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,481
We weren't right for each other.

675
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,386
I never realized
that you were so Zen.

676
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:37,256
- They ended up getting married.
- Okay, you're not helping.

677
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:40,490
I'm sorry. Oh,
you still love him.

678
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,333
What are you gonna do?

679
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,742
I plan on being irrationally hurt
and angry for as long as I like.

680
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,511
Sounds good.

681
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,180
Can we go inside
now? I can't feel my toes.

682
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,225
Ow.

683
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,054
I think I slipped a disk.

684
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,565
- Babu, we talked about this.
- Ah, just kidding.

685
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,261
I came to tell
you I figured it out.

686
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,272
- You did?
- I bought a yacht.

687
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,433
I fly to Greece
tomorrow to pick it up.

688
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,977
- Are you serious?
- Yes, but don't worry.

689
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,581
I'm investing the rest in
a high-yield mutual fund.

690
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:36,320
And this is for you.

691
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,748
Wow.

692
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,483
Thanks.

693
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,919
- I'm really going to miss you.
- Likewise, my friend.

694
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,838
Hello?

695
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,513
How many?

696
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,828
Hey.

697
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,967
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

698
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,329
What are you sorry about?

699
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,903
You were hoping there
wasn't gonna be drama.

700
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,801
It was bound to happen.

701
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,233
You wanna get a
drink and talk about it?

702
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:07,004
Or maybe we could, you
know, get some dinner at Ike's.

703
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,376
Thanks, it's been a long day. I'm
gonna get home. Sarah's waiting.

704
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,880
I can just call you later.

705
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,049
I don't think that
would be good.

706
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:23,088
Look, I had a great
time. It was fun.

707
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,418
But...?

708
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,087
- It's not gonna happen.
- Okay.

709
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,663
Maybe if it was another
time, but it's not over with Sam.

710
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,827
- Not for me, anyway.
- Mm.

711
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,374
I'd be lying if I didn't
say I was disappointed.

712
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,605
But I get it.

713
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:46,250
- I hope it works out.
- Yeah, thanks.

714
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,579
- Me too.
- Mm-hm.

715
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:57,221
Chuny, the ABG on the firefighter
in 2 came back negative...

716
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,522
for carbon monoxide.

717
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,689
- You can send him home.
- You got it. You out of here?

718
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,597
Oh, yes, I am. Thanks,
you two, for your help today.

719
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,897
Yeah, have a good one.

720
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,132
Night, Neela. - Neela.

721
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,901
Neela, hold up.

722
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,780
The drama never
ends around here.

723
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,148
Neela.

724
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,282
- Neela. What was that?
- What was what?

725
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,587
That. Back there, at the desk.
You were deliberately avoiding me.

726
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,288
Nonsense. I didn't even see you.

727
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:37,231
You didn't just look right at me
then take off like a bat out of hell?

728
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:40,463
Well, it's been a long
day and I'm bleary-eyed.

729
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,665
And by the way, Mrs. Feingold's
surgery went really well.

730
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,141
- That's good.
- Well, her and her ex were so grateful...

731
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,577
he proposed to her
again, and she said yes.

732
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,444
And I mean, what does a bride
wear on her fourth wedding?

733
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,451
- Red or black?
- I don't know. Are you okay?

734
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,648
Do they register gifts? I mean,
that... Yeah, that would be gauche.

735
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,985
Okay, okay.

736
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,924
Neela, you've been acting
really weird around me all day.

737
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,757
Have I done something wrong?

738
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,127
Yes.

739
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,194
No. You...

740
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,929
Which one is it?

741
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,835
Neela, if you're
angry with me...

742
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,342
You know, why do you
have to be so damn...?

743
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,173
What?

744
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,441
Charming, sexy? Good at math?

745
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:28,950
Okay, yes, I did think about you the
whole time you were away. Happy?

746
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,124
Yes.

747
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,429
But why are you so mad?

748
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,926
Because I like you.

749
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,134
I don't want to, but I do.

750
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:48,034
And I wanna be with
you. There, I said it.

751
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,142
- You can go ahead and gloat now.
- Gloat? Why would I gloat?

752
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,041
Because you predicted it. So
go ahead. I know you want to.

753
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,744
I'd rather do something else.
