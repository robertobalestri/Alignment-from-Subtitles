1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,937
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:10,373
- Chase me.
- One more touchdown, we get ice cream.

3
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,956
Booker and Banfield, all the
Bears are gonna need this year.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,883
We should ride in together.
Unless someone might see us.

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,886
Mm, being covert is
more exciting, isn't it?

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,094
We've broken up, we're
working together, it's weird.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,957
We weren't gonna screw up our
schedules. Some awkwardness...

8
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,391
- while we're finding our bearings is...
- Weird.

9
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,762
I should have never let you
and Sarah go out that night.

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,492
No, you were being cool.

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,760
We may have to put
you on the transplant list.

12
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,928
So Joanie's not her mother.
And Lucy has no idea?

13
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,129
Guess I'm in big trouble.

14
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,113
Only five hours in
and it's safe to say...

15
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,878
best Valentine's Day ever.

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,078
I gotta go.

17
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,589
I have to check yesterday's
paperwork, get the car gassed up.

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,751
I thought my hours
were tough. It's 5 a.m.

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,592
I'm a rookie detective, they're
looking for reasons not to like me.

20
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,964
I think what you're doing to me
is tantamount to police brutality.

21
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,230
Where'd you hear that?
A Dirty Harry movie?

22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,273
No, I think it was a porno.
One of the feminist ones though.

23
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,273
Oh, right. Yeah, I bet.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,106
So, what can I do
to sweeten your day?

25
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,114
Um... Candy hearts.

26
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,306
What?

27
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,887
You know, those little candy hearts
with stuff written on them. Get me some.

28
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,079
I never had them.

29
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,919
Are you crazy? Of course you
have. Everybody gets those.

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,651
Not me.

31
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,894
- No one's ever given you a Necco?
- No.

32
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,500
Forget it. You're
nuts. I gotta go.

33
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,302
- Then go.
- Then stop.

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,496
- You stop first.
- Archie.

35
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,607
Oh, Detective Diaz! Ha, ha.

36
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,644
He bought me a plastic tiara
and took me to Hampton Court.

37
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,009
Said I deserved to be
treated like a queen.

38
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,310
Well, you got that right.

39
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,477
- We were 15.
- Hmm.

40
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,416
What happened to him?

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,959
I heard he runs the Bombay
Brasserie in Leicester.

42
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,928
Has three little kids and
hands that smell of dalchini.

43
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,160
It's not such a bad life.

44
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,938
What about you?

45
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,898
Me?

46
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:25,140
Uh, there was... There
was one time when, um...

47
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,679
this girl and I went to Bali...

48
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,983
some surfing and some diving.

49
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,783
It was nice.

50
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,185
Bali... Bali was
nice. I like it there.

51
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,325
What about the girl?

52
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,822
Yeah, she was nice too.

53
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,362
Right. You probably don't even
remember her name, do you?

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,302
No, uh, her name
was Nicole. It's Nicole.

55
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,244
You know, I was thinking, maybe
we should go away sometime.

56
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,006
Maybe in a month or so.
Where were you thinking?

57
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,582
I'll tell you later.

58
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,518
Alex. I'm sorry you didn't sleep but
you are not staying home from school.

59
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,989
I know. It sucks.

60
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,028
We'll talk about it when
I get home, okay? Bye.

61
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,996
Alex had a girlfriend for two days
and she dumped him on the phone.

62
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,033
Wow. Happy Valentine's Day.

63
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,172
I tried to tell him she's
spoiled and forget about it.

64
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,705
Forget about it? Weren't you ever 15?
- Uh, no.

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,898
What happened?

66
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,238
Brawl at an after-hours
club on Fulton.

67
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,710
- I'm Dr. Morris.
- Get this thing out of me.

68
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,349
- How'd you end up with a tire iron?
- It's this girl.

69
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,882
I got a fracture and a lac.

70
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,849
- Another one?
- Must've been some girl.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,684
You and Gates take tire-iron guy,
the rest go to Triage. I'll take this.

72
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,088
Teddy Lempel, 63,
bronchospasm at a wedding.

73
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,456
Still going at 6 a.m.?
Pretty raucous wedding.

74
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,894
We were just getting started.

75
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,866
They wanted to be married at
daybreak on Valentine's Day.

76
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,232
It's a <i>Midsummer Night's
Dream</i> themed wedding.

77
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,034
- Teddy was officiating.
- As Puck.

78
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,643
- You already guessed that.
- Hypoxic on the scene...

79
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,642
sats went up after
nasal cannula O2.

80
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,372
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

81
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,983
It was just an
allergy or something.

82
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,813
- Don't listen to him.
- No, no, I saw.

83
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,749
- Turned blue. ANDROMEDA:
You need a doctor.

84
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,722
Lovers and madmen
have such seething brains.

85
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,949
First unit's up.

86
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,595
Aah, my stomach, man.

87
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,492
Do something,
please. Take it out!

88
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,632
Can't do anything
till surgeons get here.

89
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,234
Give him 10 more of morphine,
first dose didn't touch him.

90
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,132
- I already did.
- You already did what?

91
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,500
Gave 10 of morphine
about two minutes ago.

92
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,132
- You can't give meds without an order.
- You were about to ask me for it.

93
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,642
- I hadn't.
- Only morphine.

94
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,145
- O.R., I don't need an order.
- It's different.

95
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,476
Something goes wrong,
it's my ass on the line.

96
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,983
- You can't give whatever you want.
- A problem?

97
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,089
Systolic's down to 88, doctor.
What would you like me to do?

98
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,849
Hang some more blood. Thank you.

99
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,424
Gates, go sew up
the lip lac. I got this.

100
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,528
- Oh, come on, Archie.
- Drop it, Sam.

101
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,061
Set up to intubate.

102
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,600
We could try one more cycle.

103
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,929
We could.

104
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,038
You don't think
it's a good idea.

105
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,040
Fifteen thousand dollars,
all those hormones...

106
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,371
and only a very low
chance of it working.

107
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,137
That's no reason to give up.

108
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,943
I... I want us to raise a
child, I'm not giving up on that.

109
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,645
I'm only saying it doesn't
have to be through IVF.

110
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,723
So you're back to adoption then.

111
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,449
Why are you so against it?

112
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,457
I'm not against it...

113
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,228
I just worry we wouldn't be able
to love that child the same way.

114
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,799
Ha, ha, that's not true.

115
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,835
It's such an
unknown, it scares me.

116
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,963
And if we had a biological child, do
we know exactly how that's gonna go?

117
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,736
Well, at least we have some
idea where it came from.

118
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,710
Hmm.

119
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,908
What about an egg donor?

120
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,214
So you'll use a stranger's
egg but you won't adopt?

121
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,083
- That makes no sense.
- No. Not a stranger.

122
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,987
I can get an egg from
someone who carries my genes.

123
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,187
Lara's in school at UC now.

124
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,761
You wanna use your niece's egg?

125
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,632
You don't think that's weird?

126
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,431
Mac three and an eight-oh.

127
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:19,010
- I'm gonna put a tube down your throat.
- No, man. I don't want that.

128
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,375
- Etomidate or ketamine?
- Etomidate, please.

129
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,244
You're not gonna
feel any of this.

130
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,944
- Hey, Dr. Morris.
- Hi, what brings you guys around?

131
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,781
The brawl at The Night Kitchen.

132
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,515
- The what?
- The club where the fight broke out.

133
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,626
2000 kids got stuffed
in a warehouse.

134
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,386
It's a wonder
more don't get hurt.

135
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,088
Detective Trent Mallory, CPD.

136
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,131
Oh, uh, Claudia's been
telling me about you.

137
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,599
Detective Diaz
is our little star.

138
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,102
- Mind if we ask you questions?
- Get the cops out.

139
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,709
- Sorry, I got stuck with a patient.
- Vitals are holding, 200 cc's out.

140
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,639
I'm Dr. Rasgotra,
the trauma surgeon.

141
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,644
I don't need surgery and
cops asking me stuff, all right?

142
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,611
Just get this thing
out and let me go.

143
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,217
- Etomidates in.
- Two units on the infuser.

144
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,821
Throw me more lap pads.

145
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,047
Push the sux!

146
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,715
And let the O.R. know
we're sending him up now!

147
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,703
Morning. Waiting on a rig?

148
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,896
- No, a girl.
- Oh, I see.

149
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,064
Not like that.
A... A little girl.

150
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,904
Her mum's a patient
on the transplant service.

151
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,909
Hi, Simon. BRENNER: Hey.

152
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,749
My foster dad. He said to call if
I need him to take me to school.

153
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,184
Oh, I think you're gonna
be missing school today.

154
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,187
- Why?
- I'm gonna let your mom tell you.

155
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,019
- Lucy, this is Dr. Banfield.
- Yeah.

156
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,216
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

157
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,356
Good news, sweetie.

158
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,364
- They found me a heart.
- Really?

159
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,558
Really.

160
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,428
I knew they would. I knew it.

161
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,803
The heart's in Bloomington.
I'm gonna take a helicopter there.

162
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,468
Now, Lucy, your mom is
gonna go and get some tests...

163
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,079
and scans, then we'll take
you to the operating room.

164
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,443
- It's all happening today?
- That's what they tell me.

165
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,817
It's the ER, I've gotta go. Um,
I'll come back as soon as I can.

166
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,288
- Thank you, Dr. Rasgotra.
- Thank you.

167
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,792
Ten minutes? Are you sure?

168
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,731
All right then, there's a, uh, coffee
shop we can meet at across the street.

169
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,836
I'll see you there.

170
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,240
- Hey. This is from my girlfriend.
- Really?

171
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,433
Yeah, we met last
winter snow-dog sledding.

172
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,137
- It's a crazy story.
- Yeah, I'm sure it is. I'll be back soon.

173
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,742
- Jerry, is that for you?
- Yeah, from Doris.

174
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,750
- The Eskimo chick?
- She's not an Eskimo.

175
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,247
Excuse me. You okay?

176
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,917
Oh, yeah. A patient freaked
out. It's under control now.

177
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,929
- Listen, about earlier.
- I'm sorry if I was out of line.

178
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,691
No, I was being a little dense.

179
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,769
When I'm up in the O.R. I have
a different kind of autonomy.

180
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,098
- It's hard to turn it off.
- You don't have to.

181
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,036
Let me know what
you're doing before.

182
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,005
Hey, you two. Get a room.

183
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,471
I think you've overdosed
on mushrooms!

184
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,174
- Mushrooms?
- Not that kind of mushrooms.

185
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,683
- When are we gonna get out?
- We're waiting on tests.

186
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,184
What mushrooms
you talking about?

187
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,847
Ah, this is Teddy Lempel, the
premier mycologist in Chicago.

188
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,018
He's been voted Best Mushroom Man
four years running by <i>Fungi Magazine.</i>

189
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,630
I'm a chef and anyone
who's anyone knows...

190
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:29,133
that no one can hunt down
exquisite wild mushrooms like Teddy.

191
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,565
My gift, my curse.

192
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,205
All right. Can we have
some room here, please?

193
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,137
Quite an entourage.

194
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,642
All right, I need to
listen to your lungs.

195
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,739
This wedding is because
of me, you could say.

196
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,407
And now it might not
happen because of me.

197
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,144
- Which is quite a paradox.
- Shh. Baby, baby, baby.

198
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,755
- Don't fret.
- So you're Cupid?

199
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,087
Oh, it's the
basidiomycetes, really...

200
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:58,027
some of which are known to
produce a mating trigger in sows.

201
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:02,067
A sort of porcine
pheromone, if you will.

202
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,103
I don't say I know that
it works on humans...

203
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,672
but a certain
beverage I concocted...

204
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:12,176
was imbibed by Kevin
and Nina the other night...

205
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,874
their eyes met across a
crowded kitchen and voila...

206
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,918
they were like
Abelard and Heloise...

207
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,387
Triston and Isolde,
Pyramus and Thisbe.

208
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,583
- Chest films are back.
- Thank you.

209
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,220
I need to look at these with
Radiology. I'll be back. Come with me.

210
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,923
Well, don't take too
long. Love is fleeting!

211
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,195
He'll be in surgery for a while,
you'll need to come back later.

212
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,204
We got other interviews
we need to do at the station.

213
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,105
- Well, nice seeing you. Again.
- Here. You've been deprived.

214
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,736
Neela. Special delivery.

215
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,276
I'm waiting on a call
from chopper transport.

216
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,919
I'll be in the break
room if you need me.

217
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,056
- What's this all about?
- Hmm? Oh, that's from Doris.

218
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,589
- The malamute breeder?
- I told you about her?

219
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,590
Lucky guess.

220
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,021
Dawn, can you
re-dress my ankle in 3...

221
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,456
and make sure that my NPO
girl is still NPO before we shift her.

222
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,597
- I got it.
- Excuse me.

223
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,292
Hey, Grady, I, uh, got your
STD-Buddhist to take the penicillin.

224
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,368
- Oh, thank God.
- Hi.

225
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,164
Is... Is Dr. Morris around?

226
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,173
- Uh, are you a family member?
- I'm John Carter.

227
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,669
Uh-huh.

228
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,841
- I used to work here.
- Oh.

229
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,139
As what?

230
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,618
Can you find him?
Can you find Dr. Morris?

231
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,848
- He's around somewhere.
- Carter.

232
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,686
You the one that got the nurse
pregnant, and moved up to Seattle?

233
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,859
- No, that was somebody else.
- Sorry, my mistake.

234
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,227
Elixir of love.

235
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,895
My Valentine's Day gift
to the daring among you.

236
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,904
- It looks fecal.
- It works.

237
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,303
As what? A love potion?

238
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:09,507
Puck had a magical mixture made
from a flower called love-in-idleness.

239
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,480
And I've got my mushroom juice.

240
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,144
But didn't that make Titania
fall in love with an ass?

241
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,552
We're all asses, aren't we?

242
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,989
But it was a mistake.

243
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,059
I mean, that's what
the play is about.

244
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,662
It's about mistakes.

245
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:29,227
Perhaps, but without the mistake,
there'd be no play, would there?

246
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,735
So, what now? Are
you done with me?

247
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,170
Well, we found some abnormal
nodules that are concerning.

248
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,869
- Concerning?
- Did you consult a pulmonologist?

249
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,411
Yeah. Anyway, right here...

250
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,582
- Did you order a bronchoscopy?
- What's that?

251
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,912
It's a test where they
look into your lungs.

252
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,713
Thanks, I got this.

253
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,122
We can biopsy and see
what we're dealing with.

254
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,749
20-year-old, heart rate in 60s, went
unconscious and apneic in the rig.

255
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,021
Find Morris. He
should be down the hall.

256
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,564
- Zades. Finally, a familiar face.
- Dr. Carter. How the hell you been?

257
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,065
Not too bad. How about you?

258
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,101
- Same old.
- What happened to this guy?

259
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,796
We're taking a statement.
He started looking bad.

260
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,238
- How long you in town for?
- Uh, it all depends.

261
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,379
- On what?
- A bunch of stuff, actually.

262
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,381
- I wanna do it.
- I... I appreciate that, I do.

263
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,612
I mean, it's... It's very sweet,
but you need to think it through.

264
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,781
- You've explained it all to me.
- It's not like giving blood.

265
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,051
- It's your egg, you really should be...
- Aunt Cate.

266
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,287
Do you remember when I was
15, and I ran off with that guy?

267
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,932
The 25-year-old bartender?

268
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,627
- And I called you from that restaurant.
- Uh, it was a bar.

269
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,234
My parents had no idea.

270
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,300
You and Uncle Russell were
the only adults I could talk to.

271
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,438
You saved me.

272
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,807
I remember driving out
there. Bringing you home.

273
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,679
Cleaning you up.

274
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,083
Getting you into bed.

275
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:04,487
That week I spent with
you, sleeping in Daryl's room.

276
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,166
He must have been about 3.

277
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,832
I was so sad then.

278
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,837
And he was so sweet to me.

279
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,340
I would do anything for you.

280
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,381
- We brought him in as a witness.
- Flexes with painful stim but that's it.

281
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,892
Later he told us he got punched
in the face trying to break it up.

282
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,554
- Tracy, what's the GCS?
- One-one-three-eight-five.

283
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,198
- So, what now?
- Tube.

284
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,530
- Good. Do it.
- Archie Morris, all grown up.

285
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,195
No, way. What
are you doing here?

286
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,171
Some business to take care
of. I'm gonna be in Chicago.

287
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,401
That's great.

288
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,704
- Ready for the etomidate.
- Pushing it.

289
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,008
- Thinking about some shifts.
- That's awesome. This guy, a legend.

290
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,044
We kind of met outside.
- Suction.

291
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,744
You might get better
alignment with a shoulder roll.

292
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,583
Who do I talk to about
getting privileges?

293
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,020
Catherine Banfield, our
chief. She's out there.

294
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,990
- I can see the cords.
- Then go for it.

295
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,591
Looks like you
followed my advice.

296
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,164
- How's that?
- You set the tone.

297
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,667
I'm off to Bloomington.

298
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,502
They're about to cross clamp
the donor's aorta in 40 minutes.

299
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,735
Wow. Joanie in Surgery yet?

300
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,746
No, she's still in Radiology. She
should be heading to the O.R. any minute.

301
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,907
I'll try and catch her
before she goes up.

302
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,609
- What are you looking for?
- Scopolamine patches.

303
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,913
Helicopters make me airsick.

304
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,283
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

305
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,583
You never told me that.

306
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,923
Well, planes are fine, but
helicopters are so jiggly.

307
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,223
Well, that is good to know.

308
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:50,599
Tell me, how do
you feel about boats?

309
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,330
What?

310
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,907
Have a safe flight.

311
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,272
- Hyperventilate at a rate of 26.
- CT can take him now.

312
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,042
- Let's move.
- Left my backboard.

313
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,049
You got the story
right on this guy?

314
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,085
- Yeah, why? MORRIS:
He's in pretty bad shape.

315
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,484
Not your average punch.

316
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,285
Cops took a report, people
saw it happen. Good enough.

317
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,257
Maybe he hit his
head on the way down.

318
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,158
How's he doing? - Not great.

319
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:21,459
Minimally responsive, we had
to put a tube in to breathe for him.

320
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,798
He seems a lot sicker than
he should be from one hit.

321
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,167
- Something's not right here.
- Yeah.

322
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,968
It seems like our uniformed
guy got a little mixed up.

323
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,839
Didn't happen at the club,
happened at the station house.

324
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,275
It did? MALLORY: Yeah.

325
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,848
They brought the
guy in for questioning...

326
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,508
turns out my guys weren't
watching him as closely.

327
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,983
How so?

328
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,419
There was a drunk thug from
Garfield in the holding cell with him.

329
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,856
They had words
and it turned ugly.

330
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,757
- I see.
- It's our fault.

331
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,797
We should have had
better control of the situation.

332
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,596
Well, thanks for the update.
I better go check on him.

333
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,771
I'm gonna give you something to
make your tummy feel better, all right?

334
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,143
I'm telling you,
drink the juice.

335
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,716
- Everybody's doing it.
- Oh, thanks.

336
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,046
But to be honest, this
really doesn't look potable.

337
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,822
- Dr. Carter?
- Hey, Sam. How are you?

338
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,359
- Good.
- You should probably be back in bed.

339
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,123
Why? That's for sick people.

340
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,793
- When did you get here?
- A little while ago.

341
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,300
It's like bizarro ER.

342
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,529
Kind of the same but
everything's different.

343
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,038
Well, one thing never
changes. The patients.

344
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,506
- Dr. Carter. Wow.
- Hello.

345
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,736
Welcome back.

346
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,708
- How are you?
- Didn't see you come in.

347
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,872
- No, I kind of snuck in.
- Hey, how's Kem?

348
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,746
She's good, she's great.
She's in Paris visiting her mom.

349
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,579
Well, how long
are you in town for?

350
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,917
That, uh, is still up in the air.
We're trying to figure that out.

351
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,922
I'm still waiting
on that file, Jerry.

352
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,257
All right, Sam, our migraine lady's
been parked in this hallway since Tuesday.

353
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,594
Mary, shouldn't you be, uh, leaning
against a wall somewhere, smoking?

354
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,967
Dr. Banfield? BANFIELD: Hmm.

355
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,900
- Meet John Carter.
- Hello.

356
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,506
- I've heard a bit about you.
- All good, I hope.

357
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,767
I would love to talk to
you about something.

358
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,035
Pump-flow failed on
the LVAD in radiology.

359
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,611
- BP took a dive.
- It's mom?

360
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,180
Pre-transplant. Neela's on
the way to pick up the heart.

361
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,113
Uh, sorry, Jim. You'll
have to catch me later.

362
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,845
It's John.

363
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,387
- Good, you guys are still here.
- Is he okay?

364
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,892
Yeah, what'd the scan show?

365
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,554
That's what I came to talk to you
about. You see these areas here?

366
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,635
Multiple cerebral contusions as
well as generalized brain edema.

367
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,930
- Is that really bad?
- Yeah, it is.

368
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,301
The radiologist and I are
confused about something.

369
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,566
Hmm. What's that?

370
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,439
The only way to get this
is from multiple blows.

371
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,307
Multiple blows from different
directions, probably from a blunt object.

372
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,485
- You can tell that?
- I don't know details...

373
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,815
but this picture doesn't
match the history I'm getting.

374
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,045
Dr. Morris, eh...

375
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,749
It wouldn't be the first time
something like this happened.

376
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,889
- What are you suggesting?
- Whoever told you this story is lying.

377
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,055
The thing is, Dr. Morris...

378
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,792
I'm the one telling
you the story.

379
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,574
You don't understand,
our patient is herniating.

380
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,940
Yes. As soon as
you can. Thank you.

381
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:24,174
- Neurosurge is in the O.R.
- Yeah, what else is new?

382
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,842
- In another hospital.
- What?

383
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,250
Guy gave me an earful about the
national shortage of neurosurgeons.

384
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,392
They've started double-covering
the Chicago hospitals.

385
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,620
- Is that even legal?
- Systolics 214, pulse is down to 44.

386
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,389
Did he say how long he'd be?

387
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,897
- Couple of hours, at least.
- You're kidding.

388
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,900
- He's gonna die if we wait.
- But we don't have a surgeon.

389
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,402
All right. So let's do it.

390
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,063
No, no, no. We can't.

391
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,573
We don't have training
or the authority to do...

392
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:54,043
What are you gonna do? Stand
here and let the guy herniate and die?

393
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,881
Sterile 8s, a bovie and
a ventriculostomy tray.

394
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,110
Whoa. Are we gonna do
a ventriculostomy? Here?

395
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,653
- It's his only chance.
- I'll get the twist drill.

396
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,654
Ejection fraction
at only 18 percent.

397
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,487
- LVAD's definitely malfunctioning.
- What does that mean?

398
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,891
The device supposed to help
pump the blood isn't working.

399
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,122
Another 80 of Lasix.

400
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,563
Don't you think the
girl should wait outside?

401
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,634
She can handle this. - Fix it.

402
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:21,069
- Can you fix it?
- Lucy, come here.

403
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,637
Look at me. I'm okay.

404
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,110
You don't have to worry.

405
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,114
- Systolic's 49.
- Mom...

406
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,810
- Joanie, we're going to need to intubate.
- Guys.

407
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,853
- I found this in the ICU.
- What is it?

408
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,857
In the event of an electrical failure, the
LVAD is designed to use a hand pump.

409
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,122
- How do you know it's electrical failure?
- I don't. But it's worth a shot.

410
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,830
Give it a minute.

411
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,706
- Good carotid. BANFIELD:
Pulse ox is coming up.

412
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:58,334
Dawn, mix a milrinone infusion. I think
this might hold us till we get to the O.R.

413
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,842
How long you gonna squeeze?

414
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,379
- Until she gets a new heart.
- Gonna be any minute.

415
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,108
So let's get your mum upstairs.

416
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,881
BP's 190/118.

417
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,392
- And...
- What are you doing?

418
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,256
I'm through to the white matter.

419
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,501
Oh, nothing, just
drilling into the brain.

420
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:23,992
Good luck with that.

421
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,229
Catheter. TRACY:
Bradying down to the 30s.

422
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,237
Aim it towards the
medial canthus...

423
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,670
Opposite eye. I know.

424
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,343
Everybody start praying.

425
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,043
How do you know you're
not gonna hit a vessel?

426
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,708
- I don't.
- Or a major structure like the pituitary?

427
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,854
I'm nowhere near a pituitary.

428
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,690
I don't think.

429
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,154
Does the brain feel more
like Jell-O or like butter?

430
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,093
- Tracy, shut up.
- I'm sorry. I mean, I'm nervous.

431
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,532
- Oh, my God. MORRIS:
I believe I am in.

432
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,663
- Is that CSF?
- Yep. Decompress the ventricles.

433
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,330
- Keep the ICP around 15.
- Heart rates up to 58 and climbing.

434
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,340
Recheck pressure.
Tell ICU make room.

435
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,274
Assertive. I like it.

436
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,539
Nice job, Archie.

437
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,609
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

438
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,116
Yeah, I'm fine.

439
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,879
Jerry, is Frank coming in today?

440
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,250
Uh.

441
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,891
Only if I call in sick.

442
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:23,123
No, he's not on till next week,
some family thing in Cleveland.

443
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,422
Uh-oh.

444
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,859
Love is in the air.

445
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,900
- Did someone actually drink that?
- That chocolate soda? Pretty skunky.

446
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:33,039
- No, the bogus fungus water.
- What?

447
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,402
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, all good.

448
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,375
I'm gonna wait for
Dr. Banfield in the lounge.

449
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,070
Mm-hm.

450
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,648
John.

451
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,585
Can I just tell you, you
look great in those jeans.

452
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,055
Thanks.

453
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,091
I know, it feels like the
end of the world today...

454
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,891
but you will be falling for
someone else tomorrow.

455
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,899
Wow. Where'd you
learn that, Parenting 101?

456
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,906
Sorry. I can wait
someplace else.

457
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,406
No, no. Actually you saved me. I'll
get something from the Jumbo Mart.

458
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,135
Alex.

459
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,836
Ugh.

460
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,175
Well, there's another
thing that's different.

461
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,011
- That kid got like a foot taller.
- I know.

462
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,744
He's under the influence
of a bunch of fun hormones.

463
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,583
Well, don't let him drink
whatever Jerry's drinking.

464
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:25,952
Forget it.

465
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,634
So, Sam, what do you
hear from Abby and Luka?

466
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,326
She e-mailed me.

467
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,495
Sounds like it's,
uh, going great.

468
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,535
Great for them.

469
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,638
Can you check status
of the transport team?

470
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:51,147
- I want to know when they get here.
- Yes. I'll call the coordinator.

471
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,013
- It is good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

472
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,350
So you're a popular guy.

473
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:05,729
I worked here a long time.
I've been away a long time.

474
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,834
But I am gonna be in
Chicago sort of indefinitely...

475
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,130
I was hoping to
keep my skills up...

476
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,136
and maybe help you out a little.

477
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,969
- Help us out?
- Pick up a few shifts.

478
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,139
You don't have to
pay me. I work for food.

479
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,009
Mm-hm.

480
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,817
- So you were an Attending here?
- Yeah.

481
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,850
What have you been
doing since you left?

482
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,388
Working in Africa. Darfur,
mostly at an IDP camp there.

483
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,049
I spent some time in
Indonesia after the tsunami.

484
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,387
Really?

485
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,156
So now you're ready to
come back to the real world?

486
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,995
Well, that felt pretty real to me out
there, but yeah, you could say that.

487
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,566
I know there's a lot of
re-learning required...

488
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,730
and if you're not
fully invested in it.

489
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:53,038
I don't know how long I'll be in
Chicago, how many shifts I can pick up...

490
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,046
but I do know patients that
come through those doors...

491
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:59,379
and I know quite a
bit of your personnel.

492
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,385
And I know not to use
the snack machine on 3...

493
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,854
and how to get to the clinic
without going outside in winter...

494
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,051
and the bottom right hand-drawer
of the admit desk sticks...

495
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:12,096
unless you brace it with
the bottom of your foot.

496
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,893
I wasted a lot of money
in that snack machine.

497
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,039
Not anymore.

498
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,066
So tell me, when did
you first work here?

499
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:27,068
I was a med student
in the ER in 1994.

500
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,080
- You know Mark Greene, then.
- Yeah.

501
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,151
I knew Mark Greene. Yep.

502
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,650
I learned a lot from him.

503
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,450
When can you start?

504
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,130
- Is he gonna be all right?
- No.

505
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,465
- What you guys did, I thought...
- Well, we probably saved his life.

506
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:55,107
But there's no way to
know if he'll ever wake up...

507
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,834
be able to talk or
understand anything.

508
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,308
You know. I can tell you know.

509
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,971
- Know what?
- Don't do that.

510
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,351
I can tell when
something's bothering you.

511
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,158
It was like I froze. I
didn't know what to do.

512
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,453
When? What happened?

513
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:19,030
They took this guy
into interrogation.

514
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,326
I stayed at the desk
filling out some forms.

515
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,595
I go back there and there's
three of them tuning him up good.

516
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,001
- Three cops?
- I see them through the window.

517
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,165
So, what do I do? Go in there
and tell them to give it a break?

518
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,709
Get somebody else involved? No.

519
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,847
I walk away. Come
back 10 minutes later.

520
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,539
By then he's moaning on
the ground, crying for help.

521
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,878
Eventually, they
let me call 911.

522
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,281
Did you tell Detective Mallory?

523
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,989
I didn't have to, because
he was in there with them.

524
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,484
Okay, you can't just bury this.

525
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,790
What am I supposed to do?
I'm the new guy, I follow orders.

526
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:55,799
I wouldn't even be there
if he hadn't backed me up.

527
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,368
You can't just let this go.

528
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,071
- You don't get it.
- No, I do.

529
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,706
Things happen, deal with it.

530
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,306
You mean ignore it?

531
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,578
There's a code on the job,
you don't turn on your own.

532
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,215
That's something you
never come back from.

533
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,181
Walk in, there are 20
surgeons in the room...

534
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,324
all picking up
organs for recipients.

535
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,356
Dr. Robbin steps up,
takes her scalpel...

536
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,586
- Dr. Robbins?
- The transplant attending.

537
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,994
She whips out the heart like
it's no big deal, holds it up...

538
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:31,102
inspects it for a minute, then says
to the room "Looks good, thanks."

539
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,263
Thirty seconds later we're back
up in the air like superheroes.

540
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,600
Well, you kind of are.

541
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,676
I don't know if I could do
transplant surgeries full-time...

542
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,176
but this is kind of high.

543
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,008
- Robbins wants your butt in here.
- Okay. Coming.

544
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,183
- Are you off shift now?
- Yeah.

545
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,081
Uh, but I'll wait with
Lucy until you're done.

546
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,146
Adson with teeth.

547
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,056
Dr. Rasgotra, you're
missing all the fun.

548
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,857
SVC, IVC are done,
saved the aorta for you.

549
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,557
- Wow, are you sure? ROBBINS:
My 8-year old could do it.

550
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:06,103
Most important thing is to cut the great
vessels as close to the heart as you can.

551
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,900
That way we have tissue to
work with when we're sewing.

552
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,543
Okay. Scissors.

553
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,942
- Ready?
- Less talk, more action.

554
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,581
Okay. Uh...

555
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,478
- The aorta is divided.
- Take it out.

556
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,155
- The heart?
- No, the kidney.

557
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,315
Yes, the big, dead organ you
disconnected from circulation.

558
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,119
Bloomington wants a doctor.

559
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:32,060
Tell them it's going fine. Pick
it up with a clamp and pull.

560
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,222
Dr. Robbins, they
need to speak with you.

561
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,261
<i>Voila.</i>

562
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,928
They say we need to stop the
transplant, there's been a mistake.

563
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,315
Go ahead and discharge but
make sure you do phone follow-up.

564
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,186
All right. Gotta go. Thanks.

565
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,589
Lucy.

566
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,663
Are you done? NEELA: No.

567
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,833
- Is the new heart in yet?
- What's going on?

568
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,663
I, uh...

569
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,170
Do you know what
a blood type is?

570
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,833
Sort of.

571
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,042
Your mom is a type O...

572
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,783
which means she can only
get a heart from another O.

573
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,150
There was a mistake at
the Bloomington hospital.

574
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:40,424
The donor's blood type
was mislabeled. She's an A.

575
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,568
If we'd put that heart in your
mom, she would have died.

576
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:52,911
Fortunately, they found
out before it was too late.

577
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,445
Your mom will get
a new heart, Lucy.

578
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:02,313
So, what now? We, uh... We
re-implant the LVAD and then we wait?

579
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,046
Well, the thing is...

580
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,256
The thing is, we didn't
learn of the mistake...

581
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,589
until we had already
taken out the old heart.

582
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,255
Your mom's on a
cardiac bypass machine.

583
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:18,164
She needs to stay on it
until we find her a new heart.

584
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,172
- She can't talk?
- No.

585
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,079
But she'll know you're there.

586
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,031
Any changes?

587
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,262
Well, his intracranial pressure is
still spiking, it's not a good sign.

588
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:58,099
As I'm sure you're both aware,
I'm required by law to report this.

589
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,300
Report what?

590
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,776
Whenever the history
doesn't match the injury...

591
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,438
we need to follow protocols.

592
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,743
- You know the drill.
- I don't think I do.

593
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,751
I've sent scalp
lavage fluid to the lab...

594
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,583
where pathologists will
look for substances...

595
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,555
fibers that could perhaps
help fill in the blanks.

596
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,093
- You know, standard procedure.
- I see.

597
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,493
And of course I'll need to
notify the state authorities...

598
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,728
start an official investigation.

599
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:30,572
- What do you think you're doing, doctor?
- My job.

600
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,845
See that game last night?

601
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:46,115
The Bulls were really, uh,
shooting from outside the paint.

602
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,989
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Me, either. Basketball banter.

603
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,959
Just trying to
approximate guy talk.

604
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,828
Well, thanks for trying.

605
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,101
Women. Can't live with
them, can't shoot them.

606
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,102
Look, I'm no expert...

607
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:05,608
but if I've learned one thing it's
you get your heart stomped on...

608
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,680
it's best to take all that energy and
channel it into something positive.

609
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,121
Hi, Lucy.

610
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,158
Your foster dad's not here yet?

611
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,795
It's okay.

612
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,693
I want to say good night
to my mom before I go.

613
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,199
Well, she should be
settled upstairs soon.

614
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,398
I always knew she wasn't my mom.

615
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,144
I found a picture of another
lady in a hospital bed...

616
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,976
holding me when I was a baby.

617
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,541
So I figured it out.

618
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,915
You're a very smart little girl.

619
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,658
It never bothered me.

620
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,819
Because she always loved me so
much, and made me feel so happy.

621
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,166
And I knew that's
what a real mother did...

622
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,500
even if she's not your real mom.

623
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,606
Mr. Lempel, what are you doing?

624
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,007
If we hold the ceremony in
the next hour, we'll beat sunset.

625
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,239
- You can't leave now.
- Why, am I dying?

626
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,906
- No, you're not dying.
- That's fantastic.

627
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:22,521
Stupendous. All the more
reason to start celebrating.

628
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,782
But your bronchoscopy showed
a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

629
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,619
It's an immune reaction
to fungal spores.

630
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,921
- Mushroom worker's lung.
- You've heard of it?

631
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,621
Of course I've heard of it. Pleurotus
cornucopiae is a likely culprit.

632
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,700
I knew it was just
a matter of time.

633
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,900
Gentleman, lady,
thank you very much.

634
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:47,034
This place is nowhere
near as bad as its reputation.

635
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,376
Wait. You need to
stay and be treated.

636
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,982
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

637
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,482
I don't know why you
need me to tell you this...

638
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:58,214
but, uh, the only definitive treatment
for mushroom worker's lung...

639
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,950
is to stay away from mushrooms.

640
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,992
And that, my friends,
is not an option.

641
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,764
You'd rather have lung disease
than stay away from mushrooms?

642
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,959
If mushrooms be the
food of love, play on.

643
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:21,105
<i>If we shadows have offended,
Say but this and all is mended</i>

644
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,647
- What was that?
- Sorry?

645
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,616
Why you pull that stunt? Put
the squeeze on him like that?

646
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,949
To see that the
right thing happens.

647
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,852
I was gonna tell him, handle it.

648
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,324
- Well, it didn't seem like that.
- Ha, now you wanna judge me?

649
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,759
- I'm trying to help.
- Well, stop.

650
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,467
Last thing I need is them
knowing I opened up my mouth.

651
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:50,441
Just the two I was looking for.

652
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,942
Dr. Morris, it turns out,
there was an incident...

653
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:58,049
that some of the guys didn't feel
they wanted to be up-front about.

654
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,478
It's being dealt with now.

655
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,051
- Dealt with?
- Mm-hm.

656
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,518
The officers involved will be
disciplined, maybe even prosecuted.

657
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,456
We can't abide that kind of
infraction. Can we, Detective Diaz?

658
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,824
- No, sir. MALLORY:
I appreciate your help.

659
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,056
Make sure to get
you a report so that...

660
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,463
your records can accurately
reflect the cause of injury.

661
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,972
Okay. Thank you.

662
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,311
So you got any shifts
you want me to work?

663
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,547
Banfield said yes?

664
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,884
- Took a little persuading.
- Oh, she's no pushover.

665
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,720
- I'll be around.
- That's great, man.

666
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,327
You seem good.

667
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,824
Thanks for showing me
how to tube the effusion.

668
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,830
No problem. Check
a film in an hour...

669
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,832
and call me if the
fluid reaccumulates.

670
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,403
Grasshopper, the student
has become the teacher.

671
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,563
I heard you were lurking about.

672
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,902
- How have you been?
- Oh, I've had better days.

673
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,840
I hear the Carter
Center is opening.

674
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,503
Had a few setbacks but
official opening, a few weeks.

675
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,275
Congratulations. You
and Kem must be so proud.

676
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,511
Yeah. So I'll be around,
I'll buy you a cup of coffee...

677
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,366
- and tell you tales of Africa.
- I look forward to hearing them.

678
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:17,685
From Dr. Brenner.
John. John! Call me.

679
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:41,568
Uh, what are you doing?
It's freezing out here.

680
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:49,514
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I think I
just called you my sweet idiot.

681
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,513
Simon, what are we doing here?

682
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,278
This is the closest that
we've got to a canal for now.

683
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,683
But I am determined...
So determined to do better.

684
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,022
- What's this?
- That's an IOU.

685
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:05,429
We take a week off in April...

686
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:11,001
and the spring, as you know, is
the perfect time to visit Venice.

687
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:16,099
- You wanna go to Venice?
- Yeah.

688
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,435
With you.

689
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,241
- Grappa?
- Okay.

690
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,746
All right. I think this qualifies
as a romantic gesture.

691
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,586
Yes. No, this is nothing.
This is just the beginning.
