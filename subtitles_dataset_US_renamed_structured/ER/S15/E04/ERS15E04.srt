1
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:12,075
You don't wanna see me, fine.
But you still have to teach me.

3
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,944
Well, for that to be possible, my dear,
you'd have to have the ability to learn.

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,780
So in order to get to the next
level, each intern will get a mentor.

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,422
How'd your respiratory
physiology exam go?

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,182
Ugh, I think I flunked it.

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,920
You're a good mother, this is important
to you and something you should do.

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:32,089
One day you will wake up next to me
and wonder, "How did this happen?"

9
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,929
You're a cocky bastard.

10
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:42,933
Frank.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,011
Her abdomen's
covered in abscesses.

12
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,840
So much for the
Tijuana tummy tuck.

13
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,347
Tell us you're wearing
something underneath that.

14
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,576
- Wanna see for yourself?
- I don't approve...

15
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,620
- of ER personnel wearing costumes.
- Kids seem to like it.

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,552
Yes, but what adult wants
to get a cancer diagnosis...

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,455
- from a reject from <i>Animal House.</i>
- I'm Julius Caesar.

18
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,926
We'll drain under CT
guidance to avoid surgery.

19
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,895
Going to Kayson's talk on
recurrent pericardial effusions?

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,694
Since when do
you go to lectures?

21
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,598
- I'll save you a seat.
- Don't bother.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,450
- Hi, Dr. Brenner.
- Nice legs, Frank.

23
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,767
You gave me some
great tips on our last shift.

24
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,466
I'm glad we're working together.

25
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,736
Dr. Gates won't
be mentoring today.

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,903
- I won't?
- You get to do the culture list.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,948
All positive cultures from last
week. Wounds, urine, sputum.

28
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,278
Make sure they're on
appropriate antibiotics.

29
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,650
- Call them if they have a resistant bug.
- Great, I'm on pus patrol.

30
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,324
- So I won't seeing patients?
- You get to do that too.

31
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,950
Just stick with the non-criticals.
Dr. Brenner will mentor you both.

32
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,621
Dr. Banfield, I've already done
a rotation, so maybe I can skip?

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,258
You're an intern. Being
mentored is part of the process.

34
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,895
Dr. Morris, Tracy
Martin is with you.

35
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,975
- Where is Dr. Martin?
- Not in yet.

36
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,306
Oh, I hate working on Halloween.
It's always the same thing.

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,971
Got the idiot who slices
his hand carving a pumpkin.

38
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,310
Your shoes end up
covered in candy-corn puke.

39
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,943
Let's not forget the old chestnut:
sloppy drunk dressed as Frankenstein.

40
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,114
Halloween is new to me. I
didn't celebrate it in Australia.

41
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,317
- You never been trick-or-treating?
- Nope.

42
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,655
No candy, no costumes,
no mischief night?

43
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,922
What's mischief night?

44
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:14,125
Kids soap up windows,
egg cars, tp front lawns.

45
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,963
You were one deprived child.

46
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,368
Michael Leary, 18, stab
wound in the chest. School fight.

47
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,873
- Is that a fork?
- Vitals are good, sats 97 on room air.

48
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,810
- Stupid little dude went crazy.
- Okay, Trauma One. Let's go.

49
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:31,307
I'm sorry I'm late. This costume
is almost impossible to walk in.

50
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,319
Dr. Martin. Care to explain?

51
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,349
I was told that all the interns
were supposed to dress up?

52
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,060
You were misinformed.

53
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,398
Breath sounds equal.
Let's get some access.

54
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,270
- Mm-hm. I'm on it.
- He snuck up on me.

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,472
- Need some help?
- His pants need to come off.

56
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,343
If I'd seen him... Did you
tell her to take off my pants?

57
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,814
Yep. LEARY: Oh, go for it.

58
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,976
Surgery's on the way.

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,918
Laverne.

60
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,520
- Nice new 'do.
- Thanks. I like to change it up.

61
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,025
- Okay, Dr. St. John, what's next?
- Plain films and ultrasound.

62
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,254
- Good idea.
- It is?

63
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:21,334
- I mean, you think it is?
- Yeah. Get the machine.

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,499
Oh, the needle's at too steep
an angle. Try 45 degrees.

65
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,936
Okay.

66
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,645
- I... I got a flash.
- Nice. Here, I'll tape it up for you.

67
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,786
Oh, shoot. Shoot. Sorry.

68
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:43,481
- "Intra-operative hypotension"?
- For my nurse anesthetist program.

69
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,752
- I have a big test tomorrow.
- School sucks, huh?

70
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,221
You're learning to push
drugs for an anesthesiologist?

71
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,229
I'll be able to
administer them myself.

72
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,858
Yeah, but a real anesthesiologist
will be watching over your shoulder.

73
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,561
Actually, no.

74
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,039
How do you go to
classes, work full time...

75
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,801
raise a kid and have a life?

76
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,308
Ha, ha, ha. When you put it
like that, it sounds like a lot.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
- Good luck with that.
- Thank you. I'm gonna need it.

78
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:13,551
Nonsense. A year from now, Sam'll
be running her own cases in the O.R.

79
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,385
- You need something?
- Oh, yes.

80
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,686
I wanna thank you for turning
in your schedule request on time.

81
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,524
- My pleasure.
- Yes, but I'm a little surprised.

82
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,031
You opened up your work
availability considerably.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,169
I'm just trying to
be a team player.

84
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,165
Good. Then maybe you can
be in charge of scheduling...

85
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,275
- guest speakers for grand rounds.
- Me?

86
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,844
Figure out someone good to
start off with. We have no money.

87
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,341
You'll have to use your charm.

88
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,213
See that? The lung's
inflating at the pleural interface.

89
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,222
That's impressive, doctor.

90
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,724
- Radiology elective.
- That was smart.

91
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,828
Hello, all.

92
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,457
Hi, I'm Dr. Wade. I'm a surgeon.

93
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,534
- I still can't get used to sound of that.
- Get used to it.

94
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,661
Okay, Daria, why
don't you do the honors.

95
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:07,899
- Okay. Fork versus chest. Waiting on CT.
- Rule out vascular involvement.

96
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,566
- Maybe the pectoralis major.
- Pectoralis major. Good.

97
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,406
- Vitals? Crits?
- Fine. Stable.

98
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,979
- Dinner later?
- Mazzarino's.

99
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,776
One gram of Ancef,
page when the CT's done.

100
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,749
Sam, uh, we got a kid out
here with a bloody nose.

101
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,354
Okay.

102
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,850
Uh, well, you two
are certainly in sync.

103
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,124
Yeah, what can I
say? It's chemical.

104
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,165
Ha. You missed me.

105
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,929
Mrs. Ferreri, you can pick
up prescriptions in the ER.

106
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,939
- You're not gonna believe...
- Frank. Give these to Banfield.

107
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,475
- Tell her they're all susceptible.
- Okay. Morris...

108
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,637
Also, could you, uh, get me a new
clip for, uh, my ID? This one's broken.

109
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,838
Fine.

110
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,416
Banfield got some more
positive cultures for you.

111
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,180
She wants you to see she
sore-throat kid in Exam Three.

112
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,015
All hail Caesar.

113
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,751
Morris, you gotta see
the guy in Curtain Three.

114
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,015
Frankenstein? Great,
just like I called it.

115
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,260
You need to see him now.

116
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,456
In a minute. I've just
gotta make a phone...

117
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,295
Okay, don't get
your toga in a bunch.

118
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,471
Laverne, look at this.

119
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,830
See any fracture?

120
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,636
Um, no, I don't.

121
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,878
Yeah, me either.
But, uh, look here.

122
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,639
Posterior fat pad sign.

123
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,910
That means there's blood
in the joint from a fracture.

124
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,954
Listen, I've been wanting to talk to y...
- Dr. Brenner.

125
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,492
It's Danny Raskin, 14. Persistent
nose bleed. His brother, Scott.

126
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,719
He got in a fight.

127
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,228
School nurse couldn't get it to
stop. Complained of nausea in the rig.

128
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,128
That's probably from
swallowing blood.

129
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,304
Fork boy's going up to CT.

130
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,934
You know him?

131
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,913
Not really. Classmate.

132
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,845
- Did the school call your parents?
- It's just our mom.

133
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:00,351
They tried, they couldn't
get her. It's okay, I'm here.

134
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,888
I'm sorry, but we need to get ahold
of her before we can treat Danny.

135
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,687
Okay. Scott, I'll take you to the
phone. You can try your mom again.

136
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,890
You don't look like
the fighting type.

137
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,665
I guess I'm not.

138
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,735
Princess Jenny, open wide.
Tilt your head back a little bit.

139
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,203
- No fever.
- Yeah, but white spots on the tonsils.

140
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,171
- Dawn, any emesis basins?
- Try the second drawer.

141
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,171
And swollen glands.

142
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,942
- Could it be strep?
- You'll need a dose of penicillin.

143
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,950
- We will?
- No, let's do a rapid strep test first.

144
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,951
She's got exudate
and lymphadenopathy.

145
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,090
Don't wanna give
unnecessary antibiotics.

146
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,987
I'll get the swab.

147
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,725
There's a positive blood culture
from a week ago at the front desk.

148
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,696
Grab it, take it to Medical
Records and hunt down a chart.

149
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,734
I'm with a trauma, got six
other patients. Send your intern.

150
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,930
Don't have one today. No point
sending a doctor on a no-brainer.

151
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,802
All right, Your
Highness. All done.

152
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,409
I need this? GATES: Nope.

153
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,601
Sure, no problem.

154
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,508
- Should have the results in 20 minutes.
- All right.

155
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,716
Dr. Livingstone, I presume?

156
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,248
What you got here?

157
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,289
Birds aren't allowed in the ER.

158
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,889
- Oh, but he...
- It's okay.

159
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,896
I don't think this wild animal's
gonna give us any trouble.

160
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,901
Left another message for Mom.

161
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,266
Here, if you throw up,
throw up in that, okay?

162
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,737
So, Danny, how'd
you get in a fight?

163
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,611
There's this guy at school.

164
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,974
He's been saying stuff about our mom.
- What kind of stuff?

165
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,743
I don't understand all
of it, but I know it's bad.

166
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,283
I told you not to listen. Huh?

167
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,080
Staph aureus sensitivities.

168
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,315
Well, they're always pointing
and laughing at me in the halls.

169
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,553
It's because he's a jerk, man.
They just like picking on younger kids.

170
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,360
Got it. Thanks.

171
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,960
That's a marker for inducible
clindamycin resistance.

172
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,767
You should check to
see if the lab did a D test.

173
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,372
Daria, stop being so smart.
You're gonna make me look bad.

174
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,133
Daria, get some 2x2s.

175
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,811
So, what happened at lunch?

176
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:11,474
Well, I asked him why he
was talking about my mom.

177
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,552
He just laughed and
called her a name.

178
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,622
You don't need to
know this. Just fix him.

179
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,385
So I got mad and I
hit him with a food tray.

180
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,619
He grabbed me and
his friends piled on.

181
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,163
I don't remember after that.

182
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,672
- Low-grade fever, 100.6.
- Give her 15 per kilo acetaminophen.

183
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,477
You, uh, tame any
wild lions today, buddy?

184
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,212
Um, Owen doesn't
like to talk much lately.

185
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,081
He's been having a hard
time since their father and I...

186
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,312
I see.

187
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:52,050
My ex moved out of state with his
younger pregnant wife, Veronica.

188
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,887
I hate Veronica.

189
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,756
Did that bird just talk?

190
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,228
Uh, the therapist thought
Trevor would be good for Owen.

191
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,062
- Might help him express his feelings.
- Trevor is very expressive.

192
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,534
- Where is she? I don't wanna miss this.
- Maybe in surgery.

193
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,571
She here yet? BOTH: No.

194
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,437
Tell her it's a perfed ulcer.
That'll get her down fast.

195
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,942
- Archie, where's Neela?
- Paged her again.

196
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,581
She's here. Quick, act natural.

197
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,843
Morris, you can't keep paging
me every five minutes. What is it?

198
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,544
Very, very sick patient
in Curtain Three.

199
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,590
He doesn't look that sick. He's
walking around. What's his complaint?

200
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,249
Uh, he's... He's turning green.

201
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,737
Hello. I'm, uh, Dr. Rasgotra.
How can I help you?

202
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:38,963
Mm.

203
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,939
- Neck hurt.
- Mm-hm. I see. And, uh, anything else?

204
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,606
Need brain transplant.

205
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,750
Sir, this is an ER...

206
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,820
with real patients who are
sick and who need our help.

207
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,422
Hey, roomie.

208
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,918
You bastard.

209
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,328
Oh, my God. Oh.

210
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,091
Could've told us
you were coming.

211
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,634
Miss the surprised look
on your faces? No chance.

212
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,101
- You in town long?
- Yeah, we should all go out.

213
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:16,209
I'm only here for one night for the
annual rehab medicine assembly.

214
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,277
So you working at
an ER down south?

215
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,243
I left emergency
medicine, actually.

216
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,875
I'm doing a residency in PM and R.
Physical medicine and rehabilitation.

217
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,385
- And you like it?
- Yeah, I do.

218
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:32,051
I get to work with traumatic
brain and spinal cord injuries...

219
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,217
um, stroke patients, amputees.

220
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:39,964
And it keeps me on my toes.
Well, make that carbon-fiber toes.

221
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,431
Well, it's good to see
you up and around.

222
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,297
Thanks.

223
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,411
- Ray.
- Hey.

224
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,637
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

225
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,443
Okay, people, I'm sure
you all have work to do.

226
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,179
Gates, Sam, there's a hand injury
in Exam 2 that needs attention.

227
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,813
- Ray, good to see you.
- You too.

228
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,482
See you around.

229
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,788
We'll talk later. Neela,
don't let this guy get away.

230
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,090
- Uh, who's that?
- Uh, new chief of the ER.

231
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,291
- Another one?
- Mm-hm.

232
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,494
- How many does that make?
- I've lost count.

233
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,801
- You wanna head over to Kayson's talk?
- Oh, yeah, the talk. Uh, I can't.

234
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:26,140
- I hear it's gonna be pretty good.
- Yeah, no doubt. I'm, uh, busy.

235
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,344
- Well, um, if you wanna, you should go.
- No, I don't. I mean, I can't.

236
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,011
Okay. All right. Well,
I'll, uh... I'll fill you in later.

237
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,023
Guess who's in charge of the
ER's new teaching conferences.

238
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,216
- Really?
- Yeah.

239
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,862
I've invited Atul Gawande
to speak at grand rounds.

240
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,692
He's, uh, far too busy.
You'll never get him.

241
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,825
A bottle of
champagne says I will.

242
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,241
Hi. I'm Ray Barnett.

243
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,243
Oh, sorry. Uh, this is Simon
Brenner, the new attending.

244
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,711
This is, uh, Ray,
used to work here.

245
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,816
Ah.

246
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,750
So...

247
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,891
So you've been lucky enough to
work with the brilliant Dr. Rasgotra.

248
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,757
I've had that privilege, yes.

249
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,322
So where are you practicing now?

250
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,865
Baton Rouge.

251
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,227
Baton Rouge. I hear it's nice.

252
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,904
Oh.

253
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,603
Neela, I will catch you
later. Ray, great to meet you.

254
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,509
- Right back at you.
- All right.

255
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,774
- If you need to go to Kayson's...
- No, I don't.

256
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,681
But I've got some work to
finish off. It won't take long.

257
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,651
All right, I'll come with you.

258
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,858
- So that Brenner guy?
- Mm-hm.

259
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,256
Kind of seems like a dick.

260
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,124
- I think my wife put glue in there.
- Your wife? Why would she do that?

261
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,430
Well, she says I love
bowling more than I love her.

262
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,469
And, uh, well, ha, I got
a girlfriend on the side.

263
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,641
Hey, I heard you might
have a good teaching case.

264
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,409
Oh, a sports injury, huh? Hi.
- Yeah.

265
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,211
- Hi. GATES: Got
tingling in the thumb.

266
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,082
Numbness in the fingers.
What do you make of that?

267
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,985
Oh, uh, median nerve
neuropraxia from hyperextension.

268
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,093
Nice. What about
motor and reflex deficits?

269
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,922
Wrist extensors...

270
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,297
Biceps. No.

271
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,630
Brachioradialis. Oh,
folks, she was so close.

272
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,469
- Can I give another four of morphine?
- Yeah. Morphine fine, amphetamine fat.

273
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,570
Morphine overdose gives
you fine, constricted pupils.

274
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,681
Amphetamine gives
you fat dilated pupils.

275
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,113
It's a mnemonic. Might
help you with your test.

276
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,775
A mnemonic is a saying to
remember complicated facts.

277
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,013
Yeah, I know what a mnemonic is.

278
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,317
And I also know what morphine
does without some stupid saying.

279
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,485
Sam, that mom
you called is here.

280
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,788
Ha. I gotta go.

281
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,004
- Uh, Mrs. Raskin?
- Oh, Sandy Raskin.

282
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,764
Hi, I'm Sam.

283
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,807
Uh, Dr. Brenner,
this is Danny's mom.

284
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,969
- How's my son?
- Anxious to see you.

285
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,175
Wow, finally.

286
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,685
Couldn't check my messages until
break. You know how it gets at work.

287
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,323
We're gonna need your
consent to pack Danny's nose.

288
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,983
Sure, sure, whatever he needs.

289
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,323
- Honey, how did this happen?
- It was nothing.

290
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,829
No, he's in the hospital,
Scott. That's not nothing.

291
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,632
I'm sorry. My aim's not so good.

292
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,207
It's okay. Happens all the time.

293
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,004
Danny. Danny, are you all right?

294
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,248
My head hurts.

295
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,212
Okay. Sam, get a blood pressure.

296
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,048
Did the other kid hit
him with anything?

297
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,485
- I don't know. I wasn't there.
- Did he fall? Hit his head?

298
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,421
He's hypertensive, 138 over 89.

299
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:03,859
Let's move him. Surgical
consult, 25 of mannitol.

300
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,558
Ms. Hoffman's Vanco trough is 6.4.
Should we keep her on a gram q. 12?

301
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,328
Push her levels to 15.
Change it to 1.5 q. 12...

302
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,234
and repeat the
trough with third dose.

303
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,932
So how are you
liking rehab residency?

304
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,237
Well, it's not always
fun, but it's rewarding.

305
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,678
I've gotten involved with the
academy's Injured Soldier Task Force.

306
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,717
We facilitate access to care
for wounded soldiers and vets.

307
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,376
- That doesn't sound easy.
- Yeah.

308
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,115
Especially when you're working with
the VA and the Defense Department.

309
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,852
I hope my surprise visit isn't
wrecking any of your big plans tonight.

310
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:39,294
Well, if you consider working out
and doing laundry big plans, then...

311
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,629
Neela, Anspaugh was gonna do a
laparotomy on that abscess patient.

312
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,738
- Went with your plan instead. Good job.
- Thanks, Marisol.

313
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:51,970
I'm, uh, done in about 20 minutes.
We can sit, grab some coffee.

314
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,113
- No, let's work out.
- Really?

315
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,112
Yeah, it'll be good
after traveling all day.

316
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,649
Find me when you're done.

317
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,583
Uh, wait. Wait. You
haven't got a good seal.

318
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,719
What? What are you smiling at?

319
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,155
Ha.

320
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,423
Nothing.

321
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,863
Okay.

322
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,634
Sorry about this. The
lab lost the first specimen.

323
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,997
They won't lose this one?

324
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,662
I'll hand it to them, stand
there while they run it.

325
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,173
We need this room, so go out in
the lobby and wait for the results.

326
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,141
How long will that
be? It's Halloween.

327
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,577
Candy at the desk.
The kids can stop there.

328
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,649
Time to put Trevor in his cage.

329
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,979
- Owen.
- I'll take care of this.

330
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,090
Take her to Waiting.

331
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,492
- There you are. You want some?
- Ooh. No, thanks.

332
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,498
I still remember what
County coffee tastes like.

333
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,170
You look great,
man. How are things?

334
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,037
I still have a few more operations
in my future, but nothing like before.

335
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:08,178
I was in for a skin graft
when I heard about Greg.

336
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,452
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

337
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,327
Hey, everybody understood.

338
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,227
You doing okay?

339
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:26,302
I miss him, it sucks, but,
you know, what can you do?

340
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:34,304
I gotta say, the way you walk on
those prosthetics, pretty amazing.

341
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,820
Well, I got some custom foot modules.
Makes it easier to move and climb stairs.

342
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:45,891
You know, sometimes when I wake
up, I actually forget what happened...

343
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,062
and I jump out of bed
and wind up on the floor.

344
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,696
Ha.

345
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:55,032
- Sorry, that's not funny.
- Yeah. Yeah, actually it is, every time.

346
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,870
Oh, um, Dr. Morris,
have you seen Dr. Gates?

347
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,529
No. Do you need something?

348
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,538
Yeah, I just got a
question on a knee effusion.

349
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,714
I'm sure Dr. Brenner
can answer that.

350
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:08,079
It's okay. I'll just...
I'll wait for Tony.

351
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,749
- So, Neela, she's doing good, huh?
- Dude, Neela is a surgery superstar.

352
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,354
She's gonna be running
the department one day.

353
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,990
They must be working her hard.

354
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,289
Lots of long hours, nights, weekends.
I mean, that can't be too much fun.

355
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,590
Dr. Morris, the D-stick
on your ballet dancer is 34.

356
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,063
Okay. I gotta run.

357
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,101
If I don't see you before you
leave, take care of yourself.

358
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:35,640
Oh, and, uh, no, Ray. As far as I
know, Neela's not seeing anyone.

359
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,778
What? No, no,
no. See, I wasn't...

360
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:46,015
Owen! Owen!

361
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,586
I know Trevor's smart, but I doubt he
opened that door and flew down here.

362
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,525
Come on, let's go.

363
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,531
Oh.

364
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,634
Don't worry, I'm gonna call the front
desk and someone will come let us out.

365
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,242
Wild Kingdom, I don't suppose
you have a cell phone on you?

366
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,511
Help! Hey!

367
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,621
CT can take him in five minutes.

368
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,281
I just don't understand why Danny
would be in a fight. It's not like him.

369
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,688
Put him on the portable.

370
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,193
Maybe he didn't like
hearing all the rumors, Mom.

371
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,799
- What rumors? What's this about?
- My intern will go with him.

372
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,526
Where you going? - I'm off.

373
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,331
Call Dubenko as soon as Neurosurge
reads the films. This is their case now.

374
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,873
- Hey, um, do you guys need help in here?
- You're a little late.

375
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,600
Scott, what rumors?

376
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,111
Like you really can't think of any
reason kids are talking about you?

377
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,608
- Are you stupid or just drunk?
- Just calm down.

378
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,310
You're not helping your brother.

379
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,956
There's Mike. Maybe
he can explain it to you.

380
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,832
- What's he have to do with this?
- Go ask. You're banging him.

381
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,413
Okay. How does "to the
zoo and back" sound?

382
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,484
Sounds good, but
it's about four miles.

383
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,851
Well, these babies can
take it. Afraid you can't?

384
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,725
Okay. Last one
there buys dinner.

385
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,419
Better get your wallet out.

386
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,528
Ready?

387
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,432
All right. You "ready" ready?

388
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,052
Hey, Danny, hang in there.
- Tired.

389
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:11,288
The CT showed a subdural
hematoma over the right parietal area.

390
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,796
- What does that mean?
- Sats only 93.

391
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,435
Blood putting pressure
on the surface of his brain.

392
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,642
Get a non-rebreather.

393
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,295
It needs to be cleaned out
to prevent further damage.

394
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,840
Can you spare an intern?
Dr. Banfield's doing a pleural tap.

395
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,843
- Laverne can go. It'll be good experience.
- Are you sure?

396
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,571
You go. You've earned it.

397
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,511
Scott, tell me what
happened. Now.

398
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,577
Danny attacked Mike because
he was bragging all over school...

399
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,188
- about what an easy lay you are.
- Mike wouldn't.

400
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,087
What, you think he is in love with
you or something? He's using you.

401
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,094
Pulse ox is only 87.

402
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,626
He's hypoventilating,
needs a tube.

403
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,030
- Danny, breathe. Breathe.
- What's going on?

404
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,660
Daria, you're up, 15
etomidate, 75 of sux.

405
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,932
- Already drawn, pushing.
- MAC 2 and a 6-O.

406
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,167
Always check the
equipment before you start.

407
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,675
- How could you?
- You ready?

408
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,710
Yeah. MIKE: I
didn't say anything.

409
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,541
Watch the teeth.

410
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,880
- I can't see the cords.
- Here's some suction.

411
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,253
Your freak kid attacked me.
- Don't say that.

412
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,981
Mom, get out. Danny needs you.

413
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,025
Know what? You're nothing
but a crazy drunk whore anyway.

414
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,526
What do you want, man?

415
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,563
Stop! Stop! Stop!

416
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,795
Pull out and bag
him up. I'll be back.

417
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,282
Scott! DARIA: He needs a cord.

418
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,836
- Pull the blade upward.
- I am.

419
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,371
No, you're rocking it back.

420
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,475
- Dr. Brenner, I can't get it!
- Watch out. The tube.

421
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:34,011
- Wait, I thought you just said...
- Tube. Give me the tube.

422
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,677
You don't need a mnemonic
to save someone's airway.

423
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:48,717
Hey!

424
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,828
Well, we're not
getting out that way.

425
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,997
Don't worry. Pretty soon,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

426
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,867
You're gonna be with your
mom and your sister and Trevor.

427
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,475
The important thing is
not to be scared, okay?

428
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,515
Looks like you made out
pretty good there, huh?

429
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,516
Can I have a piece of candy?

430
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,051
No?

431
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,088
You have enough sugar in there to
put all of Chicago into a diabetic coma.

432
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,054
One piece?

433
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,193
All right. You know
what you're doing there?

434
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,564
It's called emotional eating.

435
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,201
Anybody seen the chart
on my flatulence guy?

436
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:40,403
It is not in the rack and I am not going
back into his room to look for it again.

437
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,315
Why is there a
bird on my charts?

438
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,248
That's Trevor, he belongs to
a family Dr. Gates was seeing.

439
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,118
- Where is Dr. Gates?
- No one's seen him in a while.

440
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,316
Frank!

441
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,999
Find Gates and get this bird...

442
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,263
James Mackey, multiple gunshots
to the chest and upper left arm.

443
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,270
- Party got out of hand.
- I need vitals.

444
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,671
Tachy at 120, pressure's
at a 100 with a liter.

445
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,312
- Four of O neg, x-ray.
- No pulse in the left wrist.

446
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,313
- What's with the police escort?
- They say this guy tried...

447
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,316
to shoot at some cops.
They shot at him first.

448
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,052
Five stitches.
That's not too bad.

449
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,790
Danny's gonna be fine.

450
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,865
When we're finished
here, I'll take you upstairs...

451
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,830
and you can wait with your mom.

452
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,004
He's right. She's a whore.

453
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,836
You shouldn't say that.

454
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,442
Then why does she
act like she does?

455
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:49,878
Lets us go to bed when we want.
Never yells at us to do homework.

456
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:53,177
- We can have friends over any time.
- Some kids would love that.

457
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,123
She lets us drink.

458
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,884
Better at home than some
strange place, she says.

459
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:07,362
But then, uh, she
starts drinking with us...

460
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,960
starts flirting with the guys.

461
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,505
Does Danny know what's going on?

462
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,109
When he was younger,
I could make stuff up.

463
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,609
Now he's in the same school.

464
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,549
I hate her.

465
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,758
I know she's let
you down. I get that.

466
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,726
But try not to hate her.

467
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,131
That's not gonna
get you anywhere.

468
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,703
Do you want some
more orange beef?

469
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,935
Mm. No. Any more and I won't
be able to fit through the door.

470
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:57,776
Well, then I guess you'll just
have to stay here and never leave.

471
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,374
Ah.

472
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,144
Well, don't tempt me.

473
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:07,058
Actually, it'd be nice. It gets
lonely around here sometimes.

474
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,661
Yeah, I know what that's like.

475
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,858
But you have your mom nearby.

476
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,600
Mm-hm.

477
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,667
She's great.

478
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,538
But a lot of the time,
she doesn't get it.

479
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,406
She can't understand
why I don't want her help.

480
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,578
Must be frustrating.

481
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:36,488
Yeah, I just think that deep down
she's a little worried that I might...

482
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,120
I kind of freaked her
out at one point, so...

483
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,920
When?

484
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,925
It was long time ago.
It was a bad time.

485
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,127
What happened?

486
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:57,208
It was at the hospital,
after the accident.

487
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,112
I tried to hurt myself.

488
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,915
I tried to kill myself.

489
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,848
Vicodin.

490
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,992
I wish I'd known. I
would've tried to help.

491
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,027
No.

492
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,964
No, it was something that I
had to go through on my own.

493
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:28,740
And I feel pretty strong
now, having overcome all that.

494
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,950
- Intubation tray.
- Prep for a chest tube.

495
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,890
- So we don't get a tension pneumo.
- Set up fiber-optic and open a crike tray.

496
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,997
- We can get those if we need them.
- Induction meds on board.

497
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,188
Let's do it.

498
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,391
Give the meds a minute
to work. Bag him up.

499
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,467
This the guy from the
Halloween party shooting?

500
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,661
Are you family?

501
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,006
- No, police officer.
- Sorry, but you can't question him now.

502
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,144
You gotta make
sure this kid makes it.

503
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,479
All right, do a jaw thrust so
you don't fill his stomach with air.

504
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,576
Okay, Tracy, he's
loose. Go for it.

505
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,149
Twenty years on the job, never
fired my weapon before tonight.

506
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,189
You shot him?

507
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,062
I didn't get a good look at him. All
I saw was a weapon pointed at me.

508
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,597
Then you did what you had to.

509
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,434
Part of his costume.

510
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,065
It was a toy gun.

511
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,942
Keep pushing. Lean into it.

512
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,784
- Maybe you should take over, Dr. Morris.
- Need another doc in here?

513
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,820
I got it. MORRIS: Way to go.

514
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,151
Dr. Brenner, glove up,
check the Thora-Seal.

515
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,692
- We were about to.
- Fair amount of blood.

516
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,888
- Have a thoracotomy tray ready.
- He's hemodynamically stable.

517
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:02,466
For now. You have to be prepared
for anything and everything.

518
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,502
- You sound like a cop.
- Our jobs aren't all that different.

519
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:09,665
- O-silk, please.
- Yeah, things can turn on you real fast.

520
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,673
Okay, set up for
a portable chest.

521
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,210
Let's step out for the x-ray.

522
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:28,393
When I was younger, I had a
traffic stop, guy's tail light was busted.

523
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,256
Routine, right?

524
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,488
My gut told me
something was wrong,

525
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,066
I ignored it.

526
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,897
As I was telling him
to get the light fixed...

527
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,599
he pulled out a gun, shot his
wife in the passenger seat...

528
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,106
and then killed himself.

529
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,245
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

530
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,374
Took a desk job after that.

531
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:59,350
Pushing papers isn't why I became a
cop and so I go back on the street and...

532
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,961
Officer Flores is
here for her partner.

533
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,121
- Friends of the patient are in Waiting.
- Have them wait there.

534
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,927
- What are you doing?
- Gotta make sure he pulls through.

535
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,436
They sent us home. The brass finds you,
finds me talking to you, we're in trouble.

536
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,698
Systolic's down.

537
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,535
Squeeze a liter. Hang the O neg.

538
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,643
Call Thoracic. Take him to O.R.

539
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,608
Now? CATHERINE:
1200 cc's of blood.

540
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,078
Let the docs do their job.
Let me take you home.

541
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,980
- No, I'm not leaving. It's my fault.
- He's hypotensive. Wait until he arrests?

542
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:30,316
- I didn't mean to shoot him.
- Don't say anything.

543
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,992
He must've thought we were guests
at the party, dressed up as cops.

544
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,890
Maybe you guys
should step outside.

545
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,326
I'll come find you.

546
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:43,468
Yes, yes, he'll get his own red
cells, platelets and clotting factors.

547
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,968
- Decreases the risk.
- His output is slowing down.

548
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,903
Okay, just give us 10
minutes, we'll turn him around.

549
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,940
You know, at first I thought, I
don't know how to be a father.

550
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,016
I mean, what business
do I have, you know?

551
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,677
You know, I'm not saying I
didn't make mistakes with Sarah...

552
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:07,053
but things are good now between us,
you know? I've adjusted, she's adjusted.

553
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,861
Just like I know you will
with your new family situation.

554
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,293
And soon, I hope, huh?

555
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,606
Hey, hold that door, will you?
Come on, kid, we're out of here.

556
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,003
Let's go. We're free.

557
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,969
Come on, Owen.

558
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,504
Come on.

559
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,787
These are my favorite.

560
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,740
Only 100 cc's of
additional blood.

561
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,399
BP is 110 over
75. Heart rate's 85.

562
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,203
- Best so far.
- All right.

563
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,178
Angio is waiting
to squirt his arm.

564
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,476
Vascular's ready to
repair the brachial artery.

565
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,483
Have the blood bank
stay two units ahead.

566
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,350
You really should try to
control your enthusiasm.

567
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,082
Excuse me?

568
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,160
We just kicked ass in there.
Why not enjoy victory a little?

569
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,990
Because we need
to remain vigilant.

570
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,530
Patient can crash while
you do your victory dance.

571
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,395
Yeah. Listen, Cate.

572
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,361
- Anyone call you that?
- Once.

573
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:30,669
Okay. We work under a lot of stress,
so when something good does happen...

574
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,834
why not enjoy it,
just have some fun?

575
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,071
There is no room
for levity in the ER.

576
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,239
No offense, but if
that's your attitude...

577
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,281
then your day is
always gonna suck.

578
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,016
- Night, Frank. FRANK:
Have a good one.

579
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,680
Thanks.

580
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,251
Sam. Where you going?

581
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,224
- My review class.
- Thought you were gonna blow that off.

582
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,390
Yeah, well, going to school
isn't just a cutesy little hobby.

583
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,593
What are you talking
about? I support this.

584
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:01,365
I know. When it's convenient for
you, doesn't interfere with your life.

585
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,633
That's not true.

586
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,299
You have an outdated,
sexist view of what nurses do.

587
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,742
- We do a lot more than change bedpans.
- I know.

588
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,939
Wish you'd respect
what I'm trying to do...

589
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,981
- to learn. TRACY:
Want a tall triple decaf?

590
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,448
Heaven forbid you get
an intern to do scut work.

591
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,781
Showing off to Daria by
making me look small?

592
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,719
Know what? That
is never gonna fly.

593
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,758
Teaching the interns is part of
my job. What do you want me to do?

594
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,218
Nothing. Forget it.

595
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,594
You're nervous. Let's go
home and I'll help you study.

596
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,496
Okay.

597
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:34,605
All right, well, what is the anesthetic
of choice for open-heart surgery?

598
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,912
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
- Don't be like that.

599
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,275
I gotta go.

600
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,988
Any word on Danny?

601
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,363
They removed a small
blood clot from his brain.

602
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,937
Said he'll be in recovery soon.

603
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:11,743
- Where's Scott?
- Upstairs, waiting for his brother.

604
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,247
They're good kids.

605
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,381
Why don't you stop
screwing them up?

606
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,787
- What do you know about it?
- You're sleeping with a high school boy...

607
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,015
- Mike is 18. We're adults.
- No, he is a kid.

608
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:29,821
He sees you as nothing more than
an easy lay and he's not afraid to say it.

609
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:32,965
Mike didn't mean to say
those things. He loves me.

610
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,358
You know what?
He really doesn't.

611
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,062
- I'm not talking to you about this...
- Talk with Social Services.

612
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,068
And the boys too. I called them.

613
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,498
You have no right.

614
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,667
Scott has seen way
more than he should've.

615
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,837
He tries to protect his brother.
He's not the parent. You are.

616
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,540
So why don't you
start acting like it?

617
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,812
You have done a number on these
kids and that is gonna last a long time.

618
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,189
Go to hell.

619
00:35:57,213 --> 00:35:59,547
Just fix your life,
lady. It's not too late.

620
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,238
Thank you.

621
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,898
You know...

622
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:22,079
I wish I could've been there for you
when you were going through all of that.

623
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:28,916
Well, we weren't really on a
talking basis for a while, so...

624
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,713
- Oh, I love this song.
- Cool tune.

625
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,184
Give me that.

626
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,763
Come here.

627
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,399
You know...

628
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,939
I felt responsible
for what happened.

629
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,078
I still do sometimes.

630
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,044
Neela, I was drunk and stupid.

631
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,485
And standing in the middle of
the road in the middle of the night.

632
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,888
- But the way I handled things was...
- Neela.

633
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,058
Let it go.

634
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,429
I have.

635
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,296
Ugh.

636
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:26,775
It's probably trick-or-treaters.
Let's ignore them. They'll go away.

637
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,244
So you were saying.

638
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,454
After the accident...

639
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:43,393
um, I had a lot of
time to look at my life.

640
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:51,162
And what I had to do to get
back on my feet again, literally.

641
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:57,967
And it's given everything
that happened before...

642
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,704
it's put that into perspective.

643
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,955
Mm. Bollocks.

644
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,116
- Um, let me get rid of them.
- Okay.

645
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,558
Sorry, kids... but
I'm all out of candy.

646
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,530
- You owe me $80.
- What are you doing here?

647
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,192
Look, I'm sorry, I
didn't realize you...

648
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,396
- Give me a minute, okay?
- Sure.

649
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,938
- Okay?
- Okay.

650
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,833
- You can't just show up.
- I...

651
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,740
There's nothing
going on between us.

652
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:37,143
- We work together and that's it.
- I know, I just...

653
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,342
I thought we could have a
drink and... Like a celebration.

654
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,350
Dr. Gawande agreed
to do grand rounds.

655
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,752
Good for you, but as you
can see, I've got company.

656
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,017
Right, right, Ray.

657
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,397
Okay, well... - I'll go.
- Yeah, please do.

658
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:57,865
So, I'll see you...
I'll see you at work.

659
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,267
I'm, uh, sorry. I
didn't invite him.

660
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,498
No, it's getting
late. I should go.

661
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,110
You don't have to.

662
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,338
It's been a great
day, a fun night...

663
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,881
but I have that conference
in the morning, so...

664
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,714
You can stay here instead
of driving to the hotel.

665
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,420
I'm in a good place now.

666
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:27,792
And you seem good, too, so...

667
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,732
I'm gonna go.

668
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,643
See you soon.

669
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,911
Mr. Mackey's out of surgery.

670
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,571
The bleeding in his chest was from
vessels that clotted off on their own.

671
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,116
Bullet tore through an
artery in his upper arm...

672
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,982
but the surgeons
got to it quickly.

673
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,949
- So he's gonna be okay?
- He should be fine.

674
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,821
No residual
paralysis or disability.

675
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,154
Oh, good.

676
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,858
Oh.

677
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,458
That's good to hear.

678
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,461
That's good to hear.

679
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,334
Uh...

680
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,775
Yeah.

681
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,440
You do what you can...

682
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,507
but you can't be
prepared for everything.

683
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,953
Make a mistake at some office
job, what happens? Nothing much.

684
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,917
Our watch...

685
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,890
people get hurt, people die.

686
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,187
Yeah, yeah.

687
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,660
But you can't let it
take away all the good.

688
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,764
Uh...

689
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,104
I suggest you leave
before you're seen.

690
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:18,300
If you get your partner, I'll show
you a side door that you can use.

691
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,967
Yeah.

692
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,304
Thanks.
