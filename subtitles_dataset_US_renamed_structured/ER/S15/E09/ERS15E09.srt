1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,338
Sleeping with you, it
counts as poor judgment.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,740
Well, I thought
we fit well together.

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,745
- Bertha's family is suing.
- You said they wouldn't do that.

5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,850
An intern, you'll be protected.
The rest of us are gonna fry.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,280
It was a kid, right?

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,022
- A patient you should've saved.
- It was my son.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,386
Your son died in this ER?

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,358
I'm not sure why I've done
anything I've done since that day.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,022
- The Gates-Taggart merger's in full swing.
<i>- The Brady Bunch</i> from hell.

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,931
- It's great but she'll never admit it.
- Never happier, he just loves to complain.

12
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,810
Oh, your lasagna was amazing.

13
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,205
Really good. Yeah.

14
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,210
In fact, we all had seconds.

15
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,874
Yeah, they're hitting the books.

16
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,544
You make it there okay? Don't
have to send out a rescue party?

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,916
No, but I can use a yak
with a cask of brandy.

18
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,819
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

19
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,755
- Did you get any sleep?
- Maybe three hours.

20
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:00,986
<i>Go to bed early.</i>

21
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,097
And give Alex a big
hug and kiss from me.

22
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,324
Hey, Alex. Your
mom says good night.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,765
- Night.
- That's the best you're gonna get.

24
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,336
<i>See you in the morning.</i>

25
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,235
All right. Have a
good shift. Bye.

26
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,667
The contractile vacuole
of the paramecium...

27
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,345
excretes excess water
regulating osmotic pressure.

28
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,572
I knew that once.
How's the English paper?

29
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,115
In spite of a terminal illness,
Johnny Gunther lives with passion...

30
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,186
emphasizing the theme of
living like there's no tomorrow.

31
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,413
I hope you can back
that up with specifics.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,650
Are you gonna let
us go to that party?

33
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,420
- Didn't we talk about this?
- It's Friday night.

34
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,030
Yeah, and tomorrow you
wanna go to Alpine Valley...

35
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,359
because you wanna go
snowboarding for the weekend.

36
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:43,493
- It... Besides, it's a blizzard out there.
- It's only five blocks away.

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,698
- We'll walk, and we'll be home by ten.
- No. We all made a deal. Homework.

38
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,942
- Migraine headache?
- Just got imitrex.

39
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,444
Slip and fall?

40
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,674
Broken coccyx, wife's
coming to pick him up.

41
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,512
Yeah? Don't count on it.
Already a foot on the ground.

42
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,280
- Jumbo Mart's closing early.
- You are a snow angel.

43
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,287
And that, my
friends, is the board.

44
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,519
- Wow. Your day was pretty quie...
- Hey, hey. Do not say the "Q" word.

45
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,788
You can think it, but
you can never say it.

46
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,957
Okay, well, if it stays, uh, not busy,
we'll do a suture lab with pigs' feet.

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,694
- Hmm. Guess I'll have to miss that one.
- No.

48
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,807
- Kaya's snowed in. You get to stay.
- I was up until two last night.

49
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,035
- I didn't leave Tracy's until almost four.
- I got an extra one.

50
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,571
- Can't we get somebody else...
- Take it like a man, Grady.

51
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,376
Oh, uh, Banfield's stuck in
Omaha at an ACEP conference.

52
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,381
She wants you to cover
her day shift tomorrow.

53
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:36,216
- No. She got, like, twelve hours to try...
- Yeah? Take it like a man, Brenner.

54
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,717
Were you aware that Mrs.
Mendenhall complained of red stools?

55
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,022
- It wasn't discussed.
- Dr. Wade tried to bring it up...

56
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,655
but you told him to "stick to
the thyroid." Do you recall that?

57
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,325
The patient was here for
a routine elective surgery.

58
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,768
Didn't Dr. Wade have
important information?

59
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,099
In retrospect, yes.

60
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,402
Is it your standard practice to
cut off an intern's presentation?

61
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,774
It is when we have an hour
to round on fifty patients.

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,382
- Being busy is an excuse for negligence?
- Objection. Lacks foundation.

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,078
Did you know that your intern
went to the family and admitted fault?

64
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,189
Assumes facts not in evidence.

65
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,520
Dr. Wade had the moral fortitude
to be honest with the family.

66
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,457
Objection. Argumentative.

67
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,689
- Dr. Wade lacks experience.
- I advise my client not to answer.

68
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,730
How long does it
take to lose integrity?

69
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,301
This is a teaching hospital.
We are overwhelmed.

70
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,937
We have the added burden
of training young doctors.

71
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,574
To get through the day,
we have to rely on interns.

72
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,972
It's not perfect but
it's the best we have.

73
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:34,547
- Things can fall through the cracks.
- I said we need a recess.

74
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:36,973
Fine.

75
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,415
You are not following
my instructions.

76
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,145
I need to explain what happened.

77
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,914
No. You need to
keep your mouth shut.

78
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,956
Answer "yes," "no,"
or "I don't know."

79
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,254
Be a good girl and you won't
lose your medical license.

80
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,911
- There you go.
- Oh, I'm sorry, uh, I didn't order a...

81
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,180
A Bahama Mama. Courtesy of
the gentleman at the end of the bar.

82
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,415
Take the drink back,
thank the gentleman...

83
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,992
- ask him to leave me alone.
- I can't do that.

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,425
- Why not?
- He was very insistent.

85
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,529
I was in there for four hours.

86
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,537
That is a long time
on the hot seat.

87
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,869
It was ridiculous. I
came across like a fool.

88
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,545
That's to be expected.
Their job is to discredit you.

89
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,648
They're good at it. After that,
even I think I'm incompetent.

90
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,113
You're not.

91
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,276
Take a break and I'll, uh... I'll keep
the surgical consults to a minimum.

92
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,446
You're being nice or you don't
want me touching your patients.

93
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,115
Simon, can you re-assess our fever girl?
- No problem.

94
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,286
Uh, if you don't mind, can you
check on the interns in the break room?

95
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,167
- Temp's down, no source.
- She needs a catheterized urine.

96
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,236
That can be a little traumatic.
How about conscious sedation?

97
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,305
She might stop
breathing or drop her BP.

98
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,068
- It's too risky for a simple procedure.
- You sure?

99
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,212
Sam, Tony called,
I couldn't find you.

100
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,405
<i>With two feet of
snow predicted...</i>

101
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,048
<i>authorities say to stay indoors.</i>

102
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,082
Chicago, I hope
you're listening.

103
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,720
- Hey, Chaz.
- Hey, Neela. Frank.

104
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,716
Surprised you made it in.

105
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,484
I'm dedicated. Supposed to
observe every Friday night.

106
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,219
You can observe a drunk
sleeping it off in Exam Three.

107
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,762
Or you can help me with
the Christmas decorations.

108
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,332
There's nothing going on.
You may as well go home.

109
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,559
Now that I'm here?

110
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,431
I mean, I was lucky to make it this far.
- Good point.

111
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,573
Stay subcuticular through
the flap but distal to the tip.

112
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,572
- Half-buried vertical mattress?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,870
- Uh-huh.
- Looks good.

114
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,077
So, dude, what was up
with you and Dawn last night?

115
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,183
- Nothing.
- Nothing? You were slow dancing.

116
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,085
- If you can call that dancing.
- Where was your wife?

117
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,757
We couldn't get a babysitter.
Look, Dawn got drunk...

118
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,591
You guys go to Ike's last night?

119
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,129
- There was a party.
- Oh, really. I didn't hear about it.

120
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,430
At Tracy's. Just
for the interns.

121
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:16,473
- And the nurses.
- And a couple of residents.

122
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,780
<i>As the storm moves
across the central plains...</i>

123
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,114
<i>we're well past Omaha's
previous record snowfall...</i>

124
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,779
<i>of 27 inches set
in March of 1960.</i>

125
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,323
- Mm, you sure you don't want some?
- Positive.

126
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,995
Last time I saw you was at registration.
I thought we were in the same classes.

127
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,497
It's like you've been
avoiding me for three days.

128
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,467
- Yeah, I, uh, changed my schedule.
- Okay.

129
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,133
Can you believe every
flight's been cancelled?

130
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,401
And now, every hotel
room in town is booked.

131
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,408
Yes, I know.

132
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,081
Listen, um, what we talked
about that time in the break room.

133
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,277
Yeah, I had a very
bad day that day.

134
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,288
You know, if there's ever
anything more you wanna discuss.

135
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:10,362
- I... I'm a very private person.
- I understand that.

136
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,160
- It would be between you and me.
- I have a lot of reading to do.

137
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:29,742
They say the storm'll pass by morning.
Figure the airports will open up by noon.

138
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,022
You know, folks, it might
be a little cold outside...

139
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,714
but we are gonna warm it up...

140
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:42,295
with a trip to a little place
I like to call "Kokomo."

141
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,673
Well, he's not too bad. Hey.

142
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,041
You know what? Good music,
good company, good booze.

143
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,478
This could be an okay night.

144
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:04,976
Aah.

145
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,814
Things were slow in the O.R.
I borrowed a nitrous setup.

146
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,650
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Very.

147
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,485
Sam, are we
authorized to use this?

148
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,718
Dental assistants
use this stuff like water.

149
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,862
They don't have
monitoring capabilities.

150
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,294
- Is there a problem?
- No.

151
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,068
- All right, we're good to go.
- Very cool.

152
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,033
Why don't you use it
down here all the time?

153
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,867
- Good question.
- All done.

154
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,343
- She didn't even flinch.
- I'll go run it to the lab.

155
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,069
She'll be awake in five minutes.

156
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,339
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

157
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,110
Nice work. I'll, uh, get
ready for the traumas.

158
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,514
Hey, everybody.
How are you doing?

159
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,885
Can I have your attention
please for a second?

160
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,624
Uh.

161
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,359
Is there a doctor in the house?

162
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,866
I know you're all doctors.

163
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,095
Uh, well, you know, we're...
We're gonna be here all night...

164
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,264
uh, might as well get to
know each other. All right?

165
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:06,038
I'm Archie Morris, from
County General in Chicago.

166
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,377
And, uh, you know what? Why
don't we... Why don't we go around?

167
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,317
Okay, we'll go around, tell us your
name, where you're from, maybe.

168
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,447
Maybe a story of your funniest
ER patient? Whatever you want.

169
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,458
Who wants to go first?

170
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,729
Okay, I'll start.

171
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,167
I'll start by introducing my
colleague, the chair of our department.

172
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:36,002
The very beautiful and
talented Dr. Catherine Banfield.

173
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,908
- Anything you wanna share, Cate?
- Not really.

174
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,317
You know what? I'll be honest. She
has a reputation of bit of a hardass.

175
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,819
Does your boyfriend
need another beer?

176
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:52,289
He's not my boyfr... Give me a
refill, please. Make it a double.

177
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,954
You know, deep down inside,
she really, really, really cares.

178
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,193
Ah.

179
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,328
- Did you ever call Gates back?
- Oh, man.

180
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,701
- Good thing I'm here.
- Teenage girl, full arrest.

181
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,341
What took you guys so long?

182
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,943
Waiting on the damn snowplows.

183
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,172
Her name's Ashley. Back seat
passenger, car versus utility pole.

184
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,839
She was ejected through
the rear window. Very drunk.

185
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,541
- Did she ever have a pulse?
- No.

186
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:23,019
- Is that grey matter?
- Looks like an open skull fracture.

187
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,851
One, two, three.

188
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,721
- Asystole on the monitor.
- Resume compressions.

189
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,328
- What do you guys want?
- Blunt trauma, no vitals.

190
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,194
It's not an indication for thoracotomy.
- She's so young.

191
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,632
Let's try and fix anything reversible.
Pneumothorax, tamponade.

192
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,069
Bilateral chest tubes, pericardial
tap and four units of O-neg.

193
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,540
- Patient number two is here.
- At least they're not doing CPR.

194
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,736
- Grady wants a nurse.
- We're a little busy.

195
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,573
- We got this.
- You go check it out.

196
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,046
You tell us what they need.
- Fine.

197
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:52,909
What's the story?

198
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,850
Driver with altered
mental status...

199
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,252
chest trauma and a
bad shoulder dislocation.

200
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,859
What's your name?
Come on, tell us your name.

201
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,522
Portable C-spine, chest,
pelvis, and left shoulder.

202
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,031
Alex?

203
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,496
Alex? Alex. ALEX: Mom.

204
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,600
- Call her parents?
- Left a voicemail.

205
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,651
- The cops should go to her house.
- I could use a thoraseal.

206
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,377
Be right back.

207
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,956
- I'm in, bag him.
- Tony, wake up.

208
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,527
Alex snuck out of the house.

209
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,289
He was in a car crash.
You need to check on Sarah.

210
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,594
- Not much blood in the chest.
- Let's get O-neg and a vent.

211
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,533
- You ready for the reduction?
- Soon as we tape this in.

212
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,138
Sam, I can take over in here.

213
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,831
- No, I'm okay.
- Suri can do it.

214
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,635
She's got another trauma.

215
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,007
I'm not going. Let's fix this
before his paralytics wear off.

216
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,116
- Come back as soon as you're done.
- Ready, steady, pulling.

217
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,848
- Uh, the humeral head is stuck.
- Okay, let's try again.

218
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,494
I'll give you direct
pressure. Go for it.

219
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,796
No, won't budge. I'll get skin hooks.
- Labs are ready.

220
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,132
- Trauma panel, type and cross for four?
- Blood alcohol level.

221
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,205
No, he doesn't drink.

222
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,703
- Is the girl gonna make it?
- Pretty unlikely.

223
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,708
- How about the boy?
- Too soon to tell.

224
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,847
Back seat passenger,
drugs and alcohol.

225
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:32,179
- I gotta see her. Where is she?
- Titrate, Ativan and get a head CT.

226
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,754
- Also has a sternal contusion.
- EKG and chest X-ray.

227
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,186
- Where did you put her?
- Try to relax.

228
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,259
I'm right here, Ashley. - No.

229
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,430
No, that's not a good answer,
I wanna talk to your supervisor.

230
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,655
Skin hooks.

231
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,562
Blood bank is out of O-neg.
Red Cross can't deliver.

232
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,362
- He's got a good crit.
- For now.

233
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,934
What is up with O-neg? We
have multiple trauma victims...

234
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,938
what do you expect us to do?

235
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,010
We should get Dawn in here.
- Uh, send O+.

236
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,614
The patient is a male, that'll
work until we get the cross match.

237
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,842
Pulling.

238
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,452
Ugh NEELA: There you go.

239
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,753
- Got a pulse back at the wrist.
- Shoulder immobilizer and right to CT.

240
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,761
I got the lifepak, and O2 tank is
full, the chest tube's on water seal.

241
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,596
Okay, I'll go check on Grady.

242
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,262
- I'll help you with the sling.
- I think I've got it.

243
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,469
I got a little musical game that
we're gonna have some fun with.

244
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,547
And the hotel has generously
donated prizes to all the winners.

245
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,877
Stuffed mushrooms
and, uh, potato skins.

246
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,075
Your choice.

247
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,551
Okay? Yeah. You guys ready?

248
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,656
Okay.

249
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,733
No winners yet.

250
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,746
Stop.

251
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,455
Let it stop. Make it stop.

252
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,824
Whoo!

253
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:34,201
Stranded in Omaha in the dead of
winter listening to lame-ass music.

254
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,836
Does this suck, or what?

255
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,671
You know what?

256
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,044
- Dermatology gets to go to Maui.
- I know.

257
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,119
Radiology to Acapulco.

258
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,621
I mean, just like always,
ER gets no respect. Uh-huh.

259
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:58,129
We bust our asses, taking care of people
that no one else wants to touch 24/7.

260
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,629
We deserve better.

261
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,129
Do you think we deserve better?

262
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,362
Ready and switch.

263
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,557
No tension pneumo, no effusion.

264
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,728
- Did they ever find the parents?
- Two more units, then call it.

265
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,669
Faster and deeper, Ryan.

266
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,433
- How's the CT?
- Good news.

267
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,373
- Abdomen's benign, no brain bleed.
- But he's won't wake up.

268
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,672
- Give him time.
- My God.

269
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,247
I was trying to triage
her, she wouldn't wait.

270
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,439
Are you okay?

271
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,052
Broken wrist on the right. I
need to get back out there.

272
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,848
Prep a subclavian on the right.

273
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,753
- How is he?
- How does he look, huh?

274
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,651
- Were you drinking?
- No.

275
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,123
- A little. But he wasn't.
- Sam.

276
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,358
You were supposed
to be home studying.

277
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,297
We were. SAM: You snuck out.

278
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,064
- It wasn't like that.
- He has got a learner's permit.

279
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,763
He needs an adult in that car.

280
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,603
Ashley was too drunk to
drive, he was trying to help.

281
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,746
You can't call Tony, or
you can't call me or a cab?

282
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,405
- What the hell is wrong with you, Sarah?
- What's wrong with you?

283
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,246
Uh, I need a thin
wall, not a 25, Sam.

284
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,889
- You got this?
- Yeah.

285
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,922
Okay. Let's check
you over, Sarah.

286
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,252
I wanna stay here.

287
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,554
We'll be back in a
few minutes. Come on.

288
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,270
Dude, you've got the coolest
boss in the whole world.

289
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,271
Whoo. How y'all doing?

290
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:28,608
Why don't we get Archie
up here so we can do a duet?

291
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,716
Archie, Archie, Archie.

292
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:35,014
Yeah, give him some love.
Yeah, give him some love.

293
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,156
Yeah, give him some love.

294
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,987
Archie! Archie! Archie!

295
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,792
Hi. Whoo.

296
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,166
- What do we wanna sing, huh?
- I don't...

297
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,466
- "White Christmas?"
- Yeah.

298
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,469
I don't think so.

299
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,842
"Freebird." "Freebird!"

300
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,714
You know "Walk This Way"?

301
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,384
You know "Walk
This Way"? All right.

302
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,924
Whoo.

303
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,392
Tell you what, guys.

304
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:22,433
Uh, we... We are gonna "walk this
way" because I think the show is over.

305
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,195
I'm sorry. I know.

306
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,238
Let's get you some coffee.
Let's get you some coffee.

307
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,240
However, A... ACEP rocks, I
mean it. It's, uh... You okay?

308
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,684
Good... Goodnight, Omaha.

309
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:44,916
Hold compressions.

310
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,222
- Asystole.
- That's it.

311
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,097
One fifty-seven.
I'll get a shroud.

312
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,400
I'll clean her up.

313
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,368
Let's move her
to the suture room.

314
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:14,117
Tidal volume 500, AC 14,
turn him down to 80 percent.

315
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,216
You called it?

316
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,654
Crit's good, 41.

317
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,095
Blood alcohol level is
zero. He wasn't drinking.

318
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,736
Sam.

319
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,506
CT's were all good. Small
hemothorax and a bad concussion.

320
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,975
Dawn, this ET tube can
use a little suctioning.

321
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,444
You wanna step out?

322
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,309
Sarah's here. She's getting a cast.
- Yeah. I know.

323
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,019
Things seem stable in there.

324
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,187
How are you doing?

325
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,990
He was driving
some drunk girl's car.

326
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,125
She just died.

327
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,538
And I don't know if
he's gonna wake up.

328
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,043
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have given in to them.

329
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,220
What are you talking about?

330
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,791
I let them go to the party.

331
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,230
You what?

332
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,033
I tried to call you.

333
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,871
No. No, no.

334
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,036
We are not doing this now.

335
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,976
Sam.

336
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:03,019
All right. All right.
There you go.

337
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,728
Now you're gonna feel a
whole lot better. All right?

338
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:15,433
Well, I hate to say this,
but there's a lesson here.

339
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:21,002
Yup. Red wine and
scotch don't mix.

340
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,081
You gotta remember that.

341
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,618
- You okay? Wanna take a little rest?
- Hmm.

342
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:30,751
Let me know when you're ready.

343
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,533
Sorry.

344
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,403
You know...

345
00:21:55,281 --> 00:22:00,481
my dad was born in
Lincoln, not too far from here.

346
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:06,722
When I was little, he used to
drive us to my grandma's house.

347
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,561
I remember the
ride took forever.

348
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:14,092
And he'd... He'd yell at me
for kicking the back of his seat...

349
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:20,262
or getting crumbs on the
floor, or breathing too loud.

350
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,802
That was my dad.

351
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,172
Yeah.

352
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,310
You know, he, uh...
He died last year.

353
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,479
We hadn't spoken in years.

354
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,121
He's got this storage
locker in Indiana.

355
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,696
They can either trash it or
I can go deal with his stuff.

356
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,755
It could be a
complete waste of time.

357
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:54,032
Or maybe I'd learn something
about a father I didn't really know.

358
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:04,279
- Ortho can take Alex in an hour.
- No problems, his vitals are stable.

359
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,319
Dr. Brenner, Leo's positive for
opiates, benzos and marijuana.

360
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,184
- Okay.
- How about, um, aspirin and Tylenol?

361
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,952
We sent them. None detected.

362
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,326
See that? I get attitude
from all the interns.

363
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,830
Maybe they don't like
you picking on one of them.

364
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,026
You mean Andrew?
We've worked through that.

365
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,797
When I was an intern, I
was friends with my residents.

366
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,839
- You're more like an attending.
- I don't feel that way.

367
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,477
You make them nervous.
You showed them some teeth.

368
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,204
Man, no one's delivering
pizza in this snow.

369
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,372
How can you be
hungry at a time like this?

370
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,484
- You still gotta eat.
- I may have to nuke the pigs' feet.

371
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:43,214
- Has anyone seen Trauma Two's chart?
- Right here, Dr. Rasgotra.

372
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:48,259
Oh, Brenner, I got family in here from...
- I need some help, here.

373
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,689
Wait a minute, Chaz.

374
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,924
- Weren't you with that Ashley girl?
- Yeah.

375
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,160
- Somebody has to talk to her brother.
- I'm supposed to observe.

376
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:00,170
I've been stalling him for
an hour. You're all I've got.

377
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,670
This is Chaz Pratt, he's
one of our student doctors.

378
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,210
Where's Ashley?

379
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,712
- You two are the brothers?
- No, just Tyler.

380
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,516
- And you are?
- The babysitter, I guess.

381
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,186
Tyler was supposed to hang out at
my place until midnight. Two hours ago.

382
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:27,128
The little guy was freaking
out so I brought him in.

383
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,736
- Can I see my sister?
- Her doctors are working on her.

384
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,728
- Where are their parents?
- Europe for a couple weeks.

385
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:38,310
You two got it from here? I gotta get
my truck towed or dug out or something.

386
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,646
Satting well at 50 percent.
Less that 100 cc's from the chest.

387
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,912
Sam, I let them go to
the party as a reward.

388
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,079
They busted their
asses on their homework.

389
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,780
We all agreed. No party tonight.

390
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,619
- I quizzed him. He knew it.
- Great.

391
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,956
I tried to call you. They
walked to the party.

392
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,895
I don't know what to do.
I'm trying to be his friend.

393
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,897
- I'm trying to be a good father.
- Tony.

394
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:13,173
- Did Ashley really die?
- Yeah.

395
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,307
I can't believe it.

396
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:24,251
- This is awful.
- It is. I'm sorry.

397
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,050
Alex is doing better.

398
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,422
Come on, let's go
get you some Kleenex.

399
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,657
- Head CT was negative?
- No fracture, no bleed.

400
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:37,132
- Is that Leo?
- Leo? The kid that calls you every night?

401
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,533
- What's going on?
- Looks like a bad drug OD.

402
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,641
- He's had eight of Ativan.
- I told him not to take that crap.

403
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,039
- What crap? SARAH:
It's called trail mix.

404
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,702
Kids steal prescription
pills from their parents...

405
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,349
and everyone throws
them into a big bowl.

406
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,610
Sat's are down, intubation tray.

407
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,811
It could be anti-depressants.
Push bicarb.

408
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,821
Okay, 100 milli-equivalents
over two minutes.

409
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,950
Come on.

410
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,625
<i>Would you like to pick one up?</i>

411
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,294
<i>Forecast doesn't look...</i>
MAN 3: <i>in only 30...</i>

412
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:16,408
<i>- You're gonna spend a hundred and 29...
- Am I ready for a facelift?</i>

413
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,678
Nothing but news
and infomercials.

414
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:23,509
- When can I see Ashley?
- In a little bit.

415
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,611
We got some magazines.

416
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,847
Eh, I know where they
have some video games.

417
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:34,687
- I wanna see my sister.
- Okay.

418
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,322
I'll go check with her doctors.

419
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,002
Hey, Frank, I need Brenner
to talk to the little brother.

420
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,232
He's all tied up.

421
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,276
- Well, how about a social worker?
- At 3:00 in the morning?

422
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,777
Is there an on-call
chaplain or something?

423
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,939
Grab a cut down tray,
he's in tamponade.

424
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,414
Chaz, find me an ultrasound.

425
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,853
Table for two?

426
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,283
Some, uh, coffee for you folks?
- Definitely.

427
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,086
I'll have some hot tea.

428
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,196
We've got a couple
of night owl specials.

429
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,888
A, um...

430
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:16,229
Apple pancakes and a
spicy breakfast burrito.

431
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,395
- Ooh. What's in the burrito?
- Uh, eggs, onions, bell peppers.

432
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:25,135
Uh, Chorizo, jalapeño-jack
cheese and chunky salsa.

433
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,472
One of those and a large OJ.

434
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,611
I'll have some dry toast.

435
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,751
And some napkins
when you get a chance.

436
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:36,787
You need silverware. I completely
forgot to set your table. Pregnancy brain.

437
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,823
I'd forget my head if it
wasn't screwed on. Heh.

438
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,591
It's called a
pericardial window.

439
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:53,068
They're removing blood clots from
around Leo's heart so it can beat stronger.

440
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,106
- I can't watch this.
- All right. Dawn.

441
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,437
- No problem. Come on.
- We'll let you know.

442
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,909
- Heart rate's up to 120.
- Run in a liter of saline.

443
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,105
- What for?
- In case we're behind on fluids.

444
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,478
- What if he's bleeding?
- CT was negative.

445
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:10,180
- Things change. Get Neela in here.
- Let's run another crit and fast exam.

446
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,914
Maybe Grady can reassess him.

447
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,618
Blood loss is unlikely. I think
it's hypoxia, dehydration, pain.

448
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,195
What do you know? I
want a surgeon in here.

449
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,356
- How's he doing?
- Okay.

450
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,628
Have you guys seen a little
boy? I left him in the break room.

451
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,669
He's not in here.

452
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,157
Why won't she wake up?

453
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,991
Why won't she wake up?

454
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,325
Pressure's up to 110.

455
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,701
- That's a hell of a lot better than 60.
- Cardiac team's waiting in the O.R.

456
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,069
Nice work, doctor.

457
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,177
He's in sinus tach. His
crit went from 41 to 38.

458
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,751
Could be just dilutional
from all the fluids.

459
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,514
Or it could be pain. We
can dial up the sedation.

460
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,590
- You'd miss an intra-abdominal bleed.
- Ultrasound's negative.

461
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,056
- He's not bleeding in the belly.
- Or the chest.

462
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,787
Well, you can't be sure
of that without a repeat CT.

463
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,594
I really think that my kid
deserves a surgical attending.

464
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,736
- Where's Dubenko? Where's Crenshaw?
- Not available.

465
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,065
Alex is in good hands.
Let's take a break.

466
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,333
I don't need a break!

467
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,105
You want a cup of
coffee? Something to eat?

468
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,405
You never listen to me.

469
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,175
I'm checking for blood loss,
I've ordered a third CBC.

470
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,580
Neela and Brenner
agree. You gotta trust us.

471
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,448
Trust you? Why
would I trust you.

472
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,180
I wanted Alex to stay home
and study. You knew that.

473
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,380
- Sam.
- What?

474
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:56,221
- You'd rather be his friend than an adult.
- I know how to be a parent.

475
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,590
Why would I believe that?

476
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,631
You don't know anything. You
let them do whatever they want.

477
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,462
You've made mistake with your kid,
and you wanna do the same with mine.

478
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,299
Go ahead and keep screwing
up Sarah. I'm sure as hell...

479
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm not gonna let
you near Alex again.

480
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,101
- I know you're upset...
- Don't you touch me!

481
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,343
Okay. That's okay.

482
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,449
I need to be with him.

483
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:33,389
I saw what my classmates were doing
during med school and during residency.

484
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,557
But I wasn't going
there, you know.

485
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:39,296
I mean, every other night on
call. That's no way to raise a kid.

486
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,339
You know, so I put if off.

487
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,874
Oh. Nothing wrong with that.

488
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,906
I mean, by the time
I was pregnant...

489
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:54,315
I had a good salary, a
good schedule. I was secure.

490
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,921
I was older.

491
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,649
A lot of people
prefer it that way.

492
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,585
Hmm.

493
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:09,034
When we lost Daryl, I was 40...

494
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,528
but we tried.

495
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,439
You know...

496
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,632
You know, eventually
it worked out.

497
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,936
I mean, everything
looked pretty great.

498
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:23,481
The baby looked
perfect on the ultrasound.

499
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,911
Then, you know...

500
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,789
Then at three months...

501
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,630
You had a miscarriage?

502
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,198
I'm sorry.

503
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:46,065
No, I just took it as a sign
it wasn't supposed to be.

504
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:57,342
Look, I made a choice, I devoted
myself to my training, to my profession.

505
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:00,680
And now, I'm chief of
an academic department.

506
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,980
Yeah. It's a huge
accomplishment.

507
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,592
I invested in my career,
I've been a great success.

508
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,163
Can't have everything.

509
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,601
I thought you were sleeping.

510
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:30,739
Leo's surgery went
well. They fixed his heart.

511
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,475
Good.

512
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,953
And Alex is going up
for shoulder surgery.

513
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,923
- You wanna go see him?
- I hate that room.

514
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,789
Okay. Later, then, huh?

515
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,532
You're okay in here?

516
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,265
Okay, why don't you lie
down and get some sleep.

517
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,102
- I heard Sam yelling.
- Yeah, she's mad at me.

518
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:03,343
She's right to
be. It'll be okay.

519
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:07,283
His third crit went
up. That's good.

520
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,978
- How's he doing?
- Better with fluids and versed.

521
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,954
- Brought you a water.
- Just put it on the counter, please.

522
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,117
- Heart rate's 160.
- Pressure's down to 80 systolic.

523
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,195
Get Neela back in
here. He needs blood.

524
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,355
- You don't know that.
- It's my best guess.

525
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,899
- Two units in cooler.
- You think he's bleeding?

526
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,400
We need to transfuse.

527
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,128
Give me the ultrasound.

528
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,830
- Start portable chest.
- Repeat the hemocue.

529
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,135
- Simon, you see any P waves?
- What?

530
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:35,076
- They're there, you just can't see them.
- Excuse me.

531
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,806
I can't get to the subclavian.

532
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,712
Breath sounds a bit down.

533
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,149
- Place another chest tube.
- Uh, I need to prep.

534
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,810
- What are you doing?
- Back off.

535
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,388
I'm gonna run the EKG.

536
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,185
- It'll spread out the complexes.
- I need to ultrasound.

537
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,194
- There be hemothorax.
- All right, shut up and look.

538
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,164
No P waves. It's not sinus tach,
it's SPT. We need to cardiovert.

539
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,970
He's not bleeding, he's got
arrhythmia from a bruised heart.

540
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,801
- Get them on there, Sam.
- Hold on.

541
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,101
Clear.

542
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,280
- Heart rate's 82.
- Looks like normal sinus.

543
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,577
BP's 110 over 74.

544
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,886
Thank you.

545
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,387
- Dr. Brenner.
- Yeah?

546
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:22,153
- You got a minute?
- Looks like I do now.

547
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:27,727
- Let's run a twelve lead. NEELA:
CK, troponin and cardiac echo.

548
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,960
- The girl who died, her brother's here.
- What about the parents?

549
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:34,732
They're out of town
and he saw her body.

550
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,601
I don't really think he gets
it, but I don't know what to do.

551
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:41,906
Okay. I'll... Come
on, I'll talk to him.

552
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,245
- More coffee?
- No, just the check, please.

553
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,818
Okey-dokey. I'll be right back.

554
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,660
Hello. Yes.

555
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,855
Oh, hold on, just a minute.

556
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,661
- A room just opened up at the hotel.
- Great.

557
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,999
- Just one room.
- Oh.

558
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:10,700
Yeah, go ahead. Go
ahead. I can hang out here.

559
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,468
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

560
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,209
All right, I'll take
it. Okay, thank you.

561
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,287
Here you go. You folks have a...

562
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,652
Oh. I think my baby
just kicked. First time.

563
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,189
That's wonderful.

564
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,959
Uh, can you feel it?

565
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:38,200
- It's like popcorn popping.
- Yes, it is.

566
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,739
- Congratulations.
- I gotta go call my husband.

567
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,752
- Hey, Tyler.
- Hi.

568
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,588
- This is Dr. Brenner.
- Nice to meet you, Tyler.

569
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,493
Is Ashley awake yet?

570
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,695
Tyler...

571
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,103
your sister was in a car crash.

572
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,938
- She flew out the window.
- Right.

573
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:23,240
And she hit the
ground very hard.

574
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:29,082
And it made her stop breathing
and then her heart stopped beating.

575
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:36,252
We did everything we
could for her, and we...

576
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,594
We gave her medicine
and oxygen and blood.

577
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,892
But sometimes...

578
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:48,796
Sometimes people are injured
so bad, that we can't save them.

579
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,042
And that's what
happened to your sister.

580
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:59,450
We did everything we could
for her, but we couldn't help her.

581
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,586
And she died.

582
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,557
Maybe you can try some more.
Maybe she needs another operation.

583
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,924
That wouldn't work.

584
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:19,398
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.

585
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,570
Your mom and dad are gonna
come back to town tomorrow.

586
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,238
In the meantime, we're
gonna keep an eye on you.

587
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,480
Can you stay with me now?

588
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,847
I'm not going anywhere.

589
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:45,319
Hey, Dr. Brenner, Alex is going up
to surgery, everyone else is tucked in.

590
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,363
Okay if we send the
interns home early?

591
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,364
- Yeah, it's fine by me.
- Cool.

592
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,765
I was gonna catch some
Zs up in the call room.

593
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,495
But I think I'll go
home, see my kids.

594
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,671
I thought this shift
would never end.

595
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,434
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

596
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,003
You know, when
I was an intern...

597
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,639
after a rough night, my resident
would take us all out for breakfast.

598
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,615
My treat, what do you say?

599
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,848
You know, with the snow,
I'm sure everything's closed.

600
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,685
Right.

601
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,260
- But thank you, Dr. Rasgotra.
- Maybe next time.

602
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,828
- They all hate me.
- You're the boss.

603
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,830
It's not fun hanging
out with the boss.

604
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,162
If I hurry, I can pre-round
before I sign out.

605
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,328
- You did a fantastic job on the traumas.
- Everyone pitched in.

606
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,996
Incredible saves.

607
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,643
I wouldn't wanna be stuck
here with anyone but you.

608
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,904
- That's enough.
- No, I'm serious.

609
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,478
Forget about the deposition.

610
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,140
If the case goes to court, I'll testify
on your behalf. You'll be golden.

611
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,651
And for what it's worth, you can
ask me out to breakfast any morning.

612
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,825
Except this morning. I've
gotta cover for Banfield.

613
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,371
Good night, Dr. Banfield.

614
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:05,167
Good night, Dr. Morris.

615
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,320
Just for the record...

616
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,519
tonight never happened.

617
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,952
Sarah fell asleep. When Alex
goes to surgery I'm gonna take her.

618
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,062
You want me to pick you
up a change of clothes?

619
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,288
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

620
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:00,625
Uh...

621
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,826
Sorry about your son. I
was out at the investigation.

622
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,770
He swerved to avoid a minivan
that skidded through a red light.

623
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,002
Missed them completely.
Could have been a lot worse.

624
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,245
Yeah.

625
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:28,021
Ortho wants a couple more
films before they take him up.

626
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,823
Alex, your mom's back.

627
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,499
- Did he just open his eyes?
- I think so.

628
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,795
Alex. Hey. Over here.

629
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,498
Hi. Hi.

630
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:45,337
It's okay. It's okay to sleep,
I'm right here. All right?

631
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,139
I gotta get these to the lab.

632
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,621
I was really mad. I am...

633
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,354
Those things that
I said, Tony, I...

634
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,828
What I said about
Sarah, I didn't mean that.

635
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,697
Okay.

636
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,799
I know you try...

637
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,538
and that we all make
mistakes. It's just...

638
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,808
This is a pretty big mistake.

639
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,218
Because he's everything to me.

640
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,414
And I'm still just
trying to deal with it.

641
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,486
What the hell?

642
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,056
- Oh, God.
- Pressure's down. Lost the pulse.

643
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,326
- We gotta open his chest.
- PEA arrest.

644
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,525
I'll bag him.

645
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,762
Four units packed
cells, four FFP.

646
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,171
- Two liters gushed out.
- Delayed aortic rupture.

647
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,572
We need to get
a side clamp on it.

648
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,355
I've got it.

649
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:11,688
Hold CPR. Get ready
for internal compressions.

650
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,356
- Two units hanging.
- Chest incision, right now.

651
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,033
Rib spreader, please.
