1
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,334
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,068
If anything changes
with Jody, call me.

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,604
- Or just call me.
- I will.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,225
- Who's going to Johns Hopkins?
- Dr. Rasgotra.

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,273
I'm just looking.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,717
You keep mumbling about the hiring freeze,
pushing me to do interviews all over.

7
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,686
We have something worth saving.

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,453
Did you realize that before or
after you had sex with Daria?

9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,859
I wanna be with you.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,125
There, I said it. You can
go ahead and gloat now.

11
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,925
I'd rather do something else.

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,214
Frank, we gotta get
these tele admits up.

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,816
- I'm all over it.
- There's at least 30 in the rack.

14
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,474
What were you doing last night?

15
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,644
Playing "Guitar Hero,"
doing Jell-O shots.

16
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,584
- Two messages from Kelly.
- Kelly who?

17
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,555
She said you'd know. That's
her phone number at Swissotel.

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,627
- Car crash victim coming in.
- Clear Trauma 1 and get Surgery.

19
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,993
- We're gridlocked.
- Quick dispo in Curtain 1. Grady?

20
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,897
Off duty, and going to Jumbo Mart for
caffeine to get me through my charting.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,903
- Well, who else is on?
- Well, we got Brenner, Morris and...

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,404
What do you need?

23
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,633
That's okay.

24
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,744
- I haven't picked up a patient yet.
- No, go meet the trauma.

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,345
It's busy. I got time.

26
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:23,644
Okay, fooling around with her
boyfriend, and they lost the condom.

27
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,509
She's fully dressed in the ER.

28
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,679
She should be in a private room
with a chaperone for a pelvic.

29
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,017
- Yeah, there's no need, actually.
- What?

30
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,660
Go on. Go get the history.

31
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,290
- Hello, I'm Dr. Gates.
- Tammy.

32
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,094
So the proverbial lost condom.

33
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,102
Yeah, it is kind
of embarrassing.

34
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,537
Well, don't worry. Tell
me what happened.

35
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,809
The condom came off,
and I couldn't reach it.

36
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:54,278
My boyfriend tried to
help, but he's useless.

37
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,974
I went to the bathroom
and gagged myself...

38
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,779
but I couldn't
vomit it up either.

39
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,223
I'm not gonna suffocate, am I?

40
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,453
- Dr. Rasgotra.
- Dr. Brenner.

41
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,203
How was your night?

42
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,308
Four hours of sleep.

43
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,343
You would've got a lot less
than that if you were in my bed.

44
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,538
Next time, you should spend
the night with me in the call room.

45
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,206
What, you mean on a twin
bed with scratchy sheets...

46
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,216
and phone
interruptions every hour?

47
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,150
That's kind of hot.

48
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,355
You know, I was thinking of getting
Neil Young tickets for Saturday.

49
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,893
- That sounds good.
- You like him?

50
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,224
Yeah, I love him.
Especially his early stuff.

51
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,491
- Really?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,726
"Old Man," "Only Love
Can Break Your Heart."

53
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,665
- "Heart of Gold."
- "Heart of Gold."

54
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,104
Neela.

55
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,400
Trauma coming in.

56
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,667
Thank you.

57
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,401
Ahem. Are we out of sugar?

58
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,876
I don't think so.

59
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,283
What are they doing?

60
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,859
Our old medical records
are going in remote storage.

61
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,692
Let me ask you something,
kind of man-to-man.

62
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,766
Do you believe in
the three-date rule?

63
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,732
You seeing someone new?

64
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,395
I don't know if we're
actually seeing each other.

65
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,541
We had lunch
together in the cafeteria.

66
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,472
I bought her a burger
one night at Ike's.

67
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,771
Wow, sounds serious.

68
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,245
I like her. I just can't tell
if she's interested in me.

69
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,580
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm not the
right guy to ask for relationship advice.

70
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,796
Hey, the run got
diverted to Mercy.

71
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,237
Ooh. Whoa, whoa.

72
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,777
Hey, you all right?

73
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,745
Tony, Archie, I need some help.

74
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,282
- Grab a gurney.
- Looks like this guy got beat up.

75
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,181
- What's your name, sir?
- Oliver.

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,321
- Oliver what?
- No wallet, no ID.

77
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,583
- Pupils are equal.
- You know where you are?

78
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,850
Hospital.

79
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,960
Oriented to place.
What year is it?

80
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,758
Who's the president? Do
you know who the president is?

81
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:28,993
<i>Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?</i>

82
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,467
Chicago is a police state.

83
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,539
- Violating our constitutional rights.
- Let's go, come on, move. Come on.

84
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,370
<i>Hey, hey, hey, LBJ.</i>

85
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,045
You don't have to talk.
We'll take good care of you.

86
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,772
Relax, brother, enjoy the ride.

87
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,520
Decent breath sounds. Looks
like he got kicked a bunch of times.

88
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,062
- Yeah, or fell.
- He looks too good to be homeless.

89
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,290
No blood in the belly.

90
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,264
Abrasion where somebody
stole his watch. Definite assault.

91
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,404
We already called in the police.

92
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,040
Chest is normal. The head
CT's gonna be normal too.

93
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,607
Not if there's a brain bleed.

94
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,438
These old altered guys, it's
always something metabolic.

95
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,103
Just order more IV fluids.
Let me go clear the board.

96
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,080
No, stay on this. Buff him
up, find out where he belongs.

97
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,116
- Scanner's ready.
- Potentially unstable.

98
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,755
Dr. Gates can monitor
him in Radiology.

99
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,414
Last BP was 110/65.

100
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,890
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- Excuse us.

101
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,765
Are you a student driver?

102
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,959
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,161
I'm sorry you had to
pull me out of my car.

104
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,067
Is the oxygen helping, Donna?

105
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,298
I think so.

106
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,339
Have you ever had
any trouble breathing?

107
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,408
Not till last week.

108
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,479
- Mom, I parked the car.
- Thanks, honey.

109
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,911
- That's my son, Dylan.
- Hey.

110
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,284
She couldn't even talk.

111
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,852
So you were saying
about last week?

112
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,114
They told me I had lung cancer.

113
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,918
- Where are you being treated?
- Nowhere yet.

114
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,027
We were supposed
to go to Northwestern...

115
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,562
but in the car, her breathing
got so bad that I pulled into here.

116
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,700
I have papers and x-rays, if...

117
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,360
The Willow Ridge Medical Center.

118
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,596
Our local hospital
where they diagnosed me.

119
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,708
Okay, do you smoke
cigarettes, Donna?

120
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,074
Ten to 15 percent of lung
cancer occurs in nonsmokers.

121
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,477
- We've been on the Internet a bit.
- It's in the left upper lobe.

122
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,378
Liver function
tests are elevated.

123
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,351
Okay, and did they explain the
brain CT results to you, Donna?

124
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,822
Two spots.

125
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:35,793
They thought that surgery and chemo
and radiation could buy me some time.

126
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:40,696
Stage four lung cancer has a
five-year survival rate of 5 percent.

127
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,063
- But one in 20 survive.
- Well.

128
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,401
Okay, well, we'll have our
surgeons and oncologists consult.

129
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,174
- I was hoping to go to Northwestern.
- Yeah, you're too sick to move.

130
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,540
Yeah, I'm gonna cancel
the audition, Mom.

131
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,841
No, Dylan, you're not
canceling anything.

132
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,985
Now, get to orchestra
hall on time...

133
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,019
and you can stay with
Aunt Harriet tonight, okay?

134
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,486
Okay.

135
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,728
Dr. Morris, I'm looking for
an old guy, victim of assault.

136
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,889
- He should be right back.
- Okay.

137
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,227
You know, I could be
wrong, but I thought I saw...

138
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:20,067
you and Officer Diaz
eating lunch the other day.

139
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,042
- Yeah, we were on a case together.
- Really?

140
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,739
Because I've had cases with you,
but we've never had lunch together.

141
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:33,216
Plus, it must've been a funny case,
because I noticed a lot of smiling.

142
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,288
Yeah, well, Officer
Diaz is a nice lady.

143
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,287
We all know that.

144
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,427
And I know you know
cops stick together.

145
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,255
- Yeah.
- So be careful.

146
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:47,265
If you break her heart,
we may have to break you.

147
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,293
Head CT was normal,
just as I predicted.

148
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,302
And guess what,
he's hypernatremic.

149
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,465
- How bad is his sodium?
- Hundred and sixty-five, dry as a bone.

150
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,200
- Does this guy talk?
- Not really.

151
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,209
I'll check for Missing
Person reports.

152
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,814
- Did you calculate free water deficit?
- Six liters.

153
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,951
Hypernatremia
shouldn't be corrected at...

154
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,951
One milli-equivalent
per liter per hour.

155
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,414
Need a doctor here.

156
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,654
- You can have Dr. Gates.
- Well, shouldn't I stay here and finish?

157
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,493
No, you've been wanting off
this case from the get-go. See you.

158
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,931
- He's starting to open his eyes.
- That's a good sign.

159
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,931
Oliver?

160
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,702
Oliver, try to squeeze
my hand. Oliver?

161
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,907
Curtain 3 is open.

162
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,515
Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.

163
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,016
- Damien. My wife, Corazon.
- Hello.

164
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,848
Sam, did you ever call Kelly?

165
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,651
I didn't think so, because
now she's coming to see you.

166
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,315
Let me know when she gets here.

167
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,691
- You don't see many of these.
- It's a negative pressure ventilator.

168
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,425
When the air is sucked out of
the chamber, it flows into his lungs.

169
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,467
I had polio when I was 3. Don't
breathe too well on my own.

170
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,629
- Is that why you're here today?
- No, fever...

171
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,808
abdominal pain,
possible appendicitis.

172
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,772
I'm a retired RN.

173
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,811
- I need to get a BP.
- I'm gonna need to examine his belly.

174
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,778
There are portholes on the side.

175
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,713
Stick your arms through the
neoprene if you wanna poke me.

176
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,376
All right.

177
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,057
Are you in this all the time?

178
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,995
We have three kids,
so, no, not all the time.

179
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,258
I use it 18 hours a day.

180
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,798
- How long have you guys been together?
- Forty-five years.

181
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,552
I got an e-mail from Yale.

182
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,868
They want two more
letters of recommendation.

183
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,739
That seems pointless if
Dubenko can offer you a position.

184
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,507
I'm not sure he thinks I'm
right for the job. Oh, man.

185
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,673
That's the head CT.

186
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,476
This must be the
lung mass, yikes.

187
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,818
- Where's the patient?
- LFTs and CBC.

188
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,255
Looks like the horse
is out of the barn.

189
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,726
Son's at bedside. No dad.

190
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,934
Donna, this is Dr. Rasgotra,
Dr. Dubenko. Her son.

191
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,194
- Hello.
- Dylan.

192
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,768
- Hello.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

193
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,200
I've reviewed the films...

194
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,830
and I'm sorry to say that the tumor
is far too advanced for surgery.

195
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,203
Are you sure?

196
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,404
With cancer in the liver, the brain
and bones, I'm afraid that an operation...

197
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,847
would only mean pain and
suffering without prolonging your life.

198
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,351
- It's in my bones?
- We think so.

199
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,323
- What about chemotherapy?
- It's possible, but...

200
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,120
We'll see what
the oncologists say.

201
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,357
Have you thought about
your wishes for life support?

202
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,400
Perhaps this is
better discussed later.

203
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,061
I made a living will
about 10 years ago.

204
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,537
I don't wanna be kept alive...

205
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,073
- if I have a terminal...
- Mom.

206
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,752
You might wanna
explore hospices.

207
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,903
We don't need to talk...

208
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,569
What's a hospice? What is that?

209
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,944
A way to keep people comfortable
in the final stages of illness.

210
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,550
Are you saying that...?

211
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,244
Look, we're gonna come back...

212
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,049
after you've had a little
bit more time to consider.

213
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,884
Yeah. BRENNER: Okay.

214
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,618
Doctors?

215
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,087
- What are you doing?
- What?

216
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,825
I asked for surgical opinion,
not for the Grim Reaper.

217
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,094
I was being truthful.

218
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,602
They have barely processed
the cancer diagnosis...

219
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,501
You want me to
sugarcoat it? To lie?

220
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,505
I want you to give
them a bit of hope.

221
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,406
Maybe there's something
positive to offer. Thoracentesis?

222
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,638
Good idea. That should
make her feel better.

223
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,078
Good, well, why
don't we lead with...

224
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,945
Frank said you guys
have fresh coffee.

225
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,490
I hope you have half-and-half.

226
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:38,291
Okay, I'll just
make a fresh pot.

227
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,526
Oh, okay.

228
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,464
Hi, I'm Kelly.

229
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,263
Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.

230
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,599
Oh. What kind of doctor are you?

231
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,106
Well, this is an ER, so...

232
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,971
That must be complicated.

233
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,272
You gotta know a lot
of stuff about everything.

234
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,642
How long you worked here?

235
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,477
- A couple of years.
- Cool.

236
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,985
I've only been in town for two
nights, and I'm craving deep-dish pizza.

237
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,488
Oh, Lou Malnati's.

238
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,886
Oh, yeah?

239
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,119
Yeah, that sounds great.

240
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,288
What are you doing for dinner?

241
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,499
I don't think that would
be such a good idea.

242
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,160
Why not?

243
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,500
I just got out of
a relationship.

244
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,671
When you fall off a bike,
you get right back on it.

245
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,038
You got a sesame seed.

246
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,415
- Kelly?
- Sammy.

247
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,245
Wha...?

248
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,052
What are you...? Oh, my God.

249
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,518
- Hi.
- What are you...?

250
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,523
Oh, my God, look at you.

251
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,160
Look at you. Hi.

252
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,325
I'm really sorry to just
barge in on you at work.

253
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,360
You know, I got your message,
but I've been busy at work and...

254
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,593
No, that's fine.

255
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,567
So how do you two
know each other?

256
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,102
Tony, this is my sister, Kelly.

257
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,342
Tie up a few loose
ends, I could take a break.

258
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,747
I'll be fine, me and the
Home Shopping Network.

259
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,218
Ortho's on Line 4, and they
need you at the lung tap.

260
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,880
Go save some lives.

261
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,423
Stay out of trouble.

262
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,424
That's your sister, huh?

263
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,223
- She seems very nice.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,457
- Ortho?
- Sam, cytology and culture on this.

265
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,260
Take a deep breath.

266
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,566
- Much easier.
- Good, we can pull three liters.

267
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,074
- Dylan, it's late, you should go.
- I'm not going.

268
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,573
He has an audition today for
the Juilliard School in New York.

269
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,716
- Impressive.
- What instrument?

270
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:37,942
English horn.

271
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,609
I used to play the viola.
The English horn is lovely.

272
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:44,417
Honey, they're only here once a
year. You might never get another shot.

273
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,253
I'm much better. You
think it's okay if he goes?

274
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,828
- Yeah, I don't see why not.
- It'd be best to stay.

275
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:54,467
With the extent of your disease, things
could suddenly take a turn for the worse.

276
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,398
- You mean, that could happen today?
- That's pretty unlikely.

277
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,073
Yeah, I should, I should stay.

278
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,004
- Dylan...
- Mom, I'm staying.

279
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,940
Let's wait a bit and see
how she's doing, okay?

280
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,310
- Sam, you seen the old guy?
- Not in a while.

281
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,510
Oxygen's off, so
are the monitors.

282
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,348
- Looks like he eloped.
- Great.

283
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,956
- What happened?
- I think we lost a patient.

284
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,616
- Check the bathroom.
- We can see your polio guy now.

285
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,261
I need you on a paramedic run.

286
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,192
Tell my sister it's
gonna be a while.

287
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,026
I gotta find a
demented grandpa...

288
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,669
pick up an incoming off a rig and
pull a patient out of an iron lung.

289
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,507
April Robinson, syncopal
episode at Walgreen's, still altered.

290
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,550
- Any seizure activity?
- No.

291
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,951
- What's up with the handcuffs?
- Passed out, busted for shoplifting.

292
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,989
- How convenient.
- No, she's real.

293
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,356
Blood sugar is over 400,
12 lead EKG, negative for MI.

294
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,690
I gave a liter of saline
and got her sats up.

295
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,522
- What do we have? ZADRO:
This lady fainted at Woolworth's.

296
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,066
- Heart history?
- You got me.

297
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,737
- Doesn't have a pulse. MORRIS:
When did she stop breathing?

298
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,238
They pay me to drive them to the
hospital. Lucky I had an oxygen tank.

299
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,038
- She needs a cardiac arrest cart.
- It may be too late for that.

300
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,921
Dilated appendix,
non-compressible.

301
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,751
- So I'll need surgery?
- Yes, most definitely.

302
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,257
- Can it be done with the laparoscope?
- We'll try.

303
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,158
Sometimes we have to convert
to a conventional procedure.

304
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,298
- You mean opening up my belly.
- Yeah.

305
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,428
I use my abdominal
muscles to help me breathe.

306
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,872
His friend had colon surgery
and ended up traked for life.

307
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,165
All right, well, we'll
do the best we can.

308
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,401
Dr. Rasgotra will be
back with the consent form.

309
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,072
- He's a perfect candidate for NOTES.
- What?

310
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,772
Natural Orifice Transluminal
Endoscopic Surgery.

311
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,248
You wanna remove his
appendix through his mouth?

312
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,411
He needs the least invasive
procedure, and NOTES is it.

313
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,580
We don't do that
here. It's experimental.

314
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,750
There's Dr. Horta from San
Diego doing trials at Northwestern.

315
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,054
He's had over 50 cases.

316
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,357
You're cutting a hole in his
stomach, setting up for peritonitis.

317
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,968
It's a 2-millimeter incision that's
occluded by a balloon and transport.

318
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,036
When you're done,
you close with g-Prox.

319
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,230
- They've had success.
- Wanna call this guy?

320
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,874
Chance to be state-of-the-art.

321
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,910
See if he's willing to help
and available today? Long shot.

322
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,908
Blood sugar's down to 350.
Neela wants me in Curtain 2.

323
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,313
Drop the insulin to five
an hour before you go.

324
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,284
- What's going on here?
- Your diabetes is out of control.

325
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,050
- Paramedics brought you to the ER.
- Think of it as a pit stop before jail.

326
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,922
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take it easy.

327
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,087
- Step out until she's medically cleared.
- I didn't do anything.

328
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,665
Camera shows you
pocketing lipstick and mascara.

329
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,335
I was gonna pay for
that. I got distracted.

330
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,665
You can't keep me. My
daughter needs me home.

331
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,865
Should've thought about that before.
- Hey, come on, officer.

332
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,570
Can I ask you a question?

333
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,009
"I was gonna pay for
it." What a load of crap.

334
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,480
You know, she doesn't
seem like a crook.

335
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,482
- Does she have any priors?
- Any priors?

336
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,848
You have been
hanging out with Claudia.

337
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,354
- Hey, Morris, we found him.
- Excuse me.

338
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,083
Outside, barely conscious.

339
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,750
Pulse ox, 78 on room air.

340
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,419
Probably blossoming pulmonary
contusions from trauma.

341
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,122
- Open an airway tray at 8-0.
- Where's Sam?

342
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,961
On her way.

343
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,167
- Are we gonna do this?
- Yeah.

344
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,134
This guy could
be sharp as a tack.

345
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,798
- What do you need?
- Sublingual captopril, four of morphine.

346
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,376
Hey, Sammy, I've been
here for, like, two hours.

347
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,777
- It's kind of a bad time.
- I know, I just can't really wait around.

348
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,281
- I got appointments.
- Can you just let us finish?

349
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,511
- Has everyone met Sam's sister?
- I didn't know you had a sister.

350
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,882
- Hello.
- Hi.

351
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,286
Sam, take a break.
Chuny will take over.

352
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,825
Yeah, you know, looks
like you could use one.

353
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,056
Hey, doc, we busted the mugger.

354
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,202
I got an empty wallet and a
retirement watch from County.

355
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,631
Maybe he worked here.

356
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,965
- Suction on high.
- Call for a vent.

357
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,473
End tidal CO2 detector.

358
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,543
You look good.

359
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,078
I mean, considering the last time I
saw you, we were both in pigtails.

360
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,341
Yeah.

361
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,644
Yeah, it's been
a really long time.

362
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,014
We got some catching up.

363
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,580
You wanna go to
dinner? I get off at 8.

364
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:15,888
Uh... No, you know, my flight's at
7:30, and I've got my last meeting at 5.

365
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,394
What kind of meetings?

366
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,397
Well, I'm here for
the apparel show.

367
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,501
Oh, my God, I
remember those dresses...

368
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,570
you used to make for your
Cabbage Patch Kids, oh, my.

369
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,730
What, you actually
turned that into a job?

370
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,535
Yeah.

371
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:36,079
My clothing line just got bought
by Billabong for about $2 million.

372
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,716
- You're kidding.
- No.

373
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,715
You're kidding me.

374
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,581
Yeah, it's...

375
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,121
Well, I've got to travel
to Europe and Japan...

376
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,124
- to launch the new collection, so...
- Wow.

377
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:53,295
Wow. What, did you just come all
the way from Dallas to rub it in my face?

378
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,626
No.

379
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,703
No, I came to talk about Mom.

380
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,006
I had to move her
to assisted living.

381
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,445
You know, her
emphysema got worse.

382
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,550
- Yeah, well, three packs a day will do it.
- She also had a stroke.

383
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,651
You know, I visit
her, like, twice a week.

384
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,917
And it's not a lot, but
it makes her happy.

385
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,427
And I'm gonna be traveling
for months at a time, so...

386
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,568
You know, I wanna
move her to Chicago.

387
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,729
- No, please don't.
- I'll pay for everything.

388
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:36,433
Her moving expenses, living expenses.
All you've gotta do is just go visit her.

389
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,078
Look, I've been doing this for
a really long time now, okay?

390
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,078
- I think it's your turn.
- No, it's not.

391
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,682
Look, she's your mother.

392
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,852
You know, even after
everything, she's still your mother.

393
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,681
Who I haven't spoken
to since I was 15.

394
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,955
Well, you know, maybe
it's time that changed too.

395
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,796
All right, I'm in. Bag him.

396
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,434
AC, 14, tidal volume, 500.

397
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:06,003
Have Frank check personnel records,
see if we can figure out who he is.

398
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,663
Post-expansion pulmonary edema.

399
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,833
- Let's get her son back over here.
- He went to his audition.

400
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,002
- I thought he'd stay.
- I said he could go.

401
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,148
- How soon can he get back?
- I don't know.

402
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,977
We need BiPAP and
set up for an intubation.

403
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,209
Intubation?

404
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,048
She has a living will, she
asked for no heroic measures.

405
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,690
Okay, Donna, Donna, I
need to ask you a question.

406
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,621
- Donna? Donna?
- I should call her son.

407
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,785
Exactly what I didn't
wanna have happen.

408
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,228
Start with the BiPAP. It's
noninvasive, in the spirit of her wishes.

409
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,460
- That's a good idea.
- This isn't a surgical problem.

410
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,332
You're the primary physician
on the case, so you call it.

411
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,235
Let's go, Neela.

412
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,786
Did you reach the son?

413
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,388
No. I might have to intubate.

414
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,217
With a DNR? Can
you even do that?

415
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,326
Well, temporarily. I can
always remove it later.

416
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,224
I promised her son she would
be alive when he got back.

417
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,660
I see. BRENNER: Wait.

418
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,291
There's fluid around the heart. We
can drain that, buy her some time.

419
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,768
Neela, Dr. Horta's here
on your Porta-Lung appy.

420
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,736
PeriVac kit, Betadine.

421
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,001
Well, good luck.

422
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,644
Serum ketones are negative.

423
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,177
- Is that a problem? MORRIS:
Medically, it's good news.

424
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:25,441
But it means we have no reason
to keep you in the hospital overnight.

425
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,777
So I'm going to jail?

426
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,286
I think they'll let you
out if you pay a fine.

427
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,583
I don't have the money.

428
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,623
What about a loan?

429
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,285
They won't give you a
credit if you don't have a job.

430
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,126
Ever since I got laid off,
I've been cleaning houses.

431
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,530
Barely covers the rent.

432
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,070
- My daughter.
- Your daughter?

433
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,536
Pregnant.

434
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,801
On bed rest.

435
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,809
I'm trying to buy
her a crib and stuff.

436
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,711
You can talk to a social
worker about getting some help.

437
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,709
I have worked
hard my whole life.

438
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,653
I've raised two babies,
never been on welfare.

439
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,088
I had to get my medicine.

440
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,724
- So why would you...?
- Steal a tube of lipstick?

441
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,734
I return it for store credit.

442
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:23,474
Use the credit
to buy my insulin.

443
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,739
It works.

444
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,680
Dr. Morris.

445
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,547
We're making some
progress IDing your old guy.

446
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,492
There's a patient missing from
a nursing home on Dearborn.

447
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,062
Fits his age and description.

448
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,597
You hear that, Oliver?

449
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,360
Sounds like we found
out where you belong.

450
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,436
- Systolic's down to 80.
- Run in a liter.

451
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,696
You need a hand?

452
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,103
I just need to thread the
catheter over the guide wire.

453
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,247
There's the pericardial
fluid. It should help.

454
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,716
I'll check another
blood pressure, doctor?

455
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,624
What's wrong?

456
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,893
What do you need? You in pain?

457
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,937
- Relax, you're okay. BRENNER:
Hit him with some Versed.

458
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,775
"TB."

459
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,116
TB?

460
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,287
By any chance, does your
lady have tuberculosis?

461
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,618
No, she has cancer.

462
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,993
You're sure?

463
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,595
Do you have a confirmation
on the path report?

464
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,097
It'd be unusual, but TB
could explain everything.

465
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,998
Infection in the lung, the bone,
liver, the brain, around the heart.

466
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,596
You need a sputum stain for AFB.

467
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,002
Better get a mask on her.

468
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,438
You think your guy was a doctor?

469
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,977
Oliver, were you a doctor?

470
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,477
Wouldn't pull you out
if it wasn't important.

471
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,143
Real quick, what's
the fine for shoplifting?

472
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,087
And the maximum jail time?

473
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,490
No, the guys didn't
put me up to this.

474
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,856
Thank you. Get back to class.

475
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,992
- You don't look like you've good news.
- Could be up to six months.

476
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,501
All jails are overcrowded.
It won't be that long.

477
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,639
Her daughter's having
her baby next week.

478
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,502
Hey, Morris.

479
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,673
Okay, I will be back
as soon as I can.

480
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,507
Excuse me, my captain wants to
know how much longer she's gonna be.

481
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,616
- This needs to run in over an hour.
- I thought she was ready.

482
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,618
- If I discharge her, she'll bounce back.
- I gotta call the station.

483
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,846
You know what sucks?

484
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,116
There are guys stealing
cars, shooting guns.

485
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,455
- You're here babysitting a decent lady.
- I'm just doing my job.

486
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,191
- Where's Brenner?
- He ran to the lab.

487
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,630
We think this lady has TB.

488
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,066
Yeah, and this guy
might have figured it out.

489
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,636
Really?

490
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,570
- How long does an AFB stain take?
- Less than an hour.

491
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,337
"To O.M.K. 35 years of service."

492
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,577
Oh, my God.

493
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,015
Do you know who this is?

494
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,849
Yeah, this is Dr. Oliver Kostin.

495
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,356
As in <i>Kostin's Textbook
of Emergency Medicine?</i>

496
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,390
He's a legend.

497
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,560
- Dr. Morgenstern.
- The one and only.

498
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,359
Hey, Chuny. So good to see you.

499
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,899
So good to see you.

500
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,934
This is Dr. Morris
and Dr. Gates.

501
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,332
- Hi.
- Hello.

502
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,736
Dr. Morgenstern ran
this place back in the day.

503
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,900
- What are you doing here?
- I got a call from the nursing home.

504
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,672
Ollie, you gotta stop wandering.

505
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,508
Are you his doctor?

506
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,047
No, his proxy.

507
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,048
His wife died a few years ago.

508
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,780
They never had any children, so
I got a durable power of attorney.

509
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,184
You must have been close.

510
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,019
He taught me everything.

511
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,761
Treated me like a son.

512
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,396
He knows you're here.

513
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,088
And he's having a good day.

514
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,360
What's his baseline?

515
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,732
Multi-infarct dementia
and going downhill fast.

516
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,532
Mm.

517
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,902
He had a great mind.

518
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,068
Now, there's nothing left.

519
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,042
Well, something's
going on in there.

520
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,977
He thinks that lady
has tuberculosis.

521
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,080
Does she?

522
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,555
We don't know yet.

523
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,659
The swelling
behind the right ear.

524
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,226
Could be scrofula.

525
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,955
It's a TB-infected lymph node.

526
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,623
Used to be in the
textbooks, it's not anymore.

527
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,964
- So if he's right, he's still capable...
- No.

528
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,606
It's a flash of an old memory.

529
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,469
Every once in a while, a
stimulus, a sight or a sound...

530
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,669
brings up something from
the past, but it doesn't last long.

531
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,508
For all intents and purposes, he
doesn't interact with the present.

532
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,948
He hardly speaks.

533
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,914
I brought a copy
of his DNR order.

534
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,921
So we shouldn't have tubed him?

535
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,627
He never wanted
to end up like this.

536
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,594
Could we take him off the vent?
Maybe move him into a private room?

537
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,323
Sure.

538
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,366
What about Trauma 1?

539
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:19,300
He might be
getting a few visitors.

540
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,499
You know, the ER
used to end right here.

541
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:28,807
He designed your trauma rooms
and got them built 40 years ago.

542
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,812
Dr. Horta cleared his entire
schedule to operate on you.

543
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,214
- Thanks, doc.
- My pleasure.

544
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,015
- We'll see you upstairs.
- I'll be right behind you, honey.

545
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:41,052
I'm really looking
forward to this.

546
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,218
It's gonna blow your mind.

547
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,295
Oh, Lucien, this is
Dr. Horta from San Diego.

548
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,400
Oh, hi. Yeah, I've
heard all about you.

549
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,559
So this thing's
really gonna happen?

550
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,035
- We're all set to go.
- Oh, you should scrub in.

551
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,867
I can't, I've got a couple
of cases to check in on.

552
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,238
- Let the residents do it.
- Go ahead, I'll be in and out, you guys.

553
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,140
- Let's take the stairs.
- Okay.

554
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,872
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

555
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,582
Lucien, I heard about the
NOTES appy. Pretty cool.

556
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,344
Yeah, it is pretty cool.

557
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,420
Excuse me, officer.

558
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,490
How can I stay at home when
they're sending you off to jail?

559
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:13,990
You need to be on bed rest.

560
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,560
This is crazy,
Mom. This isn't you.

561
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,890
Dr. Morris, this is
April's daughter, Kendra.

562
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,930
- Hello.
- Hello. Is she okay now?

563
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,897
Her diabetes is
back under control.

564
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,367
Mom, why would you
do something like this?

565
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:30,100
- I don't know, I guess I wasn't thinking.
- Your mother was trying to help.

566
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,712
This is between her and me, thank you.
- Mom, talk to me.

567
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,438
BP's way up, 170/100.
We should let her rest.

568
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,277
Yeah, I think
you're upsetting her.

569
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,213
What do you think
she's doing to me?

570
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,183
Sam, cycle the dynamap.

571
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,847
- Ow.
- Is that a contraction?

572
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,084
Kyle, grab a gurney,
let's get her up to OB.

573
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,388
- No problem.
- Slow deep breaths.

574
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,087
I'm okay. I don't need all that.

575
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,892
No, we have to
monitor your baby.

576
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,434
- Morris, positive AFB.
- Whoa.

577
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,534
ER's been exposed. Everybody
needs testing and follow-up.

578
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,038
We assumed it was a tumor...

579
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,540
but the other hospital
cytology was equivocal.

580
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,611
- Chuny, we're intubating.
- You are?

581
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,871
Positive TB stain.

582
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,039
She doesn't have cancer,
she has a treatable infection.

583
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,980
All right, GlideScope's ready.

584
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,585
Good call, Oliver.

585
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,222
TB is the great imitator.
That's what he taught us.

586
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,654
Twenty of etomidate,
100 of succinylcholine.

587
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,760
<i>Dr. Kostin, are you mad?</i>

588
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,830
Dr. Kostin, you can't give
succinylcholine down here.

589
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,090
I just did.

590
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,065
Paralytics and intubation
require an anesthesiologist.

591
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,396
I'll keep that in mind.

592
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,235
Your patient's too sick
for the emergency ward.

593
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,739
Patients like this
die in the elevator...

594
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,470
when we try to move them
up to the ICU without an airway.

595
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,039
Okay, gentlemen,
my work is done.

596
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,414
Beautiful shot of the cords.

597
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,024
Passing the tube.

598
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,286
Nice.

599
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,952
Sats are fine.

600
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,190
- Cuff is down.
- All right.

601
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,358
Deep breath in, Oliver.

602
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,863
And out.

603
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,975
David.

604
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,376
Where do we start rounds?

605
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,789
Right here, Ollie.

606
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,019
You're right where
you need to be.

607
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,422
Look, I have to get back.

608
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,396
But I'm really glad
you got in touch.

609
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,060
Yeah.

610
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,603
Yeah, you know, I've
been trying for 15 years.

611
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,473
Hasn't been easy.

612
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,075
You know, one day,
I had a big sister...

613
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:49,112
and then the next day, you took
off, just pregnant by some dude.

614
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,648
I didn't take off. Mom
kicked me out of the house.

615
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,114
- You could've called.
- She wouldn't let me talk to you.

616
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,779
- Written a letter.
- I did.

617
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,190
She must have tore them up.

618
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,487
I never knew that.

619
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,131
I had a baby. I had to work.

620
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,097
After a while, I
just stopped trying.

621
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,702
I figured you probably hated me.

622
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,130
I didn't.

623
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:24,614
You know, after you left, this
is the only guidance that I got.

624
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:25,842
My diary?

625
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,010
You must've left in a hurry,
found it underneath your mattress.

626
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,646
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

627
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,226
- What? Did you read this?
- Yeah, of course, like, a hundred times.

628
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:41,893
You taught me how to French
kiss, how to pierce my ears...

629
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,363
how to roll a joint. Heh.

630
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,305
- Six Flags?
- Yeah, when I was 7.

631
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,139
- That was the happiest day of my life.
- Oh, my God.

632
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,803
Mom took us home early...

633
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,383
because you puked your
funnel cake all over Shock Wave.

634
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,382
Oh, you are so wrong.

635
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,853
No, she took us home because
when she went to the bathroom...

636
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,185
you went and tried
to bum a cigarette.

637
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,556
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

638
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,694
You were grounded
for an entire week.

639
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,394
I was so stupid.

640
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,341
She's really bad, huh?

641
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,042
Yeah, it won't be long.

642
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,950
- Well, ICU could take Trauma 1.
- Okay, let's move Dr. Kostin.

643
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,517
- Dylan, how'd it go?
- It's okay. Where's my mom at?

644
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,126
She's in a different room
on a breathing machine...

645
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,696
but something amazing happened.

646
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,095
It turns out your mom
doesn't have cancer.

647
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,539
- Are you serious?
- It's tuberculosis.

648
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,466
They told us that...

649
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,235
Cells from other hospital
were suggestive of cancer...

650
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,312
but they weren't definitive.

651
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,612
So we ran a special
stain, and we found TB.

652
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,689
Thank you. Thank
you, that's incredible.

653
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,725
She's not out of the woods yet.

654
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,730
Well, if it's a drug-resistant strain,
then she's gonna have very rough course.

655
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,233
But it's better than cancer, right?
I mean, her prognosis, it's good?

656
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,803
We're gonna have to
keep you in isolation...

657
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:30,340
- till we find out you're not infectious.
- Not a problem.

658
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,479
Donna, there's
someone here to see you.

659
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,305
Mom, I heard the great news.

660
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,951
I kind of rocked it.

661
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,680
They're not supposed to
give feedback, but the head...

662
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,452
of the woodwind department
said, "See you in September."

663
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,937
Sam, I'm gonna be
up in the O.R. for a bit.

664
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,443
Prescription for insulin...

665
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,774
and an appointment
with a diabetes clinic.

666
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,110
- Where are you taking her?
- County jail.

667
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,980
Are you okay?

668
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,519
I got some medicine
to stop the contractions.

669
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,350
I have to wait till
the baby's ready.

670
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,048
- We should be going.
- Hold on.

671
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,524
You've got nothing to say?

672
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,288
You're not gonna
explain this to me?

673
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,830
Maybe later. She's
had a rough day.

674
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,869
I thought I was gonna have some help
with this baby, but I'll do it on my own.

675
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,337
I just thought you
wanted to be a part of it.

676
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,908
- But if this is how you want it, fine!
- Come here.

677
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,305
You know what? Come here.

678
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,139
- What are you doing?
- Come with me.

679
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,077
What's going on?

680
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,350
I need you to understand
what your mother's doing.

681
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,147
- Shoplifting makeup.
- To trade for insulin.

682
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:53,189
She loves you. She's made
sacrifices for you and your baby.

683
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,519
She almost died today...

684
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,561
because she ignored her
own health to buy you a crib.

685
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,496
- I didn't know.
- Yeah, she's too proud to say it.

686
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,397
I know it's hard, but try to
appreciate what you have.

687
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,214
Stump is tied off.

688
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,746
EndoShears.

689
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,620
Nicely done.

690
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,958
Tension as you pull, Neela.

691
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,891
They're still at it.

692
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,224
Yeah, you're just in
time for the big finish.

693
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,897
Appendix is out.

694
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,539
- How cool was that?
- Very.

695
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,042
- You heard about the TB case?
- Yeah.

696
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,274
G-Prox, please.

697
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,544
Yeah, we were all guilty
of diagnosis momentum.

698
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,382
Despite incomplete evidence,
we heard the word cancer...

699
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,286
and we all ran
down the wrong path.

700
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,390
It's a glimpse of
the future in there.

701
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:10,263
Yeah, I wasn't on board at
first, but Neela persisted, so...

702
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,500
Well, that's a good
quality to have.

703
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,267
Especially in an Attending.

704
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,811
There are a lot of candidates
this year, you know.

705
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,677
It's going to be
very competitive.

706
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:30,253
Well, whoever gets
her will be lucky.

707
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,351
You think he's really mad at me?

708
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,086
You did undermine his authority.

709
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,825
But it was in the
interest of the patient.

710
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:40,849
Yeah, I agree.

711
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,831
I think he must be in Trauma 1.

712
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,095
I just hope he doesn't
hurt my chances here.

713
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,296
Well, if it does,
then they're all crazy.

714
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,532
I can't imagine
anyone more brilliant...

715
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:54,840
and skilled and
compassionate and sexy.

716
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,977
And you'd better take a nap,
because you're gonna need it for later.

717
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,545
I was pre-med,
volunteering at the hospital...

718
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,714
when they made him chief in '68.

719
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,383
Back then, the ER was a glorified
walk-in clinic where you were seen...

720
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,827
by unsupervised interns
and residents with no training.

721
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,466
And the community
ERs were even worse.

722
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:21,163
Staffed by moonlighting dermatologists
and psychiatrists or drunks...

723
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,740
who'd been banned
from private practice.

724
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,306
There was no 911.

725
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,178
No paramedics.

726
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,941
And if you needed an ambulance,
you called a funeral home.

727
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,189
What the hell is that?

728
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,493
Ollie once said:

729
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:50,192
"You stand a better chance of
surviving a gunshot wound in Vietnam...

730
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,200
than a car crash in Chicago."

731
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,206
But he changed all that.

732
00:37:56,508 --> 00:38:02,505
He developed the 911 system, he
trained thousands of paramedics...

733
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,175
and started one of the finest residency
programs in emergency medicine.

734
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,718
You're all here
because of this guy.

735
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,596
Gunshot wound to the left
chest, dumped from a moving car.

736
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,067
- Lost the pulse.
- Starting compressions.

737
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:34,111
- Thoracotomy tray.
- Four of O-neg and Betadine.

738
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,610
Yankauer.

739
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,113
- Rapid infuser is primed.
- Prep for a subclavian.

740
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,323
- I need a cricoid.
- Hold compressions.

741
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,647
Okay, opening the chest now.

742
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,023
Shot in the chest
outside of a liquor store.

743
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,326
Ready? And lift.

744
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:59,165
Hold an elevator. He's gotta
go right up to the trauma ward.

745
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,771
Someday we're gonna take
care of guys like this down here.

746
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:07,310
- The surgeons will never sign off on that.
- You wait and see.

747
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,271
Dream on, Dr. Kostin.

748
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,157
Foley's in the heart defect.

749
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,758
Inflating to 20 cc's.

750
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,861
- Bleeding's slowing down.
- He's had six of O-neg, six of FFP.

751
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,360
I got a pulse, strong pulse.

752
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,761
Cardio-thoracic team's here.
- Take him away, guys.

753
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,665
Door to O.R., 12 minutes.

754
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,601
Not bad. MORRIS: Yup.

755
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,105
He could walk
out of the hospital.

756
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,614
How are you doing, Ollie?

757
00:39:58,296 --> 00:39:59,958
Another two of morphine.

758
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,656
Got it.

759
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,406
Let's TKO his fluids.

760
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,369
He's bradying down.

761
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,036
Might as well
turn off the alarm.
