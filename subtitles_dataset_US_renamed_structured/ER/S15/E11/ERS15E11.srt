1
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,365
<i>Previously on</i> ER: - I
told you about Keith, right?

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,022
- Sarah's dad? GATES:
He just snapped.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,009
I said, "You're not
my problem anymore."

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,239
You know, I turned my
back on my best friend.

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,542
I heard you were looking for me.

6
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,243
- I was worried about you.
- That means something.

7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,752
- Alex.
- Did I miss Christmas?

8
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,289
Alex always wanted a
dog. I thought it'd be cool...

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,927
Tony, it's over.

10
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,757
- Good thinking.
- You're blushing.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,264
So I was thinking
about us having a family.

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,934
Starting again.

13
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,722
Coming through. BARDELLI:
Multiple GSW's to the chest.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,119
- Pulseless.
- Out of the way.

15
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,805
- Two rounds epi, atropine.
- O-neg, prime the infuser.

16
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,863
- What you guys got?
- Drug-deal shootout. He got it worst.

17
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,795
- Need help?
- Sure, jump on.

18
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,959
- He's gonna need a thoracotomy.
- No vitals, doesn't make sense.

19
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,536
Let's open him up for MRB.

20
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,605
MRB? Maximum resident benefit.

21
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,293
- I know what it is.
- Good idea.

22
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,377
- Grab interns, assign procedures.
- You're gonna practice?

23
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,706
They've done
thoracotomies, we'll be ready.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,645
- Besides, it could save his life.
- Open up a tray, please.

25
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,216
Central line kit and, uh,
prep for a chest tube, huh?

26
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,578
Coming right up.

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,846
Okay.

28
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,837
Maybe we did the chart wrong.

29
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,642
The timing could be off,
the book said that we...

30
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,012
And it was just a month.

31
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:05,255
- We don't need to do this, you know.
- I thought you wanted this.

32
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,792
I mean, we have other options.

33
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,829
There's a lot of kids out
there that need good homes.

34
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,263
I want to have our baby.

35
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,695
So do I.

36
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,696
So, what are you saying?

37
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,643
Nothing, just
trying to be realistic.

38
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,709
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

39
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,509
So are we crazy even
thinking about this?

40
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,414
Probably.

41
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,054
But why should
we let that stop us?

42
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,716
Hmm? Stranger things
have happened, right?

43
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:45,695
- And you know I so do love trying.
- Oh, I bet you do.

44
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,396
Asystole.

45
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,837
Two more liters are in.

46
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,669
- We almost done here?
- We're teaching, Sam.

47
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,540
You're doing procedures
on a dead body.

48
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,739
The interns need practice.
You got a problem?

49
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,077
No, but there are some living
patients that could use our help.

50
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,811
Feel free to step outside.

51
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,321
Looks like they're bringing
in three more GSW's.

52
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,723
Why's it feel like we get
gunshot victims every day?

53
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,423
- Because we do.
- Guns don't kill. People kill people.

54
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,499
Great about Alex. I
know it's been hard.

55
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,431
- Thank you, Dawn.
- What about Alex?

56
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,661
Coming home today.

57
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,071
Discharged him?
When did you find out?

58
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,265
Couple days ago.

59
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,911
Jermaine Bennett, 17,
abdominal GSW left costal margin.

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,875
- Please, it hurts so bad.
- 100/60, tachy to 120.

61
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,381
- You on medications?
- No.

62
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,543
- Any allergies? JERMAINE:
No. Where's my brother?

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,882
His brother, Quincy.
Through and through.

64
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,354
- How you doing, Quincy?
- I'm all right.

65
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,685
Pedal pulse intact.

66
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,260
Daria, Gates, go
with Sam, Trauma 2.

67
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,561
Let's start him off
on a gram of cefoxitin.

68
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,429
- We use cefotetan now.
- All right. That'll work too.

69
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,436
- Get off of me.
- Yeah, you gonna love this one.

70
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,234
- Shot the guy they brought in earlier.
- Don't touch me!

71
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,469
Serena Diaz, graze wound
to the left triceps, good vitals.

72
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,239
- A real pain in the ass.
- Wish you'd get some of this.

73
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,144
- Lot of lip on you.
- Shut up, bitch!

74
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,410
- Trauma 1's open.
- Looks pretty superficial.

75
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,111
Take these things off. Not
like I'm going anywhere!

76
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,882
- Relax.
- Grady, you should take her.

77
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,548
I cannot feel my arm!

78
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,523
Do I have to?

79
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,158
Anastasia Johnson, 13
years old, sickle-cell disease.

80
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,893
Has had abdominal
pain since yesterday.

81
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Any fever?

82
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,838
No. Her CBC and her
chest x-ray are still pending.

83
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,842
Okay, um, does this feel like
your usual sickle-crisis pain?

84
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,138
No, this hurts more.

85
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,613
Start with 10 IV morphine,
titrate up from there.

86
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,516
Isn't that kind of a big
dosage for a 13-year-old?

87
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,552
Not for a sickler with pain.

88
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,917
Aren't you worried
about addiction?

89
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,356
Would you withhold morphine
from a cancer patient?

90
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,551
Exactly.

91
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,857
- You guys are going to admit me?
- Not sure yet.

92
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,660
I always get admitted.

93
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,326
- Does it hurt here?
- Ow! Yeah.

94
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,529
Get a right upper
quadrant ultrasound.

95
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:43,442
- Do you think I'll be out by next week?
- You might not have to stay.

96
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,747
But if I do, do you think
I'll be out by next Saturday?

97
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,007
Why? What's next Saturday?

98
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,378
I'm going to New
York to meet Yo-Yo Ma.

99
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,848
The cellist?

100
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,183
I baked cupcakes for three
days straight and sold every one.

101
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,849
Wow.

102
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,552
And I haven't touched my allowance
in months. Airfare's expensive.

103
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,219
You're paying your own way?

104
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,389
- You must be a big fan.
- I'm not just a fan.

105
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,559
It's my destiny to meet and someday
perform with the great Mr. Ma.

106
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:15,773
I'm sorry. Uh, this is new, and I
haven't figured out how to mute it yet.

107
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,810
Want me to fix that for you?
My dad has the same phone.

108
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,072
- Would you?
- Mm-hm.

109
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,306
Thank you.

110
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,246
At your age, the chance
of conceiving on your own...

111
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,149
and carrying a pregnancy to
term is about 1 percent per cycle.

112
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,119
It's not great odds.

113
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,620
Oh, um...

114
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,421
- What about in vitro?
- It's a long shot.

115
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,793
- So is 1 percent per cycle.
- Ha, ha. It's an expensive long shot.

116
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,127
But possible?

117
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,668
How does your
husband feel about this?

118
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,329
It's something we both
want. We're in it together.

119
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,473
All right. Well...

120
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,135
I would need an FSH level to look
at your ovarian responsiveness...

121
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,645
- as well as estradiol and prolactin.
- Okay.

122
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,947
Can you stop by the, uh, outpatient
lab today? I'll write up a slip.

123
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:07,789
Or if you have the time I could
do a quick blood draw right now.

124
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,295
- I'm not on for half an hour.
- Okay.

125
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,135
Okay, um, any chance you can
just hold still while I check you out?

126
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,007
- So how did this happen, Quincy?
- I don't know.

127
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,441
The guy just started shooting.

128
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,445
Posterior tibial and
D.P. sound good.

129
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,674
Is my brother okay?

130
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,980
Um, let me check on him for you. A
gram of Ancef and update his tetanus.

131
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,851
- Okay.
- Thanks.

132
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,319
A small amount of fluid in
the sub-diaphragmatic space.

133
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,622
His splenorenal recess?

134
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,289
Distal neurovascular's
intact on the thigh wound.

135
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,368
Get a CT angio. It's a little
close to the femoral artery.

136
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,028
- Uh, it don't even hurt no more.
- That's the morphine.

137
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:56,233
- Systolic's up to 120.
- You're not gonna need surgery.

138
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,878
- Where's my brother at, man?
- Next room over there.

139
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,775
D-five half at 100 an hour.

140
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,707
- Yo, Quince, you all right in there?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,747
There's nothing to worry
about. You just chill out, okay?

142
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,013
All right.

143
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,022
He wouldn't be here if you
didn't have him selling drugs.

144
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,751
- Did I ask you? DARIA:
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

145
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,419
- Sam, how's the hemocue?
- I'm doing it right now.

146
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,596
You could have told me about
Alex. I was worried, you know that.

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,995
How would I know that?

148
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,507
- Hemocue's 13.2.
- Set up the rapid infuser to be safe.

149
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,007
Out being serviced. I'll
grab one from the O.R.

150
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,736
Uh, we need to uncuff him.
Gotta get some work done here.

151
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:37,816
- That really necessary?
- Yeah, it's really necessary.

152
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,080
We should have results
by the end of the day.

153
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,418
- That soon?
- Well, I have friends in the lab.

154
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:49,529
- Janet, I thank you.
- Don't thank me yet. We'll talk later.

155
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,721
Whoa. Hold that.

156
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,062
- Oh, hi, Dr. Banfield.
- Sam.

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,607
Got three GSW's.
Drug deal gone bad.

158
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,745
Just in time to start my shift.

159
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:12,117
- Oh, how's your, uh, boy doing?
- He's better. He's coming home today.

160
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,120
- You must be relieved.
- Yeah. You can say that again.

161
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,926
I just gave blood.

162
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,994
- Get off!
- I need to examine you.

163
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,897
You're not gonna
examine. Get off!

164
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,561
- Lady, come on now.
- Nobody touches me! You hear me?

165
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,762
Hey, Jermaine.

166
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,966
You and your brother better come
up with 5 grand or you're dead.

167
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,441
- Ma'am, please.
- Get the hell away from me.

168
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,682
- No rebound or guarding.
- Repeat CBC in an hour.

169
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,946
Dr. Morris, may I
please join you?

170
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,320
- Why, you can't handle your patient?
- She's a lot.

171
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,826
- One crazy bitch is what she is.
- Fine. Go clear some patients.

172
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,863
- Infuser's primed if you need it.
- This one going to O.R.?

173
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,660
- Maybe.
- No.

174
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,769
Dr. Rasgotra?

175
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,371
Probably doesn't need
an ex-lap, but we'll wait.

176
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,598
- Who's next door?
- Little brother.

177
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,267
- Stable lower extremity wound.
- We have to rule out vascular injury.

178
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,810
- Do you want the findings?
- I got it. What's his name?

179
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,449
Quincy.

180
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,683
- Hi, Quincy. How you doing?
- Fine.

181
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,791
- Any pain in this leg?
- No.

182
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,225
Quincy, we need to call your parents.
Do you know how we can reach them?

183
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,728
Are they at home? Or work?

184
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,126
Is Jermaine all right?

185
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,202
Well, we're working hard
to make sure that he is.

186
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,432
Honey, it's scary. But it's important.
Know how we can find your parents?

187
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,171
They're dead. They're both dead.

188
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,947
I'll be right back.

189
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,744
- Pressure down to 60 systolic.
- Taching away at 120.

190
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,890
- Two more units on infuser.
- He may have opened his spleen.

191
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,650
- CT can take him.
- See blood?

192
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,920
- Can't tell. SAM:
Bradying down.

193
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:06,658
- Oh, I'll get the crash cart.
- You missed the decreased breath sound.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,829
Bullet went through the
chest, not the abdomen.

195
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,462
- Tracheal shift and elevated neck veins.
- Tension pneumo.

196
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,375
Heart rate's coming up.

197
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,344
So's the BP.

198
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,507
Open up a chest
tube tray, 32 French.

199
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,119
- You want some help?
- I think can handle it.

200
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,550
Get that off me.
Man, what you doing?

201
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,522
Some pressure here.

202
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,757
- Got your oh-silk.
- Trachea's midline.

203
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,359
Good breath sounds on the left.

204
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,899
Where'd Quincy go?

205
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,230
Getting an x-ray to
make sure his leg's okay.

206
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,863
- Sats are up to 98.
- Oh, man, I can't believe this.

207
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,408
What? That you got shot doing a
drug deal? Occupational hazard.

208
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,380
All right. Keep him at 5 liters.

209
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,450
- Ready for dressing.
- We're out of xeroform. I'll be back.

210
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,487
Is this Jermaine Bennett?

211
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,782
- I'm Dr. Banfield.
- Detective Reitz.

212
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,823
Uh, I need to ask
him a few questions.

213
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,653
I ain't got no answers for you.

214
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,628
- Well, is that right?
- Probably not a good call, Jermaine.

215
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,727
I'll see you at the arraignment.
How soon till you can move him?

216
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,430
Still has to do a CT, may
need surgery. Let you know.

217
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,135
Okay. Hey, you have
yourself a good day, Jermaine.

218
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,302
Elastoplast and
bandage scissors.

219
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,573
Dr. Gates, go. You
were off an hour ago.

220
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,809
- Oh, thank you.
- Another ABG in 20, please.

221
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,578
I'm gonna be back, Dr. Banfield.

222
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:37,453
- Hey, Tony. Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Why?

223
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,788
- I don't know. I was just wondering.
- I'm fine.

224
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,527
So, uh, this is how it's
gonna be from now on?

225
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,429
- What?
- You and me. This is how it's gonna be?

226
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,503
Tony, I don't wanna have
this conversation now, please.

227
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,506
Sam, I apologize. I
take full responsibility...

228
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:59,544
You taking responsibility
now doesn't change anything.

229
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,146
You put my kid in the ICU.

230
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,215
How long you planning
on being pissed?

231
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,615
You know, I don't know.
Okay? This is not easy for me.

232
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,982
I shouldn't have to
put up with this working.

233
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,555
- That's your problem.
- What?

234
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,191
How is any of this about you?

235
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,156
You giving me crap
makes it about me.

236
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,125
You've no idea what
I've gone through.

237
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,697
- Because you don't tell me.
- You don't listen!

238
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,664
- What's that mean?
- Never mind. Damn...

239
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,861
I am not gonna do this
right now. Okay? Please?

240
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,504
- Please.
- All right, Sam.

241
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,042
It doesn't have to be like this.

242
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,305
Look, what happened
was horrible...

243
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,879
but Sarah and Alex
are gonna be okay.

244
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,310
A girl died, Tony.

245
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,351
And my kid came pretty close.

246
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,493
That is not okay.

247
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,056
You know what?

248
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,756
You do you and I'll do me...

249
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,767
and we'll just go our
separate ways, okay?

250
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,215
She needs a good exam. There's
risk of a neuro-vascular injury.

251
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,714
She's very intimidating.

252
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,715
Learn how to deal
with a difficult patient.

253
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,788
She threatened to kill me, Dr. Morris.
My family, my friends, my dog too.

254
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,287
I don't even have a dog.

255
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,925
- How's she been?
- Pretty quiet.

256
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,062
For a change.

257
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,925
All right, kid, watch and learn.

258
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,196
- Ma'am, we need to examine you.
- You're not touching me.

259
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,861
You could have an injury
to a blood vessel, a nerve.

260
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,200
- So?
- We need to give you a full examination.

261
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,038
You touch me without consent,
I'm gonna sue you for assault.

262
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,077
- Listen, ma'am...
- Damn it, no!

263
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,080
What? I gotta spell it out
for you jerkoffs? Go away!

264
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,152
I am totally learning.

265
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,060
Hey, Tony.

266
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,671
Hey.

267
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,274
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Sorry. I got stuck at work.

268
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,904
- How are the new digs?
- It's kind of a dump.

269
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,548
Beats the hell out of
sleeping in the park, though.

270
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,912
- Johns Hopkins? You leaving us?
- Frank.

271
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,921
This is my turf. I don't go up to the
O.R. messing around with your stuff.

272
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,151
- You going to Johns Hopkins?
- No. I'm just looking at a program.

273
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,954
Johns Hopkins?
Who's going to Hopkins?

274
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,256
- Dr. Rasgotra.
- I'm just looking.

275
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,455
Pediatric surgery?

276
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,863
Yeah, I'm thinking
about sub-specialties.

277
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,865
- Should talk to Banfield.
- Rather not.

278
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,264
Went to med school there.

279
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,805
Ultrasound results
for Anastasia Johnson.

280
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,768
Oh, gallstones. With wall
thickening and pericholecystic fluid.

281
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,504
Cholecystitis. I'll talk to her.

282
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,007
Apparently he jumped the
divider, hit them head-on.

283
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,779
Dr. Banfield, Dr. Coburn
called for you earlier.

284
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,014
- How much earlier?
- Uh, maybe 20 minutes.

285
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,216
Their parents, driver
of the car, killed.

286
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,451
Oh, my God.

287
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,323
For the last two years
Jermaine's been in a group home...

288
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:08,196
and Quincy has been in... One,
two, three, four different foster homes.

289
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,630
He keeps running away...

290
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,998
travels across the
city to see his brother.

291
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,037
So, what now?

292
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,641
Jermaine's in police custody.

293
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,506
And Quincy's foster mom told me
to give him bus fare, send him home.

294
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,475
- What?
- She's got three kids...

295
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,740
and a full-time job.

296
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,884
I'm gonna go find him a ride.
Keep me posted on his brother.

297
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,855
Uh, Dr. Banfield, I need you
to sign off on my Bell's Palsy.

298
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,425
Okay.

299
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,394
And my broken-ankle lady.

300
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,072
Dr. Martin, will there
be anything else?

301
00:16:55,715 --> 00:17:00,050
Yes, yes. Uh, yes,
Dr. Coburn, Cate Banfield.

302
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,023
Oh, uh, yes, of course. Um...

303
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,092
The PID patient got
cefoxitin and doxycycline...

304
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,855
we sent her up to the GYN floor.

305
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,392
Mm-hm.

306
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,236
Uh, yeah, anything else?

307
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,961
Yeah, I understand.

308
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,040
No. No hurry at all.

309
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:31,045
- Hi. How you feeling?
- Much better, thanks.

310
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,480
Can I get you anything?

311
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,483
- You're admitting me, aren't you?
- Yes.

312
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,089
You have an infection in your
gallbladder. You'll need IV antibiotics.

313
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,486
I knew it.

314
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,285
I'm sorry about New York.

315
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,225
I'll catch him in San Francisco.

316
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,128
Gonna need some
new cupcake recipes.

317
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,326
- Oh, and I fixed your phone.
- Oh, thank you.

318
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,733
I downloaded some
ringtones, couple games...

319
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,395
and also this cool koi pond.

320
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,098
Koi pond. Great.

321
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,743
Oh, and you got a text
from somebody named Ray.

322
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,311
- And, girl, he is cute.
- Wait. What?

323
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,675
I had him send a picture.

324
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,841
Don't worry. I told him it
was for whenever he called.

325
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm sorry, I hope you're
not mad. I couldn't resist.

326
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,186
What exactly did you text him?

327
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,525
I told him... I mean, you
were thinking about him too.

328
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,495
He said he was
thinking about me?

329
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,300
Well, look at you. You
clean up nice, man.

330
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,374
The suit's a little big,
but, uh, it looks good.

331
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,636
Looks like I'm getting
married or something.

332
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,645
Let's get you a job first
then we'll get you a girl, huh?

333
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,273
Dude in my squad used to carry a picture
of him and his wife on their wedding.

334
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,613
- He was wearing a suit just like this.
- Yeah?

335
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,551
Nineteen years old and
married, you believe that?

336
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:47,318
Carson, Teddy Carson.

337
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,294
Used to brag about how he waited
to have sex until they got married.

338
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,990
High-school sweethearts,
the whole nine, you know?

339
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,294
But he actually waited.

340
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,665
Guys used to clown
on him about that.

341
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,168
Especially...
Especially Montoya. Ha.

342
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,970
God.

343
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,370
God...

344
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,645
He used to carry that
picture everywhere.

345
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,382
BP 122/77, pulse
90, satting at 98.

346
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,255
- What's...? What's all that mean?
- You're stable.

347
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,988
CT's negative for
bleeding in the belly.

348
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,032
Really? I thought it was an
abdominal entrance wound.

349
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,103
When he was shot he must've taken a
breath, damaged the chest and lungs.

350
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,034
How long is this
garden hose in me?

351
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,538
Two, maybe three days.

352
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,609
Man.

353
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,542
- When are they bringing Quincy back?
- Oh, he's back.

354
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,205
He's... Can I see him?

355
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,114
They don't let minors visit inmates.
Don't worry, you're teaching him young.

356
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,756
- You might get to share a cell someday.
- Not like that. He's a good kid.

357
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,425
Looks to me like he
takes after his big brother.

358
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,429
- He ain't nothing like me.
- Except for today.

359
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,462
Look, I do what I do so
he don't have to. All right?

360
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,763
Well, you could get
a real job, you know.

361
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,635
- Oh, a real job?
- Mm-hm.

362
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,243
What? Flipping burgers? Huh?

363
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,207
- Bussing tables?
- Why not?

364
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,938
Could you make it on that?

365
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,416
Now, I'm saving up for a nice
place in a nice neighborhood.

366
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:24,114
I'm gonna turn 18, file for custody,
make sure he goes to a good school.

367
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,122
Custody? Not in prison.

368
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,318
And when you get
out, he'll be grown.

369
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,326
You wanna do
what's best for him?

370
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,489
Cooperate with the police
and keep your ass out of jail.

371
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,068
Cooperate? Man, you must be crazy.
Know what happen to me if I snitch?

372
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,102
- You gonna give it another try?
- Part of the job, boys.

373
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,265
Be our guest.

374
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,306
Oh, my God, not again.

375
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,448
- You need an exam.
- I got rights.

376
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,776
Technically you're in
police custody, okay?

377
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,475
You either consent to an exam...

378
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,587
or I'll get 10 cops in here
and make you consent.

379
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,685
Come on. You could
have long-term damage.

380
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,927
Look down my shirt.

381
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,433
I'm sorry?

382
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,595
Underneath my bra, look.

383
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,305
Look.

384
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,905
I'm a cop.

385
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,713
Your radial pulse is intact.

386
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,921
Good cap refill. That means
you didn't injure any blood vessels.

387
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,993
- Okay.
- You feel that here?

388
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,426
Mm-hm.

389
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,031
- How about here?
- Mm-hm.

390
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,065
Okay, squeeze my fingers.

391
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,897
You know, they should
come in, uncuff you.

392
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,009
This is Chicago, sweetie. You can't
trust anyone, especially the cops.

393
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,880
They don't know about you?

394
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,606
It's a narcotics assignment.

395
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,911
Just my supervisor, his supervisor
and the chief of police know.

396
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,883
And, well, now you know.

397
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,014
Oh.

398
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,349
Can you bend your
wrist back for me?

399
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,960
Now, push against my hand.

400
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,431
- So you're, like, in deep cover?
- Mm-hm.

401
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,662
- How long you been under?
- Five months, 23 days.

402
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,630
Wow.

403
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,537
What?

404
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,473
Nothing. No.

405
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:29,471
Okay, let's, uh... Let's see
how strong you are, here.

406
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:44,260
- How are those kids I came in with?
- Uh, both okay. For now.

407
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,096
Jermaine pisses me off. He's
smart. He could be something.

408
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,965
I can't find a way to get him
out without blowing my cover.

409
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,634
You know, those kids?

410
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,942
You can't blame
yourself for that.

411
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,609
He came out of nowhere.

412
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:12,416
Me and Jermaine, we're doing this
deal. All of a sudden a guy pulls a gun.

413
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,686
Next thing I know, Jermaine's
brother is running up, screaming...

414
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,093
and this son of bitch,
he shoots at him.

415
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,972
I hit him three times and I don't
even remember grabbing my gun.

416
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,535
That was the kid they
brought in this morning.

417
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,714
Hey, you know, you
did what you had to do.

418
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,617
You know, things I've seen doing
this job, you wouldn't believe it.

419
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,724
But who shoots a little kid?

420
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,484
All for a backpack full of blow.

421
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,756
Must be hard.

422
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,795
Always... Always pretending
to be somebody else.

423
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,736
Hey, you got a career
out in Hollywood...

424
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,739
if this whole narc
thing doesn't work out.

425
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,845
My real name is Claudia.

426
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,213
Archie.

427
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,187
Mm-mm. No pericardial effusion.

428
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,192
Any pain in your belly?

429
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,160
No, it's just my chest.

430
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,560
Try a mig of dilaudid.

431
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:36,939
Your brother's CT is negative
for any internal damage to his leg.

432
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,237
I think he's going to be fine.

433
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,073
Thank you.

434
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:46,413
Man, the little dude was so
scared, all that blood. You know?

435
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,850
I just hate to see him scared.

436
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,917
Tell him all the time...

437
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,755
you can't be brave
and not scared.

438
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,024
- Heart rate up.
- IV infiltrated.

439
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,360
- He hasn't been getting fluids.
- Other side?

440
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,628
- Antecubital blew.
- Okay, I'll do a subclavian.

441
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,863
What's happening to
me? What's happening...?

442
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,976
All right, I need to put an IV in
the vein under your collarbone.

443
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,975
A little burning here, Jermaine.

444
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,909
Introducer needle.

445
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,709
- Am I gonna be all right?
- Keep still.

446
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,319
- BP's 110/70.
- Okay, another 2 of morphine.

447
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,083
Hi, you must be
Mom. I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

448
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,453
- Sheila Johnson.
- Hi. How you feeling, Ana?

449
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,791
Hmm. Not too bad. Except tickets
to San Francisco are 600 bucks.

450
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,228
So she has an infection
in her gallbladder...

451
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,894
and we're admitting her
to the surgical service.

452
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,939
- She needs surgery?
- We'll treat with antibiotics...

453
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:46,101
until the infection cools off. And
then we'll remove her gallbladder.

454
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,738
I'm so sorry, baby.

455
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,440
I hate this. I miss everything.

456
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:52,949
What do we always say?

457
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,016
Strongest trees in the forest.

458
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,417
That's right.

459
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,617
The strongest trees in the forest
can withstand the strongest winds.

460
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,422
One of her
grandmother's sayings.

461
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:08,033
- She's got, like, a thousand.
- It's nice. I like it.

462
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,262
Mrs. Johnson, if you'd like to sign the
admission forms, Dawn can take you.

463
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:13,906
Sure thing. Right this way.

464
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,799
I'll be back in a flash.

465
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,278
So, uh, do you
have any questions?

466
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:26,579
- Yeah. Why did I have to get sickle cell?
- I'm sorry.

467
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,847
I just want to see Yo-Yo
Ma, is that asking too much?

468
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,150
No. It's not.

469
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,520
He's playing
Mozart's cello sonatas.

470
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,162
Mozart barely wrote
anything for the cello.

471
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,357
My friends go see the dumb Jonas
Brothers and I can't catch a break?

472
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,002
You know, you have
every right to be upset.

473
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,660
I'd be upset too.

474
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,267
I wish there was
something I could do.

475
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,207
Huh. Give me a new gallbladder
and get me the heck out of here.

476
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,643
- I put some more stuff on your phone.
- Thanks.

477
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,150
And you got another text.

478
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,341
From Ray?

479
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:03,148
From some other guy named
Simon Brenner. From Australia.

480
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,484
And, girl, he's cute too.

481
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,491
Uh, I thought we
agreed no more texts.

482
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,528
We agreed no more texts to Ray.

483
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:14,667
So does he have an accent?

484
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:19,430
I knew it. I love accents.

485
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,634
You're a total player, huh?

486
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,573
Catheter's in. Okay, go.

487
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,708
How's the chest-tube output?

488
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,011
Less than 100.

489
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:36,212
All right, I think we just
got behind on the fluids.

490
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,223
Heart rate's down to 90.
Pressure's coming up, 112/78.

491
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,156
Put a dressing on this.

492
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,556
Uh, repeat CBC and chest.

493
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,996
What happened?
What're you guys doing?

494
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,868
You were sick because you
weren't getting enough fluids.

495
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,373
We filled up your
tank with two liters.

496
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,837
Detective.

497
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,511
- How can I help you?
- Jermaine Bennett.

498
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,345
You should try talking to him.

499
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,612
- I got a feeling about him.
- A feeling?

500
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,347
- Yeah.
- You mind elaborating?

501
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,790
I see a lot of knucklehead kids
come through here. He's, uh, different.

502
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,190
He was pretty clear,
he's got nothing to say.

503
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,265
- Um, just talk to him again.
- It's a waste of time.

504
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,901
Just... Just try.

505
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,295
Dr. Coburn.

506
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,972
Cate, hi.

507
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,903
- Glad I caught you.
- Yeah.

508
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,872
Know what? We
should talk tomorrow.

509
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,603
I have an appointment, I
gotta be back in one hour.

510
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,271
- Janet, please.
- Okay.

511
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,580
Uh...

512
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:44,647
All right. The labs, they show that
your estradiol and prolactin are fine.

513
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,123
But your FSH is 13.5.

514
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,229
- It means your ovaries aren't...
- Yeah, I know what it means.

515
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,297
So the chances of
IVF being successful...

516
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,763
No, not good.

517
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,631
With your own egg, the
chances are approaching zero.

518
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,170
But they're not actually zero.

519
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,232
Many fertility clinics
won't even attempt IVF...

520
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,241
on someone whose
FSH is that high.

521
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,505
It wouldn't be ethical
to take your money.

522
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,117
- Money's not the problem.
- Well, then consider how you spend it.

523
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:17,255
I mean, adoption, surrogacy,
egg donation, those things cost too.

524
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,288
Yeah, well, what
if I wanted to try?

525
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,928
- I couldn't recommend it.
- But would you help me?

526
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,066
I wouldn't be
comfortable with that.

527
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,968
I am sorry. I know
that it's rough.

528
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,507
But you do have alternatives.
There are other ways to have a family.

529
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,112
Ceftriaxone and
metronidazole have been given.

530
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,849
- We're headed up.
- Not much of a selection at the gift shop.

531
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:55,358
Oh, my God, Mozart?
Thanks, Neela.

532
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,962
No problem. I'll be up
later to check on you.

533
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,660
- Two of morphine when she gets settled.
- Hey, you get any texts lately?

534
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,827
Uh, she's a handful, this one.

535
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,336
Oh, I see you've
met my daughter.

536
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,175
She's taking the
bus up next week.

537
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,210
Haven't seen her
since I shipped out.

538
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,870
Three years.

539
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,074
- She's gonna cry.
- Yeah, well...

540
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,481
that's what moms do
when they're happy.

541
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,211
Remember, Tuesday, 2:00, right?

542
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,083
- Dr. Grasso. Second floor.
- Right.

543
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,417
Yeah, she's great.

544
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,650
If you have any
problem with your meds...

545
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,419
get a hold of me, okay?

546
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:33,895
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Not necessary.

547
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,832
- I need one more favor.
- Hmm.

548
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,232
It's Jake.

549
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,669
Oh, yeah. I'll drop him
off when I have time.

550
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,002
No, they don't allow dogs here.

551
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,941
I was hoping you could hold
on to him for a little longer.

552
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,613
Really?

553
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,012
- If you could.
- Yeah. Yeah, I could.

554
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,847
I'm sort of, uh... I'm sort
of getting used to him.

555
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,352
I appreciate it.

556
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,355
Been weird being alone. I
don't mind being on my own...

557
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,789
but totally alone gets hard.

558
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,724
I can imagine.

559
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,688
This is me.

560
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,533
- I want you to have this.
- Come on.

561
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,437
Take it. You deserve it.

562
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,541
Open it later.

563
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:30,946
- I'll see you around.
- I'll see you around.

564
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,463
Make sure you give
Jake some bacon.

565
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,798
He loves bacon.

566
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,964
And chicken too.

567
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,604
I'll remember that.

568
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,686
- How's he doing?
- Hungry.

569
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,690
I'm gonna go upstairs,
grab him a sandwich.

570
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,591
He keeps asking
to see his brother.

571
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,262
- Hello, Quincy. How are you?
- Fine.

572
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,231
You getting the hang
of those crutches?

573
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,836
Yeah, it's easy.

574
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:22,372
We're keeping an eye on your
brother, he seems to be doing okay.

575
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,703
I'm not leaving until I see him.

576
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,107
You miss him pretty bad, huh?

577
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:30,539
You know, I hear
you run away a lot.

578
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,918
- I ran away once.
- You?

579
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,553
You're a grown-up.

580
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,124
Well, sometimes we get so sad
we get angry. We run away too.

581
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,956
I only do it to see my
brother. Foster home sucks.

582
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,963
- What do you guys do together?
- Everything.

583
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,796
- Play ball. Video games. Do homework.
- Homework?

584
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:54,063
Jermaine hates it when
I don't do my homework.

585
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:59,439
Quincy, Jermaine broke the law,
put you in a very dangerous situation.

586
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,775
It's not like that. He told
me to go home, but I didn't.

587
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,439
That doesn't make
what he did okay.

588
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:07,142
- You don't get it.
- No, I don't.

589
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,153
- Why don't you explain it to me?
- He doesn't do that stuff.

590
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,258
Well, he did it today.
You saw for yourself.

591
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:17,795
No. My parents worked all the
time. It was always just him and me.

592
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,797
He picked me up at
school, cooked dinner...

593
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,901
Sometimes the
truth hurts so bad...

594
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,094
we don't want to
believe certain things.

595
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,739
- He's not a drug dealer.
- The police say he is.

596
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:30,899
Whatever. When
do I get to see him?

597
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,574
Hi. How are you feeling?

598
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:40,810
Good.

599
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:47,188
- Why are you whispering?
- No, no. I'm being inconspicuous.

600
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,262
- It's not working.
- No? All right.

601
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,332
So you've, uh... You've been
cleared. You're healthy as a horse.

602
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,833
- Jermaine and his brother?
- Jermaine is stable...

603
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,699
getting admitted
for observation.

604
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,330
Quincy'll be on crutches for a
while, but he's going home today.

605
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,340
- See? It's all good.
- Hmm.

606
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:08,807
Can I ask you something?

607
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,778
Your family? They
know about you?

608
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,944
They know I'm a
cop. But not about this.

609
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:19,387
My mother would kill me. She
already thinks it's too dangerous.

610
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,624
And how about your husband?

611
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,463
- Does he know?
- I'm not married.

612
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,359
Boyfriend?

613
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,205
I don't have one.

614
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,297
Wow.

615
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,875
Why do you keep saying that?

616
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,535
No reason.

617
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,807
I have to say
goodbye to you now.

618
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,747
No.

619
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,848
Really? Okay.

620
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,387
My supervisor's coming
in to take me into custody.

621
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,823
You know, the show must go on.

622
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,497
Nobody knows, you know.
I broke protocol when...

623
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,860
Shh. I'll take it to the grave.

624
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,160
Ugh.

625
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,274
- Shut up and stop touching me.
- Make sure you keep this dry.

626
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,001
- Sorry about this one, doc.
- No, you know what?

627
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:14,544
Don't sweat it. We get
this kind all the time.

628
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,909
You got some mouth
on you, you know that?

629
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,017
Time in the pokey
ought to do you good.

630
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,585
- Get her out of my sight.
- Appreciate everything.

631
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:25,747
Well, it's just another day in the
life. Hey, you be careful out there.

632
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:29,383
And you. Big attitude
adjustment. Big one.

633
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,459
Punk ass. Where's the ladies'
room? I gotta take a piss.

634
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,293
Come on.

635
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:41,601
Really making headway
with that one. I'm taking notes.

636
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,704
Check with Frank, see if
ICU has a bed ready for him.

637
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,907
So how am I doing, doc?

638
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,179
Uh, you don't seem to
be bleeding internally.

639
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,122
Well, that's good, right?

640
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,259
You're going to the Intensive
Care Unit. While you're up there...

641
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,827
- you talk to the police.
- What is your problem?

642
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,827
I told you I'm not
snitching on nobody...

643
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,559
And you are going to tell
them everything that you know.

644
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:13,096
Oh, I... Oh, I...

645
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,672
Boy, you think this is funny?

646
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,240
Go ahead and laugh.

647
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,483
Laugh your dumb ass all
the way to the penitentiary.

648
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,622
You wanna know why you're
gonna tell them everything?

649
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:38,957
Come on.

650
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:51,503
- Yo, Quince.
- What's up? How you doing?

651
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,875
I'm all right.

652
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,880
He's why.

653
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,178
You wanna raise him?
Do what's best for him?

654
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,550
Then set an example
and cooperate.

655
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:13,458
You know what? It's fine.
Don't worry about me. I'm good.

656
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,370
No, I'm... Yeah, I'm
sure. I'm totally sure.

657
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,633
You go have fun with your
friends and I'll pick you up, okay?

658
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,074
I promise. Okay.

659
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,079
Hey, Sarah. I love you, okay?

660
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,813
I love you more.

661
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,651
Charlie.

662
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,347
I was called down for a
consult. Where's the patient?

663
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,855
I'm right here. I
want to try IVF.

664
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,550
- What?
- Will you please help me?

665
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,358
You called me down
for a consult on yourself?

666
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:23,127
I couldn't leave the floor
and I want to try in vitro.

667
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,269
This may be my last chance.

668
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,699
I told you I'm not comfortable.

669
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,137
It's only a small
chance, but it's a chance.

670
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:34,472
Yes. But hormone treatments
have risks. Polyps, fibroids.

671
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,774
Do you really wanna put
your body through all that?

672
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,280
I have to give it a try.

673
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,315
Even though failure
is the likely outcome?

674
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:44,354
If it doesn't work, I'll
move on. But one try.

675
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,228
Let me think about it.

676
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,796
But I'm not promising
anything, okay?

677
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,992
I'll call you.

678
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,842
<i>Hi, this is Sam.</i>

679
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,612
<i>I can't get to my phone
so leave a message.</i>

680
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,585
Hey, Sam, it's Tony.

681
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:22,022
Uh, I just wanted to say that I'm
really happy that Alex is home...

682
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,889
and that he's okay
and, uh... Um...

683
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,792
Uh, that I want you to
tell him that I said hi...

684
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:36,340
and, um, that I'll... I'll
see you soon, I hope.

685
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,100
Okay, bye.

686
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:43,205
- Tony! Hey.
- Daria.

687
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,814
- Top of the morning.
- How are you?

688
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,849
- Top of the evening.
- You working? Ha, ha.

689
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,147
- You working?
- No, no, no. I have a few days off.

690
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,880
Actually, I'm drinking.

691
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,322
- Oh, how's that going?
- It's good. Good.

692
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,327
Having a good day. I
did something good.

693
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,520
Really?

694
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:04,226
Which I thought would
make me feel better, but...

695
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:08,736
See, I had this, uh...
My best friend died.

696
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:13,468
And my kid, she never...

697
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,377
Never mind.

698
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,149
- How are you?
- Fine.

699
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,161
Why are you looking
at me like that?

700
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:48,703
And I'm... And you know
what? I'm trouble. I'm trouble.

701
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,406
Everything I touch turns to...

702
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,258
But, you know, if you...

703
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,621
You wanna come home with me...

704
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,287
no strings attached,
just for one night.

705
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,988
We should have Quincy
moved by the end of the week.

706
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,214
That's great.

707
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,552
Jermaine is still
upstairs with the police.

708
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,888
Must be telling them
something, been a while.

709
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,963
- I'll keep you posted. Good night.
- Good night.

710
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,780
Hey. What are you doing here?

711
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:59,247
Taking you on a date.

712
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,783
What?

713
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:05,617
I have reservations at
your favorite, Mia Francesca.

714
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,349
What's the occasion?

715
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,357
Pretty soon we may
not have time to go out.

716
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,793
And you know, I
thought I might get lucky.

717
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:16,662
Since we're trying and all.

718
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:22,107
- You okay?
- Yeah.

719
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,607
Come on, let's talk about
it at dinner. I'm starving.
