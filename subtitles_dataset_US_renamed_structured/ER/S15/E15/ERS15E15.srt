1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,493
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,076
- Your husband?
- I'm not married.

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:12,111
- Boyfriend?
- I don't have one.

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,113
Anything changes
with Jodie, call me.

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,552
- Or just call me.
- I will.

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,847
It's not over with Sam.
Not for me, anyway.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,083
Did you realize that before or
after you had sex with Daria?

8
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,592
- It was a mistake.
- Oh, you still love him.

9
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,462
And at some level, the faculty
will always see you as little Neela.

10
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:35,626
Somewhere new, you'll be taken seriously
in a way that will not happen if you stay.

11
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,481
Food is here.

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,444
I have never had so
much take-out in my life.

13
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,088
- I thought you liked Vietnamese.
- Yeah, I like it.

14
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:59,818
There are places in Chicago with
chairs and tables and, uh, food on plates.

15
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,962
Ah, but no bed.

16
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,826
- Now, that's an excellent point.
- Yes.

17
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,628
We're not on for another two
hours, so we should ride in together.

18
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,067
Unless someone might see us.

19
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:15,266
Hmm. Being covert is
more exciting, isn't it?

20
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,967
Yeah.

21
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,613
- Oh, wait.
- No, no, no.

22
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,082
Leave it, leave
it, leave it. Ah!

23
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:31,116
Hello? Yeah. Really?

24
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,291
Yeah, that's great. Can I,
uh...? Can I take a number?

25
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,262
Yep, thank you.

26
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,295
That was Duke. The department
chair wants to meet me.

27
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,304
- What, uh, about the Attending position?
- Yeah, I can't believe it.

28
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,499
I thought I sank
myself in that interview.

29
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,770
Well, Dr. Corday must have
been very impressed. When is it?

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,813
- This weekend.
- This...?

31
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,508
That's soon. That's great.

32
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,143
Can you actually imagine
me being in North Carolina?

33
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,813
I only took the interview
to get Dubenko off my back.

34
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,892
I didn't actually
consider moving.

35
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,223
Well, that is the risk of being
a brilliant surgeon, Neela.

36
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,455
Everyone's gonna be interested.

37
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,466
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah, I should, um...

38
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,969
I should get back to my apartment,
grab some clothes before my shift.

39
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,936
But I thought we were gonna...

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,441
You save me a spring roll. Yeah?

41
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,010
No fractures of
the alveolar ridge.

42
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,550
I knew better than to
play at that shady club.

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,153
Belly's soft, no obstruction.

44
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,883
Lost my health insurance,
401(k) is in the gutter, now look.

45
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,358
- Two teeth in the small intestine.
- Thank God. Can you get them out?

46
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,656
Yeah, they should pass
on their own in a day or two.

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,892
Um, here. Flush discriminately.

48
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,502
- Poor guy.
- That's disgusting.

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,435
I gotta call my accountant.
Okay, tooth guy's going home.

50
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:56,270
Botox lady is up in Psych, and
Mr. Lam is sleeping it off in 2.

51
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,672
- Are you talking to me?
- No.

52
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,837
- Where's Brenner?
- Break room, suiting up.

53
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,073
Come on. I gotta go.

54
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,582
What did you decide on?
Gibsons or Divina Cucina?

55
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,448
- None. Claudia made the plans.
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

56
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,954
I'm meeting her in
Elmhurst. I'm going in blind.

57
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,753
- I'll bet it's something romantic.
- Wine tasting?

58
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,091
I bet it's hot-cop-fantasy role-play
stuff. Handcuffs and whatnot.

59
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,426
No. Grady. I'll let you know.

60
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,728
What kind of operation do you
run here? My back is killing me.

61
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,532
I'm sorry. We're waiting on
HMO approval for your MRI.

62
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:30,406
Well, hurry it up. If I'm gonna
rot, I'd rather do it in my La-Z-Boy.

63
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,877
- That's the last of the Marcaine.
- All right, thanks, Cecilia.

64
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,380
Dilantin level on your
seizure guy came back low.

65
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,486
Push 500 milligrams
and I'll get him ready to go.

66
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,087
- That's it?
- For now.

67
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,281
- You know, this is... This is still weird.
- What are you talking about?

68
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,552
Us. We've broken up,
we're working together.

69
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:51,961
We said we weren't gonna screw up
our schedules. Some awkwardness is...

70
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,725
- Weird.
- It's expected.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,267
- If that's what you say.
- Guys, listen up.

72
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:00,396
Banfield is out sick. She left instructions
to get patient-satisfaction scores up.

73
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,066
Tony, yours are the
worst in the department.

74
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,269
She's had me on
Geriatrics study for weeks.

75
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,505
They're not the most
enthusiastic group.

76
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,946
Rub their feet, work a
jigsaw puzzle. Whatever.

77
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,110
78-year-old male, passed out
at home, combative in the rig.

78
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,084
- Ten minutes out.
- Bingo.

79
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,419
Oh, come on. Banfield's not here.
Give me someone a little less salty.

80
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,152
- I got a kid mixing X and valerian root.
- Okay. Fine.

81
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,991
You get Dr. Gates' numbers
up, it's dinner at Gibsons.

82
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,326
- I'll foot the bill.
- Don't blow this for me.

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,366
Sam, you're with me.

84
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,504
Hey, you know department policy
about switching weekend shifts?

85
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,470
Depends on Banfield's mood.

86
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,939
Going out of town?

87
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,443
No. Well, maybe. Uh,
North Carolina, maybe.

88
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,344
Hey, my delivery was short.
Mind if I steal some Kerlix?

89
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,508
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll grab it for you.

90
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,950
- What's in North Carolina?
- Ah, not sure, really.

91
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,590
Nothing... Nothing...
Nothing definite.

92
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,129
- Yeah, there's nothing.
- All right.

93
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,161
- I get it. Secret getaway.
- Yeah.

94
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,233
Well, whoever it is, my advice?
Keep it casual, keep it fun.

95
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,200
- You think?
- Believe me. It's a long way down.

96
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,738
- Is that the rig? SAM: They
said it was 10 minutes out.

97
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,808
Stop. Stop!

98
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,160
Mom. GATES: What happened?

99
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,267
Check on Zadro.

100
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,835
- I'm Dr. Brenner.
- Joanie.

101
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,268
Okay, Joanie. Any
trouble breathing?

102
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,169
- Lucy, are you okay?
- I think so.

103
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,343
- Honey... Ow!
- Mom. Oh, Mom.

104
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,637
- What is it?
- My hip.

105
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,178
- Don't move, Joanie.
- That goes for you too, Lucy.

106
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,281
Take a big deep breath.

107
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,476
- Pulse rate, 120.
- I'm okay. I can get out.

108
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,816
Lucy? Lucy? You stay there.
Let us check you first, okay?

109
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,821
I need a collar.

110
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,520
I hit my head.

111
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,162
- We gotta get you on a backboard.
- Are you serious?

112
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,957
You're lucky to be alive.

113
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,598
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

114
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,200
- Clear bilaterally, sternal contusion.
- Ah!

115
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,996
- Yeah, the seatbelt hurt your chest.
- Okay. Ouch!

116
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,766
- Right hip tender with internal rotation.
- Mom.

117
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,772
- Daughter's here.
- Are you okay?

118
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,205
Listen to the doctors.

119
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,845
- She has a minor forearm burn.
- Put her in sutures.

120
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,881
Mom has a broken hip. Could
have an intra-abdominal bleed.

121
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,881
Just give them a minute, okay?

122
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,520
Okay, fine. We need a
HemoCue. Check Curtain 2.

123
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,054
- I wanna go.
- We got this. Frank has my sign-outs.

124
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,715
Make sure the back gets an
MRI. His HMO won't approve.

125
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,521
- What do you want me to do?
- Talk them into it.

126
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,028
Not today. Stay if you
feel that strongly about it.

127
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,723
- I can't.
- I'm sorry.

128
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,731
Pulse ox is 97 on two liters.

129
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,995
Set up for a FAST.

130
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,309
All right, your neck is fine. I just
need to sew up your forehead.

131
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:54,346
- What about Steri-Strips?
- Eh, it's well into the sub-Q.

132
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,346
Well, how about that superglue?

133
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,748
You'll have much better results
with sutures. Listen to your doctor.

134
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:05,152
- Hey, Sam, drunk driver?
- Mom and daughter. Not sure why.

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,254
I hope they're okay.

136
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,722
Dr. Gates, that old guy
with syncope is here.

137
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,597
- Go. Someone else can stitch me up.
- Okay. I'll come back to check you out.

138
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:22,167
I need a signature for Dr. Gates on this
patient-satisfaction form before you go.

139
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,506
- It's already filled out.
- Just sign it.

140
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,515
Leo Malcolm, found at home.

141
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,947
Unconscious on the
scene. Woke up after a liter.

142
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,586
Mr. Malcolm, I'm Dr. Gates.
You know where you are?

143
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,415
Some fleabag
hospital, looks like.

144
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,285
Tachy at 118. BP,
98/40. Sats, 97.

145
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,460
Heart's beating fast.
Does anything hurt?

146
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,189
I'm fine. Man can't take a nap without
Big Brother knocking at the door.

147
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,924
Motion detector. No
movement for an hour...

148
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,400
paramedics get a call from
the monitoring company.

149
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,130
- May as well get it over with.
- I feel the same way.

150
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,365
Dr. Gates?

151
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,069
I mean, welcome to County,
sir. We're so glad you're here.

152
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,042
- Acetabular fracture.
- That's bad?

153
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,210
You broke the
socket of the hip joint.

154
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,915
We can reconstruct it surgically,
but you'll need to stay at the hospital.

155
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,391
- How long will that take?
- A week. Another month of rehab.

156
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,291
No, I can't. I have Lucy.

157
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,797
If the pelvis doesn't heal, you'll
develop arthritis, chronic pain.

158
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,800
- You could need a total hip replacement.
- All set.

159
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,798
I got a tetanus shot, Mom.

160
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,431
- Your daughter is very brave.
- She's my angel.

161
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,437
I don't know what happened. I mean,
one minute we were driving along...

162
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,948
and the next, my car won't stop.

163
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,644
You're lucky it happened
in front of a hospital.

164
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,413
God's plan, right?

165
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,118
Right. Right, Mom.

166
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,957
- Excuse me. Dr. Fazzio's on the phone.
- Is he approving the MRI?

167
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,826
Fork over the 4 grand, he says
you can do anything you want.

168
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,425
- Unbelievable. I'm ordering it.
- Hey, careful, Archie.

169
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:59,801
Let's not stick a patient with a huge
bill for an unauthorized procedure.

170
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,207
Hey, Lucy, have you ever
seen a newborn baby close up?

171
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,369
I'll take you to where
they're sleeping.

172
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,175
- It's okay. LUCY:
Okay. I'll be right back.

173
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,856
I've been looking after
her alone for so long.

174
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,958
You never expect
something like this to happen.

175
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,789
Well, we can hold off on surgery while
you find someone to take her home.

176
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,023
- Do you have any family nearby?
- Uh, my mom died when I was in college.

177
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,726
Do you have any friends that
can take her? Uh, siblings?

178
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,135
I have a brother, Stuart, but
we haven't talked in a while.

179
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,400
Last I heard, he
works a bar on Cicero.

180
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,372
I can call him if you want.

181
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,238
If he's reachable,
we need to try.

182
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,477
Look, Lucy was 3 the
last time we saw him.

183
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,385
He shows up late one
night, says he's in trouble...

184
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,527
he needs a place to
stay, regroup, whatever.

185
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,192
When we woke up,
he was long gone.

186
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,424
He'd stolen cash from my wallet
and my mom's wedding ring.

187
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,160
My family's gotten
pretty small since then.

188
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,869
I have a neighbor that looks after
her sometimes. We can just ask her.

189
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,678
Okay.

190
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:19,752
- What labs do you want?
- CBC, BMP, and a blood culture.

191
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,943
Oh!

192
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,714
All right, mid-epigastric
tenderness.

193
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,725
Yeah, your stomach would hurt
like this too if I pushed you like that.

194
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,796
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Systolic only 88.

195
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,593
- So this doesn't hurt?
- Don't be so disappointed.

196
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,964
Little stick here.

197
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,139
- Ah, ah, ah. That's it, I'm out of here.
- Where you going?

198
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,739
- I'm going home.
- No, come on.

199
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,138
- Get out of my way.
- You're not going anywhere.

200
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,642
- Do you want me to call Dr. Brenner?
- I got this.

201
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,145
The paramedics would
not have brought you here...

202
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,112
if they thought
nothing was wrong.

203
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,811
Your heart's beating way too
fast, your blood pressure's very low.

204
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,478
Let me help you.

205
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,586
I'm fine, you know. I'm fine.

206
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,388
Finger.

207
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,130
Everyone wants to help me.

208
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,829
- Draw some blood, will you?
- What? Hold on. Wait.

209
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,668
My daughter, you know? - Mm-hm.

210
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,503
She got these computers
all over my house.

211
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,271
Couldn't even go to the can
without this little light blinking at me.

212
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,607
She's worried about you.

213
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,910
Yeah, she should have let me
go to the assisted-living place.

214
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,315
At least there, I wouldn't
be bothering nobody.

215
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,285
Let's order an abdominal series.

216
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,584
- What's that?
- Take X-rays of your belly.

217
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,250
- I'm fine.
- No, no. Come on.

218
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,363
Look, if it's clear, I'll
call you a cab. Deal?

219
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,130
Deal.

220
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:49,003
No fever, no neuro deficits. An
epidural abscess is a long throw.

221
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,201
Worsening pain, not
relieved with vicodin.

222
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,369
We should image him
before he's paralyzed.

223
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,481
Of course. But
it's not our call.

224
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,674
Somebody called this
guy about his sister.

225
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,216
You're Stuart Moore?

226
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,219
- Joanie was asking about me?
- Yeah, I called you, yeah.

227
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,721
Must be bad, man. I'm
the last person she'd call.

228
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,951
- Okay, she's back here.
- Uh, Dr. Brenner?

229
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,688
Frank, his sister is in
Trauma 1. Would you mind?

230
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,731
Look, Dr. Fazzio promised
he'd be down in the next hour.

231
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,995
If he doesn't approve it,
call my cell. I'll deal with it.

232
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,332
- Fine.
- Really? I can go?

233
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,734
Hallelujah. Thank you.

234
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,399
Hey, Sam. I, uh,
talked to Dubenko...

235
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,740
about the Roux-en-Y with the
robotic surgery system next week.

236
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,745
- You got me in? Cool, thanks.
- Mm-hm.

237
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,679
We've seen you
upstairs quite a bit.

238
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,012
Yeah, I'm taking as
many O.R. shifts as I can.

239
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,156
I'm not really having a
great time down here.

240
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,881
Tony. Breakup.

241
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,518
- Oh, well, you seem to be managing.
- For the most part. But you know him.

242
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,564
You know. We had coffee.
He apologized, I yelled...

243
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,192
then we both decided we
didn't want it to affect our jobs...

244
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,498
- so that's that.
- I'm sorry.

245
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,696
It's okay.

246
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,105
From now on, I am keeping
my work life out of my "life" life.

247
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,575
Well, sounds like a plan.

248
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,786
- You were done loaning me money.
- So you rob me?

249
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,444
My car was in the shop, Joanie.

250
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,183
That is not what I'm talking about. I
am talking about what you did to me.

251
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,953
You want your half of Mom's
ring? The ring was a joke.

252
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,098
What is he doing here?
I did not want him called.

253
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,359
I'm sorry, but we called your
neighbors, they're out of town.

254
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,400
It's him or foster care.

255
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,596
- She'd be better off with strangers.
- We're fine.

256
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,136
CT can take her.

257
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,976
- Everything okay?
- My brother needs to leave.

258
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,615
Call CT. We're gonna
take her upstairs.

259
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,217
If something's happening
with Lucy, I should know.

260
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,981
Why should you know?
You don't deserve anything.

261
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:50,256
Okay, you know what?
Here. Have a nice life.

262
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,955
Get out!

263
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,794
Stuart, I'm sorry about
all this. I didn't realize...

264
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,233
- Yeah, look, it was my mistake to come.
- Look, your sister's sick.

265
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,101
- Someone needs to take care of Lucy.
- That ain't me.

266
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,266
- Hey.
- Sam, he's not interested.

267
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,776
- I'm leaving.
- You're just gonna walk away?

268
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,278
- It's what she wants.
- Not what your niece wants.

269
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,474
- What do you know?
- She needs someone.

270
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,482
Stuart.

271
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,187
Lucy's not my niece.

272
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,951
She's my daughter.

273
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,704
So Joanie's not her mother?

274
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,740
I don't know where her mom is.

275
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,148
She took off when,
uh, Lucy was 3.

276
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,752
And Lucy has no idea?

277
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,621
I haven't exactly been around.

278
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,051
Yeah, I know.

279
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,560
Look, I didn't know
what I was doing.

280
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,631
I wasn't supposed to have a kid.

281
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,167
I figured leaving her with
Joanie was the best I could do.

282
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,134
Well, uh...

283
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:10,072
Asking your sister to raise
your child, it's a pretty big favor.

284
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,109
I guess that's why I didn't ask.

285
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,408
Joanie's in trouble.

286
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,152
She needs your help now.

287
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,660
I got a tiny apartment.

288
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,590
I play guitar at a bar.

289
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,792
I can't take care
of a 9-year-old kid.

290
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,098
Hey, maybe you'll
surprise yourself.

291
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,836
I doubt it.

292
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,786
Uh, look, I gotta go, so, uh,
tell Joanie I had to go to work.

293
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,325
- Uh, maybe I'll come visit later.
- Sure.

294
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,621
So?

295
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,792
He's not gonna do it.

296
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,537
Call foster care when
you're done with the CT.

297
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,035
It's been over an hour. You
were gonna call me a cab.

298
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,047
- The results are on their way.
- Huh.

299
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,181
Hey, look. I got lightheaded
and I fainted, ain't no big deal.

300
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,549
Why can't you understand?

301
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,850
Whatever you have,
Leo, let us try to fix it.

302
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,152
Ah, I'm sure you will.

303
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,526
Hi, I'm Dr. Rasgotra. I'm sorry
to keep you waiting. I got tied up.

304
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,065
I've got the O.R. standing by.

305
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,329
- Free air under the diaphragm.
- It's most likely a perfed ulcer.

306
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,702
He's been taking large doses
of ibuprofen for his arthritis.

307
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,036
- Do you have any belly pain?
- No.

308
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,879
The NSAIDs could be
masking the symptoms.

309
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,947
Uh, Mr. Malcolm, air in
the abdomen is not normal.

310
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,846
We need to go in, find the
perforation, and repair it.

311
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,350
Go in? NEELA: Mm-hm.

312
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,045
Lady, I'm 78 years old.

313
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,419
There is some increased risk
associated with surgery at your age...

314
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,084
but there's every reason to
believe there will be a good outcome.

315
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,096
If you don't do this
operation, you could die.

316
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:17,767
What are we waiting for?
Cancer? I've seen that.

317
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,604
No, thank you.

318
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,208
- Are you sure this is your decision?
- Yes. No, thank you.

319
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,609
- His daughter is here. GATES:
Have them hold on a second.

320
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,378
Look, Leo, this is one
relatively routine operation.

321
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,921
- You could be home in a few days.
- That's what they told my wife.

322
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,288
Two years later, she was still in the
hospital, tied to hoses and machines.

323
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,431
I can't do that, man.

324
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,433
You get to stay here
and watch all the action.

325
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:54,165
We're going to see inside my mom?
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

326
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,434
I can do a 3-D reconstruction.

327
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,805
Wow.

328
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,505
- How are you doing?
- A little dizzy.

329
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,083
It's probably the morphine.

330
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,317
Will I be able to meet the
foster family before she goes?

331
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,185
Of course.

332
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,761
- And she can visit me here?
- Yeah. Every day.

333
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,455
Two weeks is gonna
fly by, you'll see.

334
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,031
She deserves better than Stuart.

335
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,802
Does she remember him at all?

336
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,304
She knows that she has an uncle.

337
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,934
She knows that she met him
once. That he lives in the city.

338
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,707
My brother...

339
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,310
He wasn't always like this.

340
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,355
But I'm worried that if I'm stuck
here, he'll use it against me.

341
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:52,231
He could use custody to blackmail
me for money. It's what he does.

342
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,865
But you're her mom now.

343
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,361
Not legally.

344
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,170
I always thought adoption
was just a formality.

345
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,743
I never thought that
I could ever really...

346
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,645
lose her.

347
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,742
You won't.

348
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,146
Joanie, he's not coming back.

349
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,083
So, what happens now?

350
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,526
Well, if he's refusing treatment,
there's nothing we can do.

351
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:28,498
Nothing? This is a hospital.
You can't just let someone die.

352
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,159
It's his choice.

353
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:34,563
It's been one battle after
another since my mom died.

354
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,110
Trying to move him out of
his house, give up his car.

355
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,971
Feels like I should
know how to do this.

356
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:46,680
Sometimes, people make this kind
of decision when they're depressed.

357
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,412
Maybe we can have
him talk to somebody.

358
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,681
- Like a psychiatrist?
- We can offer counseling, medication.

359
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,262
I know he's not
ready to say goodbye.

360
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,874
- Hi, Archie.
- I'm late, I'm sorry.

361
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,309
- Don't worry about it.
Come on in. MORRIS: Oh.

362
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,448
- Nice place. Here, these are for you.
- Aww.

363
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,450
- I have a surprise for you.
- Yeah? What kind of surprise?

364
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,247
- Hey, are those cupcakes?
- Yes.

365
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,287
And balloons. I like
balloons, I guess.

366
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,154
Archie, this is my mom,
Olga. My sister, Lorraine.

367
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,488
My cousins Bianca,
Javier, Gabriella, Jose.

368
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,131
And these are my
grandmothers, Carmen and Alicia.

369
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,133
- Hey. I'm having Psych see Leo.
- What? Why?

370
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,298
If we can have him
declared incompetent...

371
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,001
we can have power of attorney
transferred to his daughter.

372
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,237
He's not incompetent.
He doesn't want treatment.

373
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,575
If not incompetent,
then depressed.

374
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,309
It's natural. It's part of
the process of letting go.

375
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:56,252
If a 25-year-old kid refused surgery,
you'd get Psych involved just like that.

376
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,822
It's his right to decide...

377
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,324
whether he wants his last years
spent in and out of hospital beds.

378
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,963
You have to respect his
wishes. Here you go, Frank.

379
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,760
Isn't it ridiculous to file four
copies of the base-station report?

380
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,164
Gee, that thought has
never occurred to me.

381
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,670
Neela. Uh, just put the rest in
the break room. I'll deal with them.

382
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,775
Also, your father of the
year is out there in Waiting.

383
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,274
Stuart Moore? He came back?

384
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,881
Yeah, I'm watching my wallet,
suggest you do the same.

385
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,177
Car crash in the ambulance
bay, dysfunctional family drama.

386
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:30,119
- Yeah, listen, I was... About Duke.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

387
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,350
I don't know why I was going
on. I guess I got caught off-guard.

388
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,894
It's a big move. You're probably
right to be a little hesitant.

389
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,793
- I was thinking maybe we could...
- I booked my flight.

390
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,565
- You did?
- Lucien switched my schedule.

391
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,465
He said if I couldn't come up
with a better reason than nerves...

392
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,072
- Of course. That's good.
- It's just an interview, right?

393
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,572
No need to make
any big life decisions.

394
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:52,234
- I'll see you later.
- All right. Bye.

395
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,911
- Need some help here!
- Mom.

396
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,743
- I need some help!
- Mom, wake up.

397
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,910
- I need a doc... Dr. Brenner.
- Mom?

398
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,680
Dropped her pressure,
dropped her sats, lungs are wet.

399
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,349
Pink frothy sputum. Pulmonary edema.
- Congestive heart failure?

400
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,755
We're helping her breathe.

401
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,329
She might have bruised
her heart in the crash.

402
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,990
BiPAP, 40 of Lasix, titrate,
dopamine, and set up for an ultrasound.

403
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,263
Calm down, okay? Calm down,
step aside and let us do our job.

404
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,033
Thirty on 15. Let's see if
we can avoid intubation.

405
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,541
- Multifocal PVCs.
- Hundred of lidocaine.

406
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,838
Mommy, please talk to me. Mommy.

407
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,243
She's sleeping, Lucy.
Her oxygen level is low.

408
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,317
When the heart isn't pumping
well, the lungs fill with fluid.

409
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,404
- BiPAP is on.
- Diffuse hypokinesis.

410
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:38,081
- Ejection fraction, 20 percent.
- Looks dilated cardiomyopathy.

411
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,351
- Can't be from the crash.
- What's happening?

412
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,122
Your mom's heart isn't doing its
job. We're trying to find out why.

413
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,525
Run of six on the monitor.

414
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,031
- Did she present in failure?
- No.

415
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,863
Couldn't handle the two
liters of saline we gave her.

416
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,267
- Mommy.
- V-tach. Charge to 300.

417
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,138
Stop! SAM: You're charged.

418
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,639
All right, clear.

419
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,574
- Could someone get her out of here?
- All right, clear.

420
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:05,245
- No change.
- No! No! Mommy! Mommy!

421
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,649
I wanna stay! I wanna stay!

422
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,628
She was down for two minutes,
came back after the third shock.

423
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,957
Yeah. Okay, that sounds good.
You call me when you're ready.

424
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:22,602
- Was that Cardiology?
- Fulminant myocarditis.

425
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,795
Heart biopsy is gonna tell
us if it's treatable with steroids.

426
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,371
What about the hip surgery?

427
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,634
We'll keep her in traction, give
her lungs a chance to dry out...

428
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,778
before we subject
her to anesthesia.

429
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,279
I put the little girl in the break
room. Social Service is on their way.

430
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,418
Jeez, poor kid. Two weeks
is scary enough, but a month?

431
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,417
And if the biopsy
shows scarring...

432
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,386
The brother's out in
Waiting. I'll speak to him.

433
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,958
- We are not sending her with that guy.
- He's the father.

434
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,154
He deserves to know if his
child is gonna be sent off.

435
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,299
- He didn't mind abandoning her.
- That was six years ago.

436
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,458
- This is different.
- You think?

437
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,735
Hey. It was a slow night.

438
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,607
- How did the surgery go?
- She hasn't had it yet.

439
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,752
We discovered Joanie
was in heart failure.

440
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,818
- What? From the car crash?
- No, it's something else, I think.

441
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,620
We're running a test now
to assess the damage.

442
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:28,392
Stuart, your daughter was with
Joanie when she needed CPR.

443
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,028
And she's scared.

444
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,037
And she needs a
place to stay tonight.

445
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,037
Yeah.

446
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,637
Yeah.

447
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,638
All right.

448
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:57,993
- Is my mom okay?
- Uh, she might be upstairs for a while.

449
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:03,535
Lucy, there's someone here
to see you. This... This is Stuart.

450
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,136
Your, uh, mom's told
you about me, I think.

451
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,205
A little. You're my uncle?

452
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,307
You probably don't remember,
but, uh, we met when you were little.

453
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,980
Yeah. It was a long time ago.

454
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,856
I've been busy. I, uh...

455
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,685
Stuart here is a musician.

456
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:34,525
Really? That's cool.

457
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,726
What kind of music?

458
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:42,564
- Uh, rock, mostly. You like music?
- I like The Police.

459
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,607
Tsk. What? Come
on. The Police, really?

460
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,978
My mom and I like the
song about dinosaurs.

461
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:55,551
- You ever, uh, listen to The Clash?
- They're all right.

462
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,589
- Liz Dade is here.
- Okay.

463
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,354
Um, Lucy, do you mind if I, um,
leave you guys alone for a minute?

464
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,897
- No, it's okay.
- Okay.

465
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,106
You know, your mom and I used to
listen to The Police when we were kids.

466
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,575
We had it on a cassette
tape. You know what that is?

467
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,114
We used to blast it so loud.
Drove your grandma crazy.

468
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,125
That's Stuart Moore?

469
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,118
- Yeah, he's the father.
- Technically.

470
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,416
That's what the
birth certificate says.

471
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,719
No criminal record, no history
of violence, no record of abuse.

472
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,227
Given the gravity of Joanie's condition,
he's a candidate for temporary custody.

473
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,990
- If he wants.
- I think he will.

474
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,465
You can't show up after six years
and act like nothing's happened.

475
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:47,629
I'll interview him. Get a sense if he
can handle it. But, yeah, he's the father.

476
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,071
- What about Joanie?
- She knows Lucy best.

477
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,676
She'll need to sign off.

478
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,110
And, Sam, we are not gonna
add to the stress of her illness.

479
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,408
I think it's a mistake.

480
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,621
Check this out.

481
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,125
Here it comes. All
right, you ready?

482
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,507
Sing that part with me.

483
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,442
That's it.

484
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,331
So, uh, her nephew's
7th birthday party.

485
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,401
Seven years.

486
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,499
Boy, what a fun age, huh?

487
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,110
Just running around
with other 7-year-olds.

488
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,680
Come on. Come on.

489
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,320
They don't speak English.
Kind of wish I knew that.

490
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,321
- You speak Spanish?
- No, not really.

491
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,518
I'm fine. Come on.
Okay, you know?

492
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,323
That's my cousin, Rogelio.
He always does this.

493
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,591
Don't worry. We'll
just serve the cake.

494
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,600
Superhero Gary is, like,
Philip's favorite TV character.

495
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,829
If he sees this, he'll freak.

496
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,065
- What can we do?
- I don't know.

497
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,107
<i>Superhero Gary! Superhero Gary!</i>

498
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,545
Greetings, small children.

499
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,552
You're not Gary. - Nice tights.

500
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,350
It's, uh, a beautiful day
in the neighborhood.

501
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:48,926
A beautiful day for a birthday.

502
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,586
- It's somebody's birthday.
- It's Philip's birthday.

503
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,755
It's somebody's
birthday. Philip. Yes.

504
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,128
- What a rip-off.
- Ahh!

505
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,897
- How old are you, Philip?
- You're not Superhero Gary.

506
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,632
Of course I am. Yeah,
I'm Superhero Gary.

507
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,538
I'm the strongest
man in Chicago.

508
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,305
With the... Behold my
biceps of superness.

509
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,074
- Boo! Those are fake.
- Your hair looks different.

510
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,414
- And his legs.
- Superhero Gary has man legs.

511
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,923
These are my bionic legs, yes. For
leaping buildings in a single bound.

512
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,621
- What's a bound?
- It's... Don't do that.

513
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,731
- Get him.
- Okay, Philip. Seriously.

514
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,094
- You guys. Come on. Stop.
- Get him!

515
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,396
- You guys.
- Stop it.

516
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,438
How are you feeling, Joanie?
- Better.

517
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,911
Satting well on BiPAP,
switching her to 10 liters by mask.

518
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,481
I felt like I was drowning.

519
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,642
Over a liter of urine
output with the Lasix.

520
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,582
You get the results?

521
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,283
Joanie...

522
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:55,726
most of your heart muscle has
been replaced by scar tissue.

523
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,025
I don't understand.

524
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,767
- A virus attacked your heart.
- A virus? What kind of virus?

525
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,771
Well, it could have
been a cold or a flu.

526
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,671
Something in the last
12 months, perhaps.

527
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,341
- How does something like this happen?
- It's extremely rare.

528
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,342
Now, unfortunately, the
damage is irreversible.

529
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,052
Now we'll wait to see if your
heart responds to IV medication.

530
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:29,456
But if it doesn't, we may have
to put you on the transplant list.

531
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,164
Mom. Mom. Mom.

532
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,135
What about Lucy?

533
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:50,405
I'm gonna take her, Joan. - No.

534
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,643
Just for a couple of
weeks, till you're better.

535
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,722
It's a lot of
responsibility. Every day.

536
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,382
- He knows that.
- It's more than just watching her.

537
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:08,024
There's an old woman in my
building. She can help out if I need it.

538
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,931
- Is that cool, kiddo?
- It's cool.

539
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,764
- We'll catch up for lost time.
- Stuart.

540
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,704
Hey.

541
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,943
I can do this.

542
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,412
Let me prove it to you.

543
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:43,028
- You don't have to if you don't want to.
- I want to.

544
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,847
Here we go again.

545
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,614
What did the psychiatrist say?

546
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,318
He says you're not suicidal,
you're not depressed...

547
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,656
and you have the right
to refuse treatment.

548
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,230
Finally, a doctor
around here who listens.

549
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,133
Refusing treatment
is the first step.

550
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,669
- We need to walk you through the rest.
- The rest of what?

551
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,739
He means the hospice, if
that's the path you're choosing.

552
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,672
Yeah, it is.

553
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,572
Contents of your bowel
could spill into your abdomen...

554
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,647
and, uh, cause a
massive infection.

555
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,944
Get through your blood
stream, infect your lungs.

556
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,520
- Which we will treat with antibiotics.
- Fine.

557
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,147
Blood pressure could, uh, drop so
low that fluid could get into your lungs.

558
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,692
We'll give you medication
to keep you comfortable.

559
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,260
- If you have to.
- Morphine.

560
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,922
Which will make you out of it.
You won't be able to see, talk.

561
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,092
Your daughter will watch
you lose the ability to breathe.

562
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,170
You wanna put your
daughter through that?

563
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,897
Tony.

564
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,769
Can you step outside, please?

565
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,149
- What was that?
- He's making a mistake.

566
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,379
You think scaring him
is the best solution?

567
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,455
- What choice do I have?
- Let it go.

568
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,259
Hey.

569
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:27,767
- What is it?
- I wanna apologize for earlier.

570
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:38,113
I watched my wife turn into a
corpse before my very eyes.

571
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,512
What makes you think that I can't
handle a little shortness of breath?

572
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,852
Hey, you, uh,
religious or something?

573
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,188
Huh?

574
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,389
You afraid that God's
gonna get mad at me?

575
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,534
It's not about that.

576
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:01,401
Why can't I, uh, show my
family that I'm still strong?

577
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:06,575
That I can, uh, leave this
world with some kind of dignity?

578
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,778
You wanna protect
your family. I get it.

579
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:16,911
Yeah. I sat with my
wife for two years...

580
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,123
waiting, watching her disappear.

581
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,796
I did that so that my
family didn't have to.

582
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:28,831
Two years.

583
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:35,738
And then, when it was over, she
didn't even remember who I was.

584
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,075
Now, what kind of
cruel joke is that?

585
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,775
Leo, you don't have
cancer. We can fix this, man.

586
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:50,184
Yeah. You did what you needed
to do. Now you just let me do mine.

587
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,617
I was talking to your
granddaughter, Alyssa.

588
00:34:56,795 --> 00:35:00,960
She's going to, uh,
Wisconsin in the fall.

589
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,129
Civil engineering.

590
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:09,503
Building cities. Must be a
tough field to get into, huh?

591
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,274
She said she talked about it
when she was a kid with you.

592
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,175
That you wanted
to do the same thing.

593
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:18,476
They never had anything like
that when I was in the Navy.

594
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,881
She's got more
opportunities than I ever had.

595
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,849
- You must be proud.
- Oh!

596
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:31,291
I'm proud of all
my grandchildren.

597
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,694
They always remember
what they come from.

598
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,825
You know, I have a daughter.

599
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,598
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

600
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,101
Haven't always done the
right thing, that's for sure.

601
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:49,238
Seeing you with your
family, meeting them...

602
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:53,852
and the way they look up to you,
all that you've accomplished, it's...

603
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:01,557
- You figure it out as you go.
- Yeah.

604
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,488
The college, the
classes, the career.

605
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,430
You've talked to her about
that your whole life. That's cool.

606
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:09,931
- And she's doing it.
- Mm-hm.

607
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:14,163
She's doing it. And she's doing
it not just for herself, but for you.

608
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,867
She's gonna graduate, and
she's gonna look out there...

609
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,737
and you're not gonna be there.

610
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,846
Is that how you want it to be?

611
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,792
You're buying me dinner.

612
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,591
- Holy Moses.
- Morris?

613
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,290
Dislocation of the left elbow...

614
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,959
needs post-reduction
films and an ortho consult.

615
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,570
Come on, kids.

616
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,367
I'll show you where they
reattached Evil Staxx's arm...

617
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,635
after I threw him
off the Sears Tower.

618
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,972
These are from the
county, state and DCFS...

619
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,775
saying that you agree to the terms
of the four-week custody arrangement.

620
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:58,973
It's a lot of forms.

621
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,312
Here's a map and
directions to Lucy's school.

622
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,921
You're responsible for
getting her to and from.

623
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,217
I got her pediatrician's office.

624
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,986
She's got an annual physical
scheduled in two weeks.

625
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,720
Why...? Can't some of this
wait until Joanie's better?

626
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,957
It's important to keep her
routine stable during the transition.

627
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:18,399
You need to bring her here every
day. Contact with Joanie is vital.

628
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,472
- How am I supposed to work?
- You'll figure it out.

629
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,339
Call me if you
have any questions.

630
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,905
- You okay?
- Yeah.

631
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,743
Now, this is nothing
you can't handle.

632
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:36,183
Listen, uh, Lucy's with your
sister until we take her upstairs.

633
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,414
Why don't you go and
pick up some food?

634
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,857
Ike Ryan's is a block down.
Grab yourself some dinner.

635
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,154
- All right.
- All right?

636
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,629
- You need money?
- No, man. I got money.

637
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,597
I'll see you in half an hour.

638
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,330
And, um, this is a bench.

639
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:58,136
Yeah, where people wait to
hear matters of life and death.

640
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:03,705
Oh, and this is one of Superhero
Gary's favorite nurses, Sam Taggart.

641
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,215
Sam, this is Claudia
and her whole family.

642
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,012
Hi.

643
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,947
- "Superhero Gary"?
- Kid's birthday party.

644
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,990
Gates has got Neurosurgery
coming down on your patient.

645
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,991
- What patient?
- Your back-pain guy.

646
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:20,462
- BP dropped and he can't move his legs.
- He's still here? Excuse me.

647
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,067
Two liters of saline wide
open. Temp spiked to 103.

648
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,499
BP, 85/50. Oh,
good. Here he comes.

649
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,297
What the hell?

650
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:31,673
- Can you feel this?
- No. I can't move my legs.

651
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,540
Spinal shock. I'll
throw in a central line.

652
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,907
Why can't I move my legs?

653
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,049
You have an infection.

654
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,185
- Costume party?
- Seventh birthday.

655
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,649
Sats are down, 87 percent.

656
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,584
Okay, 100 percent
non-rebreather.

657
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,383
Mix Levophed,
four migs in 500 ccs.

658
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,186
Vanco and
ceftriaxone are hanging.

659
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,691
Introducer and guidewire.

660
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,558
Neurosurge will meet us in
MRI. GATES: I'm holding an O.R.

661
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,723
We need to take you to Surgery
to prevent permanent paralysis.

662
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,564
- Oh, God, I'm gonna be paralyzed?
- Well, we hope not.

663
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,706
Don't worry. I got you.

664
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,808
Okay, let's roll.
The clock is ticking.

665
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,871
- You're our hero.
- Coming though.

666
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:12,175
- Lucy? Lucy?
- Yeah, Mom?

667
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,546
Do you have your backpack
and your sweatshirt?

668
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,210
- Yeah. Don't worry, Mom.
- Okay.

669
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,855
Hey, listen.

670
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,682
You be a good
girl, okay? All right?

671
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,886
I'll see you tomorrow.

672
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,955
Okay.

673
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,558
- I love you.
- I love you more.

674
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,461
Come on.

675
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,815
Good night, guys.

676
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,276
- Bye, Dr. Morris.
- Happy birthday, Philip.

677
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,589
You know, impersonating a
superhero is a misdemeanor.

678
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,087
- It is?
- Mm-hm.

679
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,455
And resisting arrest
will only make it worse.

680
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,453
I guess I'm in big trouble.

681
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:00,258
- I guess you are.
- Ooh.

682
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:27,709
He probably went to get
his place ready for you.

683
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,852
We can wait out here for
a few minutes if you like.

684
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,522
He's not coming.

685
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,768
How do you know that?

686
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:49,873
I could tell.

687
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,275
It's kind of cold out here.

688
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,044
I'm okay.

689
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,556
How long is she gonna be here?

690
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,629
It's hard to say.

691
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,697
I hope it's not too long.

692
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,037
Me too.
