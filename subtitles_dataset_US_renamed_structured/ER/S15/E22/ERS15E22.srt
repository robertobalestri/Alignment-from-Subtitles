1
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,008
Who we got coming in?

2
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,201
Fifty-four, he's got
an unconscious kid.

3
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:48,441
- I should've asked if you wanted coffee.
- No. I had a couple hundred cups.

4
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,311
I feel like I got
ants all over me.

5
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,214
You mean fleas, from that
homeless guy with the dogs.

6
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,516
I saw a rat by the Dumpsters.
I thought it was a cat at first.

7
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,888
Call Jerry, he'll have Maintenance
bring down a couple extra traps.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,020
More like a couple of shotguns.
That thing was the size of a beaver.

9
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,325
- Here we go, girls.
- All right.

10
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,260
- What do we got?
- 15-year-old female.

11
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,771
Found passed out after playing a
drinking game at a slumber party.

12
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,409
Unresponsive,
sats 93 over 2 liters.

13
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,910
BP 72 palp, couldn't get a line.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,572
- Name's Stacey.
- Stacey, can you hear me? Stacey?

15
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,775
- How long has she been down?
- Not sure.

16
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,979
Bunch of kids that were at
the party are in a car behind us.

17
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,784
- Jerry, what's open?
- They're both open.

18
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,258
All right, access, ETOH level,
tox screen, d-stick, and lytes.

19
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,055
Non-rebreather, she's hypoxic.

20
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,934
Ready for a transfer?
One, two, three.

21
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,764
Dr. Morris?

22
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,277
Dr. Morris?

23
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,004
Archie!

24
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,410
Fire's bringing in an altered
old lady, found her out in the rain.

25
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,417
- How's escalator lady?
- Ortho took her up to screw her hip.

26
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,579
- Explosive-diarrhea guy?
- Loperamide's working, he's sleeping.

27
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,316
- Belly pain back from CT?
- Nope.

28
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,517
- Oh, I hate working nights.
- Really? I like it.

29
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,290
- Nights?
- Yeah, lets me babysit my grandkids.

30
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,769
- What do you got?
- Found her out in the rain.

31
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:25,379
Looks like she slipped and fell. We called
for a paramedic unit, but she passed out.

32
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,004
We were only a couple blocks away,
be quicker to bring her in ourselves.

33
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,346
She's cold. Warm saline,
humidified O2 and the Bair Hugger.

34
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,817
- Right here.
- Jerry?

35
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,013
- Open your eyes.
- Pulse is weak.

36
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,456
- She broke her wrist when she fell.
- Maybe hit her head, she'll need a CT.

37
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,129
Some room.

38
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,131
- Pupils, equal and reactive.
- Fourteen liters by mask.

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,327
CBC, chem panel, UA,
EKG and chest x-ray.

40
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,030
Core temp is 90
degrees. Hugger's ready.

41
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,004
What's your name, dear?

42
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,972
Hello?

43
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,203
We got a name? ID?

44
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,246
- Nothing but her nightgown.
- Excuse me.

45
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,314
Blood alcohol
level is back, 420.

46
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,512
All right, no gag, she needs a tube.
- Systolic's only 66.

47
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,715
BA of 420. What is that,
like a gallon of tequila?

48
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,156
Dr. Gates. The girl's friends
wanna come back, see if she's okay.

49
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,059
Does she look like
she's okay, Jerry?

50
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,724
Give me that. Another 250
into the IO. Where's my access?

51
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,048
- Vein blows every time.
- Mac 3 and seven-oh.

52
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,265
- Damn it, lost it with the flush.
- Sterile gloves and a cordis.

53
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,102
- The tube won't pass.
- Try cricoid.

54
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,004
Breaths are shallow.

55
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,565
<i>The rain is gonna continue...</i>

56
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,702
<i>and that cold weather will
move across the lakes...</i>

57
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,106
Still raining?

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,945
I was thinking about renting
a boat, and rowing to work.

59
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,592
- How are the inmates?
- Cranky.

60
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,245
What's with the <i>iCarly</i>
crew out in the waiting room?

61
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,687
They came in with a kid
with alcohol poisoning.

62
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,020
- Gates has been flogging her for hours.
- Okay.

63
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,062
Looks like it's just us, we'll
work the board in 15 minutes.

64
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,098
- PV in three, needs an H & P, honey.
- Oh, lucky you.

65
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,066
- What's a PV?
- Projectile vomiting.

66
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,467
Guy's like a champ.
Puke went 8 feet.

67
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,972
- Thought he might have broken a window.
- Isn't this a nurse's job?

68
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,372
Why God created med students.

69
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,309
Did you finish your
lab paperwork...

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,745
or leave your usual
mess for me to clean up?

71
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,283
Love you too, Frank.
And so long, sucker.

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,879
Ah, ah.

73
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:25,048
- Ow! What?
- Didn't see you put anything in the jar.

74
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,318
No pay, no eat.

75
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,253
- No, I swear. Five bucks last week.
- Mm-hm.

76
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,229
Morris, your old lady standing
in the rain is back from CT.

77
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,300
- Night, everybody.
- I even put a 10 spot in the week before.

78
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,404
Sure, you did. Next time, write
your name on it just so I know.

79
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,938
- You don't trust me?
- You got it, champ.

80
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,744
Money with your name on it
before you leave today, Morris.

81
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,903
I've got a 3-year-old
with otitis media.

82
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,312
Mom poured hot garlic
oil into the kid's ear.

83
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,975
Looks like he has
second-degree burns.

84
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,433
Man. MORRIS: What was that?

85
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,524
PV patient, thought he'd
be out of ammo by now.

86
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,693
- Otitis kid?
- You know what? Find Brenner.

87
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,523
I'm off. I gotta finish up
with a few patients first.

88
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,994
CT negative for
fracture or bleed.

89
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,828
No anemia, EKG is normal.

90
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,595
And chemistries are okay.
- Okay?

91
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,298
- She's awake?
- Started coming around in CT.

92
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,474
Hello there.

93
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,976
- What's your name?
- Beverly.

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,309
- What's your last name?
- My name is Beverly.

95
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,609
Temp's up to 97.

96
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,619
Well, that means you don't
need this big blanket anymore.

97
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,223
Hey, do you remember what
happened to you, Beverly?

98
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,192
- No.
- You were out in the rain, you got cold.

99
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,298
- You slipped and broke your wrist.
- Oh, my wrist hurts.

100
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,024
Tubular stockinette.

101
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,327
Ooh. Oh.

102
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,963
Your hands are so warm.

103
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,874
Soft and strong.

104
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,309
Just like my Bobby's.

105
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,769
What do you see here?

106
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,012
She must've aspirated when she
was unconscious in the bathroom.

107
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,588
- And?
- Her brain is oxygen deprived.

108
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,589
And she still may be
altered when she sobers up.

109
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,388
All right. Two grams of
ceftriaxone with 500 clinda.

110
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,589
- And repeat an ETOH, please.
- So, what do we do now?

111
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,392
Now we wait.

112
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,727
Do you mind if I take off?

113
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,739
- My shift ended 20 minutes ago and...
- Yeah, go ahead, go. Go.

114
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,912
Her friends are still out front
asking if they can come back.

115
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,743
- Send them in. TRACY:
You think that's a good idea?

116
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,385
- Letting them see her like this?
- They should see the consequences.

117
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,216
- So it's okay with you if I go?
- Yeah, go.

118
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,516
Get some rest. Go ahead.

119
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,733
- Tony?
<i>- Hey, did I wake you?</i>

120
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:54,705
- No, I'm just getting Alex off to school.
- Happy birthday.

121
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,400
<i>- I got the day right, didn't I?</i>
- Yep.

122
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,910
<i>- Do you want me to sing for you?</i>
- No. God, no.

123
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,447
Mom, I don't wanna be late.

124
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,084
- Are you gonna do anything special?
<i>- Like what?</i>

125
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,948
I don't know. Get a tattoo?

126
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,784
Go skydiving? Hang
out with your friends?

127
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,290
- Come on.
- I gotta go.

128
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,588
- Happy birthday.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

129
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,367
Tony?

130
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,377
- Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.
- Dick and Heather White.

131
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,812
Are you Stacey's parents?

132
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,978
No. Stacey stayed at our house. Her
parents were in Springfield for a wedding.

133
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,487
So you've contacted them?

134
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,785
Yes, they're already coming,
they should be here soon.

135
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,325
Is she gonna be okay?

136
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,156
She's in a coma, and she
may have brain damage.

137
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,631
We're not gonna know if
she's okay till she wakes up.

138
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,359
Why does she need the tube?

139
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,836
To give her some oxygen
and protect her lungs.

140
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,533
It keeps her from choking
to death on her own saliva.

141
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,772
What were you guys drinking?

142
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,606
Vodka. Vodka and Kool-Aid.

143
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,046
We were playing I Never.

144
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,687
Stacey won.

145
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,787
Where'd you get the vodka?

146
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,695
Kids drink, we all know that.

147
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,232
We just wanted them to
be doing it somewhere safe.

148
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,926
So you supplied the alcohol?

149
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,436
I'd rather they drink at home,
than out where they could be driving.

150
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,167
Can I give her something?

151
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,315
- Come on, girls.
- Come on.

152
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,151
Let's go now.

153
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,727
Call the cops, get
them down here.

154
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,535
Hey, 9-month-old
with bronchiolitis...

155
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,502
on continuous nebs,
waiting on the PICU.

156
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,041
In 2, we have testicular pain
after a pommel horse incident.

157
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,701
That sport should be outlawed.

158
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,677
28-year-old with leukemia
cutis, Oncology's gonna see him.

159
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:18,012
We have the DKA. A is gone but
still has K, he needs to come in.

160
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,176
- What is that smell?
- The guy is a geyser.

161
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,412
- Who?
- PV guy.

162
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,854
- It's like dodging artillery.
- I don't think the wipes will do it.

163
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,960
- Grab some scrubs and ditch the clothes.
- Don't ditch, burn.

164
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,962
Guy in 3 torched his
fingers making crème brûlée.

165
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,861
Displaced tib/fib
going to Ortho.

166
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,935
Hallucinating trombone player in sutures
needs a tox screen and a psych consult.

167
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,401
And my job here is done.

168
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,303
Okay, Sanchez, testicular pain,
trombone guy, and displaced tib/fib.

169
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,570
Julia, leukemia cutis,
crème brûlée, and the DKA.

170
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,407
- Chaz. Chaz.
- Yeah?

171
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,779
We have prospective medical students
coming in here today for their interviews.

172
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,614
Dr. Anspaugh asked me to show them
around, but as I don't really want to...

173
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,587
and you're low guy on this
totem pole, you're elected.

174
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,818
- Med students?
- Prospective med students.

175
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,395
They're just a bunch of over-educated,
fiercely ambitious seniors...

176
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,295
trying to claw their way
into a prestigious program.

177
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,527
So show them a good time.

178
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,774
- Morris?
- Shh. I'm gonna put it back.

179
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,304
- Hey!
- Hey!

180
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,642
Money's in the jar, Frank.
- Morris?

181
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,250
- I'm out the door.
- Beverly's daughter showed up.

182
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,445
- Who?
- Old lady with the broken wrist.

183
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,986
Hello, I'm Dr. Morris.

184
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,990
Temp is 99. All
her labs check out.

185
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,755
God, she scared
us half to death.

186
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,422
Mom, you scared
us half to death.

187
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,160
I went in to make sure she was
getting up and her bed was empty.

188
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,101
I looked around the
house, around the yard...

189
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,366
I ran up and down
the street in the rain.

190
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,044
Tom got the car, he drove
all over the neighborhood.

191
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,646
- Her CT...
- I went over to the church, to Emma's.

192
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,283
I called the police and 20 hospitals.
I was out of my mind with worry.

193
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,884
- Out of my mind.
- She's gonna...

194
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,883
Sometimes she
wanders into the yard...

195
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,112
but she never,
ever, leaves the yard.

196
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,726
You can't leave the yard, Mom.

197
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,555
- She broke her wrist...
- You're gonna give me a stroke!

198
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,789
- You can get that from stress?
- A stroke?

199
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,197
- Stress can cause a stroke...
- What am I supposed to do about this?

200
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:19,533
Am I supposed to sew a LoJack
into your nightgown so I can find you?

201
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,537
Well, we're just
glad she's safe now.

202
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,701
You have to bring her back in
a couple days for a cast check...

203
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,678
come back sooner if there's pain,
redness or swelling. Take care, Beverly.

204
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,974
- Dr. Morris...
- No, no, no.

205
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,246
Get away from me or I'll hit
you. I mean it, right in the face.

206
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,387
Freedom!

207
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,996
- What was that all about?
- Hell if I know.

208
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,361
The police are here on
your alcohol-poisoning girl.

209
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,436
You've got to be kidding
me. Wait a minute.

210
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,110
- You called the cops?
- Damn right, I called the cops.

211
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,269
- This isn't our fault.
- Whose fault is it?

212
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,574
- Look, everybody does it.
- She had a blood alcohol level of 420!

213
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,775
That's not like giving
a kid a sip of wine.

214
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,285
- You're gonna have me arrested?
- Damn right, they're gonna arrest you.

215
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,016
That kid almost died. She could have
permanent brain damage. Four-twenty?

216
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,252
What were you doing when they
were drinking themselves to death?

217
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,227
TV? Mixing up another
batch of vodka and Kool-Aid?

218
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,524
- Get off!
- Come on!

219
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:20,928
Daddy! COP: Stay down!

220
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,801
Ma'am, please. Stay
down, stay down.

221
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,973
- Wanna call my lawyer.
- Have a good one.

222
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,038
Doc, you know
what? Shut the hell up.

223
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,186
Wow. Should we
be building an ark?

224
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,189
The news said we could get
as much as 5 inches today.

225
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,690
Glad I'm not an EMT anymore.

226
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,852
Day like this, you get wet early,
you stay wet the whole shift.

227
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,588
You'll never get dry.

228
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:55,758
37-year-old construction worker,
took a 15-foot fall from the scaffolding.

229
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,372
- Diffuse abdominal pain, impaled thigh.
- No pulse in the right foot.

230
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,064
Bagged his femoral artery.

231
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,869
BP 90, palp with 3 liters
of saline over 45 minutes.

232
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,598
Kind of a long transport time.

233
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,248
Had to wait for City Fire
to saw him off the rebar.

234
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,714
- His name's Dickie DeAngelo.
- That looks nasty.

235
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,375
Look at this idiot.

236
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,284
Who drives into that? What, did
he think it was, like, just a puddle?

237
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:21,952
Dr. Gates, that alcohol-poisoning
girl's parents are here.

238
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,063
- Hi.
- Hello.

239
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,739
Hey, doc. You got time
for a kid with a bellyache?

240
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,807
Grandma only speaks Spanish.

241
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,706
My Spanish is pretty shaky,
I've been taking a course...

242
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,710
It's gotta be better
than mine. All I got is:

243
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:47,451
Four-year-old boy, only thing I can think
of is something to do with his stomach.

244
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,920
The administrative
social worker...

245
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,752
and counseling offices
are all on the second floor...

246
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:57,795
along with the wellness
classrooms and the therapy rooms.

247
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,432
Oh, my gosh.

248
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,234
This is... This is beautiful.
- John.

249
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,638
Thirty-six exam
rooms, radiology suite.

250
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,677
Two dental suites, shower
facilities for the homeless.

251
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,748
Ob-gyn, optometry,
pharmacy, diagnostics...

252
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,011
rapid HIV testing and
support, reproductive health.

253
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,350
Wow, I can't believe you
were actually able to pull this off.

254
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,684
You had doubts?

255
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,656
No, I was pretty sure
you were gonna fail.

256
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,764
Tell me, are you gonna be able to
get funding for the county to staff this?

257
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,491
No. I'm gonna be fundraising
for the rest of my life.

258
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,535
We have enough to keep
us going for the first year...

259
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,797
while I try to build
up some endowment.

260
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,170
Carter, I knew you were rich. I
didn't know you were this rich.

261
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,676
It's the ill-begotten gains of my
Carter forefathers, put to good use.

262
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,680
- Redemption?
- Maybe so.

263
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,512
Your grandma would be so proud.

264
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,950
Grandfather's rolling
over in his grave.

265
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,489
He thought the Carter money was
gonna last longer than the pyramids.

266
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,891
- You spent it all?
- No, but most of it.

267
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,793
You've done a great
thing here, John.

268
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,366
A truly great thing.

269
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,034
Paramedics are pulling in with a
47-year-old male with chest pain.

270
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,735
And I've got a 60-year-old
man short of breath.

271
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:22,746
Okay, Julia, take the short of breath.
Chaz, you're with me for the rule-out MI.

272
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,248
He looked like crap so
I brought him right back.

273
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,320
Sats were 72 percent. So I went ahead
and hooked him up with some oxygen.

274
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,151
Okay.

275
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,017
Hello, I'm Dr. Wise.

276
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,321
And you are Mr. Gandhi.

277
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,330
My mom was a Mahatma fan.

278
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,661
And how long have you been sick?

279
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,271
- About 20 years.
- More recently?

280
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,771
Trouble breathing?
Couple of weeks.

281
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:52,673
- Do you have lung disease?
- Not that I know of.

282
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,041
- Heart problems?
- No.

283
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,276
- Any fever?
- Just can't breathe.

284
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,680
Okay.

285
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,790
Portable chest, 100 percent
non-rebreather, EKG, first-day labs.

286
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,688
- IV?
- Start a saline lock.

287
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,295
- Wear gloves.
- What?

288
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,522
I have AIDS.

289
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,651
- Should we intubate?
- Not yet.

290
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,820
Tachypneic, still
hypoxic on 100 percent?

291
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,354
What do you see?

292
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,991
Bilateral effusions, that
explains his shortness of breath.

293
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,529
Mm-hm. And that
gives us something to fix.

294
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,426
Two thoracentesis trays, please.

295
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,033
We have to tube him if he
has underlying pneumonia.

296
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,793
One step at a time.

297
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,200
What are you two talking about?

298
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:29,433
You have a lot of fluid outside your lungs.
It's making it hard for you to breathe.

299
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,943
- What can you do for that?
- Well, we can drain the fluid.

300
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,104
Which is gonna make
you feel a lot better.

301
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,946
So put your mask back on
and let's lean you forward.

302
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,385
Just dangle your
legs. That's the way.

303
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,524
We're gonna clean
the skin with Betadine.

304
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,684
You're gonna feel a sting while
we numb the skin, Mr. Gandhi.

305
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,025
- Gandhi?
- Yeah, his mother was an admirer.

306
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:02,971
Now, you're going to feel some pressure
while the needle passes through the ribs.

307
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,571
Fluid looks a little bloody.

308
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,912
Let's send it for a cell count, culture
and gram stain, AFB, and Cytology.

309
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,321
Hey, you're gonna have some
coughing as your lungs expand.

310
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,618
But that's a good thing.
That means it's working.

311
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,770
No change?

312
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,671
We have to move her, we need
the trauma room for an MVC.

313
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,573
Come on, guys.

314
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:47,416
Why don't you go home? We'll
call you if anything changes.

315
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,957
Hey, Frank, I'm going home.

316
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,564
Call me if anything
changes with the Taylor girl.

317
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,963
- Who?
- Alcohol poisoning?

318
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,865
Oh. Another one of those kids
showed up asking about her.

319
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,768
She's the one with
braids out in waiting.

320
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,211
Hi. I'm Dr. Gates. Are you
here to see Stacey Taylor?

321
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,447
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, she's in a coma.

322
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,250
And we don't know when or if
she's going to regain consciousness.

323
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,330
- Were you at the party last night?
- No.

324
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,468
I heard what happened.

325
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,233
Are you here by yourself?

326
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:48,778
You know, her friends and her
parents are on the second floor.

327
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:53,079
Maybe you wanna go up there.
You might be more comfortable.

328
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,956
I should have done something.

329
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,990
Well, you weren't there, right?

330
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,096
Stacey was texting me.

331
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,924
My parents wouldn't let me go.

332
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,001
I was really angry
I wasn't there...

333
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,531
so she was texting me all
night to tell me about the party.

334
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:19,175
She told me she was sick,
really sick, and throwing up.

335
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,475
And I...

336
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,608
I thought it was funny.

337
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,114
I should have called somebody.

338
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,555
I could have...

339
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,898
Maybe I could have...

340
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,006
The ER is the nerve
center where it all begins.

341
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:03,151
Between the ER and urgent care,
we see over 200,000 patients a year.

342
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,224
As med students, this is
gonna be your first rotation.

343
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,691
Four years to see if
you've got what it takes...

344
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,160
to be on the front line
of urban medicine...

345
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,732
or if you're a little bit more
suited for dermatology or plastics.

346
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,096
Something a little bit more...

347
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:21,498
A little bit more safe that you
can practice out in the suburbs.

348
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,707
Triage is our first stop.

349
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,845
We rely on our
talented nursing staff...

350
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,845
to determine who's gonna
be first and who is gonna wait.

351
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,744
And wait, and wait.

352
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,353
These trained professionals can
tell the difference between a hot MI...

353
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,285
and common indigestion
just by looking at a guy.

354
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,188
After triage, the patient is
brought back, their chart is racked.

355
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,522
You pick up the next
in line, no matter what.

356
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,758
Swap fecal incontinence for knee
pain, you'll never hear the end of it.

357
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,401
Glad you learned your lesson.

358
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,130
Our curtain areas are
for our subacute patients.

359
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,207
Over there is the break room where
we got bad coffee and stale bagels.

360
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,073
Trust me, you don't wanna be
going over there. Excuse me?

361
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,248
Keep up, okay? So here's the
deal about being a med student.

362
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,945
Some docs like to teach, but most
just see us as being a pain in the ass.

363
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:14,287
So they're not gonna be issuing
no formal invitation to the cool stuff.

364
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,089
You gotta keep your eye
open and go after the action...

365
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,960
it's not gonna come
to you, come on.

366
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:24,228
Another epi, let's shock
him... Shock him again.

367
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,236
- Chaz?
- This is Dr. Brenner.

368
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,271
One of our fine ER attendings.

369
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,239
This is the tour of prospective
medical students you asked me...

370
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,242
Chaz, get them
the hell out of here!

371
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,941
Okay.

372
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,948
So who wants to
see the Suture Room?

373
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,643
Clear!

374
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,989
- Anybody seen Brenner?
- Down in Trauma with the chest pain.

375
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,824
- You okay?
- Just got results back on a patient.

376
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,829
Bad news?

377
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,967
- You want company?
- No, I should do it.

378
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,333
No time like the present.

379
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,464
Right.

380
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,838
Post-tap film came back.
Your lungs have re-expanded.

381
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:11,142
- No pneumonia, are you feeling better?
- I can breathe again.

382
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:17,015
- You said you've been sick for years?
- Well, I got the AIDS diagnosis in 1987.

383
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,952
Started AZT soon as it was out.

384
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,822
It's great that you've been
able to fight it off this long.

385
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,926
Come on, doctor,
no holding back.

386
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:33,131
I can take it, believe me.

387
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,507
Your test results came back.

388
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,078
There were atypical lymphocytes.

389
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,216
Large immunoblastic cells.

390
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,645
And what does that mean?

391
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:51,220
It means that you have cancer.

392
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,330
It's a little nasty
out there today.

393
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,993
Keeps up, we're gonna
start handing out life jackets.

394
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,230
- How are you?
- I'm on the mend.

395
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,001
- Everything working?
- No complaints with the plumbing.

396
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,044
Wish I could say the same. I
was up six, seven times last night.

397
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,079
- Kind of a quiet day today, huh?
- Yeah.

398
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,876
I'm pulling out a crossword
puzzle to fill the time.

399
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,110
I had lunch with Susan
Lewis, Kerry Weaver.

400
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,619
Really? How is
the old dragon lady?

401
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,188
She's good.

402
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,452
- Susan, actually, looks fantastic.
- What are they doing in town?

403
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,927
Tonight's the opening of the
Carter Center. They came in for it.

404
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,965
- Open bar, free food on fancy crackers?
- All that.

405
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,126
Housekeeping needs
to clean up Trauma 2.

406
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:41,364
- It's still a mess after that shotgun kid.
- They're trying to mop up a roof leak.

407
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,872
- What's up?
- A pregnant woman coming in, MVA.

408
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,635
Here they are.

409
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,511
- Hey, store that for me, would you?
- Sure.

410
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,216
36-year-old female, nine
months pregnant with twins.

411
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,328
Broke her water at home.
- Contraction!

412
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,328
Traffic collision on the
way. T-boned by a CTA bus.

413
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,761
- Is this your first pregnancy?
- Fourth.

414
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,597
Struck on the passenger
side. Tachy to 120, BP's normal.

415
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,262
- Get me off this.
- As soon as we assess you, ma'am.

416
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,137
Let's get her inside. - Ah!

417
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,844
On my count. One, two, three.

418
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,610
My husband should be here.

419
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,119
He was on his way to
meet me at Mount Sinai.

420
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,817
Okay, check the perineum,
I'll do a primary survey.

421
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,960
- I've gotta push.
- It's okay, not yet.

422
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,789
Not yet. LISA: I gotta.

423
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,693
Sterile gloves and an OB
kit. What do we need, Julia?

424
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,300
CBC, coags, type, Rh.

425
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,835
- And?
- Fetal monitor.

426
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,939
- Right, fetal monitor.
- Would you care to pitch in?

427
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,872
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
- Ah!

428
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,377
Now, don't move your neck until
we make sure that it's not broken.

429
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,813
I'm fine. HALEH: I
guess the C-spine is clear.

430
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,077
She's crowning.

431
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:05,115
- All right, Mom. You can push now.
- Ah!

432
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,460
Get ready, twins, go quick.

433
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,290
Delivering the shoulders.

434
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,800
It's a girl.

435
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,099
- Umbilical clamp.
- Is she okay?

436
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,710
She's got a great set of lungs.

437
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,044
Oh, baby looks great.

438
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,014
Apgar of 9. One off for color.

439
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,354
Congratulations, Mom.
One down, one to go.

440
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,943
Hi, you're beautiful.

441
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,689
Hi.

442
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,623
We paged OB down for the
twins. Has anybody seen them?

443
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,526
Coburn's in an
emergency C-section.

444
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,190
She'd send a resident soon
as she could free one up.

445
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,304
The husband just showed.
He's the wet, anxious guy.

446
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,541
- Mr. Salamunovich?
- Yeah, Chris, is Lisa okay?

447
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,475
First baby's out and healthy,
we're waiting on the second.

448
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,273
Oh, God.

449
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:45,082
- Can I help you?
- You don't remember me.

450
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,225
Should I?

451
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,424
God, it's amazing how little
has changed around here.

452
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,096
- My dad used to be on staff.
- Mm-hm.

453
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,134
Mark Greene. I'm
his daughter, Rachel.

454
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,341
We have three boys
under the age of 10 at home.

455
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,006
Three? LISA: Yep.

456
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,652
It's a madhouse.

457
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,688
But I wanted a girl.

458
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:22,123
So before Chris went in to get
snipped, we decided to try one more time.

459
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,924
We ended up with twins.

460
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,759
- Hey.
- What are the chances of that?

461
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,833
Hey, little Camille. Hey.

462
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,800
- We're still going with Camille?
- Yeah, fine by me.

463
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,167
It was my grandmother's name.

464
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,537
Honey, keep an eye on the clock.
Preschool pick-up is in an hour.

465
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,269
- Oh, I'll just have my mom go get him.
- No, no, no, you should... Oh!

466
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:47,286
- Another contraction.
- Okay, big push this time.

467
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,946
Okay, big push.

468
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,321
- Fetal heart rate's down.
- What does that mean?

469
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:59,397
- It could be a sign of distress.
- Okay, Mom, let's get this baby out.

470
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,270
I can see the head.

471
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,563
- Meconium.
- Give me suction now, please.

472
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,763
What's meconium?

473
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:10,298
It's in the baby's
intestine prior to birth.

474
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:14,207
It can pass into the amniotic fluid
and get into their lungs during birth.

475
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,847
Ah!

476
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,853
- How bad is that?
- Clamp and cut.

477
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,286
If it gets into the lungs,
then she has to be intubated.

478
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,049
It has to be sucked out.

479
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,935
It's another girl, honey.

480
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,372
- She's not crying.
- That's intentional.

481
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:48,240
- We don't want her to breathe in the mec.
- Laryngoscope and suction, please.

482
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,109
Mom's heart rate's up to 140.

483
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,682
- Some bleeding.
- Two liters of saline, wide open.

484
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,911
- A lot of bleeding. BRENNER:
Let's get more access.

485
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,319
Put gentle traction on the cord.
Get two units from the blood bank.

486
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,515
Meconium at the epiglottis.

487
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,183
She's cyanotic. - Honey?

488
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,363
- Poor tone.
- Is she okay?

489
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,431
- Systolic's down to 90.
- Prime the rapid infuser, where is OB?

490
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,431
Ah!

491
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:17,702
Is that the placenta?

492
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,838
That looks like
uterine inversion.

493
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,277
- What?
- Need some steriles.

494
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:27,385
The uterus has turned itself inside out
and has pushed itself through the cervix.

495
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,578
I need you to push it back in.

496
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,579
Ah!

497
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,287
- It won't go.
- All right, IV nitro, right now!

498
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,089
Ah!

499
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,822
Set up for an intubation
on Mom. Two units of FFP.

500
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,298
Let's have the blood
bank stay ahead four units.

501
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,442
Pressure's only
65/45. Second unit's in.

502
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,637
- Hang two more.
- No, it won't go.

503
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,442
- Four units of mag.
- What's happening?

504
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,994
If we can't get your wife's uterus
in, we have to take her to the OR.

505
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:35,715
Put her under and see if
we can relax the uterus a bit.

506
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,755
- Heart rate's up to 140.
- Try one more time, push hard.

507
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,220
Really push.

508
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,920
Come on, get in
there, really push.

509
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:53,764
- It's in.
- It's in?

510
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,669
- Yeah.
- Great. Hold off on the nitro.

511
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,537
20 of Pit in a liter, wide open.

512
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,076
Keep pressure on the cervix. Push
in, all the way up to your forearm.

513
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,613
I want you to massage
the uterus at the umbilicus.

514
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,613
OB's here. Heard you had twins.

515
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,083
We just reduced an inverted
uterus, she's bleeding with accreta.

516
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,780
- I'm bringing her up. CHRIS:
What are you going to do?

517
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,186
- You're the dad?
- Yes.

518
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,759
We need to stop the bleeding or
else we give her a hysterectomy.

519
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,420
- How about the twins? BRENNER:
Second one aspirated mec.

520
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,157
- I paged Pedes.
- Should I let go?

521
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,961
- Don't let go till they tell you to.
- Should I go?

522
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,104
Your wife is gonna
be under anesthesia...

523
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,105
but we'll give you updates
from the operating room.

524
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,971
Your wife mentioned something about
having to pick up your kids at school.

525
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,639
If you need to make a call, you
can use that phone on the wall there.

526
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,402
Sarah, Sarah!

527
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,333
Wait. GATES: Hey!

528
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,842
- I thought you couldn't pick me up.
- I couldn't sleep, get in.

529
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,038
But I was gonna go
to Madison's to study.

530
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:13,015
I'll give you a ride, I have
to meet Alex to finish the car.

531
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,852
So, what's up, Tony?

532
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,255
You ever play I
Never? A drinking game.

533
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,328
I haven't been drinking, okay?

534
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,593
- I Never?
- I've heard of it.

535
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,830
I mean, some kids from school
have played it at parties and stuff.

536
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,271
How many drinks do you think
it'd take to be drunk enough to die?

537
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,501
- What?
- What do you weigh, 90 pounds?

538
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:43,206
How many drinks would you have to
down before the alcohol would kill you?

539
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,441
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

540
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,210
- Five, 10, 20, 50?
- I don't know, 20?

541
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,514
- Try six.
- Six?

542
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,750
Yeah, that could do
it. That could kill you.

543
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,257
Hand me your phone.

544
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,921
Give me your... I'll give it back
to you. I just wanna... Give it.

545
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,258
Do me a favor.

546
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:06,201
Next time you're at a party and you're
drinking, you've had too much to drink.

547
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,533
Or you're throwing
up, or your friends are...

548
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,472
or somebody's texting you
saying they're throwing up...

549
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,377
hit that.

550
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,305
"Help"?

551
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,911
- Who's it call?
- Me.

552
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,110
And I'll come, no
questions asked.

553
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,121
I'll help you, I'll help your
friends, I'll make sure you're okay.

554
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,116
No questions asked?

555
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,666
When did it stop raining?

556
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,928
- How's that second twin doing?
- Intubated, waiting for Pedes.

557
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,833
- Did Mom get to the OR okay?
- Yeah.

558
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,065
I'm going for coffee,
anybody want a latte?

559
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,675
- Sure, non-fat, double shot.
- Non-fat, double shot.

560
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,141
Mocha frap, extra foam.

561
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,440
Excuse me, I'm not
sure I'm in the right place.

562
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,641
My daughter-in-law's here
somewhere, having twins?

563
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,616
Is her name Lisa? Come with me.

564
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,949
Go right in and just
check in with that nurse.

565
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,649
- Julia, there's a call for you, Oncology.
- Thanks.

566
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,761
Hey, you guys know a doctor
used to work here named Greene?

567
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,420
His daughter was on my
tour, applying to med school.

568
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:07,998
- Rachel?
- Yeah, I think so.

569
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,328
You're kidding me.
Is she still around?

570
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,731
I dropped the tour
off at the dean's office.

571
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,803
They're doing
interviews this afternoon.

572
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,480
Rachel?

573
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,455
- Dr. Carter!
- Hey, look at you.

574
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,650
You're all grown
up. How old are you?

575
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,328
- Twenty-two.
- Oh, my God.

576
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,191
I remember you when you were...

577
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,856
Now you're going to
medical school, huh?

578
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,467
- Took your MCATs?
- Yeah.

579
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,069
- Where you doing your undergraduate?
- Duke.

580
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,399
Elizabeth's on faculty there,
so I get a good deal on tuition.

581
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,408
- Elizabeth Corday?
- Yeah, actually she flew up with me.

582
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,637
Elizabeth is in Chicago? What
are you both doing later tonight?

583
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,180
I don't know. I think
we're seeing some friends.

584
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,376
No, no, no. You have to come
to this thing that we're doing.

585
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,851
Rachel Greene?

586
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,889
This is my number. Give this
to Elizabeth, have her call me.

587
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,687
- It's good to see you, good luck in there.
- Good to see you. Thanks.

588
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,030
Thanks, yeah.

589
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,227
Path says it's primary
effusion lymphoma.

590
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,736
- Who's this?
- My guy who couldn't breathe.

591
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,500
- What's his prognosis?
- Median survival is two months.

592
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,734
And his options?

593
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,401
Chemo and radiation could
give him a couple months.

594
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,413
- You told him he has cancer?
- Yeah, a couple hours ago.

595
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,744
- Brave.
- Or maybe he's just relieved.

596
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,443
- Relieved?
- Dr. Brenner?

597
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:39,021
To finally know how and
when after all these years.

598
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,727
Back and forth, keep it smooth.

599
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,564
Excellent. Good. That'll do it.

600
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,805
Yeah, man, it looks good.
You were right about the color.

601
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,343
I don't know. Cobalt blue
would've been cool too.

602
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:03,447
No. Red is more your mother.

603
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,049
- Yeah, all fire.
- Well, better than cold and distant.

604
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,245
- If you say so.
- I know so.

605
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,721
- She's gonna love this.
- Definitely.

606
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,587
- Sorry, I've been gone so long.
- Oh, that's okay, Gerry came by.

607
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,063
Gerry Gugliemotto,
Dr. Wise. She is very nice.

608
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,997
- Great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

609
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:27,071
Gerry brought me gardenias.
I just love gardenias.

610
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,968
Don't you? I mean, the smell.

611
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,508
The rest of your labs came
back, everything looks clear.

612
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,144
Except for the cancer.

613
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,610
It means your body could
tolerate chemotherapy.

614
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,183
- No, no, thanks.
- It could buy you a few more months.

615
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,853
I've already had an
extra 20 years, doc.

616
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,456
I should have died with
my friends in the '80s.

617
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,182
You're still here.

618
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,257
Tommy and Bill.

619
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,191
Jeff and David.

620
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,661
- Remember Michael Thomas?
- Of course, I do.

621
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,029
Little Bobby?

622
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,297
So many people I loved.

623
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:04,708
I've been trying to live
for them, you know?

624
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,674
Keep their memories alive.

625
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,609
But I've had my
time, no regrets.

626
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,452
I went skydiving
last year, in Hawaii.

627
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:25,157
It was the most remarkable
thing. I was floating, free.

628
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,323
I couldn't feel my body.

629
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,938
I'm afraid of heights,
but I wasn't up there.

630
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,501
I guess that's kind of what
I hope death is like, doc.

631
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:43,938
Floating, free in the
air, above everything.

632
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,949
Just watching
the world drift by.

633
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:55,017
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- Yeah, there is.

634
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,254
I don't want it to hurt.

635
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,002
We can help with that.

636
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,106
66-year-old woman
ruling in for MI.

637
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:20,480
Going to the cath lab any second.
Hula girl needs an x-ray of her wrist.

638
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:23,144
We've got an SBO who's
NPO and not happy about it.

639
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,720
A sickler with a fever.

640
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,825
Dislodged G-tube on an old
gal that came in from Lakeshore.

641
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:31,793
And a 3-week-old with lethargy
and cardiomegaly, admitted for echo.

642
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,831
As you can see, the hallucinating
trombone guy's still here.

643
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,663
Tox was negative, but we're trying to
find a psych bed somewhere in Chicago.

644
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,568
- My alcohol-poisoning girl still here?
- Family didn't want her admitted here.

645
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,904
They're transferring her to Mercy,
but Mercy hasn't picked her up.

646
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:51,340
Hey, Jerry. Look at
this inbox, it's empty.

647
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:55,510
All of my day-shift
paperwork is completed.

648
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:59,624
Look, it's a thing of beauty,
it's a clerical <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

649
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,693
I just wanted you to see what
an empty inbox looks like...

650
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:08,800
so you can try to replicate that
for when I come in tomorrow, okay?

651
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:13,096
- Tough day?
- About the same as every other.

652
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,705
- Night, y'all.
- Good night.

653
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,273
Watch out for the guy
in 3, he's a grabber.

654
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,172
Thanks.

655
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,635
Hi.

656
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,139
- You look nice.
- Oh, I got a thing to go to.

657
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,515
You saw a med-school
applicant today. Rachel Greene.

658
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:30,780
She's pretty great.

659
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,550
- She a student of yours?
- She's Mark Greene's daughter.

660
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:38,126
Mm-hm. So you have no first-hand
knowledge of her academic qualifications?

661
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,527
No, I've known her
since she was a kid.

662
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,530
Mark was a pretty great doctor.

663
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,330
I'm sure the apple didn't
fall too far from the tree.

664
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,233
She did well on the interview.

665
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,674
I can't say if she'll make our
final list, but she made the first cut.

666
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,566
- So he's a bit of a boozer?
<i>- Stinks of bourbon by noon.</i>

667
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,514
- It doesn't affect his work?
<i>- That's the irritating thing.</i>

668
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,211
<i>Drunk as a skunk and he's
still a wonderful surgeon.</i>

669
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:04,481
- Is that Neela?
- Yeah.

670
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,681
- Hey, how's the teaching going?
<i>- Hey!</i>

671
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:11,023
<i>Oh, I've got mostly R-3s, very polite,
following me around like ducklings.</i>

672
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:14,495
I'm sure they're in awe of the
depth of your surgical brilliance.

673
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,998
It's either that or your
exceptional beauty.

674
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,228
<i>- They may just be stupid.</i>
- Is that Neela?

675
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,563
- Yeah.
- Hey.

676
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:23,207
<i>- Hey!</i> MORRIS:
How's life on the bayou?

677
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,775
<i>The bayou is like 100
miles away, Morris.</i>

678
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,878
Dr. Brenner? Pedes showed
up to extubate the mec twin.

679
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,881
- I've gotta go, I'll speak to you later.
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>

680
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,609
- How's the mom?
- Still in surgery, I think.

681
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,686
- She's still in the OR?
- As far as I know, yeah.

682
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,415
Hey, you mind if I
tag along with you?

683
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,918
- See you, Neela.
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>

684
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:47,894
Hey, Joe. How we doing?

685
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,628
Suctioned out the trachea and the
stomach. No mec below the cords.

686
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:55,433
Satting at 100 percent. Vigorous
tone, good respiratory effort.

687
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,235
- I think we can extubate.
- Blow-by oxygen is ready.

688
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,207
Here we go.

689
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:16,954
Good air movement.

690
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:24,296
- Can I hold her?
- By all means.

691
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,232
How about you go and
prep the rest of the kids?

692
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,567
Oh, I gotta go.

693
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,799
Good work, doctors.

694
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,409
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.

695
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,975
What's the mom still
doing up in the OR?

696
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:44,987
She's probably already out.
Sometimes, they forget to call.

697
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,594
Hey, guys. You wanna
meet your sisters?

698
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,821
- Yeah.
- Yes.

699
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,091
- Come on.
- All right.

700
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:01,302
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, kiddo. Look at this.

701
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,805
- Look. Hi, love.
- Hey, Ma.

702
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,774
- Look at this.
- Look.

703
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,780
You got sisters.

704
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,777
Where's my mom?

705
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,384
82-year-old woman with history of MS
and pyelonephritis on home IV therapy.

706
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:27,156
Now with altered mental status
and respiratory distress. BP's 60 palp.

707
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:31,132
Gave 500 cc's of saline to get her
pressure up but it's going to her lungs.

708
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,362
She's been coughing
and groaning terrible.

709
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:36,133
- She's burning up.
- Pulmonary edema, probably septic.

710
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:41,245
This is the second time we've been here.
We've been taken care of by Dr. Gates.

711
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,854
Her parents around?

712
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,830
They've been here all day,
they must be around somewhere.

713
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,198
Hey, Tony? Elderly MS
lady just came in with sepsis.

714
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,532
Husband said you've
been treating her.

715
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,710
- You look tired.
- Thanks.

716
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,086
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, this...

717
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:28,351
This 17-year-old girl came in
last night with alcohol poisoning.

718
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,927
BA 420. Still
hasn't come around.

719
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,429
She was texting her friend all
night, telling her she was throwing up.

720
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,568
Friend thought it was cool.

721
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,070
Mr. Manning.

722
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:42,897
Marjorie's not
doing too well, huh?

723
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:51,406
I know a lot of us never actually
thought that this day would come.

724
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,949
In fact, I think I
was one of them.

725
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,451
But here we are in
this beautiful facility.

726
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:04,221
Finally ready to provide
state-of-the-art outpatient services...

727
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:09,390
to the HIV/AIDS community,
the homeless, families in need.

728
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:16,064
Medical care, dental care,
daycare, counseling, services.

729
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,836
Services that have been sorely
lacking at County for many years.

730
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:25,473
I don't wanna try your
patience by rambling on too long.

731
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,983
But I hope you'll bear
with me for a moment...

732
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,782
while I talk about why we chose to
name this the Joshua Carter Center.

733
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:40,955
My wife and I had a son
and we named him Joshua.

734
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,993
And he died.

735
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,699
Excuse me.

736
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:53,140
And it seemed so
senseless that we...

737
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,812
That we... My wife
and I, we struggled...

738
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:04,012
to find some sort
of meaning in it.

739
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,351
And in the aftermath
of our small tragedy...

740
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:14,158
we realized that we could make
a difference in other people's lives.

741
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:20,464
Other people experiencing
their own small tragedies.

742
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:27,407
And that made, somehow,
the loss of Joshua bearable.

743
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:34,342
Thank you so much for coming.

744
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,817
Bravo.

745
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,426
- You done good.
- I didn't embarrass myself?

746
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,537
I wouldn't go that far.

747
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:05,005
You came, I didn't
think you would.

748
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,742
Neither did I.

749
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:12,314
Sorry I was late,
flight was delayed.

750
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:13,957
That's...

751
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,260
That was a beautiful speech.
- Hey, John.

752
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:20,125
I want you to meet Wendy
Spence from the Ford Foundation.

753
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,027
Right over here.

754
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:27,598
Your wife has low blood
pressure from the sepsis.

755
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:31,470
But giving her IV fluids will only
cause more damage to the lungs.

756
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,577
We discussed this when you
wanted to take her home, Paul...

757
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,578
that this would
most likely happen.

758
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:42,584
I didn't realize.
Please, do something.

759
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,113
Well, Marjorie has a DNR,
she doesn't want us to intervene.

760
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:50,459
Oh. I've got her
power of attorney here.

761
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:55,293
Yeah, that means I
can decide for her, right?

762
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:02,604
Your wife has a degenerative
disease that's left her debilitated...

763
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,572
without enough strength
to fight off this infection.

764
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,371
Even with
aggressive treatment...

765
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,448
she would only live a week
or two in the ICU on machines.

766
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:17,922
A ventilator, dialysis, IV pumps
to keep her blood pressure up.

767
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,248
It's only going to prolong
the pain and suffering.

768
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,425
I'm not ready to lose her.

769
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:36,463
It's time to talk about how to make
her as comfortable as possible.

770
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,650
Paul?

771
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,118
Excuse me, I'm here
to check on a patient.

772
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,854
- You are?
- Dr. Wise from the ER.

773
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,555
I called but I got put on hold.

774
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:04,667
We're swamped, couple of
people called in sick, stomach flu.

775
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,964
We brought a woman up, inverted
uterus, bleeding with an accreta.

776
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,367
Her name's Salamunovich.

777
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,566
Dr. Zwerling went
out to find the family.

778
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:15,474
They're downstairs, they have a
bunch of kids. One of the twins had mec.

779
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,478
Did she have to have
the hysterectomy?

780
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:21,141
No, she went into DIC, they coded
her for over an hour and she died.

781
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,271
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

782
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,672
Here. Make a wish and
blow out the candles.

783
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,845
- Very funny, very funny.
- What'd you wish?

784
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,613
I wished that nobody told
you guys it was my birthday.

785
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,883
- Cut the cake.
- What are you doing here?

786
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,788
I wanted to give
you your present.

787
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,552
- How'd you get here?
- I drove.

788
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,425
- Drove? Drove what?
- Well, wanna see it?

789
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,231
- Go ahead. We got it.
- Yeah.

790
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,593
Maybe...

791
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:15,629
Hey, the twins are doing great.

792
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,139
They're keeping one
overnight in the NICU...

793
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,368
but the other one's already
on the way to the nursery.

794
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,247
What?

795
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,752
- What are you doing?
- Just one second.

796
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,547
- Give me one second.
- I'm working.

797
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,054
Mom, just one
minute. You'll love it.

798
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,293
What are you doing?

799
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,059
You drove that?

800
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,137
Whose car is that?

801
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:50,068
- Alex, do they know you have it?
- Mom.

802
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,771
Nobody's gonna let a
16-year-old kid drive that car.

803
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:56,675
- Open this.
- Whose car is that, Alex?

804
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:57,973
Just open the box.

805
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,978
Mom, it's yours.

806
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,747
It was pretty banged up at
first, but Tony helped me fix it up.

807
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,827
- Alex did all the work.
- No, no.

808
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:15,699
- Get in, go.
- What?

809
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,926
- Go, Mom.
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?

810
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,075
It's beautiful.

811
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,443
Are you serious? Are you...?

812
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,284
Mom, just turn it over.

813
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,013
Oh, my God.

814
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,901
I don't know if I can do this.

815
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,031
Do what?

816
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,541
This. Every day.

817
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,339
Sure you can.

818
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,038
People need help and
you know how to help them.

819
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,877
And if I can't help them?

820
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:15,425
You do the best you can, then
you go home, you get some sleep...

821
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:19,324
and you come back the next
day and you help the next one.

822
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:25,699
I'll see you tomorrow.

823
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,207
I should have grabbed
a jacket. It's freezing.

824
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,906
Feels good. I like it brisk.

825
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,917
- Brisk? You could hang meat out here.
- So go wait inside.

826
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,526
Not like we need
you to push gurneys.

827
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:47,385
Global warming? Those scientists
should spend April in Chicago.

828
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,494
49-year-old woman, laceration
to the forehead from a bottle.

829
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:52,596
- Vitals stable en route.
- What happened?

830
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,391
- Drunken brawl at the Marriott.
- Bitch cut me.

831
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,932
A free-for-all. Chairs
flying, champagne bottles.

832
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,628
We had to wait for the
cops to arrive to break it up.

833
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,500
Take her, I'll get the next one.

834
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:04,835
28-year-old female,
blunt trauma to the head.

835
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,806
- Lacerations to the left forearm.
- She broke my damn arm.

836
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,005
- Tiffany, you're dead, you hear me?
- You hit me with a chair.

837
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,275
It was like all-star
wrestling in there.

838
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,679
- At a wedding?
- My wedding.

839
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,411
You did this at my wedding, Mom.

840
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,818
That's what you wanted?
To ruin everything?

841
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,687
- That's your mother?
- Worse, my new mother-in-law.

842
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,760
That's not true.
Totally not true.

843
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,865
Yes, it is. You were there, yes.

844
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:33,162
No. I never pulled a guy's Foley
without deflating the balloon first.

845
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,067
You did. The patient
was so angry...

846
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:39,233
- he threw an emesis basin at your head.
- A Foley is for collecting urine.

847
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,436
Okay, what about the time where
he got crazy with Dermabond?

848
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,310
- And glued the lady's eye shut?
- That I did do, actually.

849
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,781
What about the time
when he spent three hours...

850
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,113
doing a one-inch head
lac without an x-ray?

851
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,621
He discovers there's still glass
in it, he had to go and do it again.

852
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,522
Really glad you came.
Don't believe them, Reese.

853
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,822
- Should we head out for a nightcap?
- Yeah, I'm in, you coming?

854
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:02,398
Gotta get this young man home.
- Come on.

855
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,727
No, no, no. It's a school night.

856
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,234
Gotta go to... No, get
you home. Go to sleep.

857
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,601
Drop Reese off with Cleo, then
come back out. The night's young.

858
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,142
I was gonna try Elizabeth,
see if they wanna drop by.

859
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:15,539
Great.

860
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,982
Elizabeth's an old friend.

861
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:22,517
No, a friend.

862
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,851
- So?
- So yeah?

863
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:28,720
- Yeah.
- You know, maybe, maybe. Maybe.

864
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,656
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

865
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,559
- Meet you there.
- Okay, great.

866
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,895
What were you talking about?

867
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,335
- What?
- With Kerry Weaver.

868
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,877
Africa. She was just
back last summer.

869
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:49,138
Visit friends.

870
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,282
It's gorgeous, John.

871
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:05,959
Do you wanna join us for drinks?

872
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,189
I'm a bit tired.

873
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,231
And it's 5 a.m. in Paris.

874
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,530
How long are you staying?

875
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,303
I leave tomorrow night.

876
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,875
It's hard for me
to be here, John.

877
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:30,987
I know, I'm glad you came.

878
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,257
Me too.

879
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:43,332
Can I buy you lunch tomorrow?

880
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,265
Go to Shaw's. Eat
too much seafood.

881
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,428
Take a walk by the lake.

882
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,631
It's supposed to be a nice day.

883
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:56,708
I was thinking about Joshua.

884
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:01,777
He'd be 5. Nearly 6.

885
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:06,455
I think about him
almost every day.

886
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,518
Lunch?

887
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:14,993
Maybe.

888
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,430
Call me in the morning.

889
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,665
Kem?

890
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:31,515
78-year-old man in
from the nursing home.

891
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:36,814
Penile pain, deformity and
bruising. Sorry I called you in on this.

892
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:42,221
I just don't feel very comfortable
with him alone, he's kind of randy.

893
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,521
Welcome back, doc. You
bring yourself a chaperon?

894
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:48,188
Mr. Thunhurst. You're
having penile pain?

895
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,197
Hurts like a son
of a bitch, doc.

896
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,960
Let's take a look.

897
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:59,503
- You're sexually active, I take it?
- Oh, yeah.

898
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,145
I don't need Viagra either.

899
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,714
The odds at the
nursing home are great.

900
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:08,318
I mean, women outlive
men, it's at least 4-to-1.

901
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,926
- You use condoms, I take it?
- Oh, you betcha, the big ones.

902
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:19,527
All right, you
fractured your penis.

903
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,793
Fractured?

904
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:25,900
- There's a bone in there?
- No bone.

905
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,267
A tear of the fibrous sheath
called the tunica albuginea.

906
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:32,238
Swelling, bruising, hematoma,
standard eggplant deformity.

907
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:36,005
Usually happens when the female is
on top. Was your partner on top, sir?

908
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,442
What? Cowgirl position?

909
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,776
Oh, no, no. That's not for me.

910
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,112
We were going at it
in the nurses' station...

911
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,254
while they were
running the movie night.

912
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:48,217
I slipped out and Mr. Fred
hit the edge of the desk.

913
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:54,353
He's gonna need retrograde urethrogram
to make sure there's no damage...

914
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,695
and surgery to evacuate the
hematoma and repair the albuginea.

915
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,133
Tony? THUNHURST: Surgery?

916
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,362
- How long am I out of action?
- Six weeks.

917
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,734
Good Lord.

918
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,738
What am I gonna tell the girls?

919
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,706
Paramedics have a chest pain...

920
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,319
and MS lady's breathing
is scaring the husband.

921
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,318
So do you like the car?

922
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:23,722
It's incredible and amazingly
cool, but I can't keep it.

923
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:24,953
Why not?

924
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:29,156
Alex couldn't afford that. I barely give
him enough to support his iTunes habit.

925
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,825
- He worked his ass off on that car.
- I can't take a car from you, Tony.

926
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:36,235
It was a piece of junk, he did
all the work, we found the parts.

927
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,807
It still must have cost
you hundreds of dollars.

928
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,238
Thousands of dollars?

929
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:44,074
Alex learned to rebuild a car. If
you don't take it, you'll break his heart.

930
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,909
Hey, that rule-out
MI is pulling up.

931
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,576
Talk Mr. Manning through what's
going on. I'll be there soon as I can.

932
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,984
If you're thinking about
selling the Mustang...

933
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,919
I will give you
$500 cash for it.

934
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,458
- Go away, Jerry.
- Seven hundred?

935
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,288
Oh, is Dr. Gates coming?

936
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:01,626
- Yeah, he'll be here soon.
- Because she stopped breathing.

937
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:05,462
And I thought she was gonna...
And then she started up again.

938
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:09,936
Yeah. Her irregular
breathing is completely natural.

939
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,472
It's all part of the
dying process.

940
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,308
Seventy-two years.

941
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:26,148
- I'm sorry?
- Seventy-two years.

942
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,154
I met her in the sixth grade.

943
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:32,023
That's how long we've known
each other. Seventy-two years.

944
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,357
And her family had
moved in from Nebraska...

945
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:37,990
because they lost the farm,
you know, during the Depression.

946
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:44,298
And Mrs. Ross, our teacher...

947
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:49,570
she said to take the
empty desk next to mine.

948
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,442
That was it.

949
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,448
You know?

950
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,316
I never looked at
another girl for 72 years.

951
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:08,488
You hear that, Mrs. Manning?
Not once, sweetheart.

952
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,707
Yeah, just, like, move it out.

953
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,680
Well, this is a thoroughly
disreputable looking group.

954
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:30,513
Oh, my God, Elizabeth.
Oh, it's good to see you.

955
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,518
- How are you?
- I'm good.

956
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:33,849
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi.

957
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:35,081
Hello.

958
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,698
- John.
- Thank God you showed.

959
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,854
- You were the bait we used to...
- Oh, come on, that's not true.

960
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,498
You remember Rachel.

961
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,894
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hey.

962
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,693
- Hello, Peter.
- Hey.

963
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:49,533
- I remember you when you were this big.
- Yes, everyone's been saying that.

964
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,107
- I can imagine, look at you.
- What can I get you?

965
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,540
- I'll have a cranberry juice.
- You look great.

966
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,077
- Thank you.
- And for you?

967
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:59,580
- I'd like a margarita, no salt.
- See some ID?

968
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:00,944
Absolutely.

969
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:03,185
- Oh, my God.
- So how's Ella?

970
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,312
Oh, she's 9, gorgeous.

971
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:08,356
Now, Peter, you and Cleo
are still together, right?

972
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:11,962
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's
actually an associate...

973
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,758
No, no, no, I'm dating again.
- A much younger man.

974
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,798
Yeah, it's shameful. - No.

975
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,368
No?

976
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,140
Roger Anderson, 48, with eight
hours of substernal chest pain.

977
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,571
- Why wait so long?
- I thought it would go away.

978
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,803
- Good vitals, no ST changes.
- Am I having a heart attack?

979
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:30,470
Too soon to tell.

980
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:33,139
First she traps Donnie
into getting married...

981
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,807
by getting herself pregnant.

982
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:37,147
Right, innocent Donnie,
perfect little Donnie.

983
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,848
I have news for you, Donnie about
raped me in the back seat of his Camaro.

984
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:44,858
I warned him that all she was after
was his paycheck and health benefits.

985
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,792
Right, his incredible salary
working for the post office. Ow!

986
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:51,833
Then she insisted on inviting her
inbred Kentucky relatives to the reception.

987
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:55,470
It wasn't my Uncle Phil who was
found pissing in the lobby fountain! Ouch!

988
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:57,639
- Keep still then.
- Am I gonna have a scar?

989
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,333
- A little one.
- You hear that, Tiffany?

990
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,206
- I'm gonna have a scar.
- Yeah?

991
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:05,941
I'm gonna be on my Caribbean beach
honeymoon with a cast on my arm!

992
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:09,449
- Tiff, are you okay?
- Oh, honey, baby, she broke my arm.

993
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:13,647
- Donnie, Donnie, is that you?
- Yeah, Mom, it's me.

994
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:16,053
Donnie, she cut me.

995
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:19,196
- I'm getting stitches in my face.
- Hold my hand, please.

996
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:23,197
- Come here and see what she did to me.
- Donnie, sweetheart? Hold my hand.

997
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,959
- Donnie, Donnie?
- Donnie, Donnie?

998
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,466
- Come here now.
- Come here.

999
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,605
- Donnie.
- You come here right now.

1000
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:33,569
I want to prepare you,
your mom's unconscious...

1001
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,406
and the sepsis has made
her breathing more difficult.

1002
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:40,641
We have her on oxygen to help
and morphine to relieve any pain.

1003
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,379
- So she's dying?
- Yeah.

1004
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,150
- Soon?
- Probably.

1005
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,387
Would you look at that?

1006
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:54,063
How much he loves her.

1007
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:58,431
I never could understand
how he put up with that woman.

1008
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:00,331
Tough as nails.

1009
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:05,172
Hard on him, hard on us.

1010
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:09,674
Then she gets sick and he takes
care of her for all these years.

1011
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:13,342
I would've left her by the
side of the road somewhere.

1012
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,253
You know what I was doing in the car
the whole way down from Milwaukee?

1013
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,952
Crying.

1014
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,720
Crying my eyes out.

1015
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,725
Beating myself up
trying to remember...

1016
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,263
what it was we fought
about last time we talked.

1017
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:30,900
Isn't that something?

1018
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,531
As if it mattered anymore.

1019
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,928
Hey, you mind if I eat
this last piece of cake?

1020
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,472
- No, knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

1021
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,737
ER. Yeah.

1022
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,906
What's up?

1023
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,410
I know. Soldier Field.

1024
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:28,257
No, Tommy's gonna
get us tickets. Yeah.

1025
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:30,526
That's fine.

1026
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:43,773
Mom. Hey, did I wake you?

1027
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,973
Uh... Yeah.

1028
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:50,242
Oh, who does Leno have on?

1029
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,350
No. No, I'm working tonight.

1030
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,053
How was your day?

1031
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:04,052
Yeah, they got me
a cake. Chocolate.

1032
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:09,265
That crazy grandson of yours, Alex,
tell you what he got me for my birthday?

1033
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:11,792
A car.

1034
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,369
No, he rebuilt...

1035
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:19,600
Ah. WEAVER: Whoa.

1036
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:21,242
It got so cold.

1037
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:24,279
You wanna come and see what
a real doctor does for a living?

1038
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:28,578
Oh, yes, a doctor in an underfunded,
over-utilized, insane asylum...

1039
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:31,084
that passes for an
urban medical center.

1040
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:33,120
- I'm in.
- Oh, no, it's very late.

1041
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,891
- Don't start.
- How are you gonna get to the hotel?

1042
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,585
- I'll call a cab.
- Come on, she's not a baby anymore.

1043
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,630
- We'll make sure she gets back safe.
- You gonna come, Kerry?

1044
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:45,633
- No, I've got an early flight.
- Peter?

1045
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,701
No, 7 a.m. rounds.

1046
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,535
That's a cab.

1047
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,198
- Come here, bye.
- Bye.

1048
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:05,618
- So good seeing you.
- All right.

1049
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:08,280
Bye, guys! RACHEL: Bye!

1050
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:18,796
Well? Ready?

1051
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:22,399
Hey, our flight leaves at 9.

1052
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,940
Car's coming to pick
us up at the hotel at 7.

1053
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,743
Kids.

1054
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:31,175
She's not a kid anymore.

1055
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,880
Her mother would
absolutely kill me...

1056
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,215
if she knew I'd let Carter haul her
off to the ER in the middle of the night.

1057
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,256
Hey, want me to get you a cab?

1058
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,585
Oh, no. I've got a rental car.

1059
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,525
All right, well, you
want me to walk you?

1060
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:47,823
Um...

1061
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,896
Sure, thanks, yeah.

1062
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:57,330
So is Cleo good?

1063
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,703
Yeah, really good.

1064
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,069
- Do you have any more children?
- No, no, no.

1065
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,112
- What about you?
- What about me?

1066
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:08,376
- Do you have any more kids?
- Oh, no, no.

1067
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:12,044
- Are you in a relationship?
- No.

1068
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:16,488
- Dating?
- No, not really.

1069
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,928
Well, I've got a 9-year-old
at home and a busy career.

1070
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,932
Maybe when Ella's a
little older, I might, but...

1071
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,700
So...

1072
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,272
this is me.

1073
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:37,476
As usual, there was a problem
with the rental reservation.

1074
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:38,945
This is all they had.

1075
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,914
Well, it's... It's big.

1076
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:50,118
Well, you know, if you need to
transport an infantry for any reason...

1077
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,586
Yeah, or a rap star's entourage.

1078
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:58,395
Anyway.

1079
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,462
It was really nice
seeing you again, Peter.

1080
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,130
Yeah.

1081
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:10,680
Take care.

1082
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,711
- Jerry, you remember Rachel.
- Yeah, I heard you were around.

1083
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:49,648
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, you remember me?

1084
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,014
- No way.
- Jerry!

1085
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,382
Oh, my God.

1086
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:56,184
There's a spirit of camaraderie
here. It's what makes this place work.

1087
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,726
Everybody helps
everybody else out.

1088
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:00,625
Oh, God, maggots.

1089
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:02,629
Tracy, this is Rachel.

1090
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,325
She's thinking about a
career in emergency medicine.

1091
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,800
Run, don't walk, to Radiology.

1092
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:11,702
Trust me. You don't ever,
ever want to have to do this.

1093
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,309
I am the chosen one,
come to be known as Uhdia.

1094
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:15,911
Ten of Haldol and restraints.

1095
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,843
And he who believeth in
me shall have eternal life.

1096
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,574
- Hey, Morris.
- Hey, Carter.

1097
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,912
- How did the opening go?
- Good, you missed it.

1098
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,417
You know, work. Can't
wait to see it finished.

1099
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,989
- Give me a call, I'll give you a tour.
- Rachel, Rachel Greene?

1100
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,888
- Hi, Chuny.
- Oh, my God, look at you.

1101
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,054
You'll be around for a while? Don't
you dare leave before we get to catch up.

1102
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,757
And I will deliver...

1103
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:41,263
Haldol, miracle drug.

1104
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:46,534
Laverne, what have you got?

1105
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:50,044
Mr. Meyer here polished off a few
too many bottles of fine burgundy.

1106
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:53,547
Fell off the curb in front of
Spiaggia, broke his ankle, hit his head.

1107
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,276
- Waiting on CT and Ortho.
- Mind if I take over that IV?

1108
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,080
Sure, no problem.

1109
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,683
- You ever done one of these before?
- No.

1110
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:07,963
Okay, well, we use an angio-cath with
a 16 gauge needle. That's a large bore.

1111
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:11,464
You need that in case there's
bleeding and you have to transfuse them.

1112
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,863
What you wanna do
is pull that skin tight...

1113
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,972
so that the vein doesn't
roll, go in low, bevel up.

1114
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:20,632
Once you're in the vein, you pull
this little gizmo out and tape it down.

1115
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,905
Gates, is it my imagination,
or is Dr. Carter...

1116
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,209
who is not on duty by the way,
in Trauma 1 with a patient...

1117
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,909
demonstrating IV placement
to a college student?

1118
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:32,078
- What?
- Never mind.

1119
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:38,491
Jerry, why is Dr. Carter performing
medical procedures on our patients?

1120
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,186
Because he's a doctor?

1121
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:44,132
Tony?

1122
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,733
Excuse me. One sec.

1123
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:49,998
Perfect timing. That
poor bastard, his son...

1124
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:52,471
Marjorie Manning died.

1125
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,019
So...

1126
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,163
that's it?

1127
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:36,680
Can I stay with
her a little longer?

1128
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:39,384
Of course, stay as
long as you'd like.

1129
01:12:56,339 --> 01:13:00,003
Oh, yeah. Pizza.

1130
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:08,477
What is that?

1131
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:11,052
A meat-lovers special,
you want a piece?

1132
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,748
You better call a cardiologist
and schedule your first angioplasty.

1133
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:16,825
- It's good.
- How old are you?

1134
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:18,886
Thirty-seven.

1135
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,189
Make an appointment
for three years from now.

1136
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,765
You keep eating like that,
40 ought to be just about right.

1137
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:27,597
No. Come on. - It's true.

1138
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,940
- They don't get it.
- They don't get it.

1139
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,033
Who are you?

1140
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:38,306
Oh, hi, I'm Dr. Susan
Lewis, I used to work here. Hi.

1141
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,782
What is it with men
and their penises?

1142
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,385
I've been trying to figure
that one out for years.

1143
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:44,747
Amen to that.

1144
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,355
My trouble-urinating guy.

1145
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:50,050
It turns out that he has erectile
dysfunction and he can't afford Viagra.

1146
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:53,560
He takes a tube of bathroom caulk,
the kind you use around the tub...

1147
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,459
and squeezes it
into his urethra.

1148
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:58,567
It's not a religious talisman.
Get that in a biohazard bag.

1149
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:02,034
Police brought in an altered old
woman, wearing one of our bracelets.

1150
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,536
It had your name on it.

1151
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,237
Beverly?

1152
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:08,935
- Hello.
- Hello, how's her temperature?

1153
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,704
Core is 96.

1154
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,247
- My name is Beverly.
- Yes, I know.

1155
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,907
She was in here yesterday.

1156
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,644
Her daughter's name and
number should be on the chart.

1157
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,151
- Martha or Mary...
- Margaret.

1158
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:23,156
Margaret, that's right. You know, she's
gonna be worried about where you are.

1159
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,956
Oh, Margaret is a lovely
girl. Just quiet and thoughtful.

1160
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,164
How's your wrist, any pain?

1161
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:32,961
- Oh, I broke my wrist.
- I know, I fixed it yesterday.

1162
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:37,129
I fell out of a tree, Margaret was
telling me to go higher and I fell.

1163
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,502
Really? Margaret was
telling you to go higher?

1164
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,110
Mm-hm. She's...
Margaret's my sister.

1165
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,870
Yeah, just a lovely girl.

1166
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,941
You know, you really shouldn't
leave your yard. It's not safe.

1167
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,783
Oh, you have such strong hands.

1168
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:53,349
Warm and strong.

1169
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:57,152
You can tell a lot about
a man by his hands.

1170
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,121
Yes, ma'am.

1171
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,772
Where's the daughter?

1172
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,510
She went to call
the mortuary, I think.

1173
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,808
Thanks.

1174
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,945
For what?

1175
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:26,952
For everything you do with Alex.

1176
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,955
I really appreciate it.

1177
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:03,083
A little cold out here to
be playing basketball, huh?

1178
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,261
- I'm just trying to stay awake.
- Oh, yeah?

1179
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:07,863
Yep. I've got...

1180
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,330
an important call to
make in a couple hours.

1181
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:14,333
I'm afraid if I close my
eyes, I'll sleep through it.

1182
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,438
Don't you own an alarm clock?

1183
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:21,373
Can't chance it.

1184
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:23,103
Yeah?

1185
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,881
- Love or money?
- What?

1186
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,779
Well, if it's that important, it
only can be one of two things:

1187
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:31,011
love or money.

1188
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:34,424
- Love.
- Oh!

1189
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,724
Hey, put a towel around that
guy. There's women in there.

1190
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:41,091
Thought streakers went out with
disco and the Ford administration.

1191
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,663
I'm going across the street.

1192
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:44,858
- Want a burrito? Bean and beef.
- I'm fine.

1193
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,535
I'll pass.

1194
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,364
Man's a culinary
freak of nature.

1195
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,541
Nice.

1196
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:54,938
Where's your little ward?

1197
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:56,737
Who, Rachel?

1198
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,780
The women stole her
from me an hour ago.

1199
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:05,448
- Are you coming back, boss?
- What?

1200
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,384
You're hanging
around here enough.

1201
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,991
Take some shifts,
get paid for it.

1202
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,821
I don't know.

1203
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,963
Maybe.

1204
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,927
Hey, Tony, I need you.

1205
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:34,043
Transport guys from
Mercy finally showed up...

1206
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,878
for your alcohol-poisoning girl.

1207
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:39,044
They tried to move her, she
started groaning, thrashing around.

1208
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,280
Is she responsive?

1209
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:44,086
I didn't stick around long enough
to find out, went looking for you.

1210
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,424
- Stacey?
- What? What's happening?

1211
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:52,625
Stacey? All right,
responds to stimuli.

1212
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,066
- What does that mean?
- Stacey, can you hear me?

1213
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:57,866
MRS. Honey. GATES:
Stacey, you're in the hospital.

1214
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,568
I'm Dr. Gates. You were at a party,
you had a little too much to drink.

1215
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:04,246
Please, is she all right?
- Stacey?

1216
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:07,778
Stacey.

1217
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,043
Stacey.

1218
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:11,244
I need another CT.
It's gonna take a while.

1219
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,752
- How long?
- Hour, maybe two.

1220
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,720
I'll call Dispatch.

1221
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,381
Doctor.

1222
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,885
She's responding, but
not in a purposeful way.

1223
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,463
It may be a sign of lack
of oxygen to the brain.

1224
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:26,067
I'm gonna order another CT, make
sure there's no swelling in the brain.

1225
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:27,795
But she's going to be okay?

1226
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:30,998
Well, it's too early to tell if
her mental status will improve...

1227
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,937
from what you see now.

1228
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,701
But it could? - Maybe.

1229
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,437
- CT can take her now.
- Okay, good.

1230
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:40,742
- Can we go with her?
- Of course, yeah.

1231
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:04,001
My first ER rotation, they
sent me to a jail ward...

1232
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:06,642
to do a rectal on this
prisoner with a GI bleed.

1233
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:09,472
So this guy is very sketchy,
and he's kind of a leech...

1234
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:11,443
but I don't wanna
seem like a wimp.

1235
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:14,209
So I close the door to
give him some privacy...

1236
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,818
I pull on my glove, lube up my
finger and go ahead with the exam.

1237
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:22,482
When I'm done, I go to the
door to leave, and it's locked.

1238
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:24,217
It's a jail ward.

1239
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,327
The doors don't
open from the inside.

1240
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:30,660
So here I am, stuck with creepy
convict guy who is now laughing...

1241
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:34,793
pulling up his pants, asking me if it
was as good for me as it was for him.

1242
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,029
Oh, my God.

1243
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:40,199
It took me 10 minutes of banging on that
door to finally get a nurse's attention.

1244
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,571
Guy in Exam 2 is coughing red
snappers. Be sure and wear a mask.

1245
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,078
- What's a red snapper?
- TB.

1246
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:47,146
- Tuberculosis?
- Yup.

1247
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:50,912
My first week in the ER, I forgot
Haleh's name and called her "nurse."

1248
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:54,079
- As in, "Nurse, can you get me 4-by-4s?"
- Oh, bad idea.

1249
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:56,417
- Nurses hate being called "nurse."
- Why?

1250
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:59,426
- Because we have names.
- Or we know more than med students.

1251
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:01,461
- The interns.
- More than most doctors.

1252
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:04,361
So anyway, Haleh
decides to punish me...

1253
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,230
by paging me for Tylenol
orders every 20 minutes.

1254
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,098
I would have paged you every 10.
- Every five.

1255
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:14,039
My first year in med school, the
dean comes into our very first lecture...

1256
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,611
and he says, "I want you to
look to your left and to your right.

1257
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,681
A year from now,
one of you'll be gone."

1258
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:22,283
Our dean told us that when
I was in med school too.

1259
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,943
- Was it true?
- No, but it scared the hell out of us.

1260
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,716
I mean, as if we weren't
worried enough already.

1261
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:30,291
Hey, what are you doing here?

1262
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:33,587
Couldn't sleep. I thought I'd
come in, catch up on some charts.

1263
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:37,529
Maybe check up on a baby in
the NICU I helped deliver yesterday.

1264
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,134
- Where's Banfield?
- In Sutures.

1265
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,567
- Stitching up drunk-and-disorderly guy.
- Get her down here now.

1266
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:44,900
- What is it?
- Explosion at a power substation.

1267
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:47,066
Burn and blast victims.
Three minutes out.

1268
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,471
- How many?
- At least eight.

1269
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,124
Chuny, clear the trauma rooms.

1270
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,145
Jerry, get the blood
bank to send O-neg.

1271
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:55,148
Dawn, make sure we have
enough morphine and rapid infusers.

1272
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:59,812
Yipee-kie-yay. You wanna be
an ER doc? This is the fun part.

1273
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,586
Industrial explosion.

1274
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:14,827
Dr. C.

1275
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,764
Morris, Triage.

1276
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,969
EMT 1:55-year-old man
thrown against the wall.

1277
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:53,871
- Diffuse abdominal pain, BP 80 palp.
- Rigid abdomen, probably spleen or liver.

1278
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:57,011
Tracy. Two of O-neg. Hold for the OR.
- Yep?

1279
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:02,508
Open femur, good distal pulses.

1280
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,204
- I'll take this. Chuny.
- Yeah?

1281
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,585
Gram of Ancef, 100 of gent,
titrate Dilaudid and call Ortho.

1282
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,884
Julia, you're up. Laverne.

1283
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:11,458
- I got Bardelli's rig.
- Good.

1284
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:13,186
In V-fib on a high power line.

1285
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:15,831
Epi, lidocaine and 10
shocks. Put him into asystole.

1286
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,499
- Trauma 2?
- No, Curtain 3.

1287
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,567
We have to hold Trauma
for the ones we can save.

1288
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:24,366
A 27-year-old male, short of breath,
pulse ox, 82, decreased breath sounds.

1289
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,060
- No facial burns?
- Pneumothorax.

1290
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:29,007
Set up for a chest tube.
- Arm was blown off.

1291
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:31,306
- Intubated after 10 of MS.
- All right. Sam.

1292
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,415
- Anything to re-implant?
- Bits and pieces.

1293
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,641
- Go.
- Dr. Carter?

1294
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:37,884
- What? I'm sorry.
- You okay?

1295
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,855
Yeah, just a little déjà vu.

1296
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:43,592
Carter, are you working?

1297
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:45,159
- Absolutely.
- Come on.

1298
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:49,763
Burns over 90 percent of his
body, soot at the vocal cords.

1299
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:53,494
Three liters of Ringers, let's
call the burn service. Okay, cool.

1300
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:58,432
Dr. Greene.

1301
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,241
Are you coming?

1302
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:08,848
Tight wheezing throughout
the ride. Pulse ox, 88.

1303
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:11,452
Check for singed nasal
hairs from smoke inhalation.

1304
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,679
Set up for intubation.

1305
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,656
Thirty-eight-year-old male...
