1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,904
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,101
You do you and I'll do me and
we'll just go our separate ways.

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,610
- What about in vitro?
- Approaching zero.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,111
But not actually zero.

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,581
You have an infection in your
gallbladder and you need IV antibiotics.

6
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,617
- You got another text.
- From Ray?

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,015
From Australia.

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,453
And, girl, he's cute too.

9
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,788
You'll wake up next to me and you're
gonna wonder how this happened.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,920
And I'm gonna smile and
remind you that I predicted it.

11
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:38,200
<i>The toughest thing about being
a doctor isn't the terrible hours.</i>

12
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,173
<i>It isn't the loneliness, the isolation,
or the knowledge that one day...</i>

13
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,870
<i>we all lose out to the relentless
decay of the human body.</i>

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,572
<i>No, it's something else.</i>

15
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,232
Ray. It's 5 a.m.

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,740
Yes, I know, but sometimes we
do actually get to sleep on call.

17
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:22,643
Good. You should be. You know I
have those stupid interviews later today.

18
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:27,646
No. I didn't forget.
Happy birthday.

19
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,818
Of course I was gonna call. It's
5 a.m., man, give me a chance.

20
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,795
It's my intern, I better
answer. I'll call you later, okay?

21
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,455
Bye.

22
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,168
Hey, Ana. You
having a party in here?

23
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,602
Something like that.

24
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,107
Tachy all night and
then the BP took a dive.

25
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,644
Crackles bilaterally.

26
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,782
I left mine in the ER.

27
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,110
Sensitivities come back
on the blood culture?

28
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,684
Vanco-resistant enterococcus.

29
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,854
That's what you were
worried about, right?

30
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,889
Yeah. Let the PICU
know we're coming.

31
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,960
Pick a color and a number
between one and 10.

32
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,155
Blue and three.

33
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,132
- B-L-U-E. One, two, three.
- Hey, at this point...

34
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,329
removing the source of
infection is our best option.

35
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,667
You mean taking out my gall bladder.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,776
Let's finally get
you better okay?

37
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,174
Hurry up, I'm getting
sick of you people.

38
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,673
I'm gonna go call your mom.

39
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,686
Hang in there, I'll check
on you in a little while.

40
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,322
Don't you want to
hear your fortune?

41
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,720
I'll be back soon, I promise.

42
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,851
Lucien, are you sure about this?

43
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,964
No, but the conservative approach
doesn't seem to be working out.

44
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,327
She's bacteremic
and if we go in now...

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,402
<i>The toughest thing is making
the right call when it counts.</i>

46
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,504
- Forget it. No, it's fine.
- What?

47
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,642
You're gonna be an attending
soon, better assert yourself.

48
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,174
No, you're probably right...

49
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,245
You know, these decisions
are the hardest part of our job.

50
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,883
Consider the alternatives, follow
through in your mind, make a choice.

51
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,519
Can't control what
happens after that.

52
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,850
O.R. in 10 minutes.
I'll meet you there.

53
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,594
Yeah, that's totally gonna
make the elevator come faster.

54
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,505
Sorry, I...

55
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,109
Found it.

56
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,056
Dr. Rasgotra, perfect timing.

57
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,021
Page the intern,
I'm not really here.

58
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,855
Nick Vasquez, 28, fell
through a second story window.

59
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,463
- A closed window, unfortunately.
- How did you fall?

60
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,189
I was, uh, bailing
out of a plane.

61
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,154
In my dream. Uh, I'm a dream runner.
- Dream runner?

62
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,063
Most people are
paralyzed during REM...

63
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,902
they don't do what
they dream about.

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,977
My brain chemistry's off, so that
paralysis thing doesn't work right.

65
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,374
So you act things out?

66
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,039
Big-wave surfing, car
chases, dragon slaying.

67
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:13,278
- I've done it all.
- On my count. One, two, three.

68
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,946
All right, vitals stable en route,
complaining about abdominal pain.

69
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,288
- Well, that's understandable.
- Tib-fib displaced.

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,486
I'm gonna get a Stryker probe.
- What? Why?

71
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,325
Missed a compartment syndrome,
doesn't wanna get burned.

72
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,330
It's a good pedal
pulse, no swelling.

73
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,561
- I doubt it's compartment syndrome.
- I'll be right back.

74
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,938
Hey.

75
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,103
Hey.

76
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,605
- Here.
- What's this?

77
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,116
Those Blackhawk tickets
that we got. It's, uh, this week.

78
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,844
You take them, Sam. Take Alex.

79
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,148
No, no, no. It was your idea. You
might wanna take someone else?

80
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,684
Gates, you have six
patients on the board...

81
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,419
including a fresh
trauma so cut the chatter.

82
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,656
Dr. Morris, four of your
patients bounced back tonight.

83
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,198
It would be okay if you did.

84
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,598
- If I did what?
- Take someone else.

85
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,864
Sam, will you stop it? There's
no one else I wanna take.

86
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,765
Here.

87
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,843
Gates, get plain films, then
remove shards and then irrigate.

88
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,446
We could use you too,
poor guy's IV keeps blowing.

89
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,105
- Check crit q 30 and...
- What was that?

90
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,808
- What was what?
- Banfield, man.

91
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,819
One minute she's kind of loose and cool
then snap, she's back to piranha queen.

92
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,854
She was annoyed
at me for being short.

93
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,324
She made Frank take off
his tie and throw it in the trash.

94
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,362
Dr. Morris, come
with me. It's important.

95
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,600
- Uh, good luck with the interview thing.
- Oh, right.

96
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,666
- Okay, you ready?
- Uh-huh.

97
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,170
Ta-da.

98
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,209
I got under the mud flaps
and matched the original color.

99
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,312
You are kidding.

100
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,849
I rebuilt the engine, threw away the
amels and installed Mikuni carburetors.

101
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,724
My... My dad showed up on
this for his first date with my mom.

102
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,884
Yeah, she was mortified,
made them walk to the movies.

103
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,394
A month later she
was riding on the back...

104
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,862
wearing nothing
but a macramÃ© bikini.

105
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,558
Yeah, these have
that effect on people.

106
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,365
Okay. Go ahead.
Try out your new bike.

107
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,532
No, my new...? No, no Jerry. I
said... I said you could have it.

108
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,577
No way. This belongs with you.

109
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,640
Fire it up.

110
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:28,550
Keep the shiny side up.

111
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,766
Take breaths, when you
wake up we'll be done.

112
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,376
Dr. Rasgotra? You're gonna
be here the whole time, right?

113
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,602
The whole time. Did
you remember the music?

114
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,406
Sure did.

115
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,954
That's nice.

116
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,230
"Suite for Solo
Cello Number 1 in G."

117
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,696
Dr. Rasgotra, you rock.

118
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,334
Okay, let's get started.

119
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,465
Neela needs to get out of
here to work on her future.

120
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,577
It's okay. I canceled
my appointments.

121
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,576
- What? Why?
- First liter's up.

122
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,237
I'm post-call and exhausted.

123
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,907
I called in some favors to
get you those interviews.

124
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,179
- You feel bad about me not having a job.
- Who told you that?

125
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:38,519
You've been acting like you'd never
let me leave, but I get it, things change.

126
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,354
Where's this coming from?
You... You and I have never had...

127
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,929
a serious conversation
about of you staying.

128
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:48,000
- Exactly. Eleven blade.
- Trocar.

129
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,536
Ooh. It's hot in
here. Is it hot in here?

130
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,632
No, check this out.

131
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,144
- It's fine.
- Except for the pelvic fracture, right?

132
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,681
Uh, grade two, non-displaced.

133
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,377
Somebody's here to see you.

134
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,052
Hey, honey.

135
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,553
Find someone to take Oliver?

136
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,025
Yeah, your mom came
over. Thank God you're okay.

137
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,859
- Give us some room.
- You know, we've tried everything.

138
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,399
Sleeping bags, mitts,
hand-cuffing him to the bed.

139
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,230
Hey, now.

140
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:27,238
But every few months he has a crazy
dream and ends up back in the hospital.

141
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,070
- Oliver's your son?
- Yeah. Just turned 1.

142
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,676
Crit dropped another two points.

143
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,370
Oh, dilutional, most likely.

144
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,674
We'll check another
hemacue in a half-hour.

145
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,216
What, and meanwhile we
just let it keep dropping?

146
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,253
- I thought you said it was dilutional.
- Recheck it now, Sam.

147
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,890
I already signed out to
Suri, I'll have her know.

148
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,889
- What? You're leaving?
- My shift's over.

149
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,426
- They're waiting for me.
- Shifts and breaks...

150
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,292
such a nursey concept,
I've always hated them.

151
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,195
Bye, Mr. Vasquez.

152
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,532
Damn, I think I nicked
the common bile duct.

153
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,404
You think you did
or you did? You did.

154
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,511
So much inflamed
tissue, I couldn't see.

155
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,842
You had no business cutting.
Ten blade, we're converting to open.

156
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,110
Systolic's 86. Everyone knows
Samantha Taggart from the ER?

157
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,412
Starting clinicals for my
nurse anesthetist program.

158
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,078
Sponge.

159
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,457
Record vitals q five
minutes. I'm going next door.

160
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,724
- You're leaving?
- Precepting a trainee. I'll be in and out.

161
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,299
Bovie. SAM: Something matter?

162
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,211
- Not the best teach.
- Countertraction.

163
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,995
Thanks. NEELA:
Don't take it personally.

164
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,097
It's a teaching hospital.
- I'm aware.

165
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,367
Operating on her was
dicey to begin with.

166
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,068
That's your call. NEELA:
We should have our A team.

167
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,078
A team? Why don't you focus
on your job and let me do mine.

168
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,216
- Oh, my God.
- Aah!

169
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,226
I dialed the halothane down
when her pressure got dicey.

170
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,991
- I forgot to tell you to turn it back up.
- You forgot?

171
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,033
- I'm so sorry.
- Tell it to the girl.

172
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,467
Okay, let's clean this
mess up and move on.

173
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,699
Run a six, giving lido.
Forty milligram bolus.

174
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,003
Right. Then
point-five per minute.

175
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,976
It's the ER. They need
a surgeon down there.

176
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,650
Surgery's got an unstable kid
on the table, gonna be a while.

177
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,684
Great. Cordis in.

178
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:21,947
That wasn't so bad.

179
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,784
He's got a high
tolerance for pain.

180
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,449
- Hang a unit of type specific.
- How's it going?

181
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,322
He's tachy and
crit's down to 29.

182
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,987
All right, let's pack him
up, and get him to angio.

183
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,996
Angio? You mean CT, right?

184
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,192
No, I mean angio. He
has a pelvic fracture.

185
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,496
Fracture's non-displaced,
unlikely to bleed.

186
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,002
The ultrasound was negative.

187
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,538
Could be retroperitoneal.

188
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,142
If the angiogram is
normal we'll explore that.

189
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,574
Right now the pelvis
is where the money is.

190
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,872
In all these dreams...

191
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,209
you're always there.

192
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,719
You are always the girl.

193
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,620
- Nick?
- Mac three and an eight-oh.

194
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,302
- What's happening?
- Five thousand units heparin.

195
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,194
Protein C first? Not standard,
there have been good outcomes...

196
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,025
- for DIC or sepsis.
- Go ahead.

197
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,760
Thing is you have to give it before
you give the heparin or it won't work.

198
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:13,236
- Something that came up in a class.
- Okay, protein C, and then the heparin.

199
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,102
V-tach.

200
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,041
- I can't believe this.
- Point four of epi.

201
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,406
Going in.

202
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,174
Clear!

203
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,543
- No change.
- Again. Clear.

204
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,755
- No change.
- Again. Clear.

205
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,621
Hey? What happened?

206
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,851
What'd the angio show?

207
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,021
Lost his pulse before
we could do the study.

208
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,860
Charged to 360.

209
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,626
Clear.

210
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,034
- No change.
- Give the amiodarone.

211
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:48,039
Sorry to belabor, but you don't drop
crit 10 points from non-displaced pelvis.

212
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,236
If you'd scanned him you might
have seen what I'm seeing in time.

213
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,745
Go find an O.R. The
belly's full of blood.

214
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,145
- You know where it's coming from?
- Go!

215
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,242
Fourth epi's in.

216
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,887
Someone needs to
update the mother.

217
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,387
I should have fought you.
- You should have.

218
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,548
Dream runner's
bleeding out in angio.

219
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,557
- Okay, go.
- I promised I'd stay.

220
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,218
Hold compressions.

221
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,091
- V-fib.
- Switch out.

222
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,458
Go, Neela.

223
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,562
Go.

224
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,672
Go.

225
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,321
Ray. I'll call later.

226
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,217
Hold compressions.

227
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,326
Still asystole.

228
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,706
This is over.

229
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,102
13:43.

230
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,651
Please know that we
did everything we could.

231
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,460
Excuse me.

232
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,204
This can't really be happening.

233
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,037
I'm so sorry.

234
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,677
This feels like a dream.

235
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,986
<i>We can't see the future.</i>

236
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,490
Sometimes we can, actually. With
this handy new technology called the CT.

237
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,093
You heard of it?

238
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,555
Fine. Do I wish I could
do it over? Yeah, I do.

239
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,724
- There was no way to know...
- Gates was begging to get the scan.

240
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,063
Gates is a resident.

241
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,569
Don't make this about
hierarchy. If any of us...

242
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,732
refuse to hear another
opinion, the system breaks down.

243
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,708
What system? You
guys don't have a system.

244
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,280
- All I see here is chaos and disorder.
- Maybe that's the problem.

245
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:13,214
Maybe that's why after five months
you still don't get it, still don't fit in.

246
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,687
- Fit in? This isn't junior high.
- We are a team. We work together.

247
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,520
But you think that you're
so much better than all of us.

248
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,629
So much smarter. You'll
never let yourself be part of it.

249
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,265
If you wanna be a queen
go into private practice...

250
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,731
back to Indonesia,
leave medicine altogether.

251
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,530
But don't torture us here.

252
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,263
Dr. Banfield.

253
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:39,402
Jerry, turn this in to human resources.
- What are you doing?

254
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,514
Going home.

255
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,174
This isn't your fault.

256
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,581
- If I'd come down sooner I...
- It's not about you.

257
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,086
What's really going on? Are
you sick? I mean, this morning...

258
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,555
- the injection.
- Please. Leave me alone.

259
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,659
Hello?

260
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,267
Yes. I'll sign the
death certificate.

261
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:14,144
Well, now, what did the
phone do to deserve that?

262
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,409
Hi, Simon, great to see you.
How was Australia? Good. Heh.

263
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,822
You okay?

264
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,959
It's just been an
unbelievably horrible day.

265
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,095
You know what you need?

266
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,294
A didgeridoo.

267
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,198
Banfield just quit and I
just helped kill two patients.

268
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,805
Oh. Uh, Neela, I'm sorry.

269
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,569
Neela.

270
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,441
<i>The care of every
patient is a twisty maze...</i>

271
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,948
<i>that leads to an infinite
number of potential outcomes.</i>

272
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,451
<i>We hope that knowledge
and experience guide us...</i>

273
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,818
<i>but sometimes it becomes
obvious a wrong turn was made.</i>

274
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,003
Ray. It's 5 a.m.

275
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,344
I know, but sometimes we
do actually get to sleep on call.

276
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,252
Pick a color and a number
between one and 10.

277
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,014
Blue and three.

278
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,319
- B-L-U-E. One, two, three.
- Hey, at this point...

279
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,520
removing the source of
infection is our best option.

280
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,224
- You mean taking out my gall bladder.
- Let's finally get you better.

281
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,698
Hurry up, I'm getting
sick of you people.

282
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,997
I'm gonna go call your mom.

283
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,001
Hang in there Ana, I'll
check on you in a little while.

284
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,837
Don't you wanna
hear your fortune?

285
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,444
I'll be back soon, I promise.

286
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,605
<i>If only it were possible to apply
the wisdom of our mistakes...</i>

287
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,785
<i>go back to the fork in the
road and this time be assertive.</i>

288
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,513
<i>Choose the road we think we should
take. Not the path of least resistance.</i>

289
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,213
Forget it.

290
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,890
No, wait. Don't forget it.
She could die on the table.

291
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,963
She could die if we do nothing. These
decisions are the hardest part of our job.

292
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:16,227
Wait one more day. We'll move her to
PICU, I'll get ID to approve the synercid.

293
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,372
There's no improvement, we'll
take her to the O.R. tomorrow.

294
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,030
- Okay.
- Okay?

295
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,405
Yeah, you're almost an attending,
I need to start listening to you.

296
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,103
Meet me in the
unit for rounds in 10.

297
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:37,151
Yeah, that's totally gonna
make the elevator come faster.

298
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,791
What are you, like,
in seventh grade?

299
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:40,983
I look young, I know.

300
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,904
Of course I realize that
pressing a button 10 times...

301
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,671
is not gonna make it faster...

302
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,612
but sometimes when you're powerless
in a situation, you gotta do something.

303
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:09,017
That's why you're a surgeon,
right? You like to cut, fix, do.

304
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,621
I suppose.

305
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:16,695
Ah, but to choose inaction is
in and of itself action, isn't it?

306
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,622
- Who are you?
- Ned Roth.

307
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,597
Patient transport specialist.

308
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,998
Buddhist. Omnivore.

309
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,661
- Neela Ras...
- Rasgotra.

310
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,101
Yes, I know.

311
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,601
Have a nice day, doctor.

312
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,030
What are you doing?

313
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,861
And don't say it's none of
my business, because it is.

314
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,332
It is?

315
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,994
- How's that?
- If you're doing drugs, we need to know.

316
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,664
And if you wanted to keep it a secret
you wouldn't be in the break room.

317
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,176
It's 5:30 in the morning. I didn't
think anyone would be in here.

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,179
It's recombinant FSH hormone.

319
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,318
We're trying to have a baby.

320
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,353
Oh, wow.

321
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,347
We're giving in vitro a try.

322
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,724
Well, that's exciting.

323
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,522
Well, we better all hope
it works the first time.

324
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:27,360
I tell you, these drugs and
doctoring is a dangerous mix.

325
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,694
Why do you say that?

326
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:35,171
I'm erratic, indecisive and I've
been a real bitch to the staff.

327
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,732
Really?

328
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,741
Even more than I usually am.

329
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,574
Everyone and everything
just seems to get on my nerves.

330
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,875
I don't know,
maybe I should quit.

331
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,219
Oh, no. Don't be silly.

332
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,361
- Neela? This conversation?
- It never happened.

333
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,930
Dr. Rasgotra, perfect timing.

334
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,930
Page the intern,
I'm not really here.

335
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,730
A guy fell out of a second-story
window, they need a surgeon in Trauma 1.

336
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,135
All right. Page Dubenko
and let him know, okay?

337
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:11,073
I hear you're interviewing for attending
positions at trauma conference today.

338
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,267
- You did?
- Yeah.

339
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,142
Lucien's whining about
losing you to another institution.

340
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,373
He was?

341
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,781
Don't look shocked, you know he's
grooming you for a faculty position.

342
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,921
He's the one who set
up all the interviews.

343
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,088
- That's the game.
- What do you mean?

344
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,556
My brain chemistry's off, that
paralysis thing doesn't work right.

345
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,093
So you act things out?

346
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,595
Big-wave surfing, car
chases, dragon slaying.

347
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,098
- I've done it all.
- On my count. One, two, three.

348
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,502
Mr. Vasquez, please meet our
esteemed surgical colleague...

349
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,936
- Dr. Neela Rasgotra.
- Hello.

350
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,235
- Am I going to need surgery?
- I hope not.

351
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,777
Oh. These seem superficial,
but let's get an x-ray to be sure.

352
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,938
- Ultrasound?
- Just called for the machine.

353
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,516
Tib-fib displaced, I'm
gonna get a Stryker probe.

354
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,984
Good pedal pulse, no swelling. He
doesn't have compartment syndrome.

355
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,955
Gates missed a compartment
syndrome last week, he's got PTSD.

356
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,753
- That's ridiculous.
- Five minutes.

357
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,522
Can't let a bad case derail your
focus on the patient in front of you.

358
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,326
Someone ate their
Wheaties this morning.

359
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,602
- You guys looking for this?
- Yeah.

360
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,261
Can we lower the table, please?

361
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,033
- Hey. I haven't seen you all week.
- I know.

362
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,505
- It's weird.
- Yeah, really.

363
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,110
Sam, we need a
second line over here.

364
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,878
I have something that I
wanna give you later, okay?

365
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,118
I'm not getting a good look at the
spleen, but the belly looks clear.

366
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,222
No sign of internal injuries.

367
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,291
- I'll stay here, you run the board.
- I'm already in on this.

368
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,624
I am in no mood to move the meat. I
have the authority to do what I want.

369
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:42,226
Drunks, drug seekers, hysterical
parents. They're all yours. Shoo.

370
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,236
- Okay.
- I gotta run rounds in the PICU.

371
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,183
Hi. How's the new digs?

372
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,015
Okay, except for no TV.

373
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,920
Well, at least you have
your own room up here, right?

374
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,829
Her, uh, oxygen
level's still a bit low.

375
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,067
So, what now?

376
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,007
We wait. And hope her own
immune system conquers the infection.

377
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,344
She can do it. She's tough.

378
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:35,343
I need you to get better so you can help
me download Scrabble on my cell. Okay.

379
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,558
Hey. How's she doing?

380
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,856
Twenty of dopamine, sats hanging
around 90, lactate's on the edge.

381
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,192
Well, next 24 hours
will give us our answer.

382
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,926
- You off to interviews?
- I was thinking of canceling.

383
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,126
Are you crazy?

384
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,033
I should see this through.

385
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,300
No, go. I'll take care of it. I'll
call you if anything changes.

386
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,206
Trauma programs will
be fighting over you.

387
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,804
All right, then.

388
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,614
- You know, um, I don't get it.
- Get what?

389
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,484
You seem to be
dying to get rid of me...

390
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,387
you keep mumbling about
the hiring freeze at County...

391
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,120
pushing me to do
interviews all over.

392
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:20,755
- But then I keep hearing other things.
- What other things?

393
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,328
If you want me to stay,
how come you never asked?

394
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:29,999
We can't have this discussion until
you've seen what else is out there.

395
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:34,311
I'm serious. Just
go. Get out of here.

396
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,590
Wow. Look at you.

397
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,352
How's our dream
walker guy doing?

398
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:52,464
Runner. Dream runner.
He's stable, waiting for ortho.

399
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,031
Good.

400
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,533
I should be on the El right now,
rushing to this interview thing...

401
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:02,140
but instead I'm here
obsessing over cheese or ranch.

402
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,140
You know what else
I'm thinking about?

403
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,176
- Twinkies?
- Sam.

404
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,805
I think I always sort
of underestimated her.

405
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,472
I feel bad about that.

406
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,811
You know, you two should
never have broken up.

407
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,353
It's sort of complicated and I
think it's best if I lay low right now.

408
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:20,391
Well, inaction is in
and of itself action.

409
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,160
- What?
- Don't listen to me.

410
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,389
I'm post-call and
you know how I get.

411
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,997
Daria.

412
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,347
Hey, stranger.

413
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,146
- Hey, when did you get back?
- Last night.

414
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,346
Sorry, I, uh, haven't
eaten in, like, 24 hours.

415
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,388
Do you wanna go
and get a proper lunch?

416
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,154
Uh, no, I can't. I've got a
bunch of attending interviews.

417
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,853
- Cool.
- Is it?

418
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,726
I'm not so sure.

419
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,094
I'm supposed to know
things, have goals, and...

420
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,671
How can I have gotten this far in my life,
have no idea what I want from my life?

421
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,435
Sorry. I'm rambling.

422
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,874
And self-absorbed.
How was your trip?

423
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:17,005
Don't have to know where you're
going, you just gotta keep moving forward.

424
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,413
That is the key to
happiness, really.

425
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:22,214
Well, you've got it all
figured out, don't you?

426
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,084
See you later, Simon.

427
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,916
- Hello, I'm...
- Neela Rasgotra.

428
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,218
I'm so glad you're here.

429
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,794
I thought you were
in London all this time.

430
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,957
It was great for a while...

431
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,126
but I'd been gone too long...

432
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,898
and England just didn't
feel like my home anymore.

433
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,939
Believe me, I know
what you mean.

434
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,974
And then I got
the call from Duke.

435
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,409
- How's Ella doing?
- Amazing.

436
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,515
Eight, if you can believe it.

437
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,078
Oh, wow.

438
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,777
- She's beautiful.
- Ha, ha.

439
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,617
Durham's a great
place to raise a kid.

440
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,589
I thought I was gonna
miss the city, but I don't.

441
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:40,860
So, uh, when I left County you
were still doing emergency medicine.

442
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,797
Yeah, well, I saw the light.

443
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:46,700
Are you looking mainly at academic
positions or community hospitals?

444
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,670
- Uh, I... I don't know. Uh, both, I guess.
- Mm-hm.

445
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,508
And are you hoping to
focus on trauma surgery...

446
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,045
or are you open to
elective cases as well?

447
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,046
I'm open.

448
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,377
And, uh, do you have
any research areas?

449
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,147
I haven't really figured
any of that out yet.

450
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,558
Not really the sort of thing
one says at a job interview.

451
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,060
No, but I appreciate
the honesty.

452
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,326
So is Lucien helping you?

453
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,868
Helping me with what?

454
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,361
Figure things out.

455
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,638
Uh, sort of. Not really.

456
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,835
I don't think County's
really in my future.

457
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,348
County's an amazing place.

458
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,486
What I learned there...

459
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,551
It was a very intense
period in my life.

460
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:46,563
But it made me the doctor that I
am now, the person that I am now.

461
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,201
Did you ever
consider coming back?

462
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,970
Yes, briefly.

463
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,999
There is something to
be said for getting away...

464
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,441
- from the place where you trained.
- Oh?

465
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,409
They've known you
since you were a student.

466
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,846
And at some level, the faculty
will always see you as little Neela.

467
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,179
You go somewhere new,
you'll be taken seriously...

468
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,184
in a way that will not
happen if you stay.

469
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,052
You know, you really should
turn that off during interviews.

470
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:19,062
- Oh. I've gotta get back to the hospital.
- You don't have someone covering?

471
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,255
I'm so sorry.

472
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,402
- Let's just finish up, we're almost done.
- Thank you so much.

473
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,903
Maybe you should come by
and visit County sometime.

474
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,569
Yeah. Maybe sometime I will.

475
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,545
Sam, there's a bunch of
stuff I need to say to you.

476
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,244
Me too.

477
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,049
- I miss how...
- These are yours.

478
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,058
Gates, Morris is intubating
your sleepwalker guy.

479
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,677
- What happened?
- Suction.

480
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,165
- Crit dropped, he got altered.
- I'm in, bag him.

481
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,236
Call angio, tell them
we're on the way.

482
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,769
- Angio?
- Angio?

483
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,305
Crit drop, pelvic
fracture, he needs angio.

484
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,409
- What's angio?
- Run of v-tach.

485
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,068
Three hundred amiodarone,
two units on rapid infuser.

486
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,613
- Somebody please explain?
- Bleeding internally.

487
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,582
- We have to find out where fast.
- Can I talk to you outside for a minute?

488
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,051
All right, pack him up.
Let's get ready to move.

489
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,855
Hey, Ray. I'll call
you back later, okay?

490
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,696
We can't wait any longer.

491
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,528
Please. I want Neela here.

492
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,192
- Sat's 87. DUBENKO:
I'm sorry, honey.

493
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,531
We have to do this now.

494
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,435
Ana, honey, you can do this.
You've been through worse.

495
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,509
Oh. Mommy, the music.

496
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,209
I love you, sweetie.

497
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,776
Push the etomidate.

498
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,787
He's bleeding from the belly,
not the pelvis. He needs a CT.

499
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,694
The angio's
negative, he'll get one.

500
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,802
He's about to code. There's
not enough time for two studies.

501
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,962
We gotta make the right
decision now, the clock is ticking.

502
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,665
Neela, dropping crit status
post abdominal trauma...

503
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,743
and a non-displaced pelvic
fracture. CT or angiogram?

504
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,312
This our dream runner
guy? I'd get a CT.

505
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,546
All right, take him
to the scanner.

506
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,828
- Epi's in.
- What happened?

507
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:34,023
Acute chest, sepsis, she
started third-spacing everywhere.

508
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,532
Still PEA. Code team page.

509
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:40,503
Ana, honey, please. I know
you hear me. Don't do this, okay?

510
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,504
- This is my fault.
- Infection's fault.

511
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,166
You wanted to take her to
O.R. I knew this was wrong.

512
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,611
Could've been screwed either way.
Made a choice. Can't control what happens.

513
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:54,048
I'll be there. Full arrest in the scanner.
Some guy jumped through a window.

514
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,881
Ana, stay with us, okay? Please.

515
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,387
Get me the transcutaneous pacer.

516
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,557
Hold compressions.

517
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,033
This is over.

518
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,644
<i>For some patients, there
is no road to recovery.</i>

519
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,812
<i>Nothing we do as doctors
will alter the outcome.</i>

520
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,083
<i>At least that's what
we tell ourselves.</i>

521
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,399
Ray. It's 5 a.m.

522
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,774
- B-L-U-E. One, two, three.
- Hey, at this point...

523
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,711
removing the source of
infection is our best option.

524
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,079
You mean taking out
my gall bladder, right?

525
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,278
Let's finally get
you better, okay?

526
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,685
Hurry up, I'm getting
sick of you people.

527
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,191
I'm gonna go call your mom.

528
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,757
Hang in there Ana, I'll
check on you in a little while.

529
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,694
Don't you want to
hear your fortune?

530
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,061
I'll be back soon, I promise.

531
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,060
<i>When their way doesn't work
and your way doesn't work...</i>

532
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:24,369
<i>you've got to accept
defeat or find another way.</i>

533
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,205
What about
percutaneous drainage?

534
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,042
Maybe the pus reaccumulated
or she developed an abscess.

535
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,275
- Not likely.
- Less anesthesia, lower risk...

536
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,250
might still allow us to
remove the nidus of infection.

537
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,945
Okay, then what?

538
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,287
- Switch to synercid, watch in the PICU...
- Set it up. I'll meet you in PICU in 10.

539
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,192
You're almost an attending, I
need to start listening to you.

540
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,010
Ray. Happy birthday.

541
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,654
No, I didn't forget.

542
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,417
Jeez, man. I've never heard of
someone being so psyched to turn 30.

543
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,754
I'll call you back later, okay?

544
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:19,455
Big-wave surfing, car
chases, dragon slaying.

545
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,099
I've done it all.

546
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,633
Dr. Dubenko says hurry,
he's in IR with your girl.

547
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:27,136
I'm not getting a good look at the
spleen. Will you hand me a DPL kit?

548
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,501
Are you serious? We
don't do DPLs anymore.

549
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,439
It'll give us a fast answer
and spare him the radiation.

550
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:36,707
- 10-blade, betadine, and lido, come on.
- I'll give you a hand with that. Here.

551
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,282
- Thanks. GATES:
Hey, listen, um...

552
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,318
- Those Hawks tickets that we bought.
- Yeah, what about them?

553
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:45,719
Game's coming up, I was thinking I
could take Alex if you were cool with that.

554
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,122
- I don't know.
- Well, he loves hockey.

555
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,695
And it could give us a little guy
time and give you the night off.

556
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,559
I'll think about it.

557
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,901
- Fluid's pink.
- What's that mean?

558
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,836
You have internal bleeding and
you're gonna need an operation.

559
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,239
- Wow.
- We're gonna be able to fix everything up.

560
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,903
Morris, let the O.R. know,
okay? Dubenko's waiting for me.

561
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,015
- NPO and check the crit q 30.
- What the hell was that?

562
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,050
- What was what?
- Gates.

563
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,314
Following Sam around
like a puppy in there.

564
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,685
Guy does not know
how to play it cool.

565
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,690
Uh, Dr. Morris...

566
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,194
uh, come with
me, it's important.

567
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,836
Sorry, Ana, I got
stuck in the ER.

568
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,904
There, that's the liver. Good.

569
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,700
Aspirating.

570
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,536
Sats up to 92.

571
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,511
- Wow.
- What?

572
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,514
A lot of purulent material here.

573
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,052
I don't want you to
be late for interviews.

574
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,380
I can't leave in the middle.

575
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,455
Be hours before
we know anything.

576
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,559
Go, mingle, all the top
trauma programs will be there.

577
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,558
Flush. NEELA: If you say so.

578
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,768
And when you've
weighed all your options...

579
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,957
- I hope you'll decide to stay.
- What?

580
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,033
Assistant professor,
full benefits...

581
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,760
research and admin time.

582
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,239
You'll get an official
offer letter in a few weeks.

583
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,466
- Lucien. DUBENKO:
Whatever happens...

584
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,111
you've got a back-up plan here.

585
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,548
- I... I don't know what to say.
- Shut up and go.

586
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,561
Wow. Where are you going?

587
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,632
- Job interviews. I'm late.
- Good luck.

588
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,462
Hey, um, did our dream runner
guy make it to the O.R. yet?

589
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,229
- He's next.
- Do me a favor.

590
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,067
Repeat the ultrasound,
stay ahead of the blood loss.

591
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,004
- Yeah.
- Okay.

592
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,069
Whoa.

593
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,140
- Hello, Neela.
- You're back.

594
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,515
I'm, uh, so sorry.

595
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,851
I'm late for these interviews
and I have to get the train.

596
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:03,086
- I can't believe this.
- I had the guy replace all the chrome.

597
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,627
Install Mikuni carburetors.

598
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,458
Do you mind if we
borrow your bike?

599
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,099
Well, you know, surfing,
barbecues, all the usual January stuff.

600
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,333
Bastard.

601
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,673
Still, I missed this dark,
cold, miserable place.

602
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,143
Every day.

603
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,181
Really? And what
exactly did you miss?

604
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,978
I don't know.

605
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,513
It wasn't the weather
or, uh, my apartment.

606
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,489
It wasn't even the
job, really. Although...

607
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,958
there's this certain surgeon...

608
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,029
Am I, uh... Am I boring you?

609
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,225
I...

610
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,960
I couldn't seem to
get her out of my head.

611
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,573
You, doctor...

612
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,005
need to go.

613
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,644
I do?

614
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,050
Oh, I do.

615
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,887
You are gonna kick ass
in there, Neela, I know it.

616
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,491
Simon. I missed you too.

617
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,026
A little.

618
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:22,366
O.R.'s gonna be another hour at
least. You just did that 10 minutes ago.

619
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,702
I know, but I promised
Neela I'd check again.

620
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,744
Yeah, I don't feel so good.

621
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,403
He looks pale. Don't
you think he looks pale?

622
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,073
All right. Hang two units
on the rapid infuser...

623
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,276
and please call the O.R. again.

624
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,387
What? What is it?

625
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,584
The next thing, you need
to come visit Durham.

626
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,624
Can you really see
me living down south?

627
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:45,457
It's a lovely city, it's much
more cultured than you think.

628
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,929
- Simon?
- How'd it go?

629
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,568
Uh, very well, I'd say.

630
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,899
Uh, Simon, this is Elizabeth Corday,
Chief of Trauma Surgery at Duke.

631
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,041
And Simon is an ER
attending at County.

632
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,005
Nice to meet you.

633
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,877
Give me a call when
you've thought about things...

634
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,207
and we'll talk details.

635
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,612
Take her out for some champagne.

636
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,578
Well, that sounds
like you killed it.

637
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,785
You spend all these years...

638
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,224
scrambling for the privilege
of becoming a doctor.

639
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,829
- It feels crazy to be, you know, wanted.
- Well, get used to it.

640
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,339
What's this?

641
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,286
- Second unit's up.
- I'm in, call for a vent.

642
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,122
Introducer. Forty-five
minutes till they give us an O.R.

643
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,197
- That's too long.
- We'll never keep up.

644
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,198
What choice do we have? Get
a second infuser, hang an IJ.

645
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,699
No, I've got the subclavian.

646
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,338
Dump in blood and the
FFP until the room is ready.

647
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,167
Nick, hang on, okay? I need you.

648
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,275
Oliver needs you.

649
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,037
- V-tach.
- No pulse.

650
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,770
- You're charged.
- Mig of epi.

651
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:11,144
All right. MORRIS: Clear!

652
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,121
- Units 11 and 12 are up.
- Clear.

653
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,815
No change. Resume compressions.

654
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,357
Please, baby. Don't do this.
- Again.

655
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,395
Okay, enough.

656
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,730
Sterile sevens and
a thoracotomy tray.

657
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,098
I cannot bear another
one of these right now.

658
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,201
- Another what?
- What are you doing?

659
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,505
A room shortage is
a stupid reason to die.

660
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,611
I'll clamp the aorta and
fix this myself if I have to.

661
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,980
Well, all right.

662
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,088
Where are you going?

663
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:01,063
I have to go to the hospital
and check on a patient.

664
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,162
You are kidding. Have
one of the interns do it.

665
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,363
Just stay here, I'll
be back in an hour.

666
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,405
And don't say it.

667
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,009
Say what?

668
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,042
You know what.

669
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,040
I told you so.

670
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,382
- Ah, it keeps slipping.
- Try a bigger clamp.

671
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,353
Heart's barely filling.

672
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,872
I got it. All right, run in another
liter and shock him again.

673
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,604
All right.

674
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,322
- Clear.
- Sounds like you could use a surgeon.

675
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,755
- Back in sinus.
- Hallelujah.

676
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,224
Thank you.

677
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:08,665
After I ran into you, I came back
and checked. He was bleeding out.

678
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,099
- Could have gone the other way.
- Now, this isn't a done deal.

679
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,331
Okay, well, let's get him
upstairs while he's still got a pulse.

680
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:24,909
Hey, Tony.

681
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,653
I'm sure Alex would love to
go to that Hawks game with you.

682
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,017
Thank you.

683
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,418
Anytime.

684
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,301
Get some sleep, Ana.

685
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,733
No more 2 a.m. "Guitar
Hero" with the clerks.

686
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,170
I'll see you in the morning.

687
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,672
Don't you want to
hear your fortune?

688
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,275
It can wait, honey.

689
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,936
- She's been awake for two days.
- Yeah, go home already.

690
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,043
"Your actions are
the seeds of fate."

691
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,614
Not exactly a fortune, more
of a theory, really, but I'll take it.

692
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,056
Hey, you never did my fortune.

693
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,990
Pick a color and a number
between one and 10.

694
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:15,031
- Goodnight, guys.
- Okay. Rounds are at 7.

695
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,658
Okay. Green and six.

696
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:24,537
G-R-E-E-N. One, two,
three, four, five, six.
