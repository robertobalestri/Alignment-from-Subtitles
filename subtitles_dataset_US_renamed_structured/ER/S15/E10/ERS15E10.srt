1
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,267
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,464
Alex?

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:11,271
- Ma?
- He was driving some drunk girl's car.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,777
She just died.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,575
I let him go to the party.

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:21,882
Forget about the deposition. If the case
goes to court, I'll testify on your behalf.

7
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,523
Seen this guy?

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,624
That storage locker
in Indiana called again.

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,059
If you don't pay, they'll
sell your dad's stuff.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,357
Hold CPR.

11
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,629
Get ready for
internal compressions.

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,445
You can't just show up at
my work and drop this off.

13
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,082
You wouldn't go to the storage
unit, so I brought it to you.

14
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,219
- I was gonna deal with it, eventually.
- What is this?

15
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,879
It's my dad's way of aggravating
me from the grave. This is my cousin.

16
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,616
- Simon Brenner.
- Johnny. Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,795
Look, I did you a favor. This
here? It's only the good stuff.

18
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:07,265
- I find that hard to believe.
- Well, have fun.

19
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,030
Oh, uh, and Aunt Ethel says,
"Thanks for the birthday card."

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,202
- I didn't send her a birthday card.
- Exactly. Bastard.

21
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,411
What am I supposed
to do with all this junk?

22
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,605
I'm sure there's a
logical explanation here.

23
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,080
Hey, Archie, Dr. Banfield's
looking for you.

24
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,486
- Great. She's gonna love this.
- Well, how about a peace offering?

25
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,748
Somehow I don't see her really
appreciating a cheese head.

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,947
Eager for a case?

27
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,116
Someone says abdominal
trauma, I come running.

28
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,285
Twenty-four-year old
female, EGA, 36 weeks.

29
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,921
Tripped during an immigration raid
at a tie factory down on North Orleans.

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,295
- Okay. Vitals? HARMS:
Stable, but contracting.

31
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,492
Q, 5 minutes.

32
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,763
- I'm Dr. Brenner. What's your name?
- Gloria.

33
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,431
- Uh, is there any bleeding?
- Uh-uh. BP's 124/81.

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,109
- It's okay. Where you going?
- It's a case for OB.

35
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,770
She still needs a
trauma assessment.

36
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,280
I'll give you my blessing,
but she's still an OB patient.

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,919
- I'm gonna page Coburn.
- Okay. Hang in there, Gloria.

38
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,487
Please, my baby.

39
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,655
Oh, Dr. Banfield.

40
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,259
I need to skedaddle
just a little early today...

41
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,861
to get in, uh, character
for the Christmas party.

42
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,362
Never met a costume
you didn't like, huh, Frank?

43
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,329
No, ma'am. Oh, and
your other half called.

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,937
Wanted to know what time
to be here for said party.

45
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,163
You're going to the party?

46
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,706
You say that like I don't
know how to have a good time.

47
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,707
- That's not at all what I meant.
- Anyone you want us to call?

48
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,504
My husband, but he
doesn't need to come.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,979
- We got it. FRANK:
Here you go. Jock itch.

50
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,050
Oh, you sweet-talker, you.

51
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,677
Oh, hang on. You're
not seeing patients today.

52
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,848
I need you to do the
intern mid-year reviews.

53
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,823
- I'd rather do the jock itch.
- Too bad.

54
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,054
But, uh, Dr. Brenner
is great at paperwork.

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,562
Terrific penmanship.

56
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,462
Yoo-hoo. Dr. Morris.

57
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,967
- Hello, Mrs. Gaines.
- Hello.

58
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,972
I need refills for my cholesterol
and blood-pressure pills. And I also...

59
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,542
You know, I would love
to help you, Mrs. Gaines...

60
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,702
but I'm not seeing
patients today.

61
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,747
- Dr. Morris, you can go ahead and write...
- No, rules are rules.

62
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,908
However, Dr. Sanchez
here would love to help you.

63
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,317
Okay. My work here is done.

64
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,083
I brought you folks
some brownies.

65
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,318
- I made them myself.
- Awesome.

66
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,553
Frank, uh, did Psych come
down on my hair puller?

67
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,029
- Not yet. Don't eat at the desk.
- Ooh, I'm going.

68
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,895
- Right this way.
- Oh, thank you.

69
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,560
- Brownies?
- No, I'm good.

70
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,571
Dr. Gates, any word
on your homeless vet?

71
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,902
- No, I seem to have hit a dead end.
- All right.

72
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,910
Well, I'll put a call into a friend
of mine at Midnight Ministries...

73
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,674
- so maybe she'll know something.
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

74
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,541
- I gotta run upstairs for a minute.
- Okay.

75
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,580
- Sam coming in today?
- Should be.

76
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,021
Heard she wanted
to get back to work.

77
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,232
They're getting
ready to extubate Alex.

78
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,972
He's fighting the vent.
Sats are dropping.

79
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,807
- He's biting the tube.
- He wants off.

80
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,381
- He's agitated, Sam.
- Hang on. Hang on.

81
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,619
- Mm-mm. 40 milligrams propofol IV push.
- No, no, no. Please don't give up.

82
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,988
- Sorry, we can't extubate like this, Sam.
- He's right.

83
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,286
Well, he'll calm down.
Just give him a minute.

84
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,451
Restart the drip at 6
milligrams a minute.

85
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,797
Sedation's in.

86
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,892
Sorry, Sam, we'll see where
we are again tomorrow, okay?

87
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,895
Um, excuse me.

88
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,055
Is Dr. Morris working today?

89
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,361
Uh, yeah. He's somewhere.

90
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,035
Jerry?

91
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,906
What brings you to our neck of the woods?
I thought you were up in, uh... In Alaska.

92
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,704
Eh, I got tired of slinging
beers, so I moved back.

93
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,144
Hey, Archie. Look what the
world's largest cat dragged in.

94
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,806
- Jerry, my man.
- Hey.

95
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,747
- How you doing, brother?
- How are you?

96
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,615
- Good.
- Dr. Morris, do you realize...

97
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,450
there's a large storage unit in
the bay with your name on it?

98
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,154
I'm trying to get rid of it.

99
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,458
Burn it, donate it. I
want it out of here.

100
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,651
Sell everything.

101
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,798
You know, one man's
trash is another man's cash.

102
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,331
- And when do I have time for that?
- Uh, I'll do it.

103
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,096
- You will? Seriously? JERRY:
Yeah, I love a good fire sale.

104
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,105
Excellent. You know, I'll tell you
what, I will give you 10 percent...

105
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,970
Ten?

106
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,777
- Fifteen?
- It's cold outside.

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,444
Okay, fine. Fifty percent
of whatever you bring in.

108
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,984
You can't miss it. And paper
money only. None of this:

109
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,153
- "I want everything for a quarter" crap.
- You don't wanna look through it?

110
00:05:56,323 --> 00:06:00,351
I made it this far without that junk,
no need to weigh myself down now.

111
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,687
Oh, welcome back.
How's Alex doing?

112
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,457
He's still sedated, you know.

113
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,760
We tried to extubate
him this morning, but...

114
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,631
- He'll be off the vent soon.
- You don't know that.

115
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,937
I thought he would
be talking by now...

116
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,702
but he was hypotensive
for so long, you know...

117
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,675
what if he has brain damage?

118
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,337
Or what if he just never
gets off the vent? It's...

119
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,541
Look, Sam, if you need
to take a little more time...

120
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,314
No, no. I really
should keep busy.

121
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,391
You know, I can't keep sitting
there staring at Alex's monitors.

122
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,322
Thank you for the offer.

123
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,354
Come on, let's get
some coffee first.

124
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:38,991
<i>Chest is clear.</i>

125
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,329
- How are you feeling, Gloria?
- Okay.

126
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,165
- Did you reach my husband?
- He's on his way.

127
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,864
He doesn't have to
come. I can call him later.

128
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,806
Cap refill's good. You know,
he's probably worried about you.

129
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,914
- How long have you two been together?
- We met at the aquarium.

130
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,243
I was 15. NEELA: Wow.

131
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,750
I can't imagine being married
to my high-school boyfriend.

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,321
- We were both new to America.
- How's the crit?

133
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,481
Stable at 39.

134
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,422
So everyone going
to the Christmas party?

135
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,924
Not a chance.

136
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,563
Yeah, but Surgery's hosting
it this year, you have to go.

137
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,256
Belly's benign. Archie
pinched my butt last year...

138
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,925
- and Frank nearly threw up on me.
- That sounds like fun.

139
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,038
Can't imagine why anyone
would wanna miss that.

140
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,834
- Fetal heart rate's at 145.
- You're not into the party?

141
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,437
A work party? At
work? Yeah, no thanks.

142
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,205
I got a hot date
with a stock broker.

143
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,748
So while you losers are
drinking virgin eggnog...

144
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,681
I'm going to be
sipping Veuve Clicquot.

145
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,723
- It's okay.
- Okay, they're three minutes apart now.

146
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,791
Breathe, Gloria, breathe. Okay?

147
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,087
- She's on mag?
- Yeah, but it's not doing much.

148
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,753
OB can take it from here.
She's clear surgically.

149
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,455
All right, Coburn's on her way.

150
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,227
This is Mrs. Ortiz' husband.

151
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,242
- Is the baby okay?
- We're just checking to make sure.

152
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,380
Do you know if it's a
girl or a boy, Mrs. Ortiz?

153
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,540
At my last ultrasound,
it was too soon to tell.

154
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,281
What are we looking at?

155
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,323
Something wrong?

156
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,456
- Is that a twin, maybe?
- I'm not sure.

157
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,896
Getting back to work will
probably be good for you.

158
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,092
- A little distraction. SAM:
Yeah, I could use the money.

159
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,567
Oh, excuse me.
Hey, excuse me, sir?

160
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,006
- Your kids need to be buckled up.
- Sorry, what?

161
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,234
- Your kids need to be wearing seat belts.
- Okay, lady, whatever you say.

162
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,845
Just saying it's better if the
kids had their seat belts on.

163
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,413
It's the law, it's common sense.

164
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,862
- Who the hell asked you?
- She's saying it'd be better...

165
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,952
- if the kids were buckled up.
- Screw off.

166
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,452
- Hey, watch it, all right?
- How are you gonna feel, huh?

167
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,749
If one of your kids comes
through that windshield...

168
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,358
and ends up in ER with
brains coming out of his skull.

169
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,281
- You're an idiot. It's idiots like you...
- Get out of the way.

170
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,594
That keep our hospital from shutting
down, so thank you very much.

171
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,794
- Idiot.
- Let it go. Let it go. Let it go.

172
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,336
How long do I have
to wait for my refills?

173
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,670
- Uh, check with Dr. Sanchez.
- I did.

174
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,280
He said something about
spiders and wandered away.

175
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:11,316
- If I see him, I will send him your way.
- Thank you.

176
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,715
Did you have that
necklace on earlier?

177
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,685
I got it from that
big man outside.

178
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:21,391
He wouldn't know a Hattie
Carnegie piece if it bit him in the ass.

179
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,727
I know, because I was a buyer
for Marshall Field for 40 years.

180
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,994
- Well, you wear it well.
- Thank you.

181
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,333
Oh, and you should know, the
original owner of that necklace?

182
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,531
- Mm-hm?
- She was a saint.

183
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,382
Frank, have you seen...

184
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,012
- the evaluation forms?
- Hello?

185
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,307
Let's see. Last time I
looked, they were right here.

186
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,040
Thank you.

187
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,243
Got myself a little something
from the Morris family estate.

188
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,150
- Let me guess, a nice broach?
- Hmm.

189
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,349
A baseball signed by
"Joltin'" Joe DiMaggio...

190
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,154
and some no-name Yankee.

191
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,354
Yeah, no, that was me.

192
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,195
"Archie Morris." My dad was
pissed. I couldn't sit down for a week.

193
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,097
Listen, um, that
was my friend, Ida.

194
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,036
- I... I need to find Dr. Sanchez.
- Okay, if I see him...

195
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,576
- you will be the first to know.
- No, no, no. No, this is really important.

196
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,411
- What do we have?
- Renee Webber-Stewart, 39.

197
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,209
She passed out at the mall.

198
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,783
All right, let's take
her to Exam 3.

199
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,945
- We were waiting for Santa.
- She has a 6-month-old, Lola.

200
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,954
Mom broke her fall, but
check on the baby too.

201
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,684
Belly's distended,
systolic's only 84 after a liter.

202
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,860
- My wife, Nicole.
- We'll call her for you, ma'am.

203
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,588
- I have the number.
- Could be vagal...

204
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,699
- but she's pretty out of it.
- Have Social Services watch the baby...

205
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,634
- until we can get a family member here.
- That's okay, I'll look after her.

206
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,069
Huh. Hi, you little reindeer.

207
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,437
It's okay. We're gonna get
you right back to Rudolph.

208
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,308
Oh, hi. Aren't you a cute baby?

209
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,918
- Oh, Frank? Frank. Still no Psych?
- I'll call again.

210
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,551
- Hey, I'm saving that for later.
- Okay, you still have one left.

211
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,588
I'm sorry. I'm hungry.

212
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,125
We're from Immigration. We're
looking for a patient, Gloria Ortiz.

213
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,890
Mom's 5 centimeters dilated
and maxed out on terb and mag.

214
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,228
- Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
- It's a boy.

215
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,599
- Ah, we're having a boy.
- Second IV is in.

216
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,969
We're having a boy.
Did you hear that?

217
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:18,737
A boy.

218
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,956
- That's great. NEELA: This
is what we were looking at.

219
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,916
- Thought it might be a multiple gestation.
- There's only one heartbeat.

220
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,746
- No, it's not a twin.
- Are you sure?

221
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:32,649
- What's wrong? COBURN:
All right. Mr. and Mrs. Ortiz.

222
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,919
The ultrasounds shows
your baby has a large mass...

223
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,858
involving the lower
face and neck.

224
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,000
- A mass? What does that mean?
- Does my baby have cancer?

225
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,465
The ultrasound doesn't
tell us if it's cancerous.

226
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,604
The most pressing
issue is the medications...

227
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,707
- aren't stopping your contractions.
- What are you saying?

228
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,172
We're gonna do everything
we can for your baby.

229
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,369
There are two Immigration
agents at the desk...

230
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,979
who wanna talk to your patient.

231
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,175
Well, we're kind
of busy here, Frank.

232
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,049
- They don't want to wait around.
- They're gonna have to.

233
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,554
What do we do now?

234
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,215
All right, your baby
needs to be delivered.

235
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,305
Is this Gloria Ortiz?

236
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,176
- We're doing an exam.
- What do you need?

237
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,716
- To take Mrs. Ortiz into custody.
- What for?

238
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,854
She's a fugitive alien.
She's being deported.

239
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,916
This yarn is so soft.

240
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,858
Yeah, my mom spent the
'70s obsessed with macramé.

241
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,225
Wall hangings,
tea cozies, vests.

242
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,559
- Vests?
- Mm-hm.

243
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:51,194
My first-grade class picture?
Rocking a blue macramé vest.

244
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:55,274
It's like no matter where
it is, it's staring at me.

245
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,704
Hey, come to the O.R.

246
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,970
Dr. Brenner's letting us
watch an EXIT procedure.

247
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,942
- What?
- It's when they section the mom...

248
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,481
to get an airway on the
baby before the delivery.

249
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,879
I mean, can you imagine?

250
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,422
- Hey, did you hear me?
- Oh, yeah. Airways. Airways, baby.

251
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,558
- Here.
- No. No.

252
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,284
Listen, have either of
you seen Dr. Sanchez?

253
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,122
Oh, he's over there.

254
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,390
Oh, oh, that's not one
of my brownies, is it?

255
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,226
Why, is it bad? I ate two.

256
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,760
- How are you feeling, dear?
- Hey, that's my Jell-O.

257
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,395
- You shouldn't be eating my food.
- It's okay, I'm a doctor.

258
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,599
Dr. Sanchez.

259
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,349
- What are you doing?
- Wiggling and jiggling.

260
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,511
Put that back.

261
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:44,280
Oh, doctor. Doctor, he's high as a kite.
The brownies have cannabis in them.

262
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,089
You gave pot
brownies to my staff?

263
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,800
Do you know how dangerous that is?
They could have mistreated a patient.

264
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,334
I know, it was a mistake. You
see, my friend, Ida, had cancer...

265
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,802
and I made special
brownies for her.

266
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:04,137
Now she's in remission, thank
the Lord, but she still likes them.

267
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,178
And I mixed up the batches.

268
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,046
You two are done for the day.
Drink some water, take a nap.

269
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,016
Whatever you do, do not drive
home until you're clean and sober.

270
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,021
Pick any three eight-track
tapes for the price of two.

271
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,831
Mr. Ortiz?

272
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,694
How's Gloria? Is she okay?

273
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,196
She's fine, but we're worried
the tumor on your son's neck...

274
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,468
could prevent him
from breathing normally.

275
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,044
- So fix it. Can you fix it?
- We're gonna do a Cesarean section...

276
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,206
so we can insert a breathing tube
while he's attached to the placenta.

277
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,407
I don't understand.

278
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,019
Well, that way, Gloria's body
can supply him with oxygen...

279
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,156
- until he can breathe on his own.
- Wait, she's having the baby today?

280
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:54,419
- We're prepping her for surgery.
- No. I can't. No, not like this.

281
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,324
- Well, we have to.
- Are they still there?

282
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,698
Did you know
Immigration was after her?

283
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,031
We're undocumented.

284
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,537
Two years ago, they scheduled her
for deportation, but she didn't show up.

285
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,503
I couldn't let her go.

286
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,113
- Our life is here.
- I'm so sorry. I have to get back.

287
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,046
- I'll call you when we're out of surgery.
- We're not bad people.

288
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,449
We never harmed anyone.

289
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,588
We only want to be happy.

290
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,624
- Frank gave this to me.
- Oh, that was my mom's.

291
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,560
That's your story,
huh? You want it back?

292
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,098
No, I'd break it.

293
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,361
When I was 9, I juggled
the holy-family set.

294
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,903
- Oh, yeah?
- Not sure what upset my mom more...

295
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,563
that I broke her Hummels or I
tossed around the baby Jesus.

296
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,104
The only time she
raised her voice at me.

297
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,111
Well, I don't juggle, so
I think this one's safe.

298
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,875
Dr. Banfield, this is
Nicole, Renee's partner.

299
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,486
- Hi. Is she okay?
- She's doing better.

300
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,589
- Can I see her?
- This way.

301
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,216
- Where's Lola?
- One of our nurses is babysitting.

302
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,416
I'll go get her.

303
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,994
Now, she's still a little
sedated from the CAT scan.

304
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,461
- What's wrong?
- We're not sure yet.

305
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,965
But we noticed the surgical
scar on her abdomen.

306
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,003
- Do you know what it's from?
- She had cancer of the small bowel...

307
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,640
but she's been in
remission for three years.

308
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,813
What does this have to
do with her passing out?

309
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,242
Her belly's distended
and we're concerned.

310
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,942
Oh, God.

311
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,019
Is that what you think?
That the cancer's back?

312
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,589
We'll know more when
we get the CT results.

313
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,092
This one's mine.

314
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,666
I got this when Alex and
I lived in Albuquerque.

315
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,167
He was just a baby then.

316
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:48,671
And this one's Haleh's. It
was a gift from her grandma.

317
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,279
And look, look. There's
Frank. That one's his, obviously.

318
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,176
It's pretty silly, huh?

319
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,614
Sam? We can take Lola
back to her mom now.

320
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,716
Bye-bye, little reindeer.

321
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,120
Bye.

322
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,198
- You okay?
- Nope, not even a little bit.

323
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:27,573
I remember this one Christmas,
Alex begged me for a skateboard.

324
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,978
And I gave it to him,
he was so excited.

325
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,318
- And then I made him wear a helmet.
- You were looking out for him.

326
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,752
You do everything you can
to keep them safe and then...

327
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,189
- he ends up on a ventilator.
- Sam.

328
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,228
He's been tubed for
almost a week. What's next?

329
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,559
He's gonna be on a
trach his whole life?

330
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,224
Let's not jump the gun. They're
gonna extubate tomorrow.

331
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,935
Yeah, I asked Dubenko if
they could try again tonight...

332
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,903
but he said they
only do it before noon.

333
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,873
Well, he's just
following the rules.

334
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,969
Why do you do that?

335
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:07,584
- What?
- Why do you always take the other side?

336
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,991
- I'm just trying to help.
- Yeah, well, then take my side.

337
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,391
All right, well, then
let's tell Dubenko...

338
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,589
that his rules are stupid, and
maybe he'll make an exception?

339
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,892
You never know.

340
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,762
- Cefazolin onboard.
- Uterine stapler.

341
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,139
Where did you get that?

342
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,708
- Surgical lounge.
- Low-V.

343
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,709
- Want some?
- Ew. No, thanks.

344
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,315
- Amnio infusion is underway.
- Okay, people, here we go.

345
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,983
Pulse, 118.

346
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,813
- Hey, you guys, look.
- Point-six fent.

347
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,046
Watch the head.

348
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,220
Fifty atropine,
30 of fentanyl IM.

349
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,227
Okay. Vecuronium's
in. Clock is ticking.

350
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,333
Get another zero and
a three-five. Let's go.

351
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,300
The scan shows some abnormal
tissue wrapped around part of the liver.

352
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,741
- The cancer's back?
- Most likely.

353
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,111
What's next?

354
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,648
We'll talk to a surgeon and
find out what the options are.

355
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,654
Run the scan by Dr. Dubenko.

356
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,289
- It was in the lymph nodes.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,693
We knew a recurrence was likely.

358
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:30,166
I convinced myself that
I was gonna be lucky.

359
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,498
That I could dodge the bullet.

360
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,205
Well, that's a great
attitude to have.

361
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,669
She doesn't understand the
concept of "The glass is half empty."

362
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,475
I finally met someone
that I couldn't live without...

363
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,384
and that's no time to give up.

364
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,482
A week before the surgery, we
flew to Boston and got married.

365
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,627
And we ran off like a
couple of teenagers.

366
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,591
That's quite a leap of faith.

367
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,124
It's not hard when you
have someone to hang onto.

368
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,003
What's gonna happen
once she's out of surgery?

369
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,094
She'll be detained
till they deport her.

370
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,541
What about her recovery?
Let's try a Miller one.

371
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,123
Detention facilities have doctors.
- Not good ones.

372
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,309
I can't get a good
view. Suction.

373
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,076
Can't we keep her
until the baby's DC'd?

374
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,517
We can't. Baby needs to
be in a NICU for three weeks.

375
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,021
- If people knew...
- Fetal heart rate's 138.

376
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,183
And by "people," you
mean the 10:00 news?

377
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,383
Couldn't hurt.

378
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,087
You put a magnifying glass
on our hospital like that...

379
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,028
public perception will be,
"Go to County, get deported."

380
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,395
The sat? MARISOL: 52.

381
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,595
Nothing we can do?
- We're doing it.

382
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,002
It's too distorted. Suction.

383
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,664
We got some uterine bleeding.

384
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,674
Switch with me,
Neela. Rigid bronch.

385
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:45,937
I can't get it.

386
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,376
You're taking too long.
- Systolic's 84.

387
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,676
Time's up. We gotta clamp,
whether you get the airway in or not.

388
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,012
Hold on. PERRY: 78.

389
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,517
If we don't handle this...

390
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,020
Mom is gonna bleed out
and we'll lose the baby too.

391
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,213
Damn it.

392
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,950
Okay, type specific and
0.25 methergine, now.

393
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,531
I have to cut the cord.

394
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,930
Not without an airway.
- No choice.

395
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,093
The baby's not getting oxygen...

396
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,136
We bail out now or
we lose them both.

397
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,365
How about a tracheotomy?
- Not yet.

398
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,304
Dr. Dubenko, a
39-year-old woman...

399
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,104
Find Anspaugh, we're busy here.

400
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,543
I want to make sure you...
- Find Anspaugh.

401
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,046
Got it. Sorry.

402
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,649
Lucien.

403
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,783
- We'll do the trach.
- Five minutes, that's all.

404
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,823
- Let's go, let's go.
- Okay, 15 blade and a 3-0 Shiley.

405
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,365
Nicole?

406
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,740
- What's the word from the surgeon?
- Uh, none yet.

407
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,640
How are you doing?

408
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:01,377
I was thinking, uh, what if...?

409
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,717
What if this is it?

410
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,485
Lola won't remember her.

411
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,394
You will.

412
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,659
And you'll make sure
your baby does too.

413
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,266
I feel like I might forget.

414
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,338
Just the little things.

415
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,071
Just the little things.

416
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:36,216
How she burns the roof of
her mouth on pizza every time.

417
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:41,855
Or how she slaps my
arm when she laughs.

418
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,029
You won't forget those things.

419
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,867
You won't.

420
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,101
Jerry couldn't get
rid of this stuff?

421
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,907
- What do you want to do with it?
- Hey, thanks for the crock pot.

422
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,540
No problem. Uh, if it's the one with the
blue flowers on the side, it has a short.

423
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,744
Almost burnt the house down.

424
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,315
- Son of a bitch.
- What is it?

425
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,550
I made this in the third grade.

426
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:19,097
- Yeah, it's milk and cookies, for Santa.
- Okay.

427
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:23,635
Yeah. My teacher, Ms. Durbin,
said that wherever we are...

428
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,897
if we set this out,
Santa would find us.

429
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,765
That's sweet.

430
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,111
My dad didn't think so.

431
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,681
Yeah, he said Santa wasn't
stupid, he'd know it wasn't real.

432
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,148
- That was my dad.
- Yeah, but he kept it.

433
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,853
Yeah. Yes, he did.

434
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,651
Anatomy's so distorted. I
can't feel the tracheal rings.

435
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,986
- Focus.
- Crit's down to 26.

436
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,629
- I'm pulling the plug.
- Wait. Uh, guide wire?

437
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,925
- Systolic's only 68.
- Either you have it or you don't.

438
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,666
I'm in. DUBENKO:
Throw me the bag.

439
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,931
Twenty units of oxytocin
and start the drip.

440
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,667
Okay, we've got chest
rise. You can clamp.

441
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,134
Done.

442
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,641
Scissors.

443
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,341
Get the carboprost onboard.

444
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,854
Don't ever worry that you don't
do enough for your patients.

445
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,554
Right.

446
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,901
Lucien, can you stay? I need the hands.
- Yeah.

447
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,800
Uterine tone seems better.

448
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,873
- BP's coming up.
- Nice and clean.

449
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,475
Umbilical-line tray.

450
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,304
- Heart rate's over...
- Wow.

451
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,159
Good luck, Mr. Mosely.

452
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,717
Ha, ha. It's a little
late for that, isn't it?

453
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,685
- Sorry they couldn't extubate Alex today.
- Hopefully soon.

454
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,256
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

455
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,189
Copy, uh, the discharge
summary, will you?

456
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,230
I'll be right back.

457
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,359
Hey, Max?

458
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,005
Hey, Max.

459
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,168
Hey.

460
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,866
I've been looking for you, man.

461
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,045
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

462
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,047
Jake has a hard time
when it's cold, though.

463
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,085
Well, come inside, warm
up a bit. Jake can come too.

464
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,553
Let's start with a cup of
coffee. You want some coffee?

465
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,632
Yeah. Yeah, coffee's good.

466
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,323
- This wasn't your average C-section.
- As long as she's stable...

467
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,374
- we have to take her into custody.
- She hasn't even seen her baby yet.

468
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,782
- I mean, give her a few days...
- Look, we don't like this either...

469
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,945
separating a mom from her kid.

470
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,557
- But we can't make an exception here.
- Well, why not?

471
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,287
- She should be able to spend...
- I'm sorry. We'll see you tomorrow.

472
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,556
I'll show you out.

473
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:20,340
- You got them to leave?
- They're coming back tomorrow.

474
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,971
They're gonna transfer
you to a detention facility.

475
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:27,317
- How's my baby?
- He's doing very well.

476
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:31,321
He's still on a ventilator, but
mostly breathing on his own.

477
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,650
- I should call my husband.
- I told him the surgery went well.

478
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:39,424
And that he'll be able to take
your baby home in a few weeks.

479
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,028
Immigration won't
get involved in custody.

480
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,768
A mother is supposed to
protect her child, keep him safe.

481
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,502
He's in good hands.
We're taking care of him.

482
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,807
I need to see him. I
need to see my baby.

483
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,314
- Dr. Dubenko?
- Uh, really swamped right now, Sam.

484
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,386
Yeah, I need you to try
to extubate Alex again.

485
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,153
- We will. Tomorrow.
- No, today. Please?

486
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,121
We already talked about this.
First thing in the morning, I promise.

487
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,283
I've been studying to
become a nurse anesthetist.

488
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,220
- There are some tricks we can use.
- Tricks?

489
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,890
Yeah. We can give an anxiolytic
before shutting off the propofol, right?

490
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,900
That may cut the agitation
we see during emergence.

491
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,334
Two Versed would be
calming and not too sedating.

492
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,064
- Okay.
- Okay, then we sit him up...

493
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,334
and we give him something
familiar to focus on.

494
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,637
It's the Blackhawks
game from last night.

495
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,009
Okay. Well, what
if it doesn't work?

496
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:32,849
No, it'll work. I'll talk him
through it, I'll stay there all night.

497
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:37,251
I will make sure he uses the
incentive spirometer. Whatever it takes.

498
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,755
He's so little.

499
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,192
We'll, uh, do an MRI...

500
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:49,267
to figure out exactly what we
need to do to remove the tumor.

501
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,764
Had you two picked names out?

502
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:59,704
For a boy we liked Pablo.

503
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,438
After my grandfather.

504
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,708
He was a strong man.

505
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,981
It's perfect.

506
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,751
How long will he be here?

507
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,284
Well, if all goes well,
only a few weeks.

508
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:19,090
We're pretty sure he won't
need chemotherapy or radiation.

509
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,732
All alone.

510
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,376
I'll come back.

511
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,717
- They took a risk staying here.
- So what?

512
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,589
It's still inhumane
to separate them.

513
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,094
Yeah, but there is nothing
that we can do, is there?

514
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,893
Not right now. It's not a
good time to rock the boat.

515
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,333
Why? Because you're at the
center of a malpractice suit?

516
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,233
Something like that, yeah.

517
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:05,169
I could have sworn that Neela
Rasgotra was a boat-rocker.

518
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,576
Like, a champion-grade,
professional one at that...

519
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,807
but I guess, I don't
know, I was... I was wrong.

520
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,816
- No, you're not wrong, but...
- What?

521
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,986
I just don't wanna take any
unnecessary chances with my career.

522
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,954
Ah!

523
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,825
Good things happen
when you take a chance.

524
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,302
You ready?

525
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:40,770
Okay, kiddo, we're gonna
take that tube out now, okay?

526
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,381
I know you can do this.
Try, try again, remember?

527
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,676
Like when we took the
training wheels off your bike.

528
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,218
The first time you fell off,
then you got right back on...

529
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,822
and you rode like the
wind. Remember that?

530
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,117
Okay. Balloon's down.

531
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:59,821
Just relax and take some deep
breaths, okay? Second time's the charm.

532
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,361
You wanna do the honors?

533
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,060
- Me?
- Yeah.

534
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,229
You know what you're doing.

535
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,040
Yeah, okay.

536
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,009
Are you ready? Here we go.

537
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,149
Come on.

538
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,515
Yankauer.

539
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,058
Give it a moment.

540
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,892
Alex?

541
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,258
Hey, Alex.

542
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,671
Hey, sweetie. How you feeling?

543
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,000
Did I...?

544
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,503
Did I miss Christmas?

545
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,709
No.

546
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,149
Hey.

547
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,418
Jake's in the break
room eating pot roast...

548
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,425
courtesy of our
clerk, Frank's, wife.

549
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,929
I'm not sure who's
happier, Jake or Frank.

550
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,292
Yeah. Thanks.

551
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,372
After I got back,
nothing went right.

552
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,614
Those people who used to care
were gone, or I scared them off.

553
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,178
The ones I thought I could rely on
from the Army said I wasn't their problem.

554
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,921
Then you came along, and I
figured you were more of the same.

555
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:40,523
But these, uh, past few days, I
heard you were looking for me.

556
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,329
- I saw the fliers.
- I was worried about you.

557
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,901
That means something, you know.

558
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,603
That makes a difference.

559
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,539
I don't... I don't wanna
die on the streets.

560
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,116
Oncology says if we do nothing,
she has a couple of months, tops.

561
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,722
The best thing we can do is
urge her to spend the time well.

562
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,289
She's has a 6-month-old child.

563
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,859
All the more reason for her
to enjoy the time she has left.

564
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,655
Look, if I take
her to the O.R...

565
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,958
there's a good chance I'll cut into
that thing and she'll bleed to death.

566
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,156
There's also a chance...

567
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,632
- you could debulk it and give her time.
- Slim chance.

568
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,465
Her and her partner
have had three years.

569
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:20,867
It that all the time they get?

570
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,634
You could give Renee time to
create memories with her daughter.

571
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,904
Christmas really brings out the
tenacity in you ER people, doesn't it?

572
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,876
Doesn't it?

573
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,846
Fine. Make her
NPO after midnight.

574
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:37,251
I'll try to get her on the
schedule for the morning.

575
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,858
Hey, I heard the good news.

576
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,896
- How you feeling?
- I'm all right.

577
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,657
You don't have to talk.

578
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,165
I brought you
some entertainment.

579
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,600
There's enough movies on here
to tide you over until you go home.

580
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,103
Thanks.

581
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,401
All right. I'm gonna run out and get
you that ice cream you've been craving.

582
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,410
- Rocky road?
- Cookie dough.

583
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,180
Ice cream for
dinner, huh, big shot?

584
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,748
Not bad.

585
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,912
Sarah wanted to be here, but
she's, uh, at her grandparents.

586
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,582
Although she did
send this tiny little card.

587
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,057
- How is she?
- She's good.

588
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,200
She said her arm
itches from the cast.

589
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,530
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

590
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,403
- I didn't...
- Oh, Alex, this wasn't your fault.

591
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,773
I should have never let you
and Sarah go out that night.

592
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,379
No, you were being cool.

593
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,311
Well, yeah...

594
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,616
that was the problem.

595
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,051
Here's your half.

596
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,983
- Three dollars and a Canadian quarter?
- Most of my customers were patients.

597
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,994
I mean, come on, I'm not gonna
charge some kid with the chickenpox...

598
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,496
for his first-ever
pair of rollerblades.

599
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:59,730
- There were rollerblades in there?
- Don't worry, I saved the best for last.

600
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,508
You know what
that is, don't you?

601
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:09,239
- A really old motorcycle?
- It's a 1966 Triumph.

602
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,474
Marlon Brando rode a
Triumph in <i>The Wild One.</i>

603
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,950
- Never saw it, don't care.
- Ah!

604
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,579
It's only the greatest rebel movie
ever with the awesomest bike.

605
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,988
You know what? If you
love it so much, keep it.

606
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:26,496
- What? No, I can't. I can't take this.
- Fix it up, sell it, whatever.

607
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,689
I don't get you.

608
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,665
All the great stuff in there, there
was nothing in there you wanted?

609
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,828
No, it's just...
It's just stuff.

610
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:38,443
Anyway, thanks for taking care of this.
I'm sure you had something better to do.

611
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,512
Actually, I didn't.

612
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:46,150
Since I moved back, work's
been tough to come by.

613
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:50,084
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Anything I can do?

614
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,959
How can I get my old job back?

615
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,022
He fell asleep five minutes ago.

616
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,892
The extubation must
have worn him out.

617
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,660
Yeah.

618
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,868
- I'll put this in the freezer.
- All right.

619
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,506
He seems like
his old self again.

620
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,734
He wanted to remind you that
he wants a PS3 for Christmas.

621
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,790
- Lucien said he could be out in a week.
- Yeah.

622
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,904
We should have a party for
him when he comes home.

623
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,084
I forgot to tell you the other news.
Max showed up, can you believe that?

624
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,850
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I got him admitted...

625
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,352
and don't get mad, but I
said we could watch his dog...

626
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,183
- while he was in the hospital.
- Tony.

627
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,383
But you know what? Alex
always wanted a dog...

628
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,551
and I thought it'd be
cool, when he gets out...

629
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:33,256
- a dog will be there at the house...
- Tony, listen.

630
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,392
Um...

631
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:41,834
I'm gonna stay at
Chuny's for a while...

632
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:46,008
until, uh, I can find a
new place for me and Alex.

633
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:52,173
- You're moving out?
- It's just... It's just not working.

634
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,919
Sam, I know this has been
rough, but it'll get better.

635
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,750
We were doing fine before.

636
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,757
What, you just think things
can go back to normal?

637
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:02,950
I... I made a mistake.

638
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,521
- I shouldn't have let him go out.
- You keep saying that...

639
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,292
but it doesn't make
me feel better.

640
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,867
Well, I don't know what
else to tell you, Sam.

641
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,702
We can work past this.

642
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,944
I can't.

643
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,242
I can't.

644
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:29,917
- So you're just gonna run away?
- I'm not running away.

645
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,714
I'm just telling you...

646
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,728
it's over.

647
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:57,007
- How's it look?
- Looks like locusts got to this.

648
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,152
- Oh, hey. How was the hot date?
- Oh, he was a douche.

649
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,789
You know, who
lies about their age?

650
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,017
First he was 34, then
he was 37, now he's 42.

651
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,422
Maybe he was afraid you
wouldn't date a 42-year-old.

652
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,587
Well, of course I wouldn't.

653
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,030
Besides, he was a stock broker, so
it's been a bad year for him anyway.

654
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,465
Bummer. Well, this has
been fun. I'm gonna get a drink.

655
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,298
I'm gonna get more food.

656
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,933
She hired you on the spot?

657
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,807
Yeah, she wanted a
Santa that wasn't stoned.

658
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,786
- Wow, you think you know someone.
- Ho, ho, ho, Dr. Banfield.

659
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,984
- And who might this young fellow be?
- Russell Banfield, the husband.

660
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:43,651
- Ho, ho, ho.
- This is Jerry. He's filling in for Frank.

661
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,196
- You can call me Kringle. Kris Kringle.
- Mr. Kringle.

662
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,357
And this is Dr. Morris.

663
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,867
So you must be the guy
that slept with my wife?

664
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,164
- What? Uh, no, no, no...
- I'm just kidding.

665
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,371
Nice to meet you.

666
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,010
- Jerry...? Uh, Santa?
- Yes?

667
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,237
- Yes?
- Listen, I need you to do me a favor.

668
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,332
- All right, now...
- Don't worry, it's a virgin.

669
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,316
I'll be ready for Renee's
surgery in the morning.

670
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,820
Hey. NEELA: Hey.

671
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:13,254
We got news on the Bertha
Mendenhall malpractice suit.

672
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,223
- What is it?
- Well, I don't know if I should tell you.

673
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,921
Why, is it bad? It's bad.

674
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,067
- Depends on whose side you were on.
- Just spill it.

675
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,826
Motion for summary judgment.

676
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,873
- The judge threw the case out.
- You're kidding.

677
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,008
Merry Christmas, Neela.

678
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,503
Gloria left?

679
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,212
Uh, yeah, looks that way.

680
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,076
And you're not upset?

681
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,050
People do crazy things
when they're desperate.

682
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,587
Eggnog?

683
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,624
Well, wait, uh, you're not
even the slightest bit worried?

684
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,955
She'll be okay. I'm starving.

685
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,729
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

686
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,596
It's nothing.

687
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:01,365
Wait, your patient leaves hours after
surgery and you're not concerned?

688
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,371
She needs to be
under a doctor's care.

689
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:08,707
It is possible that someone put
her in a cab to another hospital.

690
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,042
Good luck with everything.

691
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,120
So she's just gonna show
up and...? And ask for a bed?

692
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,987
And it's also possible that someone
wrote down a few instructions.

693
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,561
Neela Rasgotra,
rocking the boat.

694
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,602
Archie? Can you just
hold this? I'll be right back.

695
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,775
Hey, where are you going? Archie
Morris never leaves a party early.

696
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,317
In fact, more often than not,
he's the last man standing.

697
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,250
There's a first time
for everything, right?

698
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,287
Oh, come on. Who's
gonna pinch my butt later?

699
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:54,824
Frank? He's far too stoned.

700
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:58,589
- I'm not in the party mood, I guess.
- Well, we can change that.

701
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,530
You're like Happy Holly over here.
I should be asking if you're okay.

702
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,159
I'm just saying, there are
always things to celebrate.

703
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,965
Come with me.

704
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,608
Pretty amazing, huh?

705
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:17,114
Some days our job
really does matter.

706
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:21,985
Today I did paperwork and saw
my childhood parade around the ER.

707
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:26,955
Oh, yeah. Jerry gave me the <i>Burl
Ives Christmas Favorites</i> on reel-to-reel.

708
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,459
I kept acting
like I didn't care.

709
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,559
But, you know, I'd be lying if I
said there wasn't a part of me...

710
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,465
that hoped Jerry might
find something that would...

711
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,703
I don't know, help me
understand my dad.

712
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,508
Something more than
crock pots and cheese hats.

713
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:07,331
You know, I was thinking...

714
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,329
about us having a family.

715
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,536
Starting again.

716
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:21,673
That's a pretty
big leap of faith.

717
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:26,377
Not so hard when you
got someone to hold onto.
