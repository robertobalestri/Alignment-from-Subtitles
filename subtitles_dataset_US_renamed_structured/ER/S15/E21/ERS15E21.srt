1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,035
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,768
- Be with you in a second.
- I found a baby, I think it's dying.

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,470
I'll need to appoint someone
from the hospital staff...

4
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,173
to be his protective
custodian while he's in here.

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,510
You up for it?

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:22,122
So many times in my life
I've failed to take a chance.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,087
Don't worry, Neela. I'm not
here to convince you to stay.

8
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,355
If you can handle being with a guy who gets
stuck by needles, kicked by patients...

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,659
takes an occasional slug
of radiation to his cojones...

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,936
well, then, I can certainly
stomach some occasional gunfire.

11
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,737
I got a meeting at 9, maybe
the weekend will be better.

12
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,974
- No. He's getting discharged tomorrow.
- You're about to start a shift.

13
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,310
I can get someone to cover.

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,981
Look, it's okay to be nervous.

15
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,089
- We don't know about this baby.
- Most times you don't.

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,815
He seems perfect right now.

17
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,426
I'd rather do this when we
can spend time with him.

18
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,826
Let's start with five minutes
and take it from there.

19
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,432
- Good morning.
- Yes, it is.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,932
I will pick you up at 8:30.

21
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,195
- What should I wear?
- Something fancy.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,838
- I hate surprises.
- Okay. Okay.

23
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,338
It involves fine dining
and some other things.

24
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,239
- Archie.
- Gonna be a big night.

25
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,772
Big night? Popping the question?

26
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,043
Are you crazy? We're
in the honeymoon phase.

27
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,118
Year from now, we
could hate each other.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,560
And I thought romance was dead.

29
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,055
Big surprise is I've been studying
an instructional DVD for two weeks.

30
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,750
What happens in your
bedroom stays in your bedroom.

31
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,361
I'm taking her salsa dancing.

32
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,397
She's Puerto Rican, in her
blood. And I have to work on it.

33
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,692
- Yes, you do.
- I do.

34
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,358
You should be dressed
before you start your shift.

35
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,131
I'm not on today. I'm
volunteering at Camp Del Corazon.

36
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,365
- Is that today?
- Camp Del what?

37
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,373
For kids who've had
open-heart surgery.

38
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,409
Kids with heart
disease running around?

39
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,240
We should get
some business here.

40
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,540
It's nothing strenuous.

41
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,241
Arts and crafts, face
painting, a little charades.

42
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,612
Excuse me. Cate, can we...?

43
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,779
I'm gonna go and check on him.

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,653
Felix Kirsch, found unconscious in
park. Scalp hematoma, blood from the ear.

45
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,555
- Trauma rooms are full.
- Curtain 2.

46
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,629
Started seizing.
Gave four of Ativan.

47
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,796
- Another two. Did he fall?
- Maybe mugged.

48
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,831
- Police there.
- Gotta consider cardiac...

49
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,129
metabolic and
toxicologic etiologies.

50
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,303
All right. That's more like it.

51
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,633
Um, I'll just start them off.

52
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,741
Ready. One, two, three.

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,345
Okay. Felix, open your
eyes, look at me, Felix.

54
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,981
He's postictal. Call parents?

55
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,844
- Didn't have time.
- Here's his ID.

56
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,349
Ruptured his eardrum.

57
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,009
I can come back after work.

58
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,248
Pupils equal and reactive.

59
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,187
You got everything under
control, I'm going to Pediatrics.

60
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,520
All right. Gram
of dilantin over 20.

61
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,196
How are you doing today? Hmm.

62
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,629
Did you get a
good night's sleep?

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,859
Did you?

64
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,196
Did you?

65
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,429
- He likes the rocker.
- Ah.

66
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,129
I want you to meet someone.

67
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,500
I want you to meet my
husband. His name's Russell.

68
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,975
- Hello.
- Wash your hands?

69
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,272
Yes.

70
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,216
Settle down, little man.

71
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,649
Settle down. Settle down.

72
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,983
You know what? He
seemed happier with you.

73
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,518
- Do you wanna take him?
- Oh, no, no, no.

74
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,718
No need to fuss.

75
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,328
- Okay.
- Russell's a good guy.

76
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,362
That's better.

77
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,194
That's better. Yeah.

78
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,336
He's tracking
objects with his eyes.

79
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,334
Mm-hm. And he smiles at people.

80
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,870
Yes, you do.

81
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,031
Yeah, developmental
milestones of a two-month old.

82
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,177
Ah. You're a very advanced
young man. Uh-huh.

83
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,451
My protective custodianship
is over when he's discharged.

84
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:40,814
Mm-hm.

85
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,719
If we're serious about adopting, we have
to take a state-certified parenting class.

86
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,057
When do we start? Huh?

87
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,665
We gonna start now.

88
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,594
Woo! Woo!

89
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,257
Hey, Archie.

90
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,800
- Archie Morris?
- Yeah.

91
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,471
I'm Vera.

92
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,039
Um, you need to
see the Big Kahuna.

93
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,043
- Okay.
- Kahuna, this is Archie.

94
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,940
Been looking forward
to meeting you.

95
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,446
Hey. Why don't you jump
in and, uh, follow my lead?

96
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,837
On second thought,
see that kid over there?

97
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,600
His name is Logan. See if
you can get him to join us.

98
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,342
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah. Over there.

99
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,679
Hey, Logan.

100
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,688
How's it going?

101
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,426
- Looks like fun out there.
- Lame.

102
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,865
I never cared much for, uh,
dancing when I was a kid either.

103
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:39,931
You play basketball?

104
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,369
No.

105
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,702
What do you like?

106
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,278
You're wasting your time, I
don't want to be here, okay?

107
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,642
My parents made me come.

108
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,442
Have you been
out of the country?

109
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,712
Uh, two months
ago. Machu Picchu.

110
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,049
I might not need
a scalpel, then.

111
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,715
- Kayson called about a biopsy.
- I'll call him back.

112
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,986
He faxed a report.

113
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,094
Thanks.

114
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,663
Hey, doc?

115
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,397
Do I need a tetanus shot?

116
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,372
If it's been more
than five years, yeah.

117
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,381
Oh, my God.

118
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,885
Bot fly larva. It's, uh,
endemic to South America.

119
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,922
Are...? Are they
taking over my body?

120
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,723
The fly lays eggs on you and
the larva burrows under the skin.

121
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,366
You'd know if there's more.

122
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,556
I'll be back.

123
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,363
Your bookshelves are empty.
- You need some artwork.

124
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,198
NEELA: <i>I'm still in boxes.</i>

125
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,001
<i>Way they're working me, it'll
be a year before I get settled in.</i>

126
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,605
Neela's showing us her office.

127
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,712
Hey, look, Simon's here.

128
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,609
<i>Hey, there. This is my new home.</i>

129
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,079
That's impressive.

130
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,684
<i>Oh, check this out.</i>

131
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,787
Wow, assistant
professor of surgery.

132
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:05,050
<i>We get residents from Tulane,
so I do have a faculty position.</i>

133
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,353
Well, I'll be sure
to tell Dubenko.

134
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,462
<i>I brought the stuff
you wanted from home.</i>

135
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,256
<i>- Who are you talking to?
- County.</i>

136
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,455
<i>Yeah?</i>

137
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,134
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>
- Hi, Ray.

138
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,360
Ray.

139
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,938
<i>Um, I'm gonna be late for the
OR, I just wanted to check in.</i>

140
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,099
- Call anytime.
- Yeah, we miss you.

141
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,437
Take care.

142
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,079
<i>Bye.</i>

143
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,879
Yeah.

144
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,218
Rule of the friendship bracelet
is you can't keep it for yourself.

145
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,552
You have to give it to
someone really special.

146
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,820
Who are you giving
yours to, Xena?

147
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,691
I haven't decided yet.

148
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,798
You can give it to your husband.

149
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,492
I don't have one of those.

150
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,797
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Not right now.

151
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,065
You?

152
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,443
A boyfriend? Pfft. Yeah, right.

153
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,478
- Why not?
- Guys tend to avoid me.

154
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,584
What? Come on. You're
pretty and you're smart.

155
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,845
I'm a freak with
scars and a bad heart.

156
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,980
I had a cardiac arrest in class and
the paramedics had to give me CPR.

157
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,126
It's kind of a
buzzkill to the guys.

158
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,455
That and my
internal defibrillator.

159
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,621
- What's your heart defect?
- Tetrology of fallot.

160
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,790
- So you had a BT shunt?
- Mm-hm.

161
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,801
I had hypoplastic
left-heart syndrome.

162
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,099
I needed a Norwood, Glenn
and Fontan before my transplant.

163
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,266
You know, the great thing
about camp is that we all fit in.

164
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,309
You don't have to
worry about your scar.

165
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,505
Just be yourself and go crazy.

166
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,850
Come on. Let's make
those. Let's make those.

167
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,550
Woo! Nice shot, nice shot.

168
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,130
What's up, Xena?

169
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,698
Nothing, just a
little arts and crafts.

170
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,960
Oh, I gotta cool down.

171
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,400
Emily, you wanna
check out the slime slide?

172
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,632
Um, I, uh, have to get
something from my backpack.

173
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,470
- Is she not supposed to exercise?
- She's in good shape.

174
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,274
This is her first time at camp. Her
parents don't let her do very much.

175
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,578
- Thread to 40 centimeters.
- All right, needle's out. OpSite.

176
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,885
We'll titrate to 10 cc's an
hour. You did great, Felix.

177
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,721
This is Dr. Kirsch, Felix's dad.

178
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,300
- Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.
- I'm Dr. Banfield, we spoke.

179
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,364
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

180
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,734
- Are you a physician?
- No, physics professor.

181
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,503
At the world-famous
Enrico Fermi Institute.

182
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,770
Are you okay?

183
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,744
- How'd you hit your head so hard?
- I don't remember.

184
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,351
Trying to figure out if he fell
or something made him faint.

185
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:49,080
I've heard that, uh, sometimes
sleep deprivation can lead to seizures.

186
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,279
It can.

187
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,052
He was up all last week
burning the midnight oil.

188
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,717
But he aced all his midterms.

189
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,821
Indeed, I did.

190
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,260
You wanna have a seat?

191
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,026
Thank you.

192
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,366
Yeah, it could be a while
before they take him upstairs.

193
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,440
"How much of human
life is lost in waiting?"

194
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,077
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

195
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,472
- We'll be back.
- Okay if I take him to Curtains?

196
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,707
Uh, that'll be fine.

197
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,916
Can you imagine
having a dad like that?

198
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,487
I like him. He's
concerned, devoted.

199
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,647
Think about the
pressure that kid's under.

200
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,157
Fits the profile. Acting
out, doing drugs.

201
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,226
We'll check it
out, but I doubt it.

202
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,387
I'll have Psych come
for an assessment.

203
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,157
Knock yourself out.

204
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,234
Dr. Banfield, there's
someone's here to see you.

205
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,461
Hmm.

206
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,266
That's, uh, Megan.

207
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,977
I dropped off a baby
a couple weeks ago.

208
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,670
I remember.

209
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,246
I can't sleep at night.

210
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,814
The baby's doing fine.

211
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,816
- He is?
- Yes.

212
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,511
He's well taken care of.

213
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,586
Are you all right?

214
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,790
No. No.

215
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,456
I made a mistake. I want
him back. I wanna keep him.

216
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,172
My mom says she can help.

217
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:25,012
I'll be getting a check from
the state, so we'll be okay.

218
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,980
What about high school?

219
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,054
I can go back.

220
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,519
You know, being a
mom isn't so easy.

221
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,425
I see girls younger
than me doing it.

222
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,230
You're sure about this?

223
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,777
Okay, I'll talk to our social
worker. But, uh, it might be a while.

224
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,742
I'll wait.

225
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:02,419
Megan, you know...
You just seem confused.

226
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,081
Are you sure you don't
wanna think about this more?

227
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,227
I already have.

228
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:14,429
I made a bad decision and
I just wanna do what's right.

229
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,035
So there's a tear
in the dura mater.

230
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,643
Outermost, toughest of the
three meninges covering the brain.

231
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,108
- AP Biology.
- Okay.

232
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,214
You're gonna be on bed
rest for five days till it heals.

233
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,748
I canceled my appointments,
but I've got classes.

234
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,579
- Okay if I'm back at 6?
- No problem.

235
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,381
- I'm not going anywhere.
- All right.

236
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,914
Cell phone's on. See you, kiddo.

237
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,320
Okay.

238
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,427
What do you remember
about this morning?

239
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,086
I cut through the park
on my way to school.

240
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,426
Sometimes I jump
over these rocks.

241
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,623
I guess I slipped.

242
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,564
Anything else?

243
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,797
So tell me, how does a
freshman end up in AP Biology?

244
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,499
All my classes are AP.

245
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,809
Sounds like a lot of stress.

246
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,139
Not really.

247
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,248
You been sad lately?

248
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,745
Alex on line two.
Says it's important.

249
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,945
After a concussion, as time
goes by, you start to remember.

250
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,988
Make sure to tell
me if that happens.

251
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,286
- I've got something to tell you.
- All right.

252
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,951
Hello.

253
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,921
What do you mean it doesn't fit?

254
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,362
I specifically ordered
for a '65 dashboard.

255
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,592
How was camp?

256
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,568
Amazing. I wish I
could stay all day.

257
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,468
I'll call for a return
authorization.

258
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,699
No, they were not supposed
to send a six-CD changer.

259
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,504
Okay. Okay, bye.

260
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,805
Getting a new stereo?

261
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,210
No, actually, my...
My car got broken into.

262
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,282
Oh, I'm sorry.

263
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,514
Oh, P.D. has some new info.

264
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,782
Witnesses saw a fight in Lincoln
Park where they found your kid.

265
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,154
At least four teenagers
grabbing and shoving each other.

266
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,351
- Frank.
- Thanks.

267
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,020
- What's Neela doing on your computer?
- A screen shot.

268
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,291
- You missed her video chat.
- Oh, how is she?

269
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,901
Never thought she'd be
happy in Louisiana, I was wrong.

270
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,799
She looks good, she sounds good.

271
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,302
Three new ones to present.

272
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,464
Why am I the only
attending on the floor?

273
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,736
Good afternoon. Hedda
Lanford, 24 weeks pregnant.

274
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,072
Congratulations.

275
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,340
- Left-leg pain and swelling.
- It got so bad, I couldn't walk.

276
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,814
- Any shortness of breath?
- No, just the leg.

277
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,680
- Good vitals.
- Okay. Trauma 2.

278
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,322
Paramedics are five
minutes out with a hot MI.

279
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,186
Call the cath lab and
grab me when they're here.

280
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,021
Has the baby been moving?
- Mm-hm.

281
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,823
Maybe a little less, but I
could be imagining things.

282
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,864
Let's get some fetal heart
tones and prep the SonoSite.

283
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,501
- Simon?
- Yeah?

284
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,933
- Want me to take her upstairs?
- What for?

285
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,164
After 20 weeks, we
like to send them to OB.

286
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,433
Baby's viable, they
get better monitoring.

287
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,701
If she had belly pain.

288
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,243
- They can check her leg.
- We'll do a better job.

289
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,881
Worried about a clot,
Mom comes first, not baby.

290
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,414
Then she needs an NST.

291
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,347
So get a fetal monitor.

292
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,111
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

293
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,480
You seem a little...

294
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,285
I'm looking after 40
patients by myself.

295
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,585
Set up a duplex scan.

296
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,921
Keep going, man.

297
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,127
Good job.

298
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,393
Wow, this is pretty cool.

299
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,637
It's a baby wall. I've been
up one twice that size.

300
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,312
You wanna race me to the top?

301
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,380
- I'll give you 10 bucks if you win.
- Think you can bribe me?

302
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,915
- That is so pathetic.
- No, I can't.

303
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,746
It's not as hard as it looks.

304
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,399
- I don't want to.
- It's... It's fun.

305
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,819
- Hey. What's going on?
- She's afraid to try.

306
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,084
You know what?

307
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,854
Have you ever have a
dream where you were flying?

308
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,997
What was it like?

309
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,294
Don't look at the
ground. One more step.

310
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,604
Yeah, I'm... Yeah,
I'm coming down, guys.

311
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,330
No. Keep going.

312
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,565
Okay.

313
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,466
I'm gonna keep going.

314
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:49,014
Oh, no. I don't think
I can do this. Yeah.

315
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,819
- We did it!
- Yeah!

316
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,184
- You got it. MORRIS:
Two, three. Woo-hoo.

317
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,488
Yeah. Good job, Emily.

318
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,459
- You too.
- Hey.

319
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,858
All right, who's next?

320
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,961
- That was awesome.
- Oh.

321
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,274
Hey.

322
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,317
Russ. I got some bad news.

323
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,886
Definite DVT, there's a
large blood clot in the thigh.

324
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,118
How does that happen?

325
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,626
As the uterus grows, it
presses the pelvic veins.

326
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,788
Pregnancy makes the
blood more coagulable.

327
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,662
We need to treat you with a
blood thinner called heparin.

328
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,496
- Is that safe for the baby?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,467
Sure? Took us
years to get pregnant.

330
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:46,901
Doesn't cross the placenta.

331
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,133
What if you don't give it to me?

332
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:54,005
A piece of the clot could break
off and travel to your lungs.

333
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,945
- It's called a pulmonary embolism.
- And you can die.

334
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,812
Um, my brother-in-law's an OB. Do
you mind if we discuss this with him?

335
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,389
- That's a good idea.
- I think we're wasting time.

336
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,517
This is a no-brainer. Heparin's safe. It'll
save your life, save your baby's life.

337
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:13,064
- So let's prep a 5000-unit bolus, please.
- Excuse me.

338
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,359
Hey. Hey.

339
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,405
- What is their problem?
- They just need a little time.

340
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:24,408
Banfield can deal with them because
I'm supposed to go to this heart camp.

341
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,409
Oh, they're gonna love
you with that attitude.

342
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,941
Well, maybe I won't go.

343
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,085
Look, I know it's a hard time.

344
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,081
It'll get better.

345
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,620
- What are you talking about?
- Neela.

346
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,690
Neela? Look, Sam, tell your
gossip circle not to worry.

347
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,887
I've moved on
and I'm fine. Okay?

348
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,740
- You really need me here?
- You're my designated runner.

349
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,131
Okay. On my way.

350
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,999
Oh, oh... Oh, no, no...

351
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,476
Okay. Okay.

352
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,134
All right. Two down.

353
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,076
- Bases loaded.
- Bring me home, baby.

354
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,943
Bring me home, Vera.

355
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,742
Yeah.

356
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,649
Make the play. Make
the play. Bring it in.

357
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,949
We could get a grand
slam. Bring it home.

358
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,420
- What happened?
- Vera, are you okay?

359
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,759
Okay. What's going on, honey?

360
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,265
- My defibrillator's firing.
- Let me check the carotid.

361
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,765
I think she's in V-tach.

362
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,237
- Somebody help her.
- What's wrong with her?

363
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,845
Now do a Hennepin
with him sitting up.

364
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,242
Back in the socket.

365
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,408
All right. Immobilizer
and post-reduction film.

366
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,749
When we lived in San Diego, I
saw a surfer throw his shoulder out.

367
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,025
- San Diego's nice.
- We were there for about two years.

368
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,957
- Hmm, how long have you lived here?
- Since September.

369
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,329
Are you having any eye pain?

370
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,965
Archie, I know I volunteered, but
if you've got enough help, then...

371
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,798
We're completely
short-staffed now.

372
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,270
- You need to get over there.
- This is not necessary.

373
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,170
Good, it's not
gonna take very long.

374
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,834
- ICD discharge. TAGGART:
You want a 12 lead?

375
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,141
I gotta grab the programmer,
we're gonna interrogate.

376
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,683
- Who is that?
- The Big Kahuna.

377
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,013
Chief of Pediatric
Cardiology at Rush.

378
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,382
- He runs the camp.
- Normal sinus, 84.

379
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,182
Okay, send lytes and a troponin.

380
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,521
- Hey, I'm Vera.
- Felix.

381
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,186
- What happened?
- I have a defibrillator in my chest.

382
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,490
Cool.

383
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,327
Ha. I think it shocked
me by accident.

384
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,402
- Did it hurt?
- A little, ha. Like a horse kicked me.

385
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,467
Hey, Rojo, Xena. Um, can you
call and tell them I'm all right?

386
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,302
Rojo? Xena?

387
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,911
Vera says she's fine and
she'll be back really soon.

388
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,352
- You ready?
- Okay.

389
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,683
We all have to get from
this side to the other side...

390
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,154
without going through
the same hole twice.

391
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,886
- Can I go first?
- Sure. Go ahead.

392
00:19:58,898 --> 00:19:59,991
Huh, wow.

393
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,397
It's like Cirque du Soleil.

394
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,537
Good job!

395
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,264
Don't touch the web.

396
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,666
Hey.

397
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,175
What?

398
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:16,509
Well, if everyone goes through
the web, it kind of builds a team.

399
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:17,773
That's stupid.

400
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,782
He doesn't have to
if he doesn't want to.

401
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,922
It would mean a lot to
the kids if you'd join in.

402
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,149
It wouldn't mean a lot to me.

403
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,720
Why don't you do it for them?

404
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,088
You really want me
to go to the other side?

405
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,664
Yeah.

406
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,129
I did it.

407
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,866
Look at me, I'm
on the other side.

408
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,634
Bingo.

409
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,540
That'll tell you
if it was V-tach?

410
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,908
This will tell us everything.

411
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,214
Oh. Excuse me. KAHUNA: Mm-hm.

412
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,219
Felix is getting a bed at 7.

413
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,119
- How's your headache?
- It's better.

414
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,455
- How'd you get a name like Felix?
- After Felix Bloch.

415
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,326
A physicist who won the Nobel
Prize for nuclear magnetic resonance.

416
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,401
- Like in MRI scans.
- Yeah. His work led to that.

417
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,333
He was a giant. Studied with
Heisenberg and Schrodinger.

418
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,565
Schrodinger had a cat.

419
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,403
- You know about that?
- He didn't actually have a cat.

420
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,908
It was a thought experiment.

421
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,947
Uh, the cat in the box was either alive
or dead depending on a random event.

422
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,812
- Okay, I am completely confused.
- That makes two of us.

423
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,580
Great news, it was
just a sinus attack.

424
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,121
When you ran, your
pulse rate went up to 180.

425
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,622
That means she can go back?

426
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,455
Well, she got shocked six times.

427
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,654
So I think we gotta
keep you in the hospital.

428
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,992
I'm not getting admitted.
Not during camp.

429
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,625
Honey, this thing zapped
you at a heart rate of 160.

430
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,739
- So if you exert yourself at all...
- Why don't you set it higher?

431
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,140
That's a good idea.

432
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,369
We can do that.

433
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,309
Okay.

434
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,609
Okay, no shocks until 200.

435
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,880
But only till after the
dance, all right? Huh?

436
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,521
Two weeks later, she can walk
in the door like nothing happened?

437
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,128
- That's what she did.
- There must be a time limit.

438
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,992
- There isn't.
- She's in high school.

439
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,531
We are in a better position
to care for that baby.

440
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,864
- That isn't the issue.
- We have resources, we have a home...

441
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,063
we have maturity.
Doesn't that count?

442
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,400
She's his mother. That
counts more than anything.

443
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,476
It's not a done deal.

444
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,545
The case worker still has to
talk to the mom and grandmother.

445
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,545
Take a week for
the determination.

446
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:33,174
- You let me know how that goes.
- Russ. Come on.

447
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,013
You know the system.

448
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,756
There's something else to do.

449
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,654
We keep working, we keep
praying, and we keep going.

450
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,022
I've been doing
that for seven years.

451
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,188
There you go.

452
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,893
They really need me, I
have to cancel tonight.

453
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,497
You could come down here.

454
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,268
You would?

455
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,602
Really? Do you own...?
Do you own a sleeping bag?

456
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,074
It was nice to meet
you. I'll see you around.

457
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,873
Yeah.

458
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,575
You could take
Felix to the dance.

459
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,877
It's only for kids who've
had open-heart surgery.

460
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,111
- Has an open skull fracture.
- That's close.

461
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,687
Not to mention a catheter
in his spinal column.

462
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,290
He has to stay on bed rest.

463
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,949
Let me see what I can do.

464
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,459
So how's it going in here?

465
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,455
Okay.

466
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,627
Doctor Gates, would
you take a seat?

467
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,263
I... I... I get very frustrated, because
I like to get to the bottom of things.

468
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,906
I need to know the truth.

469
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,237
Did you know Felix's parents
have to move every year or two?

470
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,404
Academic careers,
new universities.

471
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,642
Doesn't give you much
chance to put down roots.

472
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:42,447
- Make friends.
- When you feel like an outsider...

473
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,420
sometimes you fall in with
kids who do dangerous things.

474
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,322
- Like drugs.
- My urine test was negative.

475
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,258
You have Tardieu's spots...

476
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,462
little red dots near your eyes.

477
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,998
Maybe you don't remember...

478
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,796
but it can happen when
someone tries to choke you.

479
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,473
Felix?

480
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,941
Felix.

481
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,179
Did someone grab
you around the neck?

482
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,417
Not the neck.

483
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,990
The chest.

484
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,697
It's called
suffocation roulette.

485
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,390
You hold your breath and
someone squeezes you from behind.

486
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,766
The first one to pass out loses.

487
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,372
Kids die from playing that game.

488
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,838
Or get brain damage.

489
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,510
You're too smart a
kid to be doing that.

490
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,812
They're my friends.

491
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,181
Dr. Banfield, need you
in Trauma 2 right away.

492
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,386
My pregnant DVT lady has
sudden-onset chest pain.

493
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,047
- On heparin?
- For the past hour.

494
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,023
- What's her pressure?
- 110 over 65. Already did an EKG.

495
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,791
- Tell me about your pain.
- It hurts when I take a breath.

496
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,730
- Could a clot have gone to her lung?
- I would say, yes.

497
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,837
There's new right axis
deviation, and an S1, Q3.

498
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,837
- She's on heparin.
- It's not a perfect drug.

499
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,340
- What do we do now?
- We could try TPA.

500
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,139
It's a powerful clot-busting medicine.
If it works, she's back to normal...

501
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,872
with only a 1 percent risk.

502
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,177
- What about the baby? BANFIELD:
There are no good studies.

503
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,549
TPA definitely carries a risk
of miscarriage or fetal death.

504
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,347
- How big a risk?
- Ten percent, maybe more.

505
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,322
Oh, God.

506
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,189
What about a vena cava filter?

507
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,763
If we put a filter in
your main vein here...

508
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,434
we could prevent future clots
from traveling to your lung.

509
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:39,834
- But it takes time.
- We... We don't want to hurt the baby.

510
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,997
What would you do?

511
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,671
I don't care.

512
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,008
I don't care if we have
to stay here all day.

513
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,775
No, me neither.

514
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,419
They keep bugging me
to play their stupid games.

515
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,748
They don't get it.
They don't understand.

516
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,520
We could flush some
tennis balls down the toilets.

517
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,561
That would back
them up for days.

518
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,596
Or...

519
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,701
I know where there's
spray paint. We could tag...

520
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:14,203
"camp sucks" all over
the walls of the gym. Huh?

521
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:18,606
Or we can pull fire alarms and
make them evacuate all the patients.

522
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:26,886
Or we can... We can just
sit here and do nothing.

523
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:30,887
You think I'm being a jerk.

524
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,914
No.

525
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,585
I think that you're not letting
yourself have a good time.

526
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,455
It's not a good time.

527
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,658
Because Sean's not here.

528
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,264
Sean?

529
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:52,736
I met him in September,
we were in for heart caths.

530
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,574
We both had truncus arteriosus.

531
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,951
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

532
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:05,417
Since we were babies, we had the same
operations and were on the same meds.

533
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,322
He had never been to camp.

534
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,759
I kept telling him
how great it was.

535
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,628
We made plans, we
talked and texted every day.

536
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,802
He thought he could win
the Kahuna's fart contest.

537
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,207
We were gonna have so much fun.

538
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:27,871
He had to go to surgery last
week for a conduit replacement.

539
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,074
Died on the table.

540
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,850
Logan, I'm sorry.

541
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,626
Hello.

542
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,307
Yeah, I know. I know. I'll...
I'll... I'll be there as soon as I can.

543
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,672
Not a good week all around.

544
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,408
What?

545
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,316
A good friend of
mine is in the ICU.

546
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,358
Uh...

547
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,630
I tried really hard to get
her a heart transplant...

548
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,327
but now she's back in rejection.

549
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,026
It's pretty bad.

550
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,737
What are you doing here?

551
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:33,538
Well, I... I stopped
by, but she's in a coma.

552
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,343
I've been intubated
like 10 times.

553
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:41,510
When I'm deeply sedated,
I can hear everything.

554
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,155
I can even tell
who's in the room.

555
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,260
She'll know if you're there.

556
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,760
Trached a month ago
for myasthenia gravis.

557
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,958
Bleeding this morning,
opened up in Triage.

558
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,899
Tracheo-innominate fistula
from pressure necrosis.

559
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,439
- Four units of O-neg.
- Have Thoracic Surgery hold an OR.

560
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,634
Pouring out faster
than we can transfuse.

561
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,780
Overinflate the trach cuff.
That can tamponade the bleeder.

562
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,381
You want the rapid infuser?
- Absolutely.

563
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,985
This isn't helping. More
air and I'll burst the cuff.

564
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,313
A number four Shiley.

565
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,286
- That's a pediatric size.
- Wait and see.

566
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,255
HemoCue is only eight-point-two.

567
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,389
Now put your finger
in the trach hole...

568
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,797
and compress against
the posterior sternum.

569
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,266
- Like this?
- Well done.

570
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,598
- Now get your ass up to the OR.
- Thank you.

571
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:38,637
We took her to Radiology for the
filter, crashed before they started.

572
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,780
BP 70 palp, tachy to 120.
You may need to intubate her.

573
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,006
Wait, what's going on?

574
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,248
Likely it's another blood clot.
We need to think about TPA.

575
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,650
We don't want it. Don't
want to hurt the baby.

576
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,016
Things have changed.

577
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,852
No, honey, honey.
Honey, honey, talk to me.

578
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,018
Honey, I need your
help here. Wait.

579
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:59,357
What are you doing? Wait,
What...? What...? What are you doing?

580
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,497
Baby looks great.

581
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:12,736
Placenta is perfect.
No sign of bleeding.

582
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,140
Thank you.

583
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,306
And the clot in your lung
has completely dissolved.

584
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,548
I thought I was
gonna lose both of you.

585
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,711
Well, we like it
when things work out.

586
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,554
Dr. Banfield, you gave
TPA without consent.

587
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,320
Yes, I did.

588
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,623
Well, what if there had
been a bad outcome?

589
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,393
She's young and healthy
and was about to die.

590
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,628
Do I need consent to shock her
heart if she has cardiac arrest?

591
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,169
I guess you got lucky.

592
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,368
- You saved that lady?
- Yep. And her baby too.

593
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,706
Uh, I'll get these to the lab.

594
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,872
- You're still here?
- That guy with the bleeding neck?

595
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,540
He's okay after surgery.

596
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,447
Is there someplace
we could talk?

597
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,714
In here.

598
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,900
What's on your mind?

599
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,677
I've been thinking
about it and...

600
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,439
I want him to be proud of me.

601
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,744
Yes.

602
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,224
To do that, though, I'd want
to make something of myself.

603
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:40,393
You know, be somebody
who did something important.

604
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,397
Like you.

605
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,232
Like me?

606
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,100
Make a difference, you know?

607
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,602
That's a good goal.

608
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,843
I don't know if I'd really be able
to do that if I quit school right now.

609
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:06,217
Having a kid's
gonna be really hard.

610
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,158
That's true.

611
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,432
The nurses told me you
were the custodian of the baby.

612
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,102
Does that mean you
wanted to adopt him?

613
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,050
My husband and I
were thinking about it.

614
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,064
I'm just scared I'll
never see him again.

615
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,567
That... That doesn't
have to happen.

616
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,634
You can watch him grow up...

617
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,411
get to know him,
be part of his life.

618
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,079
It's called an open adoption.

619
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,080
How do we do that?

620
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,553
I... I... If we all agree,
we can work it out.

621
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,343
- What is taking so long?
- Uh, give us two minutes.

622
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,783
Yeah, I'm timing you.

623
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,253
Tony, we're on next. We
didn't do a sound check.

624
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,449
Just start without us.

625
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,117
- Go on, I'll wait.
- All right.

626
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,556
Archie.

627
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,960
Hey. I'm so glad you're here.

628
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,559
His name is Rojo. Who are you?

629
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,034
Uh, this is my friend Claudia.

630
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,696
- Do you have a scar?
- A big one.

631
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,307
From here to here.

632
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,535
What do you think?

633
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,479
- Hey, beautiful.
- Looking good there, Felix.

634
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,082
- It's good to be the king.
- All right, let's go.

635
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,698
Hello, is this thing on?

636
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,115
All right, hello, Chicago.

637
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,151
Yeah.

638
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,016
Prepare to be blown away.

639
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,192
I have one question.

640
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,028
How are you feeling out there?
- Good!

641
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:08,139
I can't hear you. I
said, how you feeling?

642
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,501
Good!

643
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,776
Hey, Rojo, how're you feeling?

644
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,540
Wow!

645
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,797
- Doctor Brenner.
- Hey.

646
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,569
What are we stopping here for?

647
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,611
Checking on a patient.

648
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,819
You people have some
very unusual therapies.

649
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,286
Seem quite effective.

650
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,102
All right, shh.

651
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,264
Everybody's sleeping.

652
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,974
Room 209.

653
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,442
- Can I stay for a little while?
- We'll be quiet.

654
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,944
You need to get back to camp.

655
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,310
Visiting hours were
over three hours ago.

656
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,952
Yeah, but you
can say good night.

657
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,189
- Good night.
- Night.

658
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,519
Good luck, Felix.

659
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,991
All right, hey, give
them some privacy.

660
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,262
Quite a day today, huh?

661
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,371
Yeah.

662
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,469
Oh, thank you for coming
out to dinner with my mom.

663
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,802
You're welcome.

664
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,172
It took the heat off
of me. She loves you.

665
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,337
Well...

666
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,481
Wanna go to her colonoscopy
with me next week?

667
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,316
Excuse me? Privacy?

668
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,311
Hey!

669
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,045
Busted.

670
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:45,588
Back to your tent.

671
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:49,558
Boys stay on the
boys' side. Got that?

672
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,494
Let me know if you
hear anything out there.

673
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,161
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

674
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,264
- You thirsty?
- No.

675
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:07,868
- Ah. You hungry?
- Ugh, I had too many s'mores.

676
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,107
Not quite as good as Charlie
Trotter's would have been.

677
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,080
- This was way more fun.
- Really?

678
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,947
Definitely.

679
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,349
You are something else.

680
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:21,186
You went from a night on the town
to a night in a pup tent without a hitch.

681
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,555
Ah. Life's too short to whine.

682
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,094
It is.

683
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,598
You know, you spend a day
with these kids, you realize...

684
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,380
This... This is
totally random...

685
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:55,726
but sometimes I
imagine a night...

686
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,294
in the future.

687
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:09,302
A night where I would take you out,
spend money, make a deal about it.

688
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,755
And it would end like this.

689
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,527
When I ask you to marry me.

690
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,793
What do you think?

691
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,768
I think I'd say yes.

692
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,014
Dr. Morris.

693
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,785
I can't fall asleep.

694
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,395
Yeah, she's never been
to a sleepover before.

695
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,655
She's homesick.

696
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,664
Well, what do you...?
What do you need, Em?

697
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,701
My dad tells me a
bedtime story every night.

698
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,804
Not a problem. All right.

699
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,809
Okay, let me see.

700
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,210
All right, once upon a time...

701
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,153
there was a little blood cell...

702
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,357
who couldn't find
his way to the lungs.

703
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,358
Now, he was... He
was blue all the time...

704
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,655
but he wished that he was red.

705
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,061
He needs a Rastelli operation.

706
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,256
What?

707
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,561
No, no, no. A Blalock-Taussig.

708
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:45,999
He has tetrology.

709
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,901
Hey, who's telling
this story anyway, huh?

710
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,377
Three ounces down the hatch.

711
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:01,383
How about a nice
burp for Russell?

712
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,213
Uh-huh.

713
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:08,616
Oh.

714
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,090
That was a good one.

715
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,859
That was a quick one.

716
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,368
Here we go. High-five. Yes.

717
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,132
Now, tomorrow, we gonna
work on that fist bump, okay?

718
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,438
Aw.

719
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:33,050
There we go, there
we go. There we go.

720
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,090
There we go.
