00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,339
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,374
- Hi, Mom.
- Do I know you?

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,980
You were gonna stay until we got
her settled into the nursing home.

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,170
I can't, Sammy.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,443
- This is my new partner, Ed.
- I hear you're looking out for her.

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,553
- She looks out for herself.
- It festers in you.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,211
You know it's wrong.

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,880
You... You need to talk
to somebody about this.

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,585
Well, what was it like when you were
a kid? You never talk about that stuff.

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,287
I was barely living
before I met you.

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,866
I need a kidney, and I came
back to the States to get on the list.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,936
Good job today.
Like you never left.

13
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,879
Sit?

14
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,506
Do you want me to sit?

15
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,207
- Yeah. We're rolling.
- Okay.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,516
It's a little warm in here.

17
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,749
Must be the, uh...

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,191
All right. So you guys
started yesterday, huh?

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,557
You can relax, Dr. Carter.

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,065
And you're interested
in, what? Life in the ER?

21
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,227
We're documenting
the challenges...

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,033
of emergency care
in the 21st century.

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,334
And you wanna know what?

24
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:19,209
About you. The people
who work here. What you do.

25
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,677
Okay.

26
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,510
How long have been at County?

27
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,210
I started about 15 years ago.

28
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,356
That's actually kind
of hard to believe.

29
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,290
Wow.

30
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,894
- Can you focus here?
- Yep.

31
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,224
Oh, here? Yep.

32
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,791
Sorry.

33
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,733
Oh, uh, I was a med
student then and, uh...

34
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,237
Well, the thing that you realize
pretty soon is that you see it all...

35
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,968
you see the whole spectrum
of human experience.

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,208
Does that sound
a little pretentious?

37
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,114
It did, right? So pretent...

38
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,484
Uh, well, you guys are
gonna probably... Anyway.

39
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,987
- Go on.
- Yeah? Good?

40
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,054
Um, well, whatever you
can imagine, it happens here.

41
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:13,724
Sometimes you're there for the
end, and that part never gets easier.

42
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,898
Uh, it can be the
loneliest place in the world.

43
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,903
Or where you go
for a second chance.

44
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:33,415
And every once in a while, if
you're smart, or lucky, maybe...

45
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,348
you find exactly what
you need right here.

46
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,693
- Come on, you can be a little late.
- No, I can't.

47
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,526
- What's so important?
- Um, a murder investigation?

48
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,360
Oh, that's the best
you can come up with?

49
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,730
Ha, ha, you're cute.

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,863
Hey, did you mean what you said?

51
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,338
You hate the way this
place is decorated?

52
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,137
You're a man, okay?
Just get rid of the futon.

53
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,471
I love that futon.

54
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,637
What's with this paint?
It's like shades of feces.

55
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,534
- You know, that's all I'm saying.
- Ha, ha.

56
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,447
I was a bachelor
till very recently.

57
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,951
Don't worry, Archie.
I'll whip you into shape.

58
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,723
<i>The one thing that
you keep learning...</i>

59
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,054
is that you can never think
that you know what's coming.

60
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,230
<i>Because when the rig rolls
up and the doors pop open...</i>

61
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,167
<i>you have no idea what's inside.</i>

62
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,777
Diaz? Diaz? Talk to me.

63
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,248
10-1, 10-1. B5412,
my partner's been shot.

64
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,583
I'm at 2549 West Harrison,
third floor, rear landing.

65
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:20,023
Returned fire, officer needs assistance.
10-1, 10-1, officer needs assistance.

66
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,388
So the only rule is...

67
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,259
- Dr. Carter?
- Never relax.

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,300
Sorry to interrupt. Two
GSWs, five minutes out.

69
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,232
One's a detective,
multiple wounds.

70
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,430
All right. Set up both trauma
rooms and call for some O-neg.

71
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,941
I gotta go. Ahem.

72
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,805
Uh, can we finish this later?

73
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,880
Yeah. If you can find me.

74
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,920
The most common
thing I see? That's easy.

75
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,120
Rectal insertions.

76
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,320
Seriously.

77
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,899
I say "stat"... Yeah, I
say "stat" quite often.

78
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:07,268
This guy, he was, um, high on PCP
but he was, like, over seven feet tall...

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,671
and we had him strapped
down on a gurney.

80
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,573
I mean, the funny part is,
is that it doesn't matter...

81
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:17,844
if it's a shampoo bottle, a
light bulb, a whisk, whatever...

82
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,954
they always tell you the
same story: "I fell on it."

83
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,817
Thoracotomy, stat, ha, ha.

84
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,252
"I fell on it"?

85
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,290
And that guy got up...

86
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,328
and he had the gurney
strapped to his back, ha, ha...

87
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,262
and he was chasing us
all up and down the hall.

88
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,124
Men.

89
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,602
People in Australia can
understand me, which is good.

90
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,207
I've got an accent.
Yes I have, um...

91
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,642
"Just clerks"? Those were
his words. "Just clerks"?

92
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,546
He said that we didn't count as
emergency healthcare providers.

93
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,483
- "He"? Who is "he"?
- The writer, I think?

94
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,385
Of a documentary?
Documentaries have writers?

95
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,789
- Well, he pieces it together or something.
- "Pieces it together."

96
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,921
- That's what's wrong with television.
- He seemed like a pipsqueak to me.

97
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,061
So you've met him?

98
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,634
He interviewed us yesterday.

99
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,939
The nurses? Got their own day?

100
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,439
Get over it, Frank.
We go to school for this.

101
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:22,071
That's it. If they can make their
own stupid reality show, so can I.

102
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,444
Can't argue with that.

103
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,745
Uh, I... I don't think
that's such a good idea.

104
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,151
Here. Press and point. You
know how to work these things.

105
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:34,022
Okay, okay, but there's nothing wrong
with a life lived out of the spotlight.

106
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,797
A stack of files, a broken
stapler, a three-hole punch.

107
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,698
But lives are saved
and lost right here.

108
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,873
It's a desk, Frank.

109
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,975
Admit, the nerve
center of the ER.

110
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,278
What you're about to see is a document
of those who serve as the gatekeepers.

111
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,315
My name is Martin, Frank Martin.

112
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,712
Jerry Markovic.

113
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,219
The few, the proud...
The desk clerks.

114
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,524
That film crew get to you yet?

115
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,495
They just asked me boring questions
about the effect of the economy.

116
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,464
The effect is that
people get poor...

117
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,194
then they use guns to get
money, the ER stays busy.

118
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,998
Now you tell me.
What we getting?

119
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,970
- I heard officer down.
- Detective.

120
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,235
- How'd he get shot?
- He's a she.

121
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,378
This one's ours.
Perp's coming behind.

122
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:29,073
- Okay, we got this one.
- Claudia Diaz. I think you guys know her.

123
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,378
- She and Morris have a thing.
- A thing? Is that what it is?

124
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,713
What happened here?

125
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,379
Son of a bitch shot me
when I was walking away.

126
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,580
I bit my damn tongue.

127
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,385
Lucky you had your vest on.

128
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,891
I feel real lucky right now.

129
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,189
Here's the shooter.
Took multiple shots.

130
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,389
Get chest and abdominal
films. Type and cross...

131
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,495
- Type and cross for four.
- You all right, boss?

132
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,434
- Yeah. Work on access when we get in.
- Does Archie know?

133
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,164
My partner's still on the scene.

134
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,776
- He said he'd call him.
- I'll try to, just to be sure.

135
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,570
Thank you for
bringing breakfast.

136
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,941
You know, this is
nice, what you're doing.

137
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,173
Oh, you like it?

138
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,912
You know, I was torn between an
eggshell white and something bolder.

139
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,488
Like a robin-egg type thing.

140
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,952
I sound gay. Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

141
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,788
You're nervous.

142
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,693
Well, it's kind of risky, asking her
to move in. Maybe she'll say no.

143
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,768
I think any girl would appreciate
a guy willing to repaint for her.

144
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,440
How are things going with
the Wonder From Down Under?

145
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,975
Good, I guess.

146
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,306
As long as we don't talk much.

147
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,209
Typical guy.

148
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,079
Fellas have to have your
deepest thoughts and feelings...

149
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,312
pried from your cold,
dead fingers, but...

150
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,920
Still, he's hard to figure.

151
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,425
Well, it's understandable.

152
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,827
You know, with what
happened to him as a kid.

153
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,762
I told him he needs
to see somebody.

154
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,097
You know, if you've been hurt
like that, you know, sexually...

155
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,173
at a young age, it doesn't
just go away on its own.

156
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:07,311
Well, it's, um, good
he confides in you.

157
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,848
It's been hard for him moving to
Chicago. There's you and there's me.

158
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,180
That's basically his whole circle
of friends. Real ones, anyway.

159
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,582
Right.

160
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,798
Wait, you didn't...?

161
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,131
- He never told you?
- It, um...

162
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,603
- Neela, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- It explains a lot, um...

163
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,134
I have get to work by 9.

164
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,335
We've got a complicated triple-A
repair Dubenko wants me in on.

165
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,606
- No, Neela...
- I'll see you later.

166
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,216
Hello?

167
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,971
Decrease on the right.
Ten blade, sterile 8's and a...

168
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,371
And a chest-tube tray.

169
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,150
Hey. She took two shots. One in
the buttock, one in the shoulder.

170
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,813
- An exit wound in the chest.
- I told you to get a desk job.

171
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,424
Oh, uh...

172
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,890
- Bastard shot me in the back.
- How's your partner?

173
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,689
- All right.
- You were covered?

174
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,264
- Any pain here?
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,427
- It wasn't like that.
- How do you know?

176
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,830
- It was clean.
- Four milligrams morphine IV.

177
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,935
- We're out of 28. Is 32 okay?
- It's not okay. It's too big.

178
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,492
Let's get the films.
I'll do the chest tube.

179
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,076
I'm okay.

180
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,008
- Just dig up a 28 someplace.
- Sats, 88.

181
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,344
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

182
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,111
- It's all you guys.
- I'm sorry, this has to stay on you.

183
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,684
Somebody get the
sterile 8's, please, ahem.

184
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,186
- Bullet crossed the mediastinum.
- Well, that doesn't sound good.

185
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,626
- Probable aortic injury.
- I need a 28.

186
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,561
- Try the hallway.
- Whoa, whoa, half a liter out.

187
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,361
All right, hold compressions.

188
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,059
He's still asystole.

189
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,397
Okay, start up. Let's
hang another unit.

190
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,144
- Should we do a thoracotomy?
- Aorta's transected.

191
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,043
- There isn't much point.
- It's worth a shot, isn't it?

192
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,618
When you're new,
everything's a question.

193
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,114
Even when you know
you know something...

194
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,590
you say it with an inflection.

195
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,756
It's never, "Thoracotomy."

196
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:41,496
It's more like, um,
"Thoracotomy?"

197
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,406
You got my smokes?

198
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,341
Hi.

199
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,270
The orderly said he could get me a
carton of Salems for the right price.

200
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,508
That was two days ago.

201
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,744
I hate smoking these
things. Taste like wet leaves.

202
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,286
Where's Carlos?

203
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:07,223
I was, uh, kind of hoping today
would be the day you remember me.

204
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,128
I remember you well enough.

205
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,364
I'm your daughter. I'm Sam.

206
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,095
I said, I know who you are.

207
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,803
They told me you've been around.

208
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,804
That's good. You're more alert.

209
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,807
Yeah, this place is
like a dream come true.

210
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,011
I feel like I won
the Super Lotto.

211
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,121
Turn off my tank
for me, would you?

212
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,657
You can't smoke in
here. It's against the rules.

213
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,688
What?

214
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,632
So it's your turn
now, is that right?

215
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,400
I just wanna make
sure that you're okay.

216
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,804
Kelly and I both do.

217
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,870
Kelly never left.

218
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,048
Kelly stayed home and took care of
me. I don't know what you've been doing.

219
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,049
- You kicked me out.
- I didn't.

220
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,415
You called me a
whore and a slut.

221
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,854
I didn't belong to you anymore.
You didn't care what happened to me.

222
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,220
You were always dramatic.

223
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,420
You told me no one would
even notice I was gone.

224
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,156
I was 15 years old.

225
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,366
What happened to
that baby of yours?

226
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,949
His name's Alex.

227
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,677
Alex?

228
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:48,259
When a head injury rolls into
the ER, every minute counts.

229
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,624
- And, um...
- Delays. Talk about delays.

230
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:58,430
A delay of even 15 minutes can
mean the difference between life...

231
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,870
- Hey.
- And death.

232
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
Here's the pelvic film.

233
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,247
Brenner's calling it next door.

234
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,785
The guy lost a lot of blood.

235
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,216
Ahem, how we doing in here?

236
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,289
I can't stay. I'm
late for a meeting.

237
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,823
- She's not lucid.
- They lose him?

238
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,222
- Yeah.
- Well, I bet no one will miss him.

239
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,295
Hey. Come on, the guy died.

240
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,728
Bullet traversed the
pelvis. Could have hit it.

241
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,096
Or the bladder or the
uterus on the way through.

242
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,101
- Where's Surgery?
- In the OR.

243
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,603
They promised they'd send
someone in a few minutes.

244
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,333
- There's fluid around the liver.
- Tachy at 134.

245
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,842
Hang a unit, type specific.
Gonna need an ex-lap.

246
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,004
Maybe not. Let's CT her. It's
gonna take time for the surgeons.

247
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,673
She could be out of the
scanner in 10 minutes.

248
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,411
- Christ. Mac 4 and 7.5.
- You're gonna intubate?

249
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,707
We gotta protect her airway.

250
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,256
Her airway's fine. Her
lungs are re-expanded.

251
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,484
- This isn't the time.
- This is the time.

252
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,458
- He's right. You're right.
- Laryngoscope and a tray, please.

253
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,689
- How's she doing?
- How's it look?

254
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,333
- Hang in there, Diaz.
- What happened?

255
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,629
We were taking statements
on a murder case.

256
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,863
Some guy started
shooting through the door.

257
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,200
- Can I get that laryngoscope?
- Where were you?

258
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,568
Right next to her.

259
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,940
Not a scratch. What a lucky guy.

260
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,307
- Problem?
- Not as long as you had her back.

261
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,314
- Think about slowing your roll.
- Is that what I wanna do?

262
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,850
Take it from me. A badge
beats a lab coat any day.

263
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,046
Band of brothers, right? Where's
your chief? The department?

264
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,386
On their way, pal. Ease up.
This guy always such an asshole?

265
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,391
Hey, come on. You
wanna get into it with me?

266
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,568
All right. You got us
both in frame there, Boris?

267
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,207
Composition not ideal.
You are freakishly tall...

268
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,367
and Frank's head is
square like block of wood.

269
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,172
Thanks for the input, Spielberg.

270
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,380
In this segment, we are going to highlight
some of the unsung heroes of the ER.

271
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,716
First up is Sadiq,
the computer guy.

272
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,915
Sadiq Gilbran-Hassani,
I'm not just the computer guy.

273
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,118
My family has illustrious history
in Syria before we were forced out.

274
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,699
Uh, let's just try to stay
on point, Sadiq, okay?

275
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,564
Without me, there'd be no timely
lab results or x-ray readings...

276
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,705
which are crucial
in the saving of life.

277
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,734
You let me know when I can
speak again, hey, Uncle Sam?

278
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,900
- Thank you, Sadiq.
- You're the boss.

279
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,946
And this is Crystal
Hung, pharmacy tech.

280
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,949
Okay, when a doctor says, "I need an
amp of lidocaine," a nurse goes to get it.

281
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,246
If there's no lidocaine,
it's a problem.

282
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:33,621
I put the lidocaine in the cart,
every damn day. So that's that.

283
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,656
Interesting. Very interesting.

284
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,457
And here we have good
old Fred Tennyson...

285
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:42,398
custodial service engineer and
catcher for the ER softball team.

286
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,504
I switch out whatever's
broken. Like light bulbs.

287
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,335
Without light bulbs, it's hard
to see. And doctors, they...

288
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,505
Well, you know,
they need to see stuff.

289
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,847
And, uh, here we have, um...

290
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,813
uh, from the cafeteria.

291
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:19,404
And without food...
we would all go hungry.

292
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,302
And on, uh, camera...

293
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,970
we have Boris from,
uh, Media Services.

294
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,140
Please leave me out
of this. This is horrible.

295
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,085
When was your last dialysis?

296
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,056
- Dialysis? MORRIS:
Banfield thought I should know.

297
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,057
It was two days ago. I'm
not due for another four hours.

298
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,025
Must be fluid overloaded
since he's not making urine.

299
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,959
- Waiting on a kidney transplant?
- Yes.

300
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,394
- Any fever?
- No.

301
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,091
Increased salt or fluid intake?

302
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:54,473
Maybe an extra sip of coffee, a
handful of popcorn. Nothing crazy.

303
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,235
Sometimes this kind
of thing is idiopathic.

304
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,470
- It can happen when on chronic dialysis.
- I know.

305
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,311
- Systolic's down to 92.
- Let's get Nephrology here.

306
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,420
And grab the ultrasound. If there's
a big effusion, we need to tap it.

307
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,649
Get my nephrologist, Gustavo
Petrov at Northwestern.

308
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,256
Anyone else you want us to call?

309
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,761
No.

310
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,164
I'll be right back.

311
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,235
Pelvic trajectory goes
through the soft tissues.

312
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,898
- It could've bagged the...
- I need the ultrasound. How's she doing?

313
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,102
- She needs angio.
- She should go to the OR.

314
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,679
- Didn't enter the peritoneum.
- We don't know that.

315
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,784
Okay. Let's not argue here. I'm not
denying she needs surgery. I'm saying...

316
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,080
- that let's look at the iliacs first.
- There's no hematoma.

317
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,780
- What if she starts bleeding in the OR?
- We'll deal with it.

318
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,893
- You've got vascular standing by?
- Did you listen to a word?

319
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,188
- You're not thinking things through.
- No?

320
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,730
- No. We've got time to be systematic.
- Systematic?

321
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,366
Angio, retrograde cystogram.

322
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,095
- Let's not lose our head...
- Calm down and make a decision.

323
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,602
Archie, it's your call.
Angio or surgery?

324
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,779
You guys need to decide this.

325
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:14,250
Bone fragments in the
bladder wall. She needs the OR.

326
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:19,283
The pace down here is visceral.
It demands being instinctive...

327
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,324
in the moment.

328
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,589
I prefer having time to
think something through...

329
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,893
hash out different possible
versions, make a plan.

330
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,502
I mean, that's why I'm
better at being a surgeon...

331
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,696
than I was strictly
working in the ER.

332
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,574
You're gonna get in trouble
if they catch you doing that.

333
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,309
Maybe they'll throw me out.

334
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,944
You know, if you don't want
me here, you should just say so.

335
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,993
It's not like I'm gonna leave,
but at least we could talk about it.

336
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,323
Why don't we just try to forget our
mistakes and wipe the slate clean.

337
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,162
Mistakes? What mistakes?

338
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,134
- The ones that we both made.
- Speak for yourself.

339
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,536
All right, you know
what? I'm not gonna sit...

340
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,870
and play along with you as the
martyr and me as the evil child.

341
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,876
You don't have
to sit here at all.

342
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,949
I was young and dumb and in love,
Mom. I believed everything he said.

343
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,519
I raised you better than that.
I raised you better than that.

344
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,622
No, you didn't.

345
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,020
You actually know you didn't.

346
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,194
What is this? It's all wet?
Did you spill something?

347
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,256
Leave it.

348
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,494
- I'll get somebody to clean it up.
- No.

349
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,159
It's what they get paid for.

350
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,396
I don't want the staff
in here. I said stop.

351
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,370
- It's disgusting.
- It's not.

352
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,135
Leave it. Would you please
get out of here, you bitch?

353
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,472
- Get out. Get out of here.
- Give it to me.

354
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,511
- Give it to me.
- Get out.

355
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,580
Mary, I was coming to get you
for Flex and Fun. You ready?

356
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:01,820
Do I look like I'm ready
for Flex and Fun, you idiot?

357
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,832
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

358
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,400
So your mother's stroke affected her
frontal lobe. Do you know what that is?

359
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,513
- Yes, I'm a nurse.
- Oh, I thought you were in fashion.

360
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,012
No, that's my sister.

361
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,311
Heh. I didn't realize
there were two of you.

362
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:31,580
Anyway, what we see with frontal
lobe injuries is the filters come down.

363
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,785
The ability to self-censor, be empathetic,
sensitive, all tends to be affected.

364
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,862
Yeah, I know what
you're getting at.

365
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,625
So the things that she
says, it's not really her.

366
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,699
It's the stroke talking.

367
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,928
It changed her.

368
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,037
I appreciate what
you're saying, I do.

369
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,200
But the thing is, uh...

370
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,747
my mother hasn't changed a bit.

371
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,247
What you see in there,
that's who I grew up with.

372
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,386
That's exactly how
I remember her.

373
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,491
A bit more angle on the needle.

374
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:09,124
- Eureka.
- Good. I'll be right back.

375
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,497
We'll, uh, do a liver lac,
then explore the pelvis.

376
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,100
Urology will fix the bladder.

377
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,896
GYN will scrub in to
address the uterine issue.

378
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,232
- Primary repair will get it done?
- I hope so.

379
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,966
She may need a hysterectomy.

380
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,943
- Well, whatever you have to do.
- Okay.

381
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,746
She has four units cross-matched.
We'll have them sent up with her.

382
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,010
OR's ready.

383
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:39,188
I hate the fact that you put
yourself in danger every day.

384
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,328
Every time you do,
I'm so proud of you.

385
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,430
Okay, let's go.

386
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,170
- How's it going? GATES:
Fluid is serosanguineous...

387
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,374
and Johnny boy here
is a backseat driver.

388
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,309
- Dr. Carter?
- John?

389
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,045
Dr. Carter? MORRIS: John.

390
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,281
- He's in V-tach.
- No pulse.

391
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,892
- Did I irritate his myocardium?
- It's not your fault.

392
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,392
Five hundred of calcium
gluconate, amp of D50.

393
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,292
We don't know
his potassium level.

394
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,613
It's high if the kidneys
can't excrete it.

395
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:21,229
All right.

396
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,835
- Charged to 360.
- Clear.

397
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,836
- Still V-tach.
- Again. Clear.

398
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,137
Again.

399
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:35,303
- Hi. You guys have a consult for Renal?
- Mg of epi, 150 of amiodarone.

400
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:39,043
- Excuse me, Dr...?
- Emily Haverman from Nephrology.

401
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,016
Gates, switch.

402
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,747
- You're a student?
- Fourth year. I'm doing a rotation.

403
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,256
That is an ER Attending
coding on the table...

404
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,918
and this is not a teaching case.
So, please, turn around, walk out...

405
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,327
get your attending,
and come back now.

406
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:57,266
- Dr. Wheeler would prefer if I examined...
- I'm trying to remain professional.

407
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,836
If you're not walking away
within three seconds...

408
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,032
I swear to God, I may start
doing compressions on your head.

409
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:10,910
I spent a lot of years in the
Army, jumping out of choppers...

410
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,446
and I thought I
was a team player.

411
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,783
But I wasn't. Not
until I got here.

412
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,416
Whoa. K's 7.6.

413
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,560
- Calcium's on board.
- Going again. Clear.

414
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,519
Back in sinus.

415
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:28,395
- Carotid's good.
- Recheck the lytes now and q30.

416
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,926
I'm Dr. Wheeler from Nephrology.

417
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,231
- My attending.
- Perfect timing.

418
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,809
Morris.

419
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,539
You saved me? I'll
never live it down.

420
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,547
Mom?

421
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,558
I gotta get to work.

422
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,923
When's Kelly coming back?

423
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,927
A week, maybe.

424
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,295
I must have spilled some water on
that blanket or something. I don't know.

425
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,844
I'll take care of it. I'll
get it back to you tonight.

426
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:24,248
I'm gonna keep coming
here. No matter what.

427
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,858
You won't go through this alone.

428
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,699
You do what you gotta do.

429
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,267
We all have our cross to bear.

430
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,883
The UNOS list can take a long time.
Have you thought about direct donation?

431
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,290
- Yeah, I've considered it.
- And? Your wife not a match?

432
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,224
If not, we have a paired
organ-donor program.

433
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,493
- The two of you could qualify.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that program.

434
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,160
I just haven't talked
to Kem about that yet.

435
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,829
There's very
little risk in testing.

436
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:19,342
Well, it's just not something we're in
a place to get together on right now.

437
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,740
Oh.

438
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,314
Does she know about your status?

439
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,880
She knows that I have
some medical issues...

440
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,489
and I came back to Chicago.

441
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:36,022
She's in France.
She's visiting her family.

442
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,930
I left the whole
thing kind of vague.

443
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:42,033
Okay. I will shut up now.

444
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,533
I'm just kind of tired.

445
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,429
- I'll split.
- Pull that curtain for me?

446
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,698
You got it.

447
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,934
Hey, I didn't realize
you were coming in.

448
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,603
Yeah, me either. I got paged for
an organ transport. Heart donor.

449
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,717
- Plane leaves in two hours.
- How's your mom?

450
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:02,218
Visiting her makes me feel like
Jodie Foster in <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

451
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,721
Fun. Hey, no offense,
but this smells like piss.

452
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,861
I'm supposed to bring that to
her but I'm not gonna make it.

453
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,962
- I'll take care of it for you.
- Really?

454
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,860
- Yeah.
- All you do is send it up to Laundry...

455
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,763
- and drop it off on your way home.
- Not a problem.

456
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,871
- You sure don't mind?
- Did I not just volunteer?

457
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,134
You know, you're not such
an ass as some people say.

458
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,244
Thank you.

459
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,475
Um, what were we talking about?

460
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,812
Oh.

461
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:40,451
But, you know, eventually, I started
to figure things out as a doctor.

462
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,892
You know, and how I fit in
professionally with this place...

463
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,760
in this community
of people, you know.

464
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:51,597
That's a big, big
part of it, for me...

465
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,832
is, uh, being good
with yourself...

466
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:01,145
and who you are, and
who you're meant to be.

467
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,839
You know, finding yourself.

468
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:10,987
And then there's the
next step after that...

469
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:15,150
which is finding somebody else.

470
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,222
And sometimes you think:

471
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,802
"You know, that's just... That's
never gonna happen for me."

472
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,265
Then you meet someone...

473
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,172
who makes you feel...

474
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,873
you know...

475
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,612
Who gets you...

476
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,755
and you get her.

477
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,486
Someone you can imagine...

478
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:08,806
S...

479
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,983
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

480
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,230
People think all we do is scrub
poop and vomit off the floor.

481
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,834
But I refill the paper
towels, the toilet papers...

482
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,664
stock the soap, the dispensers.

483
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:35,831
Without clean hands, you
get lots of bad infections.

484
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,334
She's right.

485
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:42,209
Nosocomial infections cause over
30,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.

486
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,213
He knows.

487
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,614
So, boys, what's this all about?

488
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,851
Oh, the interview guy said
that we were non-essential staff.

489
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,427
- Non-essential?
- We're offering a rebuttal.

490
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,064
You're essential.
You're quintessential.

491
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,531
- Um, yeah.
- I'm sure you'll set him straight.

492
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,466
- Let me get a little rest, eh?
- Yeah.

493
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,570
Hey, hey. I think this lady's having
an allergic reaction or something.

494
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,713
Uh, okay, we'll page somebody.
Let's put her right over here.

495
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,611
- Let's get Morris.
- Morris is upstairs.

496
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:20,412
- How about Brenner?
- Uh, critical ICU.

497
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,315
How long have you had this rash?

498
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,614
An hour.

499
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,384
- Oh, she's having trouble breathing.
- Peanuts.

500
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:29,327
- Did she say "penis"?
- This is getting weird.

501
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,655
Peanut.

502
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,799
Peanuts. It's a peanut allergy. I
knew a kid who had this in school.

503
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,001
- And?
- He died.

504
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,497
- Oh, man. She's not moving any air.
- We need help.

505
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:46,506
Uh, uh... No, we don't.

506
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,261
Thank you.

507
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,495
Yeah?

508
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:20,037
- Oh, in your face, reality boy.
- Yeah. Do we look non-essential now?

509
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,888
I thought you'd be
upstairs working on Claudia.

510
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,223
Uh, Urology is doing the
bladder reconstruction.

511
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,456
They swapped me out
for their own resident.

512
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,501
- Ah.
- I'm, uh, going on a heart retrieval...

513
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,161
so I figured I'd grab a
coffee before the airport.

514
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,638
A heart retrieval for Joanie?

515
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:52,710
- Yeah, it's good news.
- That's fantastic.

516
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:56,747
The, uh, heart's in Seattle, so we won't
be back until the middle of the night.

517
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,078
Are we all right?

518
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,552
What do you think?

519
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:13,665
Well, um, that
something's bothering you.

520
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,897
Clever twist.

521
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,464
Forget it.

522
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,600
Explain it to me.

523
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,178
Hey, how is my being
worried about you a twist?

524
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,714
Because you keep
turning everything around.

525
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,718
I, uh... I don't think I'm
smart enough to fight with you.

526
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,378
Like that.

527
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,616
You're plenty smart
enough, but right now...

528
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,090
it's easier to make me
seem hyper-analytical.

529
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,128
This morning, it wasn't going
your way, so I was irrational.

530
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,062
- I never said you...
- I'm the one bothered by something.

531
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,930
I'm the one refusing to have
a reasonable conversation...

532
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,799
and I'm the one who
doesn't make sense.

533
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,770
- It's all a defense mechanism.
- Defense? Defense for what?

534
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,934
I don't know.

535
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,536
Something you haven't told me?

536
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,473
I don't tell anyone everything.

537
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,140
Then what are we doing?

538
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:11,713
We hit a speed bump weeks
ago and you react by disappearing.

539
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,883
We see each other all the
time. We talk, we sleep together.

540
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,462
There's a way to do all those
things and still disappear.

541
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,826
Why would I wanna do that?

542
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,601
Tell me.

543
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,144
Now, Neela, there are things
that should be kept private.

544
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,612
Not between two people trying to
figure out if they belong together.

545
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:42,083
- Now, I am comfortable with you.
- Well, maybe that's not enough.

546
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,655
Not when I have
to find out things...

547
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,520
important things, about
you from other people.

548
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,354
Oh, so that's
it, that's it, is it?

549
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,587
I'm not chatty enough
so you go snooping...

550
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,255
- trying to get under my skin?
- It's not like that.

551
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,836
Make me be what you think a boyfriend
should be? Sharing my emotions...

552
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:02,666
and talking about every stupid
damn thing that bothers me? No.

553
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,639
No!

554
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,812
Look, a terrible thing
was done to you.

555
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,213
I understand that.

556
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,655
I hate that it happened.

557
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:25,593
But somewhere in all of what's gone
on between us, one thing is clear...

558
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,401
we're not meant to be together.

559
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,697
It doesn't mean we don't
care about each other deeply.

560
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:42,143
You know, I truly believe...

561
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:46,142
there's something better
out there for both of us...

562
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,311
whenever we're ready for it.

563
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,416
Better?

564
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,553
Something more right.

565
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,481
- Northwestern, huh?
- Too good for County.

566
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,455
Well, what can I say, Frank.

567
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,788
I've seen how you care
for your patients here.

568
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,863
Dr. Morris says to make sure
they check another potassium...

569
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,557
- as soon as you get there.
- Thanks, Haleh.

570
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,962
We're gonna see you soon, right?

571
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:40,065
Not if I see you first.

572
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,901
Folks, it's only a mile away. You can
visit him when we're not on the clock.

573
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,839
Um...

574
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,371
Primary repair worked.

575
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:31,818
So I guess the world
can look forward to...

576
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,227
a gaggle of
olive-skinned kids...

577
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,919
with red hair and freckles.

578
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,263
You know, if that's
something that you want.

579
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:59,579
The life you lead, the things
that you have been through...

580
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,152
they define how you do your job.

581
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,288
The quality of...

582
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:08,086
The quality of your work.
Especially in a place like this.

583
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,922
So at the, uh...

584
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:17,665
At the end of the day, you
choose to, ahem, deny or deal.

585
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,798
And which do you choose?

586
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,251
It's evolving.

587
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,453
I'm evolving. Um...

588
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,689
All I know is that I know, um...

589
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:49,095
that there is a lot of
work that I need to do.

590
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,167
Can you be more
specific about that?

591
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,011
No.

592
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,010
Not with you.

593
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,621
Mrs. Taggart.

594
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,819
Hi. I'm Tony Gates.
I work with Sam.

595
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,995
I used to play.

596
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:25,001
You know, at Christmas
time, I'd play the carols.

597
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,530
It's all gone now.

598
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,073
Yeah, well, Sam wanted
me to get this back to you.

599
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,439
Well, she said
she was coming by.

600
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,504
Well, she, uh, can't
tonight. She's on a work call.

601
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,181
Uh-huh.

602
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,848
- And you are?
- I am a friend.

603
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,320
A friend? Uh-huh.

604
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,986
- Do you smoke?
- No, ma'am. I don't.

605
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,862
That's too bad.

606
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,558
You're a good-looking
fella, though, aren't you?

607
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,669
Hmm. Must be
the lighting in here.

608
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:04,976
Do you know that out of
all these people in here...

609
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,573
I'm the youngest one
by about 15 years.

610
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,183
What the hell did I
do to deserve this?

611
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,081
I can't imagine.

612
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,630
I don't want her to stop coming.

613
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,230
So if she thinks that's
so, you tell her it's not.

614
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,502
Okay.

615
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,607
You know, Sam's
an amazing person.

616
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,643
She's very strong, she's
overcome a lot of obstacles.

617
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,720
You get to know her,
you'd be very proud.

618
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,922
- She hates me.
- No, she doesn't.

619
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,720
- Well, she thinks that I hate her.
- Then change that.

620
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,654
Sure.

621
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:01,724
Ta-da.

622
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,296
Change.

623
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,262
Well, it's up to you.

624
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,542
Have a good night.

625
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,937
Hey.

626
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,406
You're not lying, are you?

627
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,484
She's gonna come back tomorrow?

628
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:24,589
When Sam makes up her
mind, nothing stops her.

629
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,361
I love helping people.

630
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,301
You know, originally,
I wanted to be...

631
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,840
the first baseman
for the Chicago Cubs.

632
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,638
The thing I hate most about my job?
- Mm-hm.

633
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,303
- The smells.
- The smells.

634
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,314
Human body's got some
pretty interesting smells.

635
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,146
What's the dating life like? Ha.

636
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,652
Well, I'm not gonna tell you.

637
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,315
It's personal.

638
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:05,692
A patient is a patient. Um,
pain is pain. It's universal.

639
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,890
And I reached a point
about five years ago...

640
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:15,131
where I started to feel that
every day was the same thing.

641
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,001
And I'd had enough.

642
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,404
But I've been through
a lot of stuff since then.

643
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,748
And now...

644
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,655
I try to embrace the idea...

645
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,319
that everything that happens
has never happened before.

646
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:44,062
Like that saying that you can't
stand in the same river twice...

647
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,602
because by the time
that you come back...

648
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,070
it's not the same river.

649
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,177
And you're not the same man.

650
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,578
Anyway...

651
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:09,421
I look around this place now and I
can't imagine ever finding it boring.

652
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:16,424
Because right at the moment
that you think you've seen it all...

653
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:22,205
something happens that you
never could have expected.
