1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:06,899
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,703
Are you a sociopath,
a sadist? Stoned?

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,437
I heard that you were tightly
wound, but I had no idea.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,477
What am I giving up? A dumpy O.R.?
Overnight call? Below-market pay?

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,948
This is not what you want.

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,917
Everything was going really
well until the ambulance blew up.

7
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,614
Morris. Don't screw this up.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,522
There's an open artery. I can let him
bleed out or accept the risk of a stroke.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,290
His heart's gone, his brain's
gone. We're pronouncing him.

10
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,366
He was going to be
the chief of the ER.

11
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,369
As we embrace the memory of
our colleague and our dear friend.

12
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,713
Helipad access, ortho
supplies, suture cart...

13
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,380
Nurses' station, drug
lockup, call room.

14
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,214
- There's a call room?
- Yeah, but don't plan on sleeping.

15
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,789
- I didn't come here to sleep.
- Hey, don't be snarky, we just got here.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,255
- Nice dress.
- Oh, Barneys sale, 1800 bucks.

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,758
Got it for four. Love that.

18
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,726
Okay, these are the trauma rooms,
take some time to familiarize yourself.

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,063
Ah, the new interns.
Welcome to County.

20
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,035
- Those are some shoes.
- Oh, I always wear heels.

21
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,401
Anything else hurts my feet.

22
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,111
Everybody get a chance
to look around Chicago?

23
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,484
We were at a friend's wedding in
Denver yesterday. Drove all night.

24
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:33,821
Yeah. I washed my hair in a gas
station sink and I came straight here.

25
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,324
You're from Texas, right?

26
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,158
Went to med school in San
Antonio, but I'm from New York.

27
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,128
- I don't speak Spanish.
- Oh.

28
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,806
Ah, everybody meet Dr. Tony Gates
and Sam Taggart, one of our nurses.

29
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,309
- Welcome. SAM:
Nice to meet you.

30
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,471
Gates oversees you, I supervise
him, Sam's got her eye on all.

31
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,413
Be careful, she'll kick your ass.
- Trust him, he knows.

32
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,418
- Aah!
- Security!

33
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,194
Charts, forms, lab
recs, it's all here.

34
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,526
Is this...?

35
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,792
Are these who I think they are?
- It's true.

36
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,664
- Your replacements have arrived.
- Tracy Martin. Nice to...

37
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,705
Oh, thank you, God. I
am not an intern anymore.

38
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,809
Kaya, come meet
your partners in crime.

39
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,774
Hey, you guys. How's it going?

40
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,470
You're an intern too? - Yup.

41
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,808
Skipped the orientation.

42
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,473
Y'all need to get your
behinds down to Personnel.

43
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,176
You can't work without IDs.

44
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,947
And this is Frank. Donuts
will make him your friend.

45
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,024
- Avoid coconut, it gives him gas.
- You can say that again.

46
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,120
Come on.

47
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,396
Hi, I'm Tracy Martin and I am an
intern in the Emergency Department.

48
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,293
Oh, wait. I need a touchup.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,975
Andrew Wade, intern,
General Surgery.

50
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,111
- Surgeon, wow.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,619
Daria Wade, intern,
Emergency Department.

52
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,982
I should go find where I'm
supposed to be right now.

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,720
- Call you later, Dar.
- Honey, honey. Yeah, I know.

54
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,830
I gotta go now. I love you. Bye.

55
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,170
Ryan Sanchez, intern.

56
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,567
My wife's home with the kids.
Getting used to the new place.

57
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,577
Hello?

58
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:37,707
I did my MBA while I was at
Stanford and the program there is real...

59
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,685
- Hold on, I wasn't ready. WOMAN:
That's enough. You're done.

60
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,527
Put the little penis away.

61
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:54,730
And you, you're a doctor
now, try to look like one.

62
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,767
And on that note...

63
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:00,669
three-inch heels have
no place in the hospital.

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,444
Catherine Banfield, Attending
physician, chief of the ER.

65
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,980
Hello, everyone.
I'm your new boss.

66
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,961
We see an average of 250 patients
a day. Three hundred if it gets crazy.

67
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,599
- Few years, you can handle anything.
- I'm sure.

68
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,259
- So, what made you come back?
- It was time. Chicago's home.

69
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,530
I don't get the whole
medical-mission thing.

70
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:35,301
Why chase tragedy overseas when
we've got disaster right at our front door?

71
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,604
It's not for everyone. I thought
the nurse ratio was four to one.

72
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,748
My ex went on a
medical mission. Mistake.

73
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,440
Where are the nurses?
Doesn't look four-to-one here.

74
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,778
We're short, as usual.

75
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,047
This is Haleh Adams, our charge nurse.
Haleh, meet Dr. Banfield, our new chief.

76
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,554
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

77
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,955
- Coffee anyone?
- I'm not into coffee, it's a crutch.

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,322
Uh, meet me to run
the board in five minutes.

79
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,897
- Do I know you? You look so familiar.
- I don't think so.

80
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,830
Ever work at St. Mark's? I
pick up shifts there sometimes.

81
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,402
- No.
- Moonlight in Urgent Care?

82
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,564
- I could swear I've seen you before.
- No, it's my first day.

83
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:12,839
Well, if there's anything you need
to know about this place, just ask.

84
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,580
Cuticle cream?

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,946
Latex gloves are
murder on your hands.

86
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,747
Think this used
to be a sandwich?

87
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,914
You guys get settled,
meet me out at the desk.

88
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,156
- You okay?
- Yeah, ahem.

89
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,491
You've been here for
like 96 hours straight.

90
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,464
- We're a little short-staffed right now.
- Us too.

91
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,798
Abby took a few days off with
Luka. And you look like crap.

92
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,873
- Look who's talking? You live here.
- Easier than going home.

93
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,667
- Sleep is overrated.
- Bring it on.

94
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,176
These patients have been
on the board since yesterday.

95
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,610
Hospital's full, they
never discharge at night.

96
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,511
Makes it impossible
to admit anyone.

97
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,152
I'm friendly with the nursing
supervisor on Med Surg.

98
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,481
- Bet you are.
- She can always find a bed for me.

99
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,486
Can you get her
to open things up?

100
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,888
- Lubricate the log jam?
- Do it.

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,556
Oh, uh, Dr. Banfield.

102
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,893
I wanted to let you know, I have
to take off a little early tonight.

103
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,399
Um, starting the nurse anesthetist
program, have to drop off my kid.

104
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:13,802
Leave when your shift's over. I'm a
stickler for that, Sam. It is Sam, right?

105
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,034
Yeah. It's only like 20 minutes.

106
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,976
We all have commitments, just
don't let them bleed into your work.

107
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,411
Wow, new chief seems great.

108
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,177
You know, Alex can hang
out with me and Sarah tonight.

109
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,480
- Really?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,952
I don't want to be him alone.

111
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,962
- No problem, I'll pick him up after work.
- Thank you. It's a big help.

112
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,663
James Silcott, 26, burns and minor
trauma from a chemical explosion...

113
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,665
- in the apartment next to theirs.
- Decca Richards, 24, same explosion.

114
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,200
Vitals good, abdominal pain.

115
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,065
- Babe, you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

116
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,671
I'm Dr. Gates, what happened?

117
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,037
- We were reading on the couch.
- This blast came through the walls.

118
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,678
- Both trauma rooms are open.
- Kaya with Dr. Morris.

119
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,871
Gates, you're with
me, Trauma 1, let's go.

120
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,744
- Follow me. SAM: We're
gonna be right next door.

121
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,783
I'll bounce between
and supervise.

122
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,387
We're Attendings. We
don't need to be supervised.

123
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,046
Just watch this time, get
a sense of how things go.

124
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,886
Screw that.

125
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,618
Eighteen gauge in the antecube.

126
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,387
Tachy at 118, pulses are good.

127
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,464
Second degree burns to chest
and arm. Kaya, let Surgery know.

128
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,898
All right, on my
count. One, two, three.

129
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,132
- What exploded?
- I don't know.

130
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,571
Just heard this breaking
glass. Probably his meth lab.

131
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,768
- Guy's a freak.
- HemoCue, trauma panel, type and cross.

132
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,470
Why the ultrasound?

133
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,808
Explosion. Blunt
trauma. That's why.

134
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,974
- How's your pain?
- It's pretty bad.

135
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,483
- My arm's killing me.
- We can get you something.

136
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:34,711
Five of MS.

137
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,620
Get another set of vitals before you
go dropping his pressure with narcotics.

138
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,057
- Is Decca okay?
- I'll go check.

139
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,793
Good idea.

140
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,759
So, what kind of music
does your band play?

141
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,497
It's hard to explain. Imagine a
punk version of '40s standards.

142
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:56,336
That makes no sense.
Okay, no fluid, looks good.

143
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,943
You have to check
it out sometime.

144
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,579
- Ow!
- Sorry.

145
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,786
- You want me to try?
- I said stand back and watch.

146
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,315
I had a band once.

147
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,918
Bunch of sexually
frustrated adolescent boys.

148
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,588
All right, IV's
in, hang a liter.

149
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,588
Liter of what?

150
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,622
- Normal saline.
- So be clear.

151
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,160
- Everyone knew what he meant.
- We knew one song...

152
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,766
"You Got Lucky" by Tom Petty,
and we played it over and over.

153
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:30,140
Over and over again. I'm
not kidding you, it was sad.

154
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,178
- You have a patient on the table.
- A stable patient.

155
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,111
- It's cool, really.
- A trauma case can turn on a dime.

156
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,682
I know that. We're good here.

157
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,946
Every patient that comes through
that door is my responsibility.

158
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,785
And I have to know that
I can trust your judgment.

159
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,052
I'm sorry for
calling so early...

160
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,459
but I've got an obstructive
pancreatitis on the schedule.

161
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,463
You gotta stop
doing this, Dusty.

162
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,229
Would you jump straight to
pancreaticojejunal anastomosis...

163
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,635
or do a sphincteroplasty first?

164
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,503
If the proximal duct is open,
option one, otherwise, two.

165
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,804
Intermittent dilation, go
with a Puestow procedure.

166
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,244
- You are my hero.
<i>- Yeah, yeah. I know.</i>

167
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,351
I gotta run, I'm doing
grand rounds at Rush.

168
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,386
- Dr. Crenshaw?
- What?

169
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,217
Oh, finally, I've
been looking for you.

170
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,088
Andrew Wade, new Surgical intern.
I'm supposed to shadow you today.

171
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,559
- Is black okay?
- Fantastic.

172
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,092
Ahh.

173
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,393
Where is she?

174
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,561
- Probably should get back to work.
- It's my day off.

175
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,231
- I only came in because I wanted to...
- Neela, I know where this is going.

176
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,071
But Lucien's a fantastic
teacher. The patients love him.

177
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,042
And he's an amazing
trauma surgeon.

178
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,773
- I don't disagree.
- Then how can you let him leave?

179
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,783
I don't like it either,
but he forced our hand.

180
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:50,322
- He was upset. He didn't mean...
- The board voted for dismissal. It's done.

181
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,361
Listen, Captain Hemolysis, you
guys use the same excuse every time.

182
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,393
Spare me the
dog-ate-my-homework crap...

183
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,725
and get me the
potassium level. Thank you.

184
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,226
Impossible to get
anything done around here.

185
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,031
- You okay?
- Yeah.

186
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,340
When was the last
time you had a day off?

187
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,738
I got a guy with Bullous
pemphigoid in Curtain 3.

188
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,436
You should check it out.

189
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,605
Why don't you get
out of here for a while?

190
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,980
It'll be good for you. - Hey.

191
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,420
I need you sign off
on a bunch of stuff.

192
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,488
I'm all yours.

193
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,423
One of the nurses had me
order Bactrim on tricycle girl.

194
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,255
Is that approved for kids?

195
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,329
You're missing the
point. She asked me.

196
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,557
Didn't need my order
co-signed or anything.

197
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,600
Hallelujah. I am so sick of
getting my orders co-signed.

198
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,260
There's always been
someone double-checking.

199
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,906
Making sure we didn't mess up.

200
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,804
Now you feel like you're
flying without a net, right?

201
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,241
- Exactly.
- That's completely normal.

202
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,677
Now, all this
responsibility, I mean...

203
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,676
I want it, it's
just a little scary.

204
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,752
- Hmph!
- What?

205
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,186
If you're not ready, then
you shouldn't be here.

206
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,859
You're ready. It takes
time to grow into this job.

207
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,255
You have complete backup.

208
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,862
No one's expecting you
to run a code the first day.

209
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,090
Now, come on. Let's
start with the basics.

210
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,327
Fever with a murmur.
What's the workup?

211
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,597
Surgery wants to admit the
explosion couple for observation...

212
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,934
- but they have no beds.
- What else is new?

213
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,374
Park them in the hallway, I will
write orders for vitals and fluids.

214
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,877
Hey. See this guy, will you?

215
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,345
He's been waiting
five hours already now.

216
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,815
Oh, so sorry, Frank. We were
eating bonbons in a bubble bath.

217
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,454
Totally lost track
of time. Go say hi.

218
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,216
Hey, I'm Sam. I'm
one of the nurses.

219
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,055
Finally, I was ready
to give up on you guys.

220
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,124
Check this out.

221
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,025
- Do I have flesh-eating bacteria?
- I don't think so.

222
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,398
But, uh, I'll have one of
the doctors take a look.

223
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,564
How long is this gonna
take? I got a big test tomorrow.

224
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,574
And if it were up to
you? What would you do?

225
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,981
- I just got here thirty seconds ago.
- Sometimes that's all you get.

226
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:02,247
Okay, um, severe
cellulitis, IV antibiotics?

227
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,481
- What kind? SAM:
I don't know, um...

228
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,651
- Ancef?
- No. IV Vanco to cover MRSA.

229
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,355
And don't answer a question
with a question. I hate that.

230
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,863
- Are you gonna give me some medicine?
- What was that?

231
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,939
Just trying to get a sense of how
you think, what you're capable of.

232
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,872
Oh. That's kind of hard to
come up with a plan on...

233
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,238
Hard?

234
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,575
You're an ER nurse. You're the first
line against gunshot wounds, stabbings.

235
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,350
- Think bedside teaching is hard?
- Male found behind the explosion site.

236
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,750
- Let me go.
- Your leg's broken. You can't walk.

237
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,289
Minor burns to neck and
torso. Probable tib-fib, left.

238
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,790
Gates, take this. I'll be right in.
- Listen to me.

239
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,020
- Why won't you listen?
- Can I run it?

240
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,062
- No. I'm Dr. Gates.
- I don't need a doctor.

241
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,460
- Name?
- Shut up.

242
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,034
- We gotta call you something.
- Felix.

243
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,433
All right, ABCs, here we go.
- He breathing?

244
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,766
He's tachypneic. Could
be edema from the fire.

245
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,602
Ryan, on my count.
One, two, three.

246
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,073
Stop!

247
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,405
- Okay, I'm only gonna listen.
- Don't touch me.

248
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,775
Sat's 91. GATES: Sir,
your oxygen level is low.

249
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,383
- We need to evaluate your lungs.
- Leave me alone.

250
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,882
Let me just cut your shirt.

251
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,544
- Don't touch me. Don't touch my stuff.
- Sir, relax.

252
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,952
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- Whoa.

253
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,992
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God. Now you did it.

254
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,288
- Is this cocaine?
- You cut through the bag.

255
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,657
- Bag?
- You shouldn't have.

256
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,662
- What powder?
- It's weaponized ricin.

257
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,165
- It's extremely lethal. I made it myself.
- Ricin?

258
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,463
- Shouldn't have done that.
- I'm out of here.

259
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,902
Whoa! You open those
doors, the whole ER is exposed.

260
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,304
I told you not to touch
me. Now we're all dead.

261
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,101
- ER.
- Frank, call HAZMAT.

262
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,304
We have a situation here.

263
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:43,582
Cops said the guy's a real wack job.
Had stuff on anthrax, botulism, plague...

264
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,782
Keep it down, don't
want people to panic.

265
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,086
We're moving people.
They're gonna know.

266
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,163
Environmental Services won't
touch it, they said call HAZMAT.

267
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,355
- Did you?
- Yes.

268
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,693
Fire department is
supposed to respond first.

269
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,665
- What's their ETA?
- Ten minutes out.

270
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,668
I think we should
seal off Exam 2.

271
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,273
With what, duct
tape? I'll find some.

272
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,774
- Morris.
- Right behind you.

273
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,337
If they get sick, we
need to have access.

274
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,778
- A few hours before symptoms manifest.
- We can't leave them in there.

275
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,386
Gotta be quarantined till HAZMAT
can figure out what we're dealing with.

276
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,283
- Let's just concentrate on evacuation.
- Evacuation where?

277
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,016
You know this
hospital, you tell me.

278
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,227
- Hold the elevator.
- Where are you going?

279
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,886
- Upstairs for observation.
- Thought you had no beds.

280
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,158
Well, we can't very well leave
them here in Hot Zone, can we?

281
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,393
Surgical lobby. Come with me.

282
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,069
Dr. Gates, the Hazardous
Materials team is on the way.

283
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,541
I have an unstable patient, three
freaking interns, please hurry up.

284
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,476
I knew the cops would be
all over my place so I ran.

285
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,708
There are no masks in
here. There's no gowns either.

286
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,978
Didn't count on the
fire escape collapsing.

287
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,748
- Shut up.
- Inhalation of aerosolized ricin...

288
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,083
can kill in 24 hours.

289
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,226
Does it say if it's
absorbed though skin?

290
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,918
We should all be wearing gloves.

291
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,562
How's his pulse ox?

292
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,891
God, they're
trapping us in here.

293
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,857
Oh, my God.

294
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,367
Annie, honey, I'm
with a patient, gotta go.

295
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,531
All right, let's stay focused.
Secondary survey, let's go.

296
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,671
A year's supply
of Valium in here.

297
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,576
Don't forget the IV tubing and infusers.
I don't know what they have upstairs.

298
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,774
How much would this
be worth on the street?

299
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,886
After today, I'm thinking
about an alternate career.

300
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,419
You doing all right?

301
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,921
I should bring some
fentanyl too, right?

302
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,289
He's got a phone in there.

303
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,262
You can call and talk to him.

304
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,793
No, he's busy.

305
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:36,459
I'm busy too. Gotta start my
new career as a drug dealer.

306
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,163
- I don't want that.
- I'm not interested in what you want.

307
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,376
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- You should've told us about this.

308
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,753
I tried. Listen, my
leg is really killing me.

309
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:49,107
Yeah, because it's broken.

310
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,616
Unfortunately for you, we can't
help because we're stuck in this room.

311
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,983
- Please. Something's really wrong.
- Look. That doesn't look right.

312
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,216
Yeah. Compartment syndrome.
We have to do a fasciotomy.

313
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,418
You're bleeding from the
fracture into the soft tissue.

314
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,292
That's why blood is
not getting to your foot.

315
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,331
Ryan, go to the code
cart, get morphine.

316
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,299
- Morphine? For this guy?
- We treat everybody the same.

317
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,440
- What's morphine look like?
- It's a clear bottle, black top.

318
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,632
- Says "morphine."
- It's really killing me.

319
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,903
- I don't think there's any here.
- I'm sorry. This is gonna hurt.

320
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,478
- What's your name?
- Daria.

321
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,978
Daria, talk to him. - What?

322
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,480
- Talk to the patient.
- Oh, um...

323
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,244
Okay, so how did you
become a bioterrorist?

324
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,682
Ow!

325
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,947
Damn it.

326
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,452
Hey.

327
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,583
What's going on?

328
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,786
HAZMAT team's 10 minutes out.

329
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,025
Discharge whoever you can,
bring the rest to the evacuation area.

330
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,601
- Moved the portable monitors upstairs?
- Yeah.

331
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,364
Grab whatever you need
because when HAZMAT gets here...

332
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,941
- they're not gonna let you back in.
- Let's move the CHF-er.

333
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,476
- Mr. Burke, you can't leave yet.
- What's going on?

334
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,444
- First I heard bomb scare. Now anthrax.
- It's not anthrax.

335
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,447
Yeah, whatever
it is, I don't need it.

336
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,610
Stop. You have a serious
infection. You need to be admitted...

337
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,119
- to the hospital for IV antibiotics.
- I can't.

338
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,019
I'm supposed to take
the GED tomorrow.

339
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,524
- I'm gonna get my diploma.
- Sam, we're going up.

340
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,130
Please, don't leave. I'm gonna try
to work something out for you, okay?

341
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,456
Okay, go slow, he needs
an expiratory phase.

342
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,660
Any chance we could
use oral antibiotics...?

343
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,327
- No.
- He's gonna go home.

344
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,234
Change his mind.

345
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,240
I said we were taking the
rule-out MIs to Family Practice.

346
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,378
We don't have
enough staff to cover.

347
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,208
But I got the clinic nurses to help...
- Dr. Morris...

348
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,145
the rule-outs
will wait upstairs.

349
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,478
You just let me know
when you need my help.

350
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,052
I'm here for you.

351
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,921
You think the docs in that
room are gonna be okay?

352
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:48,031
I don't know. I hope so.

353
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,864
I, uh, heard that you worked
in Thailand after the tsunami.

354
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,010
Indonesia.

355
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,108
Well, this must seem pretty
minor compared to that.

356
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,777
Yeah. It is.

357
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,688
ICU says they're not
allowed to lend their machine.

358
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,256
- Don't ask, just take it.
- Intubated patients, there.

359
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,257
Thanks. CRENSHAW:
How many more are left?

360
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,396
- Another 20 or 30.
- We need to make more space.

361
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,396
Respiratory's on the way with more
O2 and Rehab's sending three vents.

362
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,098
Rehab was Marisol's idea.

363
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,260
- This one's a keeper.
- Sorry, gotta take this.

364
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,461
Hey.

365
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,470
<i>Eleven hang-ups, Dusty?</i>

366
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,767
We are under siege.

367
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,933
You do know your
number shows up, right?

368
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,874
<i>I'm stuck with a new intern...</i>

369
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,412
and the ER was the target
of a bioterrorist attack.

370
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,313
- Mm-hm. I used to call that a Thursday.
<i>- Oh, you love this, don't you?</i>

371
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,580
Me, getting my ass kicked
while you sleep in and go to yoga.

372
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,783
I wish, but with all the lectures,
conferences and interviews out here...

373
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,986
it's been grueling. Speaking
of which, I gotta run.

374
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,458
Yeah, okay. No, no.
Wait. Lucien? Lucien?

375
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,568
The ER's been attacked and
you're catching up on phone calls?

376
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,016
- Any headway with Anspaugh?
- No, but he knows it's crap.

377
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,697
- Wouldn't look me in the eye.
- A kid pulled out his G-tube.

378
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,174
- That's Neela's specialty.
- You owe me.

379
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,680
- The guys in the moon suits are here.
- Oh, good, feel much better now.

380
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,407
They must have an exit strategy.

381
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,986
Fracture must've
severed the tibial artery.

382
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,178
I can't see crap.

383
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:20,349
It says that low micron ricin particles
may be suspended in the air for hours.

384
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,927
- We're screwed. GATES:
Ryan, get me a suture kit.

385
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,793
I'm gonna have to make this incision
bigger to find the bleeding vessel.

386
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,594
Here we go. One, two, three.

387
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,669
All right. Get me 4-by-4s.

388
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,364
- I don't feel so good. TRACY:
Wait, you need to lie down.

389
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,841
- What are you being admitted for?
- Asthma. It's bad this time.

390
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,480
We were here all night, my
mom went home to shower.

391
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,515
- I can't get any air.
- No, it's gonna be okay, I promise.

392
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,483
Daria, find a large BP cuff
and put it around his thigh.

393
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,951
Heart rate's up to 135.

394
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,488
- Look in the drawer for a hemostat.
- Like a clamp?

395
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,819
Yeah. A needle driver,
anything. Come on.

396
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,656
- Do we have any albuterol in here?
- It's too much.

397
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,162
- He's not moving air well.
- Felix, talk to me.

398
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,493
- Who was the ricin for?
- It doesn't matter.

399
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,728
If we're gonna all die here,
you can tell us why. You owe us.

400
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,168
I was gonna send
it to a few officials.

401
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,706
- Systolic's only 84. DARIA:
This cuff is way too small.

402
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,844
- And I'm not finding any clamps.
- Okay.

403
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,707
I'm serious, this
guy needs a neb.

404
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,041
We don't normally keep
respiratory meds here.

405
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,209
- Check the cart. The bottles. FELIX:
Homeland security. What a joke.

406
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,356
We let anyone in. Anything
can happen. It's not right.

407
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,219
Neither is exposing innocent
people to a deadly biotoxin.

408
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,917
She has a point there, Felix.

409
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,962
My wife, she used to
work near the Pentagon.

410
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,600
She got killed by
one of the planes.

411
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,070
All right. I need
Prolene, get me Prolene.

412
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,064
What's Prolene?

413
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,069
Okay, so this is a dose
of Vancomycin now.

414
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,373
You're gonna go home
with this IV tonight.

415
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,881
In the morning, before your
test, come in, show your bracelet...

416
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,021
they're gonna give you
your second dose. Deal?

417
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,678
Deal. Thanks.

418
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,916
It's cool you're getting
your GED, you know.

419
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,526
I got tired of telling people
I dropped out of school.

420
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,287
Challenging
yourself. I admire that.

421
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,021
This is Devon, 8 years old.

422
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,565
Floor collapse, fell into a
basement. Injuries to chest and pelvis.

423
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,862
His mom, Hannah,
jumped to get to her kid.

424
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,938
- Arm looks broken, vitals okay.
- Okay. This way.

425
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,200
Mommy? HANNAH:
Devon, honey, I'm right here.

426
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,401
- Where are you? HANNAH:
Get me off of this thing.

427
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,741
- In a minute, ma'am.
- I need to see my son.

428
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,474
What's going on?
We're closed to trauma.

429
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,484
Accident was four blocks
away, the rig got authorization.

430
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,918
- I never...
- I did. Diverting an unstable kid...

431
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,649
across town would've been
crazy. I authorized them to come.

432
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,792
- Wake up.
- Sats only 82.

433
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,589
Throw me that. This
kid's not breathing.

434
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,129
Five-oh and a Mac two.

435
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,765
All right. I think I
got it. There we go...

436
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:43,959
God. Crap.

437
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,833
- Another Prolene?
- Oh, his sat's only 81.

438
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,304
- Turn up the 02.
- It's up. It's all the way up.

439
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,068
Felix? Felix?

440
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:55,277
I can't... Under...
She went out of snow.

441
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,939
He's altered and there's
no albuterol in here.

442
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,608
All right. Mac three and a 7-0.

443
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,153
Hang in there,
I'll be right back.

444
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,790
- What's a Mac?
- Macintosh laryngoscope...

445
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,654
size three, a 7-0 ET tube.

446
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,422
- Got it. We're going to intubate?
- We might have to.

447
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,430
- V-tach. I can't feel a pulse.
- All right. Start CPR.

448
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,625
I can't take my
hand out of here.

449
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,165
Come on. Let's Go.
Ryan, start compressions.

450
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,001
Daria, bag him. Tracy,
charge up the defibrillator.

451
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,666
Let's go. This is
the real thing now.

452
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,574
- Three-sixty?
- Yeah.

453
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,840
Put the paddles on the chest. Come
on. Put the paddles on the chest. Clear.

454
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,977
Go!

455
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,880
- Still V-tach.
- All right.

456
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,117
Resume compressions.
Daria, switch with me.

457
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,286
Put pressure on the artery
like your life depends upon it.

458
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,125
Tracy, give me that tube.

459
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,791
- It's for Jacob. There was only one.
- This guy's not breathing, Jacob is.

460
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,666
- He's a kid. His sats are dropping.
- Shock him again.

461
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,333
- Clear.
- All right.

462
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,302
You're gonna let some
innocent kid suffer...

463
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,470
and maybe die, to save a
low-life who tried to kill us?

464
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,913
Still V-tach. I'm sorry, but why
do you even want to save this guy?

465
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,246
Because we prioritize the sickest
patient. That's what we do here.

466
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,321
If you don't get it,
you don't belong.

467
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,584
Fine. Then you tell
that to the kid's mom.

468
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,899
All right. I'm in.

469
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,266
- Tape.
- Got it.

470
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,564
- Two milligrams?
- Yeah, give it to Daria...

471
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:31,074
and, uh, always hold the tube against
the soft palate until it's secured in.

472
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,370
Going again.

473
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,035
Clear.

474
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,750
- Still V-tach. Resuming.
- All right.

475
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,751
- What do I do with this?
- Squirt it in the tube.

476
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,855
- Good.
- Here you go.

477
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,014
That one's for Jacob,
two cc's in the IV.

478
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,723
Won't intravenous
epi mess with rhythm?

479
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,419
Maybe but it'll dilate
bronchioles, help oxygenate.

480
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,794
- All right. Do it. Chase it with a flush.
- Here goes.

481
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,428
No change. GATES: All right.

482
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,939
Shock him again, it might work
now with the drugs on board.

483
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,543
Clear.

484
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,378
Back in sinus.

485
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,816
- All right.
- Aren't we the heroes.

486
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,955
Come on. We just saved a guy's life.
- Dr. Gates, it worked.

487
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,613
Jacob's sats are coming up.
- Good.

488
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,085
- Hello? BANFIELD:
<i>It's Cate Banfield.</i>

489
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,422
How you guys doing?

490
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,326
Oh, honestly? We're
a little bored in here.

491
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,902
When you open the doors,
you'll be in a quarantine corridor.

492
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,581
What the hell?

493
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,345
This is so surreal.

494
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,682
- Gates, what do you got?
- Severed tibial artery.

495
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,121
- I got Vascular standing by.
- Status asthmaticus.

496
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:56,660
- He needs a terb drip in the ICU.
- I'll make sure they have room.

497
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,027
Four of us, dry martinis,
straight up with a twist.

498
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,534
You'll all be decontaminated
and admitted for observation.

499
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,967
I hope they've can
decontaminate our insides...

500
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,972
because we've been breathing
that crap for a long time.

501
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,109
- Ow!
- Positive Murphy sign. Any fever?

502
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,839
Yeah, white count's 24...

503
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,178
ultrasound showed
acalculous cholecystitis.

504
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,981
Looks like you're gonna need an
operation to take out your gallbladder.

505
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,954
- Will I have to stay home from school?
- For a few days.

506
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,857
- We'll be doing it laparoscopically.
- We'll only be making a tiny cut.

507
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:33,025
If you make a bigger cut,
could I stay home longer?

508
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,689
Don't like school, huh?

509
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,735
I just moved here and everyone
already knows each other.

510
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,395
- Did you write a preop note?
- Not yet.

511
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,541
It's hard, I know. I
just moved here too.

512
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:47,806
The girls in my new school, well,
they're all into being cool and making out.

513
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,578
I miss Detroit.

514
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,979
Listen, you don't wanna
be cool in 7th grade.

515
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,520
I don't? ANDREW: No way.

516
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,350
Seventh-grade
cool kids peak at 16.

517
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,516
Spend their lives
missing the glory days.

518
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,719
Me and Dr. Rasgotra here,
huge nerds at your age.

519
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,065
- Am I right?
- For sure.

520
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:12,061
- Got a trauma. They're asking for you.
- Make sure you get consent from mom.

521
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,068
You know, the truth is...

522
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,404
every cool adult will tell you
they were an unpopular kid.

523
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,878
- You're just saying that.
- No, it's like a rule of the universe.

524
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,210
- You'll see.
- I will?

525
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:28,843
Yeah. The adventure
is just beginning.

526
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,784
- Grab another cordis, this wire is kinked.
- Fluid in Morison's.

527
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,825
- He needs a repeat HemoCue.
- I'm on it.

528
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,059
Hey, hang in there. I
know it's hard to watch.

529
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,758
This is all my fault.

530
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,730
I took him with me
on the job. Ahem.

531
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,102
I don't have anyone to watch
him, stay with him after school.

532
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:50,941
Believe me, I get that.

533
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,601
I'm a locksmith.

534
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:56,146
The banks have us running ragged,
changing locks on foreclosed houses.

535
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,906
Sounds depressing.

536
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,886
Who knows why some people's
lives work out and others don't?

537
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,080
It all seems so random.

538
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,991
Yeah.

539
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,994
A subclavian's in, get the blood
bank to rush our packed cells.

540
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,632
Devon thought that he
saw a cat in the house...

541
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,166
and he went inside to see.

542
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,906
And the next thing I know he was
screaming through a hole in the floor.

543
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,735
Your tube's in the
right main stem.

544
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,108
- I know.
- Pull it back.

545
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,644
I put it there to decrease the risk
of pneumo during line placement.

546
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,783
- Then you should decrease tidal volume.
- Okay, you know what?

547
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,850
You need to stop
micromanaging everyone.

548
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,749
Do your job and I won't have to.
- Have this out later.

549
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,322
We need to get
him to surgery now.

550
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,254
Get Ortho in here,
reduce that arm.

551
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,925
- OR's ready.
- Okay, let's go. I'll update you soon.

552
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:48,090
- No, give her a moment with her son.
- You know, we don't have time for this.

553
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,099
Two minutes.

554
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,983
Listen, baby boy.

555
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,317
I want you to be
strong in there.

556
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,183
Okay?

557
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:15,659
Because if anything
happened to you...

558
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,728
the world would stop.

559
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,728
You know that, right?

560
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,232
We'll get them in here.

561
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,536
Felix made it to the OR.

562
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,840
Baby, they do it every
year. It's tradition.

563
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,142
- What about Jacob?
- Tucked away in the PICU.

564
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,912
They keep us overnight
the first day. It's a ritual.

565
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,021
Should be fun.

566
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,588
I love you too.

567
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,588
Kiss the kids goodnight.

568
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,720
- Why are you lying to your wife?
- She'd freak if she knew the truth.

569
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,058
Give her a little credit.
- Thanks.

570
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:01,496
Annie grew up in west Texas,
in a town with like 4000 people.

571
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,904
Never meant to end up
with a guy from Brooklyn.

572
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,774
She was totally against moving
to the city, but I fought for it.

573
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,575
Can't practice emergency
medicine out in the sticks.

574
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,342
Exactly.

575
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,418
- I talked her into this.
- Oh, boy.

576
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,750
She was nervous about
smog, traffic, purse snatchers.

577
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,719
So I can't quite bring myself
to tell her that on my first day...

578
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,624
I was the target of a
weapon of mass destruction.

579
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,389
Hey, you. GATES: Hi.

580
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,562
- You okay?
- Yeah.

581
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,863
Not coughing blood,
the night is still young.

582
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:35,633
Yeah, there's only eight more
hours till we find out if we're gonna die.

583
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:40,068
Okay, well, they're looking
for beds for you guys upstairs.

584
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,943
- Can I get you guys some lunch?
- Burgers, fries, onion rings, all on me.

585
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:48,019
I mean, after all, it could
be our last day this earth.

586
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,754
What's up, Ryan?
You a vegetarian?

587
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,061
Ryan. SAM: Oh!

588
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,392
Hey, we need a gurney here!

589
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,727
- Keloid cowboy can go home.
- He has a follow-up in Surgery Clinic.

590
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,892
Cholecystitis girl will
have to hang here.

591
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,800
She won't mind, she's
crushing on Dr. Andrew here.

592
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,431
- Too bad I only have eyes for you.
- Dusty, that boy's going to the OR.

593
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:14,569
- I'm pretty sure it's a liver lac.
- Tell them to prep. I'll be right there.

594
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,848
You wanna grab a coffee?

595
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,921
You know, after this settles down?
Or maybe a stiff drink's more in order.

596
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,853
- It's been quite a day.
- Yeah, it has.

597
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,618
I just thought we could
talk about what happened.

598
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:31,286
Don't mind her,
she's in a foul mood.

599
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,922
Today's her day off, she struck out
with Anspaugh, got into this mess.

600
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,499
- Anspaugh?
- She's on campaign to bring Lucien back.

601
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,163
I told her it was a lost
cause, but Neela's stubborn.

602
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,311
- Your uncle is worse.
- Yeah. Marisol, you work here...

603
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,140
Elective-surgery guys were
asking how they could help.

604
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,181
I suggested they take the
pancreatitis case off your plate.

605
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,013
That is, unless you wanted
to do that one yourself.

606
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,811
Are you for real?

607
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:01,323
- Got blood pressure yet?
- BP 85/51. It's too low to get access.

608
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,291
- Satting okay?
- Go back to the tent.

609
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,795
- Is it the ricin?
- You haven't been cleared yet.

610
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:10,026
- Is this what happens?
- Let's let Dr. Banfield fix him. Come on.

611
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,468
- Do you think it's the ricin?
- Seems early, but it's possible.

612
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,336
Brachial artery's here. Slightly
medial, you'll hit the vein.

613
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,705
Got a flash.

614
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,211
- Welcome back. REIDY:
Drug overdose in PEA.

615
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,146
Found him with a syringe
still connected to an IV.

616
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:28,151
- We're closed to trauma.
- He's wearing a County bracelet...

617
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,256
registered for today. Must've
wandered off for a drug fix.

618
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:36,127
- My cellulitis guy.
- All right, move him upstairs, let's go.

619
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,803
Resuming compressions.

620
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,907
Narcan's in.

621
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,734
- It's the fourth dose.
- Are we sure it's opiates?

622
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,439
Some guy told the paramedics
they shot heroin together an hour ago.

623
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,783
He has track marks
all over his ankles.

624
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,645
It's called a head-to-toe
exam for a reason.

625
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,288
Hold compressions.

626
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,395
- Still PEA.
- Another epi.

627
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,094
He was taking his
high-school equivalency.

628
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,602
He was not the type of guy
who was gonna shoot up.

629
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,731
You ask about IV drug use before you
sent him out with a portal into a vessel?

630
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,343
Not specifically, no.

631
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,412
You cannot judge people
based on what they're reading.

632
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,912
I expect you to know that.

633
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,019
Just heard from the CDC.

634
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,853
The ricin powder was
too coarse to vaporize.

635
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,323
No chance a toxic dose
could've got into the lungs.

636
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,092
That's good news, Frank.

637
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,164
Exam 2 needs to stay sealed
pending environmental detail.

638
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,426
That's a precaution.
Otherwise, we're clear.

639
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,332
Thanks, Frank.
Hold compressions.

640
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,802
No change.

641
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,676
- That's it, we're done.
- What?

642
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,379
Four rounds of cardiac meds
and still he's in agonal rhythm.

643
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,449
Core temp's dropping,
this guy's dead.

644
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,893
What's our EBL? - 400 cc's.

645
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,692
Not bad. Sponge.

646
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,459
NEELA: How's it going?

647
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:25,365
Liver lac, grade three,
just like you thought.

648
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,699
Repair's going
well, vitals are solid.

649
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,138
I think Andrew here
is a good-luck charm.

650
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,072
Irrigate right here.

651
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,645
I'll let the ER know.
Is it cool if I go, then?

652
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,476
Yeah, check out the sit-in
outside Anspaugh's office...

653
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,015
on your way out. NEELA: What?

654
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,244
Brenner organized
some kind of protest.

655
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,445
Everyone's talking about it.

656
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,930
- Dr. Dubenko has been an...
- What's going on?

657
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:59,003
We want Dubenko back.
Dr. Brenner says his uncle responds...

658
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,663
to the whole strength-in-numbers
concept. Sit down, join us.

659
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,901
No. I've, uh, got some
loose ends downstairs.

660
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,410
Be released. Not under
these circumstances.

661
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:10,038
When can I see Devon?

662
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,208
As soon as he's in
recovery, they'll let us know.

663
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,346
While you were asleep,
the police came by.

664
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,080
They investigated the house.

665
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,556
It seems the prior owner
intentionally broke a water pipe.

666
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,251
Flooded the whole first floor.

667
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,125
A "screw you" to the bank
for repossessing. We see that.

668
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:31,066
With the heat and humidity, the
floor boards rotted and just gave way.

669
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,066
Doesn't change the fact that
I've been dragging my son...

670
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,640
all over the South
Side changing locks.

671
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,271
He's only 8 years old.

672
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,271
He deserves to be
protected from the world.

673
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:49,812
You know, this idea that
we can protect our children...

674
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,153
you believe it
because you have to...

675
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,089
but it's an illusion.

676
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,727
So, what? It's all just luck?

677
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,791
All you can do is
hope for the best?

678
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,466
You love him, you
spend time with him...

679
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,664
that's all any kid wants.

680
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,312
One second she's
a raging bitch...

681
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,974
and the next she's
Mother Teresa. I don't get it.

682
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,313
Well, she's pretty good
at faking compassion.

683
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,353
Hey, I know you know this...

684
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,458
but what she said about
the OD, that was crap.

685
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,254
It wasn't your fault.

686
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,556
Thanks, Archie.

687
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:35,561
Hello?

688
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,163
Hello?

689
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,307
Disconnected every damn phone.

690
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,999
Pain assessment forms?

691
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,973
File them next to
the H & P sheets.

692
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,046
Okay. Patient satisfaction
surveys? These are all filled out.

693
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,115
I'll take those.

694
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:55,447
And this looks like an old handout
on renal failure by Greg Pratt.

695
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,784
- Should I toss it? It's from...
- No, you should not toss that.

696
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,290
- That's his work. That's his legacy.
- Dr. Morris.

697
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,451
- Mind if I give you feedback?
- Here we go.

698
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,688
- Control your emotions.
- Can we not do this?

699
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,026
- Act like a leader.
- Oh, come on.

700
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,963
All the criticism, the bullying. That's
how you get people to respect you?

701
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,368
You have been storming
around, sulking all day.

702
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,135
You are an Attending
physician, not a toddler.

703
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,511
Did you think that
I was finished?

704
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,520
You know what, lady? Shut up.

705
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,490
We have been through
hell here the last few weeks.

706
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,123
But somehow we're getting
through it. And you know how?

707
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:48,235
By showing up here every day
and dedicating ourselves to this work!

708
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,273
You don't know us.

709
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,911
You don't know this place.

710
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,511
And the last thing we need is
for some stranger to come in...

711
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,014
and tell us how it's done.

712
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,386
I know that you lost a friend...

713
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,290
and I'm sorry about that.

714
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:16,098
But we will never have a
conversation like this again.

715
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,728
Understand?

716
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,319
- Hey.
- Hey.

717
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,465
Can I, uh, talk to you?

718
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,327
Yeah. I'm all ears.

719
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,628
Thank you for what you did.

720
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,794
I mean, the thing for Lucien.

721
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:56,931
I don't know if it will work,
but I appreciate it. I really do.

722
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,736
No big deal.

723
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,006
And, um, you know, maybe
I'm being presumptuous here...

724
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:07,743
but, um, if this was in any way some
kind of gesture intended for, well...

725
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,515
me, I guess I just
wanna be clear.

726
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,958
Clear?

727
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,629
We're work colleagues,
and that's all.

728
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,197
I don't wanna go for
coffee or drinks with you.

729
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,800
Not now, not ever. Okay?

730
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,101
So let me get this straight.
Me going to bat for Lucien...

731
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:33,007
is actually some sort of, uh,
romantic overture to impress you?

732
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,438
You've lost me there.

733
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:40,847
But, um, don't worry about the
drinks. That's, uh, message received.

734
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,654
Dr. Brenner, your favorite
water-skier’s asking for you.

735
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,521
Thank you.

736
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,532
I've got the old records
on your thalassemia guy.

737
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,168
Thank you.

738
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,702
I called the pneumonia
kid's insurance company...

739
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:03,273
- told them we're not transferring.
- Perfect.

740
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,669
Uh, listen.

741
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,008
I know things have been a bit
rough with you and Dr. Morris today.

742
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,207
And I hope you don't mind
my saying, he's not himself.

743
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,979
He took Dr. Pratt's death
harder than any of us.

744
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,316
But he's a good guy,
he's a good doctor and...

745
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,754
I don't have a
problem with Dr. Morris.

746
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,393
- You don't?
- Nope.

747
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,019
He cares about his patients,
has an opinion, takes a stand.

748
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,656
And works his ass off, which is
more than I can say about you.

749
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,861
- Excuse me?
- You better get things in order, Frank.

750
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,370
It's a mess around here.

751
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:41,444
I can't believe they made
me throw away my shoes.

752
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:42,842
Louboutins.

753
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:46,348
- You know how much those cost?
- No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell us.

754
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,612
That was quite the first day, huh?
- You could say that.

755
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,552
I got to perform a liver
lac on an 8-year-old boy.

756
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,216
- That is so cool.
- Wait, so they're not admitting you?

757
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,885
No. You all heard the
ricin isn't dangerous, right?

758
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,302
What? So, what happened?

759
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:00,727
I mean, why'd you faint?

760
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,529
I was reading about psychosomatic
responses to perceived toxic threats.

761
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,193
Apparently, it's pretty common.

762
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,567
Oh, so you're a hypochondriac?

763
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,743
I said psychosomatic.
It's different.

764
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,312
Either way, you'll live to
see another day of scut.

765
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,143
Welcome to internship,
the dream starts now.

766
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,874
Cheers.

767
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,115
Hi. GATES: Hey.

768
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,121
Health Department said
you're cool to go. You're free.

769
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,922
- Sweet.
- Later.

770
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,458
See you, kids. DARIA: Bye.

771
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,255
Bye.

772
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,625
- Cute couple.
- Yeah.

773
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,265
- So when are you going to class?
- Forget it.

774
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,408
- It's a bad idea.
- What? Why?

775
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,839
I'm missing work, I'm
barely there for Alex.

776
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,275
The last thing I need
is to complicate my life.

777
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,440
I don't know what happened, but you're
a kick-ass nurse and a good mother...

778
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,110
and this is something you
should do. You'd be great at it.

779
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,520
- Really?
- Yes.

780
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,127
Besides, I wanna spend time
with Sarah and Alex anyway.

781
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,453
All right. I mean, I
guess I can make it...

782
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,825
- if I really hurry.
- Of course you can. Go.

783
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,932
I'm just gonna get some beer,
we're gonna play quarters...

784
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,433
spark up the bong.

785
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,837
Hey.

786
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,298
I'm glad you didn't die today.

787
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,636
<i>The whole department was there.</i>

788
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,374
Doctors, nurses, techs, clerks.

789
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,883
They were all sat outside
Anspaugh's office...

790
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,315
<i>demanding your return.</i>

791
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,979
Can we talk about this
later? I'm about to go out.

792
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,283
What's there to talk about?

793
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,825
<i>These things
happen for a reason.</i>

794
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,619
Maybe it really is
time to move on.

795
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:39,957
Time for a new chapter.

796
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,498
You belong at County.
You know it and I know it.

797
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,828
Don't make me beg.

798
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,130
It's healthy to change
things up, you know?

799
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,500
- I was stagnating there.
<i>- Oh, that's bollocks.</i>

800
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,968
That's what my yogi says, and
I'm telling you, he's always right.

801
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,208
Lucien...

802
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,316
don't be an idiot.
Come back to work.
