1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,406
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,339
There, you got us.
Gates is my boyfriend.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,673
- Ah, you got in.
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,613
It's a little on the pricey side,
but for you there will be a discount.

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,911
You can't abandon me in
the middle of my training.

6
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,110
Not my responsibility

7
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,007
- You need to get laid.
- Oh, is that right?

8
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,295
Yeah, I'm pretty certain of it.

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,421
We're gonna be okay.
So let's just get past it.

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,086
Let's just go someplace new.

11
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,460
We got room for one
more. Who's it gonna be?

12
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,844
Gates, the board's a mess.
You're only seeing three patients.

13
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,278
- Feel free to pitch in.
- No. My job is to supervise and teach.

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,383
- Your job is to move the meat.
- Morris.

15
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,486
When I was a resident, I
had what's called a work ethic.

16
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:56,123
- Yes. You set the bar high.
- Oh, you bet I did.

17
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,488
It's not as easy as it looks, I
gotta keep an eye on you guys.

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,288
- Dr. Dubenko.
- Frank.

19
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,329
Exam 3 is clear. Bring me
syncope, impetigo and nausea.

20
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,228
Poor guy. I heard he just quit.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,459
- Dubenko?
- No way.

22
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,626
- I'm looking for Dr. Lockhart.
- Me too.

23
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,466
When you see her, tell her I
need one more prescription.

24
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,972
There's something in his eye.
- What happened?

25
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,840
Down the street from the explosion.
They said it was an ambulance.

26
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,504
- Who went in that rig?
- Get Bardelli on the radio.

27
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,379
Set up the trauma rooms.

28
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,678
Dumar, you seen Sam? - No.

29
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,618
- All right. Let's roll.
- I didn't get a call.

30
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,686
<i>Unit 62 respond to
explosion and car fire...</i>

31
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,760
<i>800 block South Michigan.</i>

32
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,421
This is unit 62
responding. Go. Drive.

33
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,368
Hold on. Hold on
Hold on, hold on.

34
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,165
Sam.

35
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,782
Ow!

36
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,364
Grab another line.

37
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,043
- Greg, are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so. What about...?

38
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,481
What about the guys in the back?

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,583
- Hey, Bardelli.
- Hey, Bards. Come on. Wake up, man.

40
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,116
You need to sit, wait
for the paramedic.

41
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,955
- I'm an ER doc at County, so is he.
- We can help.

42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,597
All right. You can assess him.

43
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,496
- How's your neck? Any pain?
- My stomach.

44
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,502
Oh, man.

45
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,103
Dannaker, we need a saw.

46
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,740
You get your guy to
the sidewalk. I got him.

47
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,933
All right, just hang
in there, Bards.

48
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,439
- Abby? What are you doing here?
- Wrong place, wrong time.

49
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,212
- How's your breathing?
- Something hit my jaw.

50
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,080
- I think I broke my wrist.
- Bardelli's impaled.

51
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,658
He needs two large
bore IVs, some 02...

52
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,591
Don't worry. There're on
it, okay? You're the patient.

53
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,526
- Sit down.
- I can still work with one.

54
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,997
Come on, guys. This is stupid.
We could be helping out, triaging.

55
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,797
You've been walking on this?
You have an open fracture.

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,371
- It just stings a little.
- Irrigate with saline.

57
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,245
It's just a little
blood, I'm all right.

58
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,709
- When I said I thought you needed...
- Shut up.

59
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,178
We've got trauma.

60
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,517
Okay, everyone needs
to sign in at the window.

61
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,855
We'll get to you as soon as we can.
- Clear a path.

62
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,928
- Gates, are they okay?
- Yeah, so far.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,531
Out of the way. Move.
How're you doing, Bards?

64
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,895
- Pressure's up to 90.
- Hold an O.R. for him.

65
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,060
Hey, Greg. Sorry about this.

66
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,729
Broken jaw, open fibula.
Pulse ox is borderline.

67
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,966
- Hang tough, Greg.
- Mm-hm.

68
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,310
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Got a facial fracture. Shouldn't talk.

69
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,448
Neela, Brenner. I
need you with Bardelli.

70
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,777
- We're on it. SAM:
One, two, three.

71
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,648
Trauma panel, chest,
facial series and tib-fib.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,257
- Sats are 93. SAM:
Open up, buddy.

73
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,289
Need a gram of Ancef,
a hundred of gent.

74
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,553
Some jelly for the belly.
- 110 over 70.

75
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,562
Small lac to the oropharynx.

76
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,224
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Everybody, stop. Stop, stop.

77
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,336
Give me one percent
with epi gel foam.

78
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,169
Morris, Sam, stay here.
Abby, go fix your wrist.

79
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,899
- Gates, get in there with Bardelli.
- I'm fine.

80
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,271
No. Go. Go.

81
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:15,347
You heard the man. 27
gauge on a 3 cc syringe.

82
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,952
Hey, Brenner, you better
be teaching in there, man.

83
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,315
- What do you guys need?
- Lateral C-spine. Deep breath.

84
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,983
- How is he?
- He's good enough to boss us around.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,492
Kaya, pre-op antibiotics.

86
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,824
Ceftriaxone covers gram
positives and negatives.

87
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,523
Okay, but not the anaerobes.
Ertepenum gets them all.

88
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,031
Tony, do you mind
calling my mom?

89
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,075
I don't want her to hear
something on the news.

90
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,368
- No problem. MARQUEZ:
First unit of O-neg is up.

91
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,838
- Might as well intubate.
- He's got a good airway.

92
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,273
- Need it for surgery.
- We have anesthesiology.

93
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,436
Put in a central
line, take him to O.R.

94
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,310
I'm gonna make that
call. You guys all right?

95
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,115
Yeah.

96
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,356
- How's that feel?
- Much better.

97
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,319
- There you are.
- Mrs. Gaines, this is not a good time.

98
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,657
Oh. Oh, dear.

99
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,459
- Yes. Should I...?
- Come back later.

100
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,797
Oh, yes.

101
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,372
- Did I see Luka stop by today?
- Mm-hm.

102
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,811
- And?
- And I think things are gonna be okay.

103
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,580
I'm glad to hear that.

104
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,081
Everything was going really
well until the ambulance blew up.

105
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,510
Thanks.

106
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:32,591
- How about we x-ray your ankle?
- No, it's just a sprain. Thank you.

107
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,293
Hold up. Here. I'll take those.

108
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,559
Bleeding stopped with epi.
- Yeah, I told you it would.

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,062
- This doesn't make sense.
- What?

110
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,842
There's no fracture. The
tibia and fibula are intact.

111
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,808
- Did they x-ray the wrong leg?
- No.

112
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,414
- Pratt, that's not your bone.
- What?

113
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,719
- Two-inch bony fragment.
- Yeah, it's someone else's.

114
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,223
- Someone from the back of the rig?
- Most likely.

115
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,362
Ugh. Gnarly.

116
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,865
- Good thing you sat up front.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,698
- Let me numb it up.
- No, just pull that out.

118
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,938
- Without local?
- You sure?

119
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,234
- Yeah.
- Okay.

120
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,257
Send that up for
HIV and hepatitis.

121
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,121
- Pulse ox down to 88.
- Put him on 100 percent.

122
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,955
Pneumothorax on the chest x-ray?

123
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,596
No, diffuse
bilateral contusions.

124
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,163
Blast lung.

125
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,834
Shock wave caused
bleeding throughout the chest.

126
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,799
I know.

127
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,064
It might get worse
before it gets better.

128
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,866
I'll get the non-rebreather.

129
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,447
Hey, how come
he's not in the O.R.?

130
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,844
Surgery wants
a central line first.

131
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,917
- How you doing, Lou?
- Hanging in there.

132
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,647
- How's Greg?
- Uh, sats are down.

133
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,356
Hang two more o-neg.

134
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,017
We're giving her real time
guidance in the sterile field.

135
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,323
- Is that the IJ?
- Perfect.

136
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,762
- Can you see, doctor?
- It's crystal clear.

137
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,528
Decreased breath sounds.
- Pulse ox is dropping.

138
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,501
The damaged alveoli
are filling with fluid.

139
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,836
We need to talk
about intubation.

140
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,211
Okay. Do it.

141
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,142
- Etomidate and sux are ready.
- Push it.

142
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,909
- Lower his head.
- Assisting ventilations.

143
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,980
Morris, don't screw this up.

144
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,230
- Abby, you want to give it a try?
- With this?

145
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,304
- Gates.
- I think he wanted you to do it.

146
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,573
You know, I need to step back
and keep an eye on the big picture.

147
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,081
I'm running this,
you're doing it.

148
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:16,752
- All right. Laryngoscope and suction.
- Sats up to 90.

149
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,857
I need a doctor in here.

150
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,854
I got it. Check the cuff.

151
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,328
We have an end-tidal detector?
- Ready to go.

152
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,262
Jasmine. She has
tight wheezing...

153
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,231
she was in back
of a burning car.

154
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,667
- I couldn't get my seat belt off.
- Hmm.

155
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,069
That must have been scary, huh?

156
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,869
Can you sit forward?
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

157
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,738
I have moderate
persistent asthma.

158
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,849
I'm on inhaled
Beclomethasone, Albuterol...

159
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,612
and an oral
leukotriene modifier.

160
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,845
You know a lot.

161
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,090
Can you tilt your head
back? Who's with her?

162
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,892
Uh, the nanny. She's
calling her mom right now.

163
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,529
No evidence of thermal damage.

164
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:00,064
I'll be back. Keep her on ten
an hour. Order a portable chest.

165
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,861
You got it.

166
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,867
- See the cords?
- Too much blood.

167
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,903
What about cricoid?

168
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,041
Anatomy's distorted.
You're making it worse.

169
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,939
Pulse ox down to 80.

170
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,572
All right. That's
enough, bag him up.

171
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,546
You do this, Arch, you're
better at it. Here. Come on.

172
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,386
- Open up a 7-0 and a bougie.
- I need the rapid infuser.

173
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,621
- What's with Bardelli?
- Might bleed out.

174
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,637
Neela still in there?
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,633
- Let's take another look.
- We're here if she needs us.

176
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,231
- Chuny? MARQUEZ:
They're tubing him.

177
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,238
- It's not slowing down.
- Okay, apply more pressure.

178
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,241
The blood's from deeper
inside. Maybe a mesenteric artery.

179
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,174
- Need the O.R.
- You over-transfused.

180
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,180
Got his pressure up, blew a
clot. Was fine when he got here.

181
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,749
Why didn't you say something?

182
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,819
Because I didn't hear, I
was busy with the central line.

183
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,353
- What have we got?
- Lucien?

184
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,955
Abdominal penetration.

185
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,616
- Exit wound hemorrhage.
- TKO the fluids, hang FFP and platelets.

186
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,817
Are you back at work?

187
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,124
I heard the news on the radio, I
figured you might need my help.

188
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,858
Crap, they still haven't got it.

189
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,204
- I see the epiglottis. GATES:
That's as far as I got too.

190
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,364
- Everything's to the right.
- Use my hand.

191
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,373
- I'll hold when you see cords.
- Sats are drifting down.

192
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,681
Forget it. There's no way.

193
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,511
- Wanna try the bougie?
- I can't see the larynx.

194
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,882
- Fiber optic's here.
- I'll set it up.

195
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,385
- Too much blood for that.
- You want to try again?

196
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,457
He needs oxygen.
He needs a crike.

197
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,958
- We can try to go retrograde...
- We're criking.

198
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,653
- No crike trays.
- Check the hall.

199
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,730
Pulse ox in the seventies.

200
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,561
Okay, forget the tray. I need
an 11 blade and a Shiley.

201
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,533
- I got 10 blade here.
- Where the hell are the Shileys?

202
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,071
Run of v-tach,
open the crash cart.

203
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,072
- Sam, you have bandage scissors?
- Yeah?

204
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,835
Get over here.

205
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,374
Morris, what are
you doing? Bag him.

206
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,006
- Morris, what are you doing?
- Hey!

207
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,153
Cut the drip chamber right here.

208
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,920
Bag him up.

209
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,233
- Good chest rise.
- What the hell was that?

210
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,171
- Sats are coming up.
- All right. All right.

211
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,943
You still need a crike tray?

212
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,716
Rose Franklin, 10 foot fall.

213
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,513
Another one from the explosion?

214
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,053
Got knocked down an access well.

215
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,521
- Concussion, hip fracture.
- Warm up the head CT.

216
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,754
One, two, three.

217
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,396
Ma'am, are you having any pain?

218
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,725
- Kaya?
- Trauma panel, UA, type and hold...

219
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,799
- c-spine, chest and pelvis.
- Good.

220
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,965
- How you doing, Rose?
- Norman Chapman, tibia fracture.

221
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,730
- Rose, it's Norman. I'm right here.
- She's a relative?

222
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,875
No. She's a complete
and total stranger.

223
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,637
Norman's a real hero. He
jumped right in to save her.

224
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,905
- Ten feet down at least, right?
- At least.

225
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,580
I broke my leg when I landed...

226
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,582
and then I crawled out
with her on my back.

227
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,813
Wow. Okay. Start your
primary assessment.

228
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,385
- Hey, am I gonna have to miss work?
- What do you do?

229
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,154
- I'm a website debugger.
- Like a programmer?

230
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,389
Uh, not really. I
beta test websites.

231
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,556
I click on them a
couple thousand times...

232
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,065
try to get them to crash.

233
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,261
Chuny, I heard they
brought Bardelli in.

234
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,565
Oh, yeah. They took
him up to the O.R.

235
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,435
Who was he riding with?

236
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,000
They'll have to wire his jaw...

237
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,907
and then he'll go to the
ICU until his lungs heal.

238
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,606
With all the facial trauma,
we had to crike him.

239
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,115
Uh-huh.

240
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,584
His vitals are stable,
he's oxygenating well.

241
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,188
You have any questions?

242
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,091
I'm good.

243
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,290
Inflate the cuff,
hook up the vent.

244
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,656
Hey, Chaz.

245
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,422
How are you doing, man?

246
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,525
You can't talk with that thing?

247
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,102
Good, so you get to listen
to me tell everybody...

248
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,366
about how many times I
kicked your ass on the court.

249
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,480
"I'm busy now. Can I
ignore you some other time?"

250
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,174
I'll check on you later, okay.

251
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,852
Dr. Lockhart. Mrs. Escalante.

252
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,215
- Hi.
- My mom.

253
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,515
- Hello.
- How's she doing?

254
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,453
Um...

255
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,958
Okay, well, her pulse ox is
up to a hundred, which is good.

256
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,025
- You're funny.
- Jasmine. Come on. Honey.

257
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,168
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

258
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,530
- You don't look fine.
- She's acting weird.

259
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,071
Can you sit up, sweetie? Okay.

260
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,470
Well, the wheezing's improved.

261
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,138
- Dropped her BP.
- What's happening?

262
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,147
Bolus 250 of saline. Repeat
CBC, and abdominal ultrasound.

263
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,582
- Need to check for internal bleeding.
- Shouldn't you have done that?

264
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,415
You've been in the other
room this whole time.

265
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,594
What's up with his neck?

266
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,393
Whoa. That wasn't there before.

267
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,065
- Get surgery, right now.
- Call for four units.

268
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,838
There's a pulsatile
mass. It's expanding.

269
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,215
There's no bleeding in
the chest or abdomen.

270
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,879
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.

271
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,048
I'm checking on a bunch of things.
- Mom.

272
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,457
I'll get back to you as soon as
I get some more results, okay?

273
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,395
- Hey, excuse me, are you a doctor?
- Yeah.

274
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,966
You think my leg is broken?

275
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,626
- X-ray's been ordered.
- Never rock against the teeth.

276
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,897
Um, you know what?

277
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,906
- Does this hurt?
- Ah.

278
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,704
It's probably fractured.

279
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,972
I jumped into a courtyard
to save that lady.

280
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,376
Really?

281
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,629
- You see the cords?
- Yeah.

282
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,881
Every day, I get a pop and I
get pretzels from the snack bar.

283
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,080
Today, I thought, "I'm
gonna get a burger."

284
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,623
And it was like fate put
me there to save her.

285
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,626
- That's great.
- I'm in, bag her.

286
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,797
She was talking when I brought
her in. Is she gonna be okay?

287
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,060
It's a possible epidural, we're
gonna take her to head CT.

288
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,795
- She's strong, she'll pull through.
- Okay, I have to...

289
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,769
I don't know how I did it.

290
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,843
I was in pain, I was desperate and I
was in a deep hole. Then I remembered:

291
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,242
"When you feel there's no hope,
You're at the end of your rope..."

292
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,905
- What's the rush?
- It's Greg.

293
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,278
"And there's a
hero inside of you."

294
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,011
Ha-ha-ha! The song was right.

295
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,755
- A second Yankauer.
- Hang another two units.

296
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,018
- What happened?
- Expanding neck hematoma.

297
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,127
He dehisced the lac.
- A sponge stick.

298
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,995
- Do you think he's gonna aspirate?
- Trach tube has a cuff.

299
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,203
- He was doing okay. NEELA:
Piece of mandible cut his carotid.

300
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,601
- We should have seen this.
- Unless he cut the artery, it took time.

301
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,832
Got it.

302
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,636
Okay, Betadine
and cut-down tray.

303
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,290
- What are you doing?
- I need to tie off his carotid.

304
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,177
- Tying off his carotid?
- It'll cut off blood to half his brain.

305
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,808
- Paralysis and aphasia.
- Collaterals through the circle of Willis.

306
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,315
There's an open artery. I can let him
bleed out or accept the risk of a stroke.

307
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,460
Think he's gonna
die if you don't?

308
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,693
You understand?

309
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,702
Should I call Dad?

310
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,572
- How about Bettina?
- Try her cell.

311
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,372
Some burning with lido.

312
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,979
Abby, right now.

313
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,484
Multifocal PVC's,
runs of v-tach.

314
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,523
Where's the blood gas?

315
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,055
- Her pH is very low.
- What is that?

316
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,308
- Retract anterior.
- Superficial bleeders.

317
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,496
They have enough doctors in
there. My daughter needs you.

318
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,229
Okay, all right. Okay. Um...

319
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,442
She's got a profound gap acidosis,
but her oxygen level is normal.

320
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,273
- Did she ingest anything?
- Uh, yeah.

321
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,677
That's it. That's
probably it. Cyanide.

322
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,049
Mix two grams of
hydroxo-cobalamin. That's the antidote.

323
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,383
Sometimes, when a car
interior burns, it releases cyanide.

324
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,718
As soon as it gets
here we'll give it to her.

325
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,521
Fix the light, I can't
see a damn thing.

326
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,927
- Try to stop the...
- Everybody, stop! Stop! Shh. Quiet!

327
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,930
Let her work.

328
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,028
Releasing the clamp.

329
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,869
Field is dry.

330
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,538
Morris?

331
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,247
- You got it.
- All right.

332
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,656
Okay, I'll close with steri-strips.
- Systolic at 100.

333
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,454
Give me that.

334
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,897
You're supposed to run
this in over 30 minutes.

335
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,091
- Abby.
- Is that safe?

336
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,828
It's okay to push it faster
if the heart's in trouble.

337
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,065
This binds with the
cyanide to form a vitamin.

338
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,135
Normal sinus. ABBY:
See? She's coming around.

339
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,280
V-fib. MORRIS: Damn it.

340
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,676
Starting compressions.

341
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:13,308
- Call for bypass. NEELA:14
French femoral catheters.

342
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,756
Trauma 1. They're
waiting for you.

343
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,097
Somebody going on bypass?

344
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,504
It's Pratt. They're doing CPR.

345
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,476
- Lines are primed.
- Clear of bubbles. Ready to go.

346
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,076
We can stop bagging and
compressions because the bypass...

347
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,281
It does all the work of
the heart and the lungs.

348
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,219
- Pulse ox is coming up.
- That's good.

349
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,856
He's in an agonal rhythm.

350
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,122
But we don't treat it now.
We wait for the bypass to work.

351
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,561
- Is it a compound fracture?
- No, it's spiral.

352
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,069
You have to fall a
long way to get a spiral?

353
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,834
- Yeah, it takes a bit of force.
- Yeah, I know.

354
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,569
- Did you hear about how this happened?
- Several times.

355
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,044
Swelling, but no
bleed on Head CT.

356
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,483
Excellent.

357
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,142
Actually, that's a
bad concussion.

358
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,316
And a nasty pelvic fracture.

359
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,254
Hey. You're doing
okay, Rose? It's Norman.

360
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,259
I'm right here. Hey,
open your eyes.

361
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,691
It might take a bit of time.

362
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:37,532
- How long?
- I can't really say.

363
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,840
All leads are isoelectric.

364
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:47,244
- So his brain's not working?
- Not right now.

365
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,376
- He wasn't down for that long.
- We started CPR right away.

366
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,646
He never had prolonged hypoxia.
- Guys, guys.

367
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,284
- It could have been an air embolus.
- That would do it.

368
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,791
A blast injury puts
air into the circulation.

369
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,089
And the air goes
up into the brain.

370
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,460
- And that's it? DOCTOR:
Well, the brain can still recover.

371
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,771
We'll wait four hours. Then we'll
check Auditory Evoked Responses...

372
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,775
and an Apnea Test before
making any decisions.

373
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,740
I'll come back.

374
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,213
We should get Bettina.

375
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,046
I left a message on her cell.
- Keep trying.

376
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,503
Listen, I don't think we
all need to be in here.

377
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,979
There's nothing more
we can do for now.

378
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,114
We'll take shifts.

379
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,285
There's a lot of patients.

380
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,923
He would tell us to get out
there and take care of business.

381
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,655
That's what he'd say.

382
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,722
Tony?

383
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,485
Pressure's down. 90 over 60.

384
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,651
- 500 of saline, check a crit.
- Is she bleeding in her pelvis?

385
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,094
Wasn't that impressive on the CT.
Maybe we got behind on her fluids.

386
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,927
- I wanna push Vitamin K.
- What for?

387
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,934
- She's probably on Coumadin.
- We never got a history.

388
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,267
She's in A fib. ST segments
are consistent with digoxin use.

389
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,671
- She's probably on a blood thinner too.
- Makes sense.

390
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,678
I suppose Vitamin K couldn't
hurt. Let's get her to trauma.

391
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,839
Call the blood bank for FFP.

392
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,853
- Pretty smart for a med student.
- Book smart, she's got a ways to go.

393
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,784
Whoa, wait up, guys.
I was crutch training.

394
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:13,187
- We're moving to another room.
- You gotta keep me in the loop here.

395
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,228
It's an ancient Chinese proverb, "He
who saves a life is responsible for it."

396
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,062
No cardiac activity.

397
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,409
It's only been two hours.

398
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,017
I need to ask you
about something.

399
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,952
Listen, in Greg's wallet,
he has an organ donor card.

400
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,526
I wanna make sure that's okay.

401
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,391
He's not dead yet.

402
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,837
If it comes to that,
then do what he wanted.

403
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,170
You've been here a
long time. Take a break.

404
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,176
I'm fine.

405
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:22,354
Hi, Bettina, it's Sam again from
the ER. Call us when you get this.

406
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,831
Excuse me. Excuse me.

407
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,928
Crit's down to 24.

408
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,731
- Did you re-check her ProTimes?
- ProTime's good.

409
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,430
- Only 80 over 40.
- She might not make it to angio.

410
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,406
- We could try preperitoneal packing.
- Excuse me?

411
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,910
Suprapubic incision,
leave the peritoneum intact.

412
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,775
Lap pads on either
side of bladder.

413
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,281
- We had good success in Nicaragua.
- In Nicaragua?

414
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,443
I volunteer summers in a rural
hospital. High trauma, low tech.

415
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,454
- I thought ortho was admitting.
- Uh, unstable pelvis.

416
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,924
- You ever hear of preperitoneal packing?
- Yeah, they do it in Europe. It works.

417
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:14,627
- Shall I?
- Yeah. Ten centimeter incision.

418
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,699
- Just like a C-section.
- You've done those too?

419
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,467
Mm-hm.

420
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,036
Where are we with Greg?

421
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:29,374
It's been four hours,
the neurologist is back.

422
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:32,677
Good. All the way down
to the pre-sacral space.

423
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:41,154
- Uh, can someone help Norman, please?
- Pressure's up. Angio can take her.

424
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,851
Well, she doesn't need the O.R.

425
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,862
You're lucky to have such
an experienced med student.

426
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,062
Okay, let's go.

427
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:04,574
- EEG remained isoelectric.
- No brain stem-evoked responses.

428
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,914
Blood gas after ten
minutes. PC02 is 74.

429
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,890
74?

430
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,493
Anything over 60
means brain death.

431
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,226
I'm so sorry, Chaz.

432
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,040
What are you doing?

433
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,377
Chaz, there are no
vital signs to monitor.

434
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,281
Not yet.

435
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,114
Can you please just keep this
thing going a couple more hours?

436
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:46,588
No, no. He could come
back. Maybe he'll come back.

437
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:50,456
His heart's gone,
his brain's gone.

438
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,426
We're pronouncing him.

439
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,711
He's still warm.

440
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,245
Yeah, that's just
the bypass machine.

441
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,983
We need to keep him
on it to perfuse the organs.

442
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,626
Neela's gonna take
him to the O.R. now.

443
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,248
I wanna stay with him.

444
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:52,285
- I wanna push his gurney.
- Of course.

445
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,101
He's going upstairs.

446
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,573
DVT's admitted and Biliary colic
goes home with instructions...

447
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,808
- to lay off the cheeseburgers.
- Great. Thanks.

448
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,552
It's pretty quiet in here, guys.
You can take another hour.

449
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,588
And do what?

450
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:10,423
I, uh, I wanted to be there, but I thought
it was more important to cover Morris.

451
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,224
- It was a really beautiful service.
- Yeah.

452
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,893
A bunch of stuff came. It's a gift
basket from Dr. Weaver in Florida.

453
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,164
And this, it's... Comes
all the way from Africa.

454
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,173
- John Carter?
- Yeah.

455
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,311
It means a person's
soul'll live forever.

456
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,640
We're supposed to
leave it by the grave.

457
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,240
We should get caught up with
your patients, and we'll jump in.

458
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,443
Okay. I need to change.

459
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,985
Hey, guys.

460
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,682
I was gonna drop Bettina off at
home, but she wanted to stop by.

461
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:42,589
Since I didn't get to speak
to you all at the church...

462
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:47,631
You were... You
were a family to Greg.

463
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,032
He loved you all very
much. You should know that.

464
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,937
- I've got a sick one, here.
- We're on it.

465
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,633
Fever, low BP, altered,
and a broken leg.

466
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,211
I remember that guy.
He'll talk your ear off.

467
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:06,181
Not today. Two liters of
saline. Set up for intubation.

468
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,117
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

469
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,518
- It was nice to see Luka at the funeral.
- Yeah.

470
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,353
- Is he coming to Ike's?
- No, he had a plane to catch.

471
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,223
- It's good to see you together.
- Amen to that.

472
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,832
- Neela, they need you in Trauma.
- Do I have time to get into my scrubs?

473
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,695
Of course not.

474
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,536
Luka said something
about an interview in Boston.

475
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:31,371
Yeah, we were thinking about
moving, but now I'm not so sure.

476
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,403
It's hard to imagine
leaving this place.

477
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,016
What do you need?

478
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,880
Fever and sepsis. We're
looking for the source.

479
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,020
- Bingo.
- Well, it feels fluctuant.

480
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,187
- Would you like the honors?
- Please don't make me put on gloves.

481
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,763
Eighteen gauge.

482
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,341
Little pus.

483
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,868
- He needs a wash-out in the O.R.
- That sounds about right.

484
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,244
Excuse me. Hello.

485
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,542
Yeah, no worries, I can talk.

486
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,792
Are you feeling better?

487
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,888
I just needed a minute.

488
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,728
I meant, better
from the surgery.

489
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,093
Oh, yeah. I'm, uh... I'm
going back to work on Monday.

490
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,431
Oh, that's good.

491
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,074
I mean, that you're ready.

492
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:44,572
But it's also good that you have a
little more time off as well, you know.

493
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,914
Oh, man.

494
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,578
What?

495
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,926
I'm not sure how to do this.

496
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,064
Do what?

497
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,738
I've been holding
onto something.

498
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,004
And I didn't know
the right time.

499
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:20,310
And now I know there's
never gonna be a right time.

500
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,373
This is for you.

501
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,644
It was in Greg's pocket
on the day he died.

502
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,207
You know, that guy got hurt
last week, trying to be a hero.

503
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,843
Yeah.

504
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,702
Uh...

505
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,212
I've been thinking a
lot about last week.

506
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,375
And about how Pratt wouldn't
let me get on that ambulance.

507
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,987
So I don't wanna waste time.

508
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,189
I wouldn't be with you if I didn't
think we could have something real.

509
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,925
I feel the same.

510
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,002
Sam, Gates, you
guys know about Ike's?

511
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,262
Yeah.

512
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,737
We'll try to start around 8:30.

513
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,570
If anyone has anything
they wanna say, you know.

514
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,679
Share a story or a memory.
That would be the time.

515
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:58,510
You know, can you hang up
or take that someplace else?

516
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:02,051
- Sorry, that was Anspaugh.
- Uncle Donnie?

517
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:09,891
He thought that everyone should know
they were going to offer Greg the job.

518
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,088
He was going to be
the chief of the ER.

519
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,368
Excuse me.

520
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,711
Hey. Chaz. Wait up.

521
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:33,579
- Hey, we're all going to Ike's tonight.
- I don't think so.

522
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,880
Everybody's gonna be there.

523
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:39,286
- I already went to the funeral.
- This is different.

524
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,590
I've been doing it all day.

525
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,491
Shaking hands, getting hugs.

526
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,656
They say, "Are you okay?"
And I smile and I nod.

527
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,062
I can't do it anymore.

528
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:56,140
I've lost a lot of people in my
life, but not like this. Not a brother.

529
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:01,303
But I think you're gonna miss
out on something if you don't go.

530
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,143
- Tonight's about remembering him.
- You all get to do that.

531
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,309
He worked here for eight years.
I only knew him for a couple.

532
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,750
I was trying to catch up on
the 18 that I missed out on.

533
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,186
- I was just starting to know him.
- I'm sorry.

534
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,262
Have a good time at your party.

535
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,769
I looked on a medical
website. It was probably a virus.

536
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,003
I didn't even think
about under my cast.

537
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,149
Not a good idea to scratch
your skin with a wire coat hanger.

538
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,614
The itching was driving me nuts.

539
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,016
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is this an unusual case?

540
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,783
Do you think you could
write this up for the journals?

541
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,358
I think you need
rest. And so do I.

542
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,791
Hello there. Someone
wanted to see you.

543
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:54,364
Oh, my God. I didn't know you
made it. They wouldn't give information.

544
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,866
- I couldn't see you, I'm not a relative.
- Norman, easy.

545
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,336
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Thank you.

546
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:05,204
- Thank you for saving me.
- You look fantastic.

547
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,039
We'll let the two
of you catch up.

548
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,848
- So are you going to Ike's?
- Mm-hm.

549
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,380
- Should I wait for you?
- No.

550
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:34,601
He's taking a leak and he
finds Morris hiding in a stall...

551
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,367
on his cell phone getting
advice about a case.

552
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,410
And he storms back
to the desk and tells me:

553
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,843
"That kid couldn't find
his ass with both hands."

554
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,749
- And Pratt was always right.
- Yeah, very funny. Very funny.

555
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,252
Okay. Excuse me, everybody.

556
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,617
Um, tonight's not about
speeches or anything...

557
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,626
but I was gonna say something, I
was wondering if anybody else...

558
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,559
- If...
- Hold on.

559
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,926
Sorry.

560
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,194
This is from the church. I
thought it should be here.

561
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,939
Who, uh...? Who wants to start?

562
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,225
A couple of years ago,
after Michael died...

563
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:39,402
Greg helped me through
the hardest time of my life...

564
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,335
and I don't think I ever
thanked him enough for that.

565
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,299
Chaz.

566
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,954
Before I met Greg, I
was, uh, pretty clueless.

567
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,062
He taught me that
anything is possible.

568
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,758
He taught me not to be scared.

569
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:14,170
And helped me to realize who I was
and the kind of person I wanted to be.

570
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,640
I got this from UNOS.

571
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:25,682
A 15-year-old
girl in Nebraska...

572
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,116
a father of three in Maryland,
and a college student in Texas...

573
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,314
all got organs from Greg.

574
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,894
He saved three lives that day.

575
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,729
You know, uh, sometimes
after a really gnarly shift...

576
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,861
Greg would drag me over here.

577
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,064
He'd buy me a beer and we
would, uh... We would share...

578
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,144
an order of his all-time favorite
deep-fried mozzarella sticks.

579
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,874
He'd say that the clams might be
frozen, the mushrooms might be bad.

580
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,314
But you can't go wrong
with mozzarella. So...

581
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,551
Uh...

582
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,090
I invite all of you to dip
deep into the marinara...

583
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,159
and, uh, raise your cheese...

584
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:14,861
as we embrace the
memory of our colleague...

585
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,996
our mentor, our chief...

586
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,166
and our dear friend.

587
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,776
God, we miss you.

588
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,255
- To Greg.
- Dr. Pratt.

589
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:40,915
Pratt.
