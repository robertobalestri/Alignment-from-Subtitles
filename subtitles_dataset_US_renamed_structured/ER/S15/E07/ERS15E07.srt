00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,303
Hello, I'm Eriq La Salle.

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,343
This week we lost the creator
of our show, Michael Crichton.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:15,916
A gentleman, gracious and witty. Brilliant
writer, intelligent, unfailingly kind.

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:19,212
But most of all, Michael was a
good friend and we will miss him.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,770
<i>Previously on ER:</i>

6
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,712
So you don't remember
anything like this...

7
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:27,760
I forget lots of stuff.

8
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,693
Do I know you?
You look so familiar.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,542
You knew I don't like
people knowing my business.

10
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,592
How can you work in that place?

11
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,129
<i>When will we know it's working?</i>

12
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,275
Baby.

13
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,285
Where are you?

14
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,842
- What are you doing in here?
- I hate this wallpaper.

15
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,982
We'll redo it.

16
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,643
I don't know what you were
thinking last night, talking about that.

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,312
It was a dinner party,
I didn't pick the topic.

18
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,220
Well, you certainly didn't
hesitate to dive right in.

19
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,828
Maybe that's because you won't
talk about it when we're alone.

20
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,303
You think I blame you
for what happened?

21
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,733
You think I'd still
be here if I did?

22
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,805
I try not to worry
about who you blame.

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,246
No offense, living with a teenage
boy is like living with an animal.

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,978
Only, cows make better conversation.
Butt abscess. Needs dressing.

25
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,849
At least a cow's not a predator.

26
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,083
Sarah's friends are like a pack
of she-wolves with cell phones.

27
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,227
Look, a new one just for you.

28
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,760
Anal warts.

29
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,260
This is so ass.

30
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,933
Looks like the Gates-Taggart
merger's in full swing.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,867
- You mean the Brady Bunch from hell?
- It's going great, she'll never admit it.

32
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,871
- Really? Okay.
- Never been happier, loves to complain.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,064
This much we know.

34
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,039
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Sorry?

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,838
The VA sent these
records over...

36
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,777
and some guy called from
the Wounded Warriors' Project.

37
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,280
- What's that all about?
- Is the ladies' this way?

38
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,918
Down the hall and to the left.

39
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,925
- Thank you, dear.
- Hey, is Banfield on?

40
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,111
She should be in soon.

41
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,950
- That about our homeless vet?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,992
- What's the story?
- I'm gonna figure it out.

43
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,359
Hey, uh, Bertha. Bertha,
this is not a good time. Bertha!

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,964
Whoa. Go get her, big boy.

45
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,533
And Hoberman's still
waiting on a cholecystectomy.

46
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,693
When are you gonna
clear out all these boarders?

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,202
We're working on it, Sam.

48
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:55,103
Oh, you might wanna get more than one
intern down here doing your babysitting.

49
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,801
- How's Dr. Wade managing?
- Customers seem satisfied.

50
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,912
Yeah? What about
you? Are you satisfied?

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,982
I need to loosen up a bit. I have
a tendency to micromanage...

52
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,641
Yeah, Cate mentioned that.

53
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,287
- Cate who?
- Dr. Banfield.

54
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,320
You know, department
head coffee klatch.

55
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,582
Great.

56
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,454
You know, autonomy's a
fine teaching device, Neela...

57
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,496
let's just make sure it doesn't lead
to slowness or distraction. Okay?

58
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,828
You guys ready?
Good. Ready to round.

59
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,263
Where's your intern?

60
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,769
When are you going to
get me a bed in a real room?

61
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,668
Uh, soon. Uh, we're
a little backed up.

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,174
I was meant to go under yesterday.
I haven't had anything to eat...

63
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,609
but some Jim Jones juice and
Jell-O that made my poop red.

64
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,440
- Red? Wait, you mean...?
- Now this?

65
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,611
The mattress is
made of cement...

66
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,347
and I've seen airport
runways that were less noisy.

67
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,491
Am I smudged?

68
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,952
Uh...

69
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,624
Just... NEELA: Hello?

70
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,088
- What are you doing?
- Um...

71
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,132
Oh, God.

72
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,435
Hey. I'm in the
middle of my run.

73
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,369
We can talk about this later.

74
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,174
No, I'm not. It's just that...

75
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,374
Listen, I gotta go now, Russell.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,368
- Six down, two to go.
- That's not so bad.

77
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,704
That's just the ER. We have
40 more waiting upstairs.

78
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,813
Right, 67-year-old
woman presents with...

79
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,381
- God, with the age again.
- Neck mass and dysphagia.

80
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,882
- Dis-what?
- Uh, pain on swallowing.

81
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,885
Saying it fancy doesn't make
you seem smarter, Andrew.

82
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,148
It makes you seem insecure.

83
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,917
It's a shorthand doctors
use, to save us time.

84
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,459
Yes, in theory.

85
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,887
Uh, her son noticed the
mass about three months ago...

86
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,794
when she visited
him in Michigan.

87
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,162
Ann Arbor. He's a professor
at the university there.

88
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,393
Oh.

89
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,233
Fine needle aspiration showed
a degenerative albeit benign cyst.

90
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,932
Thyroidectomy is indicated
for symptomatic relief.

91
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,771
All right, that's
thorough. Next?

92
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:14,176
Review of systems positive for
headache, back pain, constipation.

93
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,782
Let's stick to the thyroid.
That's what we're here for.

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,974
I'm with you, Bollywood.

95
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,019
Uh, no palpitations, diaphoresis,
heat intolerance. However...

96
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,852
Her TSH is normal so we know
there's no hyperthyroidism. Right?

97
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,824
- Right. But there is...
- Okay then. Moving on.

98
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,424
Three-year-old, near-drowning
with hypothermia, core temp's 84.

99
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,693
Bradycardic in the 60s
with a thready pulse.

100
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,301
- Dr. Banfield?
- A ride-along?

101
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,097
I was out. I saw
the rescue team.

102
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,172
Took almost 20
minutes to find the girl.

103
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,832
Twenty minutes? She was
underwater that whole time?

104
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,537
Grandpa took her on a walk
because she was acting fussy.

105
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,684
Everything was
good, she was happy.

106
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,719
And then the baby was just gone.

107
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,355
Go deep. Go.

108
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,626
Go, go, go!

109
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,189
Chase me.

110
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,197
Nice pass.

111
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,363
That's why they
call it a Hail Mary.

112
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,663
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Mwah.

113
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,568
You didn't chase me.

114
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,575
Because I'm the
quarterback. Now, buttonhook.

115
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,076
I'm tired.

116
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,078
Aw. One more touchdown,
then we get ice cream.

117
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:25,310
Booker and Banfield, that's all
the Bears are gonna need this year.

118
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,180
<i>What's your plan?</i>

119
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,017
She has a pulse, so
warm her up and wait.

120
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,988
- So?
- Access, warm saline...

121
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,888
get Respiratory
down with a vent.

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,825
Get Bair Hugger, prep
for intubation. I'll be right in.

123
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,522
- I have a favor to ask.
- Not now.

124
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,032
- I need your help getting an MRI.
- An emergency, call the radiologist.

125
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,730
It's not an emergency but it needs to
happen today. I have a homeless vet.

126
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,898
Cognitive deficits,
behavioral changes.

127
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,440
Let Neuro work it up.

128
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,875
They said they want him as an
outpatient, which is never gonna happen.

129
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,777
He's not an ER patient
anymore, it's out of our hands.

130
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,610
He was in Iraq.

131
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,009
A war hero.

132
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,883
Served in the same unit I
did back in Desert Storm.

133
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,788
I hear the harmonica playing, Dr. Gates,
but work is work, the rest is irrelevant.

134
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,430
Dr. Banfield, I get this whole
tough-boss thing and it works for you...

135
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,897
it really does, but
cut me some slack.

136
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,558
I need your help.

137
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,566
Dr. Banfield, the old
ball and chain on line two.

138
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,108
Thank you.

139
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,109
Tell him I'm in with
a patient, Frank.

140
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,814
I'll call him later.

141
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,915
Max Gonzalez...

142
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,622
sergeant first class.

143
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,293
You figured out who I am, huh?

144
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:45,556
Mm-hm. Hundred and first
airborne, first squadron, 75th cav.

145
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,592
Yeah.

146
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,436
Yeah, that's right. They
called us the Widowmakers.

147
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,800
So you remember it?

148
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,005
My memory's a work in
progress. But it's getting better.

149
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,579
- So thanks for that.
- Don't you wanna hear more?

150
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,010
Not really.

151
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,448
Awarded a silver star in '06,
later wounded in a rocket attack...

152
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,816
killed a bunch of buddies. Doctors
documented altered behavior.

153
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,423
Anger, depression, hostility.

154
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,422
- They gave me some pills.
- Yeah. SSRIs.

155
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,254
- Antidepressants.
- Didn't help much.

156
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,625
They discharged you on a 5-13.
Do you remember what that is?

157
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,790
Yeah, it meant that I could go home.
- No, it meant the Army...

158
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,870
- could stop giving you medical care...
- It meant I could get out of there.

159
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,302
Because they said you
had a personality disorder.

160
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,670
Something wrong with
you before you enlisted.

161
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,335
Maybe there was. That's
what my old man always said.

162
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,778
What if there wasn't?

163
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,439
What if it was a lie?

164
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,848
Your symptoms are consistent
with a traumatic brain Injury, TBI.

165
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,455
You could have suffered
when that rocket hit.

166
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,648
So you're saying what?

167
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:45,950
They dumped me?

168
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,024
I'm saying I think
they missed it...

169
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,892
mistreated it and sent you packing
for the cheapest possible price.

170
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,159
I wanted out, doc.

171
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,530
Trust me, I wanted out.

172
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,571
Yeah, because you
needed out, but not like this.

173
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,174
I don't wanna be
here, I don't like it here.

174
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,403
I know how it is to come
back from war and feel adrift.

175
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,383
Max, just give me a
couple hours to help you.

176
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,045
Tube's in.

177
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,215
Get Pharmacy to send more
warm saline, as much as they've got.

178
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,887
- ABG's back, she's acidotic, 7.22.
- Should we use a high vent rate?

179
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,501
The mother's out here. Someone
should probably talk to her first.

180
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,697
Dr. Morris, update the family.

181
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,668
I kind of have my
hands full here.

182
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,501
Dr. Martin.

183
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,508
Okay, but, uh, shouldn't you? I
mean, she's your patient, right?

184
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,044
- What's the CO2?
- Forty.

185
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:45,076
Standard rate, the pH might
normalize as we get the temp up.

186
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,388
Hello. You the mom?

187
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,683
Sandra Herrero, is
my daughter okay?

188
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:54,123
It's hard to know yet, we're
trying to warm her up now.

189
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,887
She's very strong for her age.

190
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:02,096
She's a good girl, very
sweet, so she'll be okay?

191
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,103
The cold water may have
protected her heart and brain.

192
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,207
We're just waiting to see.

193
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:13,210
Please, I know you know. So tell
me, is my baby gonna be all right?

194
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,315
Why can't you ever
give a straight answer?

195
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,615
You wanna have baby?
Another baby? Now?

196
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,782
- Well, not right now, but...
- Ha, ha.

197
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,484
Excuse me? Is...?
Is this your son?

198
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,560
There's something
wrong with him.

199
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,924
Daryl?

200
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,395
- What?
- Daryl!

201
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,124
Daryl!

202
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,130
- It's happening again.
- You're okay.

203
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,294
- Call an ambulance?
- No. I'm a doctor.

204
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,337
- He doesn't look good.
- He's burning up.

205
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,976
Just febrile seizure. Get
him home, cool him down.

206
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,202
Maybe we should be safe.

207
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,773
It's just like last time.
Look, it's stopping already.

208
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,916
Are you sure?

209
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,317
I've been doing this too
long to make promises.

210
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,286
But I'll tell you losing control
is not going to help her.

211
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,619
If that's what you
gotta do, do it outside.

212
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,818
In here, you be the
mom, you be calm...

213
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,692
you put energy into
helping your girl fight back...

214
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,231
because that's what she needs.

215
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,860
Can I...?

216
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,129
Can I go be with her now?

217
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,273
Yes.

218
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,277
- Still seven boarders here.
- Cate's gonna kill me...

219
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,514
- if we don't clear them.
- Yes, she is.

220
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,524
How long is this gonna go on?
You people are practically living here.

221
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,991
And by "you people" you mean?

222
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,288
- Surgeons.
- Of course.

223
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,022
We're trying to clear
overflow as quickly as possible.

224
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,067
- Miss Mendenhall is crashing.
- Well, that's one way.

225
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,835
- BP down to 60, palp.
- We've got a massive GI bleed.

226
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,236
Saline wide open
on pressure bags...

227
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,401
prep for central line, two
units on rapid infuser. Let's go.

228
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,207
- How's her airway? SAM:
Not great, even on 100.

229
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,814
Okay. Tube her, Neela. Hey.

230
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,712
- She complain of abdominal pain?
- No.

231
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,409
Any history of blood per rectum?

232
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,054
Uh, no. Not so far as I know.

233
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,690
Suction's on high. - Okay.

234
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,984
Call GI. Endoscopy if
we get her pressure up.

235
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,650
- Lost the pulse.
- Ah, damn it.

236
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,521
Starting compressions.

237
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,222
Dr. Banfield, our frozen
girl's having runs of v-tach.

238
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,730
<i>I've got the amiodarone.</i>

239
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,892
Give 75 milligrams
and set up an infusion.

240
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,561
- Got it.
- BP's 67/32.

241
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,004
Valecia's temperature's dropped
a little. We're working on that.

242
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,235
- It's supposed to go up.
- I said stay calm.

243
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,879
I'm stepping up rewarming
with some pleural lavage.

244
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,038
You see that? Huh?

245
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,878
How are coags? Platelet count?
- Not back yet.

246
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,077
Specimen clotted, we
had to send it again.

247
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,916
We should not
have to wait an hour.

248
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,115
We'll give platelets
and FFP empirically.

249
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,590
Why do we have to fight the
same battles every damn day?

250
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,956
Go on, do it.

251
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,040
How long have we been going?

252
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,379
Thirty-nine minutes.

253
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,781
It's time for another epi.

254
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,355
- It won't do any good.
- What about the GI consult?

255
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,549
They won't scope a
patient without a pulse.

256
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,059
- Dopamine?
- Eight units of packed cells, two FFP.

257
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,528
We've replaced her
entire blood volume twice.

258
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,258
If the heart could come back, it
would have by now. We're done.

259
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,869
- Uh-uh.
- We're done.

260
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,871
Two, three, four.

261
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,645
Eleven-fifty-eight a.m.

262
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,447
- Any relatives?
- A son.

263
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,716
- Sorry?
- She said she had a son in Michigan.

264
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,554
I'll call him.

265
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,959
Okay. I'll get started on the
paperwork for the coroner.

266
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,232
Could you get me...?

267
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,167
Could you get me
a death kit please?

268
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,470
- I can take care of that if...
- Please.

269
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,169
Pull the curtain behind you.

270
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,625
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,134
Tomorrow's not good
enough, she needs it now.

273
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,301
- What's the hold-up?
- There's no ECMO unit in the hospital.

274
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,970
- What? That can't be.
- County only has two machines.

275
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,139
One's in use, the
other's out for repairs.

276
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,444
Systolic's down to 44.

277
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,052
Valecia needs a machine...

278
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,451
that will warm her blood and do
the work of her heart and lungs.

279
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,116
We don't have that here, so we
have to transfer her to another hospital.

280
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,128
It's gonna take hours for a hospital to
accept her, a transport team to pick up.

281
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,562
Time is critical.
So let's not waste it.

282
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,327
- Call transport. Go.
- This girl's not stable enough.

283
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,962
Increase rewarming, get the heart in
better shape before we ship her out.

284
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,700
She still has a pulse and
a BP. Now is our window.

285
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,243
Dr. Banfield. She's here now.

286
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,972
We gotta work with what we have.

287
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,014
We don't need to
go to the hospital.

288
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,344
You don't know that.

289
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,920
He's groggy, he's post-ictal. Just
like what happened the other time.

290
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,489
That wasn't the same.
He was fine in 10 minutes.

291
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,649
He had a full workup,
he stayed overnight.

292
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,988
- Spinal tap, CT.
- You're not being objective.

293
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,564
They terrified him and
found nothing. It was nothing.

294
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,564
Febrile seizures recur. The
pediatrician warned us about it.

295
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,172
What if this is different?

296
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,798
If he is not better in 20
minutes, we'll take him in.

297
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,207
She's in v-tach again.

298
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,874
We got a pulse?

299
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,111
Thready femoral.

300
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,447
Okay, Morris. Lead the way.

301
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,183
Let's move her to a trauma room.

302
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,759
Prep for peritoneal lavage.

303
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,228
Ten more liters of warm
saline and grab a thoraseal.

304
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,457
Wait. You're leaving?

305
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,864
Get it started. I'll be in soon.

306
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,607
It was probably diverticulosis.

307
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,573
So she blew an artery in her
colon wall and bled to death.

308
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,872
It wasn't foreseeable. She
had none of the predictors.

309
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:24,484
- Like bloody stool?
- Yep, that would be one.

310
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,782
She had it.

311
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,890
Well, it's not here. You never said.
- She had it.

312
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,392
Did you do a rectal exam?

313
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,653
Check for occult blood?

314
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,630
Did you ask her about any
specific signs of GI bleeding?

315
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,792
She, uh... She said something
about the food making her stool red.

316
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:47,065
- Why didn't you bring this up at rounds?
- Because she had so many complaints.

317
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,268
Her headache could have been a brain
bleed, her backache a ruptured triple-A.

318
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,972
It's your job to decide what needs to
be considered and when to speak up.

319
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,743
If you're submissive when someone's
life's on the line, you're not ready...

320
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,911
I try to speak up
and nobody listens!

321
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,382
Let's discuss this later.

322
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,631
There's no way to be
ready for something like this.

323
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,468
But in the end, it'll
make you better.

324
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,776
You can't be a great doctor
until you've killed a patient.

325
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,274
Yeah. I've heard that before.

326
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,316
I think it's called
a rationalization.

327
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,986
It's only been 15 minutes.

328
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,934
It's too long, I'm...
I'm calling 911.

329
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,327
Russ, he's waking up.

330
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,172
Hey, sweetie. How you feeling?

331
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,537
Hey little man,
you had us scared.

332
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,340
Can't have our number one
wide-out on the injured reserve list.

333
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,745
Here, have some water.

334
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,176
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

335
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,480
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

336
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,525
Oh, don't bother, that's
my private line. ER.

337
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,421
Vindication. Look.

338
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,501
"Diffuse axonal injury in the parasagittal
white matter, consistent with TBI."

339
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,196
- Yeah, and this is vindication because?
- This is gonna save Max's life.

340
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,001
Put him on a path of getting
healthy, medical coverage.

341
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,837
You convince
Neuro to readmit him.

342
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,672
- I can, with your help.
- Dr. Gates.

343
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,906
- Indulge that inner softy one more time.
- This is the last time.

344
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,106
I wanna hug you.

345
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,275
You'll be the one
with traumatic injury.

346
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,044
You're the best.

347
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,613
- Dr. Banfield.
- Yeah?

348
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,758
Valecia lost her pulse.
- Hey, Suri.

349
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,554
- What happened to my patient?
- That bed's been empty.

350
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,560
- Anybody see him leave?
- I don't know.

351
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,962
Frank. I had a guy in there from
radiology, Max Gonzalez, a vet.

352
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,194
- He had a duffel bag? You seen him?
- That guy was real jumpy.

353
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,738
He went outside for a
smoke maybe 15 minutes ago.

354
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,215
Max!

355
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,946
Hey, Max!

356
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,393
Max! Wait up!

357
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,461
What happened?

358
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,466
Went into v-fib. Didn't respond
to the shock, she's still too cold.

359
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,967
This is why I wanted to transfer.
This is what I was worried about.

360
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,131
Think she'd be better
off coding in a rig?

361
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,902
Please. I stayed calm.
I did what you said.

362
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,546
Please help her.

363
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,816
Please. You don't
need to do that.

364
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,853
- Okay. Don't want him to pull the IV.
- I'll hold his hand instead.

365
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,292
It's getting harder to bag.

366
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,131
Might be pulmonary edema.

367
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,269
Get sterile. You can
help with the thoracotomy.

368
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,606
Thoracotomy? Why?

369
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,441
Myocardial irrigation.

370
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,315
I'm gonna open your daughter's
chest, flush saline over her heart.

371
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,978
No, please, don't.
Something else!

372
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,351
- I know it's scary.
- Try something else!

373
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,993
If we don't get her
heart beating, she'll die.

374
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,889
I'm gonna need a 10 blade.

375
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,066
Is there a fire, Mama?

376
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:44,643
No, baby, we're in an ambulance.
We're gonna make sure you're okay.

377
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,745
Where's daddy?

378
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,074
He in the car right behind us.

379
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,580
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

380
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,710
We are not gonna let this baby
slip away. Not here and not now.

381
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,551
Okay, ma'am we're here.

382
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,399
Welcome to County
General, I'm Dr. Greene.

383
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,993
Are you the mom?

384
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,141
What's our core temp?
- Still 86.

385
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,610
Take it again.

386
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,717
- Just did it two minutes ago.
- Take it again.

387
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,722
- Internal paddles.
- She's still too cold.

388
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,756
There's nothing to lose. Clear.

389
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,230
- No change.
- Go again.

390
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,922
Why are you doing that?

391
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,795
We've gotta get her heart going.

392
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,131
Nothing's working. Why
isn't anything working?

393
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,398
We're just getting started here.

394
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:48,802
Ceftriaxone's in.

395
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,307
Finish the bolus, then
run fluids at 100 an hour.

396
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,675
- He needs a D-stick, a serum CK.
- Hour ago he didn't need anything.

397
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,509
- Why don't we have labs back?
- You in the medical field?

398
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,448
ER attending at U of C, where
trauma labs are back in 10 minutes.

399
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,349
Welcome to our world.

400
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:06,583
- Sat's 91 on 100 percent.
- Come on. Come on, Daryl, wake up.

401
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,625
All right. Crank the O2.

402
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:09,921
What about an ABG?

403
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,088
With your son's depressed
consciousness, we need to consider...

404
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,790
Why don't we do a head CT first?

405
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:18,028
We have one scanner, your
son's in line behind two criticals.

406
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,197
- You have a critical patient here.
- Cate, let them do this.

407
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,638
- Is Elizabeth working today?
- I can check.

408
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,038
Mm.

409
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,045
Forget it. Call the lab and get them
to read the CBC over the phone.

410
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,939
Pulse ox is 87.

411
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,711
Daryl, honey, wake
up and breathe for us.

412
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,186
Six of etomidate and 30 of sux.

413
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,051
No, no tube.
He's just post-ictal.

414
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,627
Your son's vomited blood, he's
been altered for over an hour.

415
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:45,026
- My son has a history of seizures.
- Seizure can't account for that.

416
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,325
A Mallory-Weiss tear,
atypical presentation.

417
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,162
He's hypoventilating and
his brain needs oxygen.

418
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,216
Why don't you check an ABG...?
- Listen.

419
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,000
I need you to be the mom
now, I'm gonna be the doctor.

420
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,040
It works best that way.

421
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,201
- He's right.
- Who's running the floor?

422
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,643
I am. And I've been
doing this job for a while.

423
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,009
So you need to trust me.

424
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,548
<i>Clear.</i>

425
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,011
She should be warm enough
now to respond to the shock.

426
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,883
Clear!

427
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,349
I don't understand this.

428
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,359
Otoscope.

429
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,157
Mr. Herrero, did you see her
hit anything on the way down?

430
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,870
On some rocks? Anything?

431
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,909
She was really cranky,
so he took her out.

432
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,479
He's asking if it's his fault.

433
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,345
If he did something wrong.

434
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,509
CAT scan shows signs
of hypoattenuation...

435
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,712
in the distribution of the MCA.

436
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,050
I'm not a doctor.
Can you explain that?

437
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,852
- Your son had a stroke.
- What?

438
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,360
Why would he have that?
- I can't explain that yet.

439
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,929
He's bradying down.

440
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,033
- You need to give thrombolytics.
- Not without a CBC.

441
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,726
All right, 0.2 of epi
and prep some atropine.

442
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,565
Let's keep
neurosurge in the loop.

443
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,799
- You said he didn't need anything.
- Ninety-nine out of a 100...

444
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,477
Stop talking like a doctor.
That's our son, damn it.

445
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,772
Heart rate's down
to 40. No pulse.

446
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,779
Starting compressions.

447
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,985
Is there any sickle
cell in your family?

448
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,951
- Thalessemia?
- No.

449
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,920
Can think of any reason
why your son had a stroke?

450
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,616
No.

451
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,091
Start atropine.

452
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,788
Mark, they're waiting
for you upstairs.

453
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,126
I'm a little busy here.

454
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,064
Yeah, I can take over. It
looks like you need a break.

455
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,727
- Any meds?
- No, he doesn't take anything.

456
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,806
I'll see if they can
hold your chemo.

457
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,742
Is it possible that he
ingested something?

458
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,541
Something from your
medicine cabinet?

459
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,782
Maybe it's an ingestion.

460
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,180
She's up to 94 now.

461
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,282
What medicines in the house?
- Clear.

462
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,288
- Just aspirin.
- Anything else?

463
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,087
- Prescription meds, over the counter.
- Still v-fib.

464
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,776
- What? What does he take?
- For blood pressure, carda...?

465
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,696
- Valecia could have gotten them?
- No. It has a child-proof cap.

466
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,770
Diltiazem. Diltiazem!

467
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,167
Very toxic in kids.

468
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,275
Blanca, half a gram
of calcium, IV push.

469
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,570
I'll check Trauma 1.

470
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,713
Lab says that
specimen's hemolyzed.

471
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,874
They just let it sit
around for an hour.

472
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,108
Not the first time.

473
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,811
It's all right, I always
draw an extra red top.

474
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,355
- Let me look at that.
- What? What is it?

475
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,548
The buffy coat.

476
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,523
You can't diagnose
anything from...

477
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,287
Look at the ratio
of whites to reds.

478
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:34,331
Haleh, call Oncology, have them get
that leukapheresis machine down here now.

479
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,695
Oncology?

480
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,235
You're gonna do that
without a diagnosis?

481
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:42,569
The seizure, the stroke.
It's sludging. It all fits.

482
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,800
Oh, God.

483
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:47,378
Jerry, I want you to drag a
hematologist to a microscope...

484
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,412
and make him look
at this boy's smear.

485
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,815
Right away, Dr. Greene.

486
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,181
Is someone gonna tell
me what is happening here?

487
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,047
Leukemia.

488
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,493
Daryl's got leukemia.

489
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,998
- What's he doing?
- "Little Frog Tail." It's a nursery rhyme.

490
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,761
<i>If you don't heal today</i>

491
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,363
<i>You'll heal tomorrow</i>

492
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:18,204
- Another round of epi.
- Toxicology's on their way.

493
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,505
Dr. Martin, make those
compressions count.

494
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,840
Calcium's on board.

495
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,380
- Pushing epi.
- Epi's in, infusion's on the way.

496
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,218
- Is this the leukapheresis case?
- We almost have access.

497
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,121
- Switch with me.
- Platelets are up.

498
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,092
Platelets? We don't even
know if he's thrombocytopenic.

499
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,390
He's oozing around his
IVs, there's no way he's not.

500
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,295
Uh, platelets could
worsen the viscosity.

501
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,732
Needs a femoral line.
I can't if he can't clot.

502
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,582
- We have no choice.
- He could stroke out.

503
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,729
Listen to me, we have no choice.

504
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,066
- Calcium's back, 4.2.
- Going in the right direction.

505
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,109
Not fast enough.
Push another half gram.

506
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,405
Got it.

507
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,982
Repeat the level with
calce, phos, sodium.

508
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,551
- Potassium, BUN, creatinine, LDH.
- It's been over 10 minutes.

509
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,780
Is this gonna...
This gonna help?

510
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,285
This machine
improves blood flow.

511
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,324
Give his heart a
chance to rebound.

512
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,429
When will we know it's working?

513
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,230
- It takes a little time.
<i>- It's been 30 minutes.</i>

514
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,761
Clear!

515
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,807
No change.

516
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,343
Come on.

517
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:29,607
Come on, now. Clear.

518
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,419
- V-tach.
- Could be hyperkalemic from tumor lysis.

519
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,022
Five of insulin,
amp of D-50. Clear.

520
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,487
- Still v-tach.
- Going again.

521
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,218
Clear.

522
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,226
- Dr. Greene.
- Mix 20 of kayexalate.

523
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,724
Labs are back.

524
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,330
White count 167,000...

525
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,169
- large myeloblasts.
- No. No.

526
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,045
No, no, no. No, no.

527
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,213
Yes! Yes! Sinus rhythm!

528
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,543
Clear. Clear.

529
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,220
Oh, my God.

530
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:12,347
- We got a pulse.
- He's been down for almost an hour.

531
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,824
Is she back? You got her back?

532
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:19,021
His brain's been
deprived of oxygen.

533
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:25,900
Call Surgery, we need to get her
upstairs so they can close the chest.

534
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,271
I'm gonna stop now.

535
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,790
You saved her.

536
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,422
You saved her.

537
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:19,848
No.

538
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,405
No.

539
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,265
No.

540
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,615
She'll be in surgery for an
hour while we clean and close.

541
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,884
We can go with her?

542
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,191
Have them re-check the calcium.

543
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,993
I wanna thank you.

544
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,768
It's what we do.

545
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,535
- When it goes right.
- There was a minute there...

546
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,111
It was like I was
losing everything.

547
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,744
- You can't imagine...
- I'm glad it all worked out for you.

548
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,748
She's a beautiful child.

549
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,421
We're still waiting
on the coroner.

550
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,293
Something else you need?

551
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,324
I wanna clean him up.

552
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,492
We probably have some gauze.

553
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,299
I want the tube out.

554
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:19,277
Normal procedure is we have
to wait for the coroner before...

555
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,276
I'm familiar with procedure.

556
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,374
Where's your husband?

557
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,582
He's calling our families.

558
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,354
I know, uh...

559
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:42,400
nothing I can say will probably mean
much to you right now, ahem, but I...

560
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,532
I've seen enough
grief in my life to...

561
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,166
know how
devastating it can be...

562
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:57,710
and how hard it can
be to find the resilience.

563
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,521
I just hope...

564
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:10,351
you and your husband find...

565
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,158
Greene. A minute in the hall?

566
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,031
Excuse me.

567
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,369
So Oncology is mad at me.
Why do you suppose that is?

568
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,564
I've had my hands full, Robert.

569
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:27,042
Well, I just used all my pull
and influence to persuade them...

570
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,114
to keep the chemo suite open
one hour, so get up there...

571
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,343
or I'm gonna sell your
vincristine on the black market.

572
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,214
- I'm still...
- Stop complaining.

573
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,913
Nobody told you to
go and get cancer.

574
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,204
I have to go.

575
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,970
I'll be back as soon as I can.

576
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,040
You never answered my question.

577
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,238
I can't let you extubate him.

578
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,043
You know that.

579
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,997
You're free to cut the tube.

580
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:48,345
Those are the ones
you never forget.

581
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,687
You shouldn't be doing that.

582
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,587
I keep a secret stash in
the back of the fridge...

583
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:58,423
crack one open when something
really amazing happens.

584
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,563
In five years here, this is
like the third one I've drunk.

585
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,336
One beer every 20
months I can overlook.

586
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:13,743
So forgive me for noticing...

587
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,507
but what happened in there?

588
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,377
Something changed.

589
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,911
The situation evolved.

590
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,525
It was a kid, right?

591
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,960
We all have one.

592
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,197
Some case you blew.

593
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,598
A patient you should have saved.

594
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,204
Yours was a kid?

595
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,133
Yeah.

596
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,638
How old?

597
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,972
He was 5 years old.

598
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,646
Those are the worst.

599
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,611
He was my son.

600
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,848
He died here.

601
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,151
In Trauma 1.

602
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,592
Your son died in this ER?

603
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,935
And you're working here?

604
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,811
I'm not sure why I've done
anything I've done since that day.

605
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,915
Why'd I not leave my
apartment for almost two years?

606
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:31,081
Then I see the news
about the tsunami...

607
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:36,026
and I fly to a place 10
thousand miles away.

608
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,791
Why'd I do that?

609
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,525
Why did I come back?

610
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,301
Why did my son have leukemia?

611
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,340
I never understood any of it.

612
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,053
I'm sorry for your...
For your loss.

613
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,192
I... I don't really
know what to say.

614
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,961
When your parents are
gone, you're an orphan.

615
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,735
Spouse dies, you're
a widow, or a widower.

616
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,374
But when you lose your baby...

617
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,308
there's no word for that.

618
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,086
See to it she gets
this before you go.

619
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,615
Hey.

620
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:18,960
Listen I... I would
really like to see you.

621
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,498
I... I miss you, Elizabeth.

622
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:27,066
Please. Please,
don't... Don't... Don't cry.

623
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,368
Yeah. Tonight. Yeah.

624
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:35,241
Yeah, I'll come over.

625
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,575
I'll see you then.

626
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:49,323
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when they came for Daryl...

627
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:53,661
but I, uh... I had
to be somewhere.

628
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,031
It was an atypical presentation.
Nobody could have picked it up.

629
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,266
If I had just brought
him in earlier.

630
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,907
He had acute leukemia,
that's why he died.

631
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,475
It might have given
me another day.

632
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,478
A little more time.

633
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,554
They said we can go now.

634
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:36,635
I appreciate your
effort, Dr. Greene.

635
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,704
Take care, both of you.

636
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,181
Good luck.

637
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,867
Baby.

638
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,741
Where are you?

639
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,688
You never cried.

640
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,926
At the hospital...

641
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,068
at the funeral.

642
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,902
I've been...

643
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,538
I've been really
angry about that.

644
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:50,743
You never cried about
anything since that day.

645
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,920
Maybe we've been
fooling ourselves. Maybe...

646
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,284
we've been done
for a long time, but...

647
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,454
never figured it out.

648
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,095
I never blamed you.

649
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,391
Never.

650
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:28,551
I used to think
every day that...

651
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,479
if God told me I could die...

652
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,955
and go to heaven and
be with Daryl, I would do it.

653
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:41,229
I wondered if that made
me an awful person...

654
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:44,597
that I'd give up
my life with you...

655
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:49,234
give up everything we
could still have in the future.

656
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,583
But I never...

657
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:10,120
really got away from the
feeling like I need to be with him.

658
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,286
Dreaming of him.

659
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,527
I never got away
from the idea that...

660
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,499
somehow I'd be able
to hold him again.

661
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:45,358
I've been afraid for so long.

662
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:51,393
I don't want to be
afraid anymore.
