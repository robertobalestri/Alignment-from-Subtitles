1
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,574
<i>Why is light given
to those in misery?</i>

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,944
<i>And life to the bitter of soul?</i>

3
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>To those who long for
death that does not come?</i>

4
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,552
<i>Who search for it more
than for hidden treasure?</i>

5
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:09,902
<i>Who are filled with gladness and
rejoice when they reach the grave?</i>

6
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,847
<i>For sighing comes
to me instead of food.</i>

7
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,486
<i>My groans pour out like water.</i>

8
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,281
<i>What I feared has come upon me.</i>

9
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,483
<i>What I dreaded
has happened to me.</i>

10
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,591
<i>I have no peace.</i>

11
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,253
<i>No quietness.</i>

12
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,858
<i>I have no rest,
but only turmoil.</i>

13
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,367
Faithlessness is the
only natural disaster.

14
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,299
Sugar is evil. Cast
away that pop.

15
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,669
Safe haven, right?

16
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:25,335
That's what you said? Well, I left my
baby here and now I want him back!

17
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,512
I was next. WOMAN 1:
Call this a safe haven?

18
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,946
Dr. Lockhart! Purdy can't sleep.

19
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,551
Give me my baby!

20
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,710
Okay, I'll be with you in
a minute, Mrs. Gaines.

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,185
Thank you. MAN 3: How
much longer I gotta wait?

22
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,382
Come on, sir, I'm taking you in.

23
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,186
I've been here two hours.

24
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,220
Paul Traylor, 34,
GSW to the chest.

25
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,629
- Shot by intruder in his apartment.
- Okay, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

26
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,066
Some dumb kids. Made a mistake.

27
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,728
Tachy at 120, BP's good.

28
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,736
- Hold up, hold up.
- Sats down to 89.

29
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,535
It's getting harder to breathe.
- Okay, hemostat.

30
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,076
- What?
- Give me the clamp.

31
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,180
Repent sin lest ye be stricken.

32
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,647
- Now is the time of fire and brimstone.
- Reidy, you gotta know...

33
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,720
that covering a penetrating chest
wound creates a one-way valve.

34
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,721
Causing a tension pneumo.
- Today...

35
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,988
the reckoning will commence.

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,719
- Thanks.
- No problem.

37
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,727
Welcome to the end of the world.

38
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,163
Today everything changes.

39
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,262
Today? Really? I thought
that was next week.

40
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,971
On my count. One, two, three.

41
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,741
Can you call St.
David's Academy?

42
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,818
- No exit wound.
- I won't be coming in.

43
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,544
- On it.
- Nothing below the waist.

44
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,984
- What do you do?
- Tutor.

45
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,351
- I run the sports program.
- Axilla's clear.

46
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,220
Okay, get him
back down. Gates...

47
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,089
- start on chest tube.
- Got it.

48
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,560
Haleh, can you call for
C-spine, chest and belly films?

49
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,495
- Uh-huh.
- I'll do that.

50
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,999
I'm supposed to do grunt
work while you supervise.

51
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,069
- Oh, that's true.
- So how'd this happen?

52
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,069
Stayed at my
girlfriend's last night.

53
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,936
- Got back, a bunch of kids were there.
- In your place?

54
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,169
They were partying or something.

55
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,870
I told them to leave.
Things got out of hand.

56
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,073
- One of them had a gun.
- How'd they get in?

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,445
- I don't know. GATES:
All right, little pinch.

58
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,717
Being the new
attending feel different?

59
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,719
No, not really.

60
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,085
Well, yeah, a little bit.

61
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,695
Guys, I got hung up with the
intussusception kid. What do you got?

62
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,889
GSW to the chest, no
exit. BP and Sats are good.

63
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,864
All right, slight pressure here.

64
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,231
- Two hundred cc's on the floor.
- That's my blood?

65
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,101
That's normal for
a gunshot wound.

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,266
- Type and cross for 6.
- Morris, excuse me.

67
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,140
- We have an attending here.
- Right. Of course.

68
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,145
Told them family only, they
wouldn't take no for an answer.

69
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,414
- Coach, you okay?
- How'd this happen?

70
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,485
Thanks for showing up, guys.

71
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,486
But you got morning
drills and school.

72
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,386
We ain't practicing without you.

73
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,790
Call me when you get
the films back. Excuse me.

74
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,724
You okay?

75
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,096
Had a run of double shifts.

76
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,262
- Why don't you take a couple days off?
- He won't stop working.

77
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,771
Yeah, the interns are
all in procedure lab...

78
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,672
and we're already
stretched thin without Greg.

79
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,642
Have you met the
new, uh, chief yet?

80
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,181
- Banfield?
- No. Not yet.

81
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,681
Soon enough, she's on today.

82
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,353
Dr. Morris. I got two kids
here with possible gastro.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,989
I'll take it. Why don't
you take a break?

84
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,953
This is Mrs. Weddington
with her sons, Larry and Curly.

85
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,527
Where's Moe?

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,863
No Moe. Okay.

87
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,095
Uh, Larry?

88
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,967
- That's Curly.
- Right. Right.

89
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,769
Up all night vomiting, but
they seem to be better now.

90
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,608
Probably had too much cake.

91
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,940
We were at a bowling
party all day yesterday.

92
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,877
Sam, I thought
you went upstairs.

93
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,713
Eh, they said it might take a
while, so I might as well work.

94
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,787
They're making her go in
front of some disciplinary board.

95
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,449
- How come?
- She left a Hep-Lock in a patient.

96
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,219
Okay, fluid
challenge these guys.

97
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,068
Give them some
popsicles, see how they do.

98
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,167
Oh, excuse me. Um,
I was wondering, um...

99
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,465
My boys are
getting to the age...

100
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,336
where they need to know
about certain things...

101
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,306
and I'm sure they
have questions.

102
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:24,012
- Oh, sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,710
Could you maybe talk to them?

104
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,716
Uh, yeah. Sure.

105
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,381
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

106
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,617
Sure. I'll be back
here in a little while.

107
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:35,393
Okay, I'll just
catch up with them.

108
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,394
- Great.
- Okay.

109
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,260
You look pretty.

110
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,237
Are you stoned?

111
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:52,176
- So I just, uh, heard a rumor. Is it true?
- This kid's here to see his coach.

112
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,611
Yeah, he's, uh... He's
right through there.

113
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,978
Some of your friends
are already with him.

114
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,723
What's the rumor?

115
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,423
That you got a job
at Mass General.

116
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,028
That you're moving to Boston.

117
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,464
Who told you that?

118
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,192
A girl who works in
HR told a scrub nurse.

119
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,702
The same girl that said Chuny was
pregnant with Crenshaw's love child?

120
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,067
Hey.

121
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:26,640
I'm happy for you, I really am. I'm
happy for you and Luka and Joe.

122
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,582
Even if it kills me to think that
you won't be working here anymore.

123
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,947
That you'll be living far away.

124
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,548
I wish you would have told me.

125
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,824
Well, what for? What?

126
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,553
So you could plan some
embarrassing party?

127
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,325
Because I'm your friend.

128
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,109
Well, we're still gonna
be friends, aren't we?

129
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,243
Well, first shift as an
attending, last shift at County.

130
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,751
- That's quite a day.
- Yeah.

131
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,254
- How soon are you leaving?
- Tonight.

132
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,487
Tonight?

133
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,093
- Abby!
- I'm sorry. I know...

134
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,696
can you not tell anybody?

135
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,265
Because it's just...
It's too weird and I'll...

136
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,996
I'll figure out a
way to do it, later.

137
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,565
Rule of today: No crying. Right?

138
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,703
Hey.

139
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,313
I got two guys coming
in. Fight at a synagogue.

140
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:41,387
- Oy vey. A couple of feisty Jews, huh?
- Hm?

141
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,614
I don't know. The
gloves are off today.

142
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,849
What the hell is this?

143
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,859
Frank's learning to tango for
his 30th wedding anniversary.

144
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,897
Promised Connie that I would
dance with her at the party.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,195
Keep your head up, Frank.

146
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,736
I can't, then I can't see
where to put my damn feet.

147
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,566
Thirty-two-year-old male,
lip versus fist, vitals stable.

148
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,540
You're not a mohel,
you're a butcher.

149
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,306
The baby is fine, Sheldon.
A little blood is normal.

150
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,676
You were sloppy! Sloppy
with my baby's penis!

151
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,340
- End of conversation.
- Crazy.

152
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,577
I'm done with brises.

153
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,983
Who needs the aggravation?

154
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,820
- Hey, do I know you?
- I don't know. Do you?

155
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,691
I performed your
wedding ceremony.

156
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,522
It's Abigail, right?

157
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,358
Um, yeah. Abby,
actually. It's Abby.

158
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,867
So how's your first year
of married life been?

159
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,527
Oh, well, you know.

160
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,730
Got its ups and its downs.

161
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,375
What? He's a slob?

162
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,875
Leaves the toilet seat
up, never does the dishes?

163
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,444
Something like that, yeah.

164
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,842
Listen, the ceremony
was meshuga.

165
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,678
Those are the ones that last.

166
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,948
Here.

167
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,021
Keep this on it.

168
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,285
- It was nice to see you again.
- Don't worry, it'll get easier.

169
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,091
Shalom to that.

170
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,193
You guys, where's your mom?

171
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,065
Okay, uh... Here we go.

172
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:13,643
I sometimes talk to kids
about, you know, stuff.

173
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,477
So why don't we
just go right over here.

174
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:22,546
And if you have any
questions about...

175
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,557
sex, or drugs or alcohol,
you can just shoot.

176
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:32,593
I know it's hard for kids your age
to talk about this stuff, but I think...

177
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,233
- We can ask you anything?
- Yes.

178
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,268
Is it true if you sneeze with
your eyes open, they pop out?

179
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,635
- Can vampires get AIDS?
- Put a penny on El track, will it crash?

180
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,605
Why can't we wear
pajamas in daytime?

181
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,074
Our brother got a girl
pregnant, he won't marry.

182
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,340
- Why do you think he won't?
- Okay, am I...? Am I being punk'd?

183
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,347
Crit's dropping in 2.

184
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,452
You guys, stay right there.

185
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,179
- How do blimps fly?
- What about chest and belly films?

186
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,324
- Haven't done it.
- What's taking so long?

187
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,356
- Processor's down.
- That's ridiculous.

188
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,189
550 out of the chest tube,
hemoglobin's dropped to 11.

189
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,821
All right, hang O-neg, call for
type specific, platelets and FFP.

190
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,934
- This is Lily.
- His fiancée.

191
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,093
- He's gonna be okay?
- That's the plan.

192
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,671
Sat's only 83. ABBY: All right.

193
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,205
Deep breaths for me.

194
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,502
A non-rebreather and
set up to intubation.

195
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,474
Etomidate and sux. Eight-oh.

196
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,807
Paul, we're gonna have
to put another tube in.

197
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,006
- You're not gonna be able to speak.
- Right.

198
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,617
Zeke.

199
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,149
It's not your fault. Okay?

200
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,652
I don't blame you.

201
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,119
Hear me?

202
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,385
Say you hear me.

203
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,390
I hear you.

204
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,823
Pushing the meds.

205
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,896
All the bulbs are out.

206
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,196
Okay, folks, give
it to me straight.

207
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,895
GSW to the chest.

208
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,473
- First unit's up.
- First unit? That's all?

209
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,872
Hemodynamically
stable five minutes ago.

210
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,878
Okay. Get this crowd out of here.
- This is his girlfriend.

211
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,009
All right, just
the Globetrotters.

212
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,584
You're gonna have to step
out while we work, okay?

213
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,652
- No way.
- We're not gonna leave till...

214
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,222
Hey, Meadowlark, did you
hear what the lady said?

215
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,717
I prefer to give blood
before the vitals take a dive.

216
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,558
- It works out much better that way.
- I don't transfuse without a reason.

217
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,431
Oh, like being
shot in the chest?

218
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,092
Where's the bullet?

219
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,737
I ordered plain films,
the processor's down.

220
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,396
What's the CT show?

221
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,542
- CT takes an hour.
- Oh, please.

222
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:26,613
Our patients don't need radiation and
a $1000 bill for an unnecessary scan.

223
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,509
Oh, yes, the victim complex.

224
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:33,517
It's all so hard here at County.
Boo-hoo. Takes so long, nothing works.

225
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,952
You think this is tough, kiddies,
try a cinderblock hut in Malaysia.

226
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,455
I'll call Radiology again.

227
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,617
I know you're Tsunami
Mary or something...

228
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,853
but we don't need
war stories right now.

229
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,464
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

230
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,562
I'm Cate Banfield.

231
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,398
- Abby Lockhart.
- You're a baby attending, flying blind.

232
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,302
Take help if you wanna stick
around. Otherwise, the door.

233
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,603
And I'm talking about the big
picture. So there are your options.

234
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,773
I'll keep that in mind.

235
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,078
Who wants to intubate?

236
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,182
Guidewire.

237
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,121
Hemoglobin's stable, 11.1.

238
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,762
That might be a sign that
bleeding is slowing down.

239
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,453
Not necessarily.

240
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,700
- Hang another unit.
- Introducer.

241
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,394
Let Gates finish that, I
need you to run the board.

242
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,269
- Call me when the films are ready.
- All right.

243
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,811
He said they were
from the neighborhood.

244
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,450
What? You didn't hear
what coach told the cops?

245
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,586
- I don't know who they are.
- Settle down.

246
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,153
- Stay out of the way. HILO:
They live in your building.

247
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:46,225
Dr. Lockhart, she's so blue,
can you give her something?

248
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,123
I'm not a vet, and cats
aren't allowed in the ER.

249
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:53,289
- Is there anything else I can do for you?
- My water pill. I need a refill, please.

250
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:57,665
You know what? This has gotta stop.
You have to get yourself a real doctor.

251
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,271
You're not a real doctor?

252
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,308
Mrs. Gaines, you
know what I mean.

253
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,069
I'm not gonna be here forever.

254
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,078
You have such a
dark perspective.

255
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:13,317
I'm drawn to you,
dear. So sue me.

256
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,352
Can you hang on?
I'll be right back.

257
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,116
Hey! At least you
don't sneeze anymore.

258
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,261
Yeah, I take antihistamines
when I see you coming.

259
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,089
What are you doing? I
thought you were taking a break.

260
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,457
Ever been at a crossroads?

261
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,469
Who do you think
you're talking to?

262
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,868
That's how I feel.

263
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,974
Like something's changing,
but I don't know what it is.

264
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,973
It gets easier once
you get used to it.

265
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,341
I keep thinking
about what he said.

266
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:53,615
The last words of Greg Pratt
were, "Don't screw it up, Morris."

267
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,629
You won't.

268
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,631
If I were in trouble,
Archie, I would call for you.

269
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,400
I would.

270
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,503
I would trust you with anything.

271
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,882
And I didn't always feel
that way, but I do now.

272
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,482
Actually, why don't you get up
and come with me for a minute.

273
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,357
Can you die from eating
Pop Rocks and soda?

274
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,328
If I hold in a fart,
will I explode?

275
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,195
Why don't you try to find your
mom? Check the front desk.

276
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,564
Dr. Morris. This is
Roxanne Gaines.

277
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,105
She's on captopril, Lasix,
Ambien, and glyburide.

278
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,367
She comes in once
a month for refills...

279
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,069
sometimes more when she
shares meds with her cat.

280
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,338
Yeah, Purdy has insomnia.

281
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,910
You can do this at
your primary physician's.

282
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,053
No, wait, Morris. Please, just...
Can you just do this for me?

283
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,951
- What?
- If I'm ever not here, Roxanne...

284
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,852
- ask for Dr. Morris.
- Abby.

285
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,425
Look, just do it.

286
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,052
- I'm trusting you.
- Got films on your guy in 2.

287
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,290
Maybe you guys should
chat. Get to know each other.

288
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,527
A little kooky, but I love her.

289
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,606
Yeah, join the club.

290
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,640
Hm. Oh...

291
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,471
What's going on
with the Hep-Lock?

292
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,079
I got duped, the
guy used it to OD.

293
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,379
That's a calculated
risk, we've all done it.

294
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:25,412
Are they gonna put
a letter in your file?

295
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,646
Nursing supervisor called
me, said to be prepared.

296
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,756
What, ha, ha, are
they gonna fire you?

297
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:31,982
Screw them.

298
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,093
I can always find another job.

299
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,964
Oh, come on, you don't
really want that, do you?

300
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,291
No, I don't.

301
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,732
Got your films.

302
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,104
Blood gas looks good.

303
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,178
All right. Dial down
the oxygen, please.

304
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,939
- Where's Cruella de Ville?
- Covering for you, we hear.

305
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,380
And real happy about it.

306
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,850
Bullet's in the
belly. Call Surgery.

307
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,753
And you threaded the
subclavian into the neck.

308
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,291
- Crap.
- Yeah.

309
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,655
How's the board look, doctor?

310
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,359
Um...

311
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,194
Clear with a white
frame, lots of writing on it.

312
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,835
If you put pressure on
the clavicular fossa...

313
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,337
as you're threading subclavian,
it prevents it going in the jugular.

314
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,340
- Know what that's called?
- The finger in the fossa trick.

315
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,206
Points to the new lady
for stealing the punch line.

316
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,040
Nice pickup.

317
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,277
Go next door, see
what's going on.

318
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,317
As much as I enjoy
being your bitch, I...

319
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,821
Dr. Gates has been duly
schooled, we'll take it from here.

320
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,327
Get set up to fix your line.

321
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,665
We raided your boys too. - Hey.

322
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,390
- Hey, hey, hey!
- It's your fault!

323
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,230
- Can I get some help here?
- Why? Why you have to do it?

324
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,802
- Knock it off.
- Our father!

325
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,304
Come on, guys. Come
on. HILO: You did this!

326
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,874
It's his fault! He got
coach messed up!

327
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,171
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

328
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,076
It's his fault coach is in here.
- Outside.

329
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,513
- Here.
- Get off me. Get off me!

330
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,380
Hey! I'm trying to help you.

331
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,848
Come here.

332
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,081
Sit down. Sit down.

333
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,388
- Hold this on it.
- What for?

334
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,996
Just do it.

335
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,697
Is coach okay?

336
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,096
He's gonna be.

337
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,906
It's not my fault.

338
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,543
Why would it be your fault?

339
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,176
I just said it's not.

340
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,349
I didn't even think
he'd be there.

341
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,517
Where? His apartment?

342
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,286
Coach knows how it is.

343
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,066
He's been through
his own rough times.

344
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,565
And got past it. That's
what he teaches us.

345
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,365
That's a good thing to teach.

346
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,941
I think you're gonna
need some stitches.

347
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,405
Zeke.

348
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,608
Why?

349
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,943
It's... It's not like they say.

350
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:15,248
He would give you anything
you needed. You know that.

351
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,218
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,791
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,121
- Ow!
- Lily, you're gonna have to step out.

354
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,229
- Come on, here we go.
- You know that!

355
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,992
Bring her back in there.
I'm gonna need 4.0 Prolene...

356
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,601
and 1 percent lido. - Okay.

357
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,401
- Abby.
- Have you seen a kid running around...

358
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,066
- he's about 15, yay high?
- No. Not that I noticed.

359
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,678
You working at a surgi-center?

360
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,178
- Well, I wa...
- Haleh, you seen that kid, Zeke?

361
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,509
Not since you have.

362
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,083
- I'm getting lido.
- Thanks.

363
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:48,653
I told myself, you know, I could
walk away and never think twice, but...

364
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,518
If you see my basketball kids
roaming around, let me know.

365
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,250
- Okey-dokey.
- This is County.

366
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,157
- Is, um...? Is Frank dancing?
- Keep your head up, Frank.

367
00:19:56,328 --> 00:20:00,356
Well, it turns out I can't
imagine working anyplace else.

368
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,597
- You can't?
- No, I can't. Can you?

369
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,500
Well...

370
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,107
it wouldn't be easy, but
for the right reasons, yeah.

371
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,334
Is there something...

372
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,171
- you're not telling me?
- No.

373
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,437
- Come on.
- Yeah.

374
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,215
Luka and I are moving to
Boston. Don't tell anyone.

375
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,442
- Really?
- Yeah.

376
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,641
- Ab...
- Can't go there.

377
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,186
- It'll get me started. Thanks.
- There's your lido.

378
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,947
- Then, uh, no problem.
- Yeah.

379
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:28,083
- So I have to go find this kid. All right.
- Okay. We'll talk later, then.

380
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,621
- Why do monkeys love bananas?
- What's a douche bag?

381
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,393
- Where the hell's their mother?
- I want to talk to you.

382
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,867
You know what? I'm not the right
person, because I'm a short-timer.

383
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,837
- You are? How short?
- Yeah. Really short.

384
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,499
Today is my last
shift, don't tell anybody.

385
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,806
I was just about to say what a
great mentor you've been and ask...

386
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,176
- I find this pretty upsetting.
- You're good.

387
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,647
You don't need me anymore.

388
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,810
Abby! He's on the roof.

389
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,913
Zeke?

390
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,223
Hey, Zeke, I didn't get a
chance to finish dressing your cut.

391
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,525
Don't come over here.

392
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,038
Hey, you know, these
things, they don't...

393
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:16,437
Don't usually work out the
way we think they're going to.

394
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,508
Because it's, uh...

395
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,112
you know, it's the
middle of the day.

396
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,342
It's a crowded street and
you'll probably end up...

397
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,448
End up landing on
a bunch of tourists.

398
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,760
Hey, what are we doing up here?

399
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,869
After Jamal got shot...

400
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,277
out in Tinley...

401
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,184
coach told us if we ever
needed a place to go...

402
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,921
like to be safe or just chill...

403
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:11,621
He left his key in one of those little
magnet boxes behind the radiator.

404
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,635
Those kids hassle me...

405
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,900
all the time.

406
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,843
I told them I could
take them to a place...

407
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,411
where we could just party...

408
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,442
hang out, do whatever
we wanted there.

409
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,614
After coach came in,
everything got crazy.

410
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,619
I couldn't stop them.

411
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,429
I promise I'm gonna fix up
your coach if you'll just please...

412
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,429
Just come back
away from there, okay?

413
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,193
All right, listen. Hey.

414
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,030
I'm gonna...

415
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,503
Look at this. Come here.
Look at this. Just look at this.

416
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,837
All right? You take it.

417
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,944
I don't live up to my end...

418
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,484
you inject that into your vein
and your heart will stop beating.

419
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,849
- I'm not stupid.
- I'm not kidding.

420
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,020
It's called a fatal arrhythmia.

421
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,287
If I don't live up
to my part, take it...

422
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,363
and you can do
whatever you want.

423
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,998
Are you nuts or something?

424
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,697
I just know what it's
like to be out on a ledge.

425
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,379
And yeah, I'm nuts.

426
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,151
So why don't you just please...
Just please come back here, okay?

427
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,478
Come on.

428
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,924
Come on, Zeke.
Come here. Come on.

429
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,923
Just easy.

430
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,570
It's okay.

431
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,172
Listen to me, we have
a man bleeding out.

432
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,442
The rapid infuser.

433
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,882
We're bringing the GSW.

434
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,319
- Switch to portable, we're going.
- Someone tell me what's going on.

435
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,355
Losing blood faster
than it's replaced.

436
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,494
Surgeons need to
get in there and repair.

437
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,889
Seems too red.

438
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,360
- Run of six.
- All right.

439
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,998
- Let's roll.
- He's got a pulse.

440
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,158
Send him with a crappy BP
and intermittent V-tach he'll arrest.

441
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,463
Longer we argue,
the greater the chance.

442
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,868
- She's right.
- We're more equipped to handle...

443
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,564
a code down here, trust me.

444
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,300
Abby. HALEH: He's in V-tach.

445
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,537
- All right, lost pulse.
- Thoracotomy tray.

446
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,682
- Starting compressions.
- Charge to 360.

447
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,160
Sterile 7s, a 10 blade.
- What are you doing?

448
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,482
We have to open his chest.

449
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,917
- Abby, look at this.
- Not now, Grady. Clear.

450
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,347
No change.

451
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,722
- Resume compressions, 360, again.
- Look at the left hemi-diaphragm.

452
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,920
Yeah, it's a hemothorax.
It happens. Clear.

453
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,365
Still in V-tach.

454
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,229
All right. Haleh,
prep the chest.

455
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,327
You slowed us down enough.

456
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,336
Three-sixty again.
Stand by with epi.

457
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,906
The chest tube went through?

458
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,238
You see the tip of the
tube right there. Clear.

459
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,404
Maybe it only looks like the tip.
The end is obscured by blood.

460
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:18,050
- Back in sinus.
- Strong radial pulse.

461
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,516
All right. Let's
get him to the O.R.

462
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,881
All right.

463
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,417
- Wait.
- No.

464
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,081
Grady's right.

465
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,523
Chest tube followed
the bullet, in the spleen.

466
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,926
Listen, that is highly unlikely,
and we can't prove it here.

467
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,430
We could see it with the
ultrasound. Let me see.

468
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,035
- We did an ultrasound.
- But it's easy to miss.

469
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,865
A dislodged clot in the
spleen could have caused...

470
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,305
Caused a precipitous arterial
bleed to drain out the chest tube.

471
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,738
Get out of the way.

472
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,605
Yeah, I can't get a
good view. Haleh...

473
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,807
call down to the pharmacy,
have them deliver some fibrin glue.

474
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,281
- Dr. Lockhart.
- Fibrin?

475
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,319
A tissue adhesive, it can be
used for splenic hemostasis.

476
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,979
I think the dose is 2000
units but you better check.

477
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,955
Stop. Enough. We are done.

478
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,424
He is a green resident,
and you're a newbie...

479
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,826
- we ain't messing around on a hunch.
- Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

480
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:09,093
I know you don't know anything
about me or my clinical judgment.

481
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,761
But it's not really my first day.
It's... I've been here for 10 years.

482
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,874
And I know when
I know something.

483
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,634
And you've been here for a week.
So just... Can you just give me this?

484
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,251
Your five minutes are up.

485
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,321
- Almost there.
- Over a liter out now.

486
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,515
Sorry, we were stuck
with a grade-5 liver.

487
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,786
- Put him in Trendelenberg.
- Okay, here we go.

488
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,089
- How long to clot? ABBY:
How long does what take?

489
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,528
Fibrin glue. Couple
of seconds, I think.

490
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,634
We think the chest
tube's in the spleen.

491
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,293
- You think?
- Yeah. No scan, we can't see anything.

492
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,633
- So how'd you come up with this plan?
- Grady.

493
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,138
He was paying attention.

494
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,440
Seems to have worked.

495
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,843
Oh, God, thank you.

496
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,209
Thank you.

497
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,110
Systolic's up to 90.

498
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,017
Clamp the tube. Let's
get him out of here.

499
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,623
- Can I go with him?
- No, it's better if you wait.

500
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:06,815
Here we go.

501
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,388
Impressive.

502
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:15,625
Well, I'm a skilled practitioner
and an excellent teacher.

503
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,497
It's just getting
too hard to deny.

504
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,161
Well, I've never heard of
using fibrin glue this way.

505
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,398
Yeah.

506
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,669
To tell you the truth, I have absolutely
no idea where that came from.

507
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,073
Lodged in there somewhere.

508
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,876
Well, it's a good job it was. And
I see you've met our new chief.

509
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,883
Hm. She's not the chief of me.

510
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:40,084
- Lucien's waiting for us in O.R. 1.
- Okay.

511
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,692
Zeke, you can't be up here.

512
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,357
Go do your thing. What are you
doing? Where's the nurse I left you with?

513
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,662
He... He looks bad.

514
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,364
He's pale from blood loss, but
the surgeons are gonna fix that.

515
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,076
- If he doesn't make it...
- Hey. Hey.

516
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,976
Now, I kept my end of
the bargain so far, right?

517
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,279
All right, now you
have to keep yours.

518
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:07,078
Now, just go downstairs
and wait with the nurse.

519
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,050
Zeke, this is
going to be all right.

520
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,190
You just have to keep
telling yourself that.

521
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,521
All right. I'll see you later.

522
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,801
A little more traction. - Coker.

523
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,301
End-tidal looks good.

524
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,270
All right, into the peritoneum.

525
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,309
You guys are gonna bring
this home for me, right?

526
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,306
Capsule's ruptured. - Suction.

527
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,242
Splenic artery's sheared off.

528
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,908
You know, we get
tired of hearing...

529
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,418
how you guys have to come
in, clean up our messes.

530
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:46,286
We can autotransfuse what's
left back in the splenic vein.

531
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,984
But the fact is,
sometimes you do.

532
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,460
VBG's 7.38. NEELA: Pickups.

533
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,270
So let's make this one
more for the road, huh?

534
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,236
Here's our bullet.

535
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:10,182
- Second liter's up.
- Curved clamp to Neela.

536
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:14,286
Splenorenal ligament
is isolated and...

537
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,685
And cut. Excellent.
Looking up, Abby.

538
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,015
Great.

539
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,283
That is great.

540
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,861
Bovie. Watch out for the...

541
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,554
Gastroepiploic artery. See it.

542
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:29,224
Okay, bullet completely
spared the stomach and liver.

543
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,731
You guys are so good at this.

544
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,905
I mean, just
really, really good.

545
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,103
Systolic's holding at 98.
DUBENKO & NEELA: Oh-silk.

546
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,411
And I love what
you've done up here.

547
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,652
This new observation
deck is very comfortable.

548
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,152
Nicely lit. Nice big window.

549
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,518
- Way to go. NEELA:
Posterior margin's free.

550
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,092
Mobilize it.

551
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,593
- Curved clamp.
- Clamp to Lucien.

552
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,494
And, you know,
you two are like...

553
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,501
Like yin and yang. Have you
ever thought about, I don't know...

554
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,036
dating?

555
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,004
I mean, why ask what if, right?

556
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,112
I'm gonna go tell them
that he's out of the woods.

557
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,772
- Yeah, why don't you do that?
- Yeah, we're fine here.

558
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,282
And I'm gonna be
punching out soon so...

559
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,051
Thank you for this.

560
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,194
I'll see you sometime.

561
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,160
Be good.

562
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,143
They're almost
done, it's going well.

563
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,618
Good.

564
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,054
His people are in the
family room, I'll update them.

565
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:04,788
You know, you won't really have
me to beat up on after tonight.

566
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,890
So I understand.

567
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,828
You know, despite some
obvious issues with authority...

568
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,302
I'm wondering
why you're leaving.

569
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,135
For my family.

570
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,767
I have a husband and a little
boy. We just need a fresh start.

571
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,278
- How old is your son?
- A little over 2.

572
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,481
It's a great age.

573
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,314
I love that age.

574
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:36,093
Well... your
shift's almost over.

575
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,758
Nice knowing you.

576
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,493
Good luck here.

577
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,172
Can you give us a minute?
- Sure.

578
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,244
I want my syringe back.

579
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,813
- He's okay?
- Mm-hm.

580
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:12,390
And you're gonna have to talk to some
doctors to make sure you're okay too.

581
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,035
I know you think
you're a bad person.

582
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,640
We all think that about ourselves
sometimes. But you're not.

583
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,035
You just did a bad thing.

584
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,338
Don't make the same
mistake again, okay?

585
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:38,554
You would've never let me
use that thing, would you?

586
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:43,358
You know what? I really
hadn't thought that far ahead.

587
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,428
See you later.

588
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,529
Dr. Lockhart.

589
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,868
Dr. Lockhart. Dear, you
made me so nervous...

590
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,568
- I had to come back.
- What's the matter, Roxanne?

591
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,372
You're sick, aren't you?

592
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,775
No. Not anymore.

593
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:07,750
Oh, ha, ha, but the way you were
talking. Is something bad gonna happen?

594
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,787
No. Something good. Hey,
Sam! Are you going up now?

595
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,788
- Dead nurse walking.
- I wanna talk.

596
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,757
- Will I see you next time?
- Ask for Dr. Morris.

597
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,361
You have to do some stupid monkey
dance for a bunch of cheap suits?

598
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,764
To justify how we
navigate a broken system...

599
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,769
which is the problem that
they should be looking at.

600
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,566
You're very articulate today.

601
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,402
I know.

602
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,803
Nurse Taggart, it'll
be a few more minutes.

603
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,811
- Are you kidding me?
- It's okay.

604
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,246
No, it's not okay.
She's working, all right?

605
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,409
She can't keep bouncing up and
down like some registered yo-yo.

606
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,610
Abby.

607
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:47,555
Hi. Hi, I'm sorry, but don't
you think this is kind of ass?

608
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,218
- Excuse me? Who are you?
- Abby Lockhart.

609
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,729
I used to be a nurse in the ER, I
am now an attending physician.

610
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,994
- You'll have to be on the agenda.
- Let me break it down for you.

611
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,000
What we do is take
care of patients...

612
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,662
that nobody else wants
to deal with, all right?

613
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,332
The homeless alcoholics,
drug addicts, psychotics.

614
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:11,780
All of us, especially the nurses,
put ourselves at risk every day.

615
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,111
Every day.

616
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,153
When wards don't want to
go over nurse-to-patient ratio...

617
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,917
because they want to follow rules,
guess who sucks up the surplus?

618
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,185
The ER does. And
never mind that means...

619
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:26,092
having admitted patients parked
on gurneys in the hallway for days...

620
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:30,258
and our nurses have to cover three
times as many patients as anybody else.

621
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,028
We're the safety net.

622
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,774
We do not have the luxury
of abiding by the rules...

623
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,536
because we don't kick
patients out on the streets.

624
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,174
So we get creative.

625
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:44,612
And yes, it's against the rules to
send a patient home with an IV.

626
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,684
Worst-case, he'll
do something stupid.

627
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,219
But Sam Taggart is not a
worst-case scenario kind of person.

628
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,718
Well, none of us are.

629
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,793
Because to work down there you have
to have some sort of faith in people...

630
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,932
and in your ability
to help them.

631
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:04,458
She didn't inject drugs
into the IV, the patient did.

632
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:08,698
And what would you have her do?
Deny a potentially lifesaving treatment...

633
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,866
because the guy maybe
might do something stupid later?

634
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,511
She's an excellent nurse.

635
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,655
And she did what almost
anybody else would do...

636
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:27,224
and she should not be punished
because a patient made a bad choice.

637
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,753
I mean, we have so many
things working against us.

638
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,829
Don't be another one of them.

639
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,710
And they all deserve a raise.

640
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,975
Don't make me come back here.

641
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:14,369
<i>Have you journeyed to
the springs of the sea?</i>

642
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:21,108
<i>Or walked in the
recesses of the deep?</i>

643
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,432
What are you doing with that?

644
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,834
- Souvenir.
- Mm-hm.

645
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,338
You come with me.

646
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,828
Some we had to put up for them.

647
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,466
Dr. Greene, Greg.

648
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,967
You're the only one
who's ever gotten to do two.

649
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,973
I don't see Carter up there.

650
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:31,778
He wouldn't do it.

651
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,283
He said it was defacing
government property.

652
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,897
We're gonna miss
you so damn much.

653
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:03,243
<i>Have the gates of death
been shown to you?</i>

654
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,815
Hey, I was looking for you.

655
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,085
Do I have to go up
there and apologize?

656
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,746
No, um...

657
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:17,423
I got a week's suspension, no pay,
but it could have been a lot worse.

658
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,353
So thank you.

659
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,223
Nurses gotta stick
together, right?

660
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,031
All right. I got a run to catch.

661
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,070
<i>What is the way to
the abode of light?</i>

662
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,743
<i>And where does darkness reside?</i>

663
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,123
One, two, three, four, five.

664
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:51,058
Frank. Passion. Intensity.

665
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,858
It's the dance of immigrants,
stuck between two worlds.

666
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,696
Yeah, well, I better get better at
it by Saturday, or I'll be deported.

667
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,269
Is Connie gonna kick you out?

668
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:03,067
Worse. She'll make me
buy her something expensive.

669
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,580
Hold it, ha-ha. Hold on a
second. Let me show you.

670
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,208
<i>Apilado.</i>

671
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,052
Now, <i>la cadencia.</i>

672
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,054
Five, six, seven, eight.

673
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,952
I've been stumbling
around here all day. What...?

674
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,253
What were you waiting for?

675
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,493
- Where is everybody?
- There's a double run coming in.

676
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,328
I'm taking this.

677
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,232
- I'm not here.
- Me neither.

678
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,606
Hey.

679
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,373
Tell that big Croat to bring
you back for a visit sometime.

680
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,440
Keep your head up, Frank.

681
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,850
I guess I let the cat
out of the bag, huh?

682
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,665
This kind of group thing I
was sort of hoping to avoid...

683
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,498
but, um, Luka's picking me
up and since you're all here...

684
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,972
I just wanna to say,
it's been a great decade.

685
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,302
Excuse me?

686
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,709
- What the hell?
- She's leaving, Archie.

687
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,875
- When?
- Now, you idiot.

688
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,016
What?

689
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,019
You are?

690
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,226
She...? You are?

691
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,690
- You never said anything.
- Well, I just...

692
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:13,237
- I kind of thought you got the idea.
- I didn't.

693
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,270
I didn't.

694
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,035
I... Well, I'm... Well...

695
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,776
You know, Archie,
it's amazing...

696
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,280
that you've managed to make
my last moment about you.

697
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,509
I love that.

698
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,778
- I love you too.
- Ha-ha-ha.

699
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,683
Okay. ABBY: Okay.

700
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,455
I'm gonna miss you guys.

701
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,760
We'll be thinking about you.

702
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,564
So long.

703
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,366
Bye, Abby.

704
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:28,412
<i>Have you comprehended
the vast expanses of the Earth?</i>

705
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,453
<i>Tell me if you know all this.</i>
