1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:06,633
Previously on ER:

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,333
I need to loosen up a bit. I have
a tendency to micro-manage...

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,739
Yeah, Cate mentioned that.

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,176
I don't wanna be
here. I don't like it here.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,613
I know how it is to come
back from war and feel adrift.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,184
Saying it fancy doesn't make
you seem smarter, Andrew.

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,753
It makes you seem insecure.

8
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,049
Could you get me
a death kit please?

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,682
It's your job to decide what needs to
be considered and when to speak up.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,058
If you're submissive when someone's
life is on the line, you're not ready...

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,893
I try to speak up
and nobody listens!

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,900
You can't be a great doctor
until you've killed a patient.

13
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,004
- So that Brenner guy?
- Mm-hm?

14
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,231
Kind of seems like a dick.

15
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,042
"Because of the ongoing chaos...

16
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,185
there has been a depletion
of resources including water...

17
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,445
which continues
to divide the area.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,613
- What are you doing?
- Water resources are at such a low...

19
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,224
scholars are projecting
that by 2025...

20
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,763
- Okay, put that down.
- Syria, Oman, Libya...

21
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,924
and Ethiopia will also be
struggling for a larger supply."

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,864
That's my thesis. It's rough.

23
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,868
That is not rough.
That is scholarly.

24
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,870
I haven't even
rewritten that page.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,136
You misspelled irrigation.

26
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,475
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. It's "i-g" not "a-g."

27
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,945
Look, I can't type.

28
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:27,053
"Well, one of the most efficient
resources is drip irrigation..."

29
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,053
You're torturing me. Stop.

30
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,024
But as more countries
gain the use...

31
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,823
of this technology...

32
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:44,404
the areas will become... Better.

33
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,816
When was Kennedy assassinated?
- No.

34
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,009
- John or Robert?
- I haven't heard a thing.

35
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,086
- I was hoping you had.
- Do I look fat?

36
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:05,157
- No, sit down. When was Bobby killed?
- 1978. '73?

37
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,817
Does your son have any
friends that may have called?

38
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,989
- '65?
- '68, Alex. You gotta learn these.

39
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,930
- Six, six, '68.
- I knew that one.

40
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,401
You don't even know
how to choose clothes.

41
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,733
- I'm changing.
- No, you look great. Sit down.

42
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,343
No, I hear you. I'll call you if I
know anything, Mrs. Gonzalez.

43
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,379
- Thank you.
- No news?

44
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,448
Maybe this guy
wants to be homeless.

45
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,950
- Nobody wants to be homeless, Sarah.
- You know everyone in the world?

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,854
No, smart-Alex, do you know every
one of those flashcards? Let me see.

47
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,223
When was the War of 1812?

48
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,195
- Look at him. He's thinking.
- No, I got you.

49
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,175
- It's over his breakfast.
- He thought about it.

50
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,536
Hi, yeah, this is him. Quiet.
Shh, shh. It's the shelter on Third.

51
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,571
Hi, yes.

52
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,408
You haven't heard
from him. Okay.

53
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,377
No, thank you. I appreciate
you calling me back. Bye.

54
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,748
I was thinking of staying put.

55
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:09,549
I was gonna go back home but
the airfare is so bloody expensive.

56
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,420
What about you?
What are your plans?

57
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,790
Oh, that's great, Ray.
Where's she from?

58
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,122
Oh, I've heard that
Georgia is beautiful.

59
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,768
Well, that should be fun.

60
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,336
Well, I guess I'll talk to
you when you get back.

61
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,473
Yeah, you too.

62
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,179
- You don't have to do that.
- I don't work Tuesday, it's no big deal.

63
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,283
Don't worry about it. My
brother's friends will help me move.

64
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,182
Neela, this is Leanne.
Leanne, Neela.

65
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,288
Moving. I hate moving.

66
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,984
Hard to concentrate on my dissertation
when my roommate's screwing.

67
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,492
- What's your focus?
- Middle Eastern politics.

68
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,460
Speaking of which,
Samuir Khalaf's...

69
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,327
giving a lecture in
an hour, I've gotta go.

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,332
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

71
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,600
She seems impressive.

72
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,867
Full scholarship to
University of Chicago...

73
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,170
and she speaks five languages.

74
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,939
Does she twirl around in
phone booths and fight crime?

75
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,810
She doesn't seem like your type.

76
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,280
- Why's that?
- I don't know.

77
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,817
I figured you with
someone less intellectual.

78
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,852
Now, that is rude. No,
you've got me all wrong.

79
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,789
In fact, it's evolving
into quite a thing.

80
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,656
- How about you? You seeing anyone?
- No, riding solo.

81
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,558
I can set you up
with a rugby mate.

82
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,894
Yeah, I'd rather be boiled
and laid in a bed of cat litter.

83
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,831
- I can arrange that too.
- Bug off.

84
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,404
Beth, 46, fell down a flight of
stairs trying to escape a house fire.

85
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,632
I'm Dr. Brenner, do you
know where you are?

86
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,970
- Hospital.
- Shallow resps, tachy to 125...

87
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,010
BP's 100/58.

88
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,148
- My leg.
- Closed deformity on the left...

89
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,748
looks like a tib-fib.

90
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,508
- How is she?
- You were to obey...

91
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,516
- the traffic lights.
- She's my wife.

92
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,485
Pulled her from the fire. I
tried to have him looked over.

93
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,147
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine.

94
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,816
- Trauma room, let's go.
- Bolus 5000 units heparin.

95
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,758
Then 900 an hour.

96
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,364
- Hey, do you have a second?
- What's up? I'm late for a diverticulum.

97
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,263
I wanted to talk
about Mendenhall.

98
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,733
Let's all try to move
on from that, shall we?

99
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,170
Pull into the slow lane during
an accident you'll have a problem.

100
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,866
I was thinking of a way to
ensure that never happens.

101
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,103
Really? I hope you
plan to patent that idea.

102
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,909
If you have the ability to control the
future, you might be onto something.

103
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,381
- Lucien, I'm not joking.
- Let's just use this...

104
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,112
as an opportunity to assess
your management style.

105
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,620
My style is not the problem.

106
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,281
How am I to delegate work
to an intern I can't trust?

107
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,892
Make him into one you can.

108
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,222
I wish I didn't have
to supervise anyone.

109
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,695
- I'd be better off.
- That's really how you feel?

110
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,096
- Yeah, it is.
- Fine then. Permission granted.

111
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:38,034
You are free of having to
supervise. No more interns for you.

112
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,369
He's not capable, not competent.
I can't have him killing another.

113
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,443
I'm moving him. He's gone.
You made a decision, stick by it.

114
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,308
- They have me in surgical clinic.
- You'll have to do it anyway.

115
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,214
I was planning on the end
of the year when I was tired.

116
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,412
- You'll be fine.
- What if Dr. Rasgotra...

117
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,421
cockblocks me in the department?

118
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,423
- She's not.
- Andrew thinks everyone...

119
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,824
is thinking about him.
Do not entertain him.

120
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,657
She told Dubenko she doesn't
want me to work with her.

121
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,925
Give her a few
weeks, she'll get over it.

122
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,659
And if she doesn't?

123
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,168
You'll look at ass ditzels
on old women forever.

124
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,308
Hey, just because
Banfield's on vacation...

125
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,409
doesn't mean you
guys can slack off.

126
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,842
Tracy, Grady, Brenner
just got a trauma.

127
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,073
And Daria, Gates is doing
a central line in Curtains.

128
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,186
And Andrew, you shouldn't
even be down here.

129
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,652
You see? Even the
nurses don't want me here.

130
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,415
- I am gonna strangle you.
- Is he like this at home?

131
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,791
- Uh-huh. All the time.
- All right, you need some love.

132
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,293
Hands in. Intern power.

133
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,931
Break.

134
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,057
Thank God I'm a resident.

135
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,136
Maybe I should call the VA
hospital or Voices for Veterans.

136
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,499
You've done enough.

137
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,107
I could also check the
alleys around the hospital.

138
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,478
Sorry, I got stuck
splinting a 3-year-old.

139
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,211
Ten of lido.

140
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:55,372
Hey, sir, you're gonna feel a little
stick, this is the numbing medicine.

141
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,675
Ceftriaxone's ready.

142
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,786
What's the name of that
shelter on Michigan near the El?

143
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,353
St. Mary's.

144
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,690
My neighbor volunteers there.

145
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,826
All right. Angle
that up a little bit.

146
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,688
- How many rounds of epi?
- Three.

147
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,524
- He's been out 20 minutes.
- Lily? What's going on?

148
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,222
Homeless man found down.

149
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,858
You guys got this, right?

150
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,299
Line is primed.

151
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,149
- Only 80 systolic.
- I can't thread the guidewire.

152
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,074
Don't pull back. Try
rotating the bevel.

153
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,007
- Maybe that's not him.
- That's his duffle.

154
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,841
It's not going. SAM: He
needs volume and pressors.

155
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,179
All right. Get me
gloves. Open a new tray.

156
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,548
That's it.

157
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,734
Superficial burns
to the right arm.

158
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,804
- What labs do you want?
- CBC, trauma panel, type and cross.

159
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,668
Why won't they leave us alone?

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,139
- Chest is stable.
- It's okay, honey. We'll move.

161
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,807
- Right-upper quadrant's tender.
- Not going anywhere.

162
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,911
This is our home.

163
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,552
Talk later. Let's
just get you well first.

164
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:05,143
IV's in.

165
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,514
Your interns do know
how to hold a scalpel?

166
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,690
- Excuse me? NEELA:
Why was surgery called...

167
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,119
for a buttock abscess?

168
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,921
I was late because I was doing
an I&D that an ER intern could do.

169
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,791
A surgical intern.
Your underlings?

170
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,762
That's really not the
point. What have you got?

171
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,370
Beth Lotery. Blunt trauma to
the belly and legs, minor burns.

172
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,698
- How's the ultrasound?
- We're getting to that.

173
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,535
- Sat's 86.
- What's happening?

174
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,870
Mrs. Lotery, open your eyes.

175
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,276
- She's not breathing.
- Intubating.

176
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,179
- Tracy, you up for this?
- Totally. Mac two and seven-oh.

177
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,843
Morris, can you sew this
and check the chest x-ray?

178
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,316
Let your intern do it.

179
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,891
- Five hundred cc's in.
- He's still hypotensive.

180
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,550
Two liters and start levophed.

181
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,855
He's septic, help me
get his pressure up.

182
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,693
- What are you doing?
- I have to take care of something.

183
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,499
- Dr. Gates.
- Hey, Sully. How are you?

184
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,229
I need more colored condoms.

185
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,739
- I gave you a bunch.
- What are you, jealous?

186
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,207
I'm scared. I'll
hook you up later.

187
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,557
Tony, I'm sorry.

188
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,997
It's not him.

189
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,368
It's not Max.

190
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,744
Pericardium looks good.

191
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,439
Systolic's only 79.

192
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,776
Could be the anesthesia.

193
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,943
Okay. Hang another liter of
NS. Do we have a repeat crit?

194
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,679
Running it now.

195
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,188
- You guys need any help?
- We're fine, Andrew.

196
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,696
Clinic's not for another
hour. I thought...

197
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,887
More gel please, thank you.

198
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,759
What was that about?

199
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,130
This is the patient's brother.

200
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,896
Hey, Beth. It's
Richie. I'm right here.

201
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:11,639
- She's been sedated.
- Helping her breathe while her body heals.

202
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,747
I told you something
was gonna happen.

203
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,646
I didn't burn down the house. I wasn't
the one who threw rocks at our car.

204
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,320
But this is because of you.

205
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,786
My sister shouldn't
have to live like this.

206
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,222
- What do you think that is? MORRIS:
Maybe a subcapsular hematoma.

207
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,327
- Crit's down to 31.
- Let's get her to CT.

208
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,896
- She might need surgery.
- Wait a minute, surgery?

209
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,293
She's got to have surgery?

210
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,663
Possibly the fall may have
caused injury to her liver.

211
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,933
- You son of a bitch.
- Whoa, whoa.

212
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,096
No, I told her to
leave you a year ago.

213
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,593
Settle down. RICHIE:
You're a freak and a pervert.

214
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,407
Twelve years old. Twelve
years old, Hank, that kid was.

215
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,410
I didn't do it, Richie.

216
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,947
I didn't touch that girl.

217
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,255
How do you think that
guy got Max's bag?

218
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,914
Probably ripped it off
at a homeless shelter.

219
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,685
Pretty lame.

220
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,129
Oh, look at this.

221
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,355
Is that Max?

222
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,262
Yeah, it says a couple
years ago, up in Tal Afar.

223
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,493
- You'd hardly recognize him.
- You know what?

224
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,331
I'll put this up at fire houses.

225
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,633
- Maybe it'll make someone give a damn.
- Well, that's a good idea.

226
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,078
And after that, you're
going to let it go?

227
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:17,936
I'm gonna try.

228
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,671
Daria, did you look at the
x-ray for my pneumonia guy?

229
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,645
Yeah, line's in the
near the atrium.

230
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,444
Start him on antibiotics and
move him upstairs, okay?

231
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,348
- All right. Now show me the look.
- Okay. It was like this:

232
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,286
"We're fine, Andrew."

233
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,016
She's probably having a bad day.

234
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,163
Daria, did you see the
stink eye? Look again.

235
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,929
"We're fine, Andrew."

236
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,158
Dude, you're cool. I promise.

237
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,358
The stink eye, Daria...

238
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,263
- Hello, Dr. Rasgotra.
- Hi, there.

239
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,996
Hey.

240
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,570
Okay, I take it
back. You're dead.

241
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,870
Whoa, Little Miss
Sunshine's mad.

242
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,014
I'm sick of interns.

243
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,308
- This about that old lady last week?
- It is.

244
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,316
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake that cost someone their life.

245
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,716
You need vacation. What
you doing for holidays?

246
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,256
I was thinking to visit Ray but
he's going away with his girlfriend.

247
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,482
His girlfriend?

248
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,821
Morris, that storage
locker in Indiana called.

249
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,897
They said if you don't pay
up they'll sell your dad's stuff.

250
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,660
Dead, my dad's driving me
crazy. Ray has a girlfriend?

251
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,929
- He just met her at the gym.
- Are you okay?

252
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,936
I'm happy for him.
This is wonderful.

253
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,905
- Are you Neela Rasgotra?
- Yeah, how can I help you?

254
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,339
You've been served.

255
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,206
Is that a subpoena?

256
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,713
Yeah, it's a medical
malpractice suit.

257
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,715
Going for a CAT scan of
her abdomen and pelvis.

258
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,089
Could give her cancer.

259
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,388
We have to have it to
see if she needs surgery.

260
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,394
- You coming up, Dr. Brenner?
- Yeah. Did you bring O-neg?

261
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,226
- Right here.
- How long does this take?

262
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,594
Not very long.

263
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,293
Can you check his oxygen
levels while we go upstairs?

264
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,597
- I wanna stay.
- Should listen to your lungs.

265
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,571
- You can't be with her.
- I'll let you know her results.

266
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,301
I'm okay. Really.

267
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,036
You're short of breath,
let me check you out.

268
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,912
Okay.

269
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,280
Bye, sweetie.

270
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,321
Why don't you come with us?

271
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,463
This way.

272
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:26,973
It's not true what
he's saying about me.

273
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,975
- None of my business.
- I mean, I teach music.

274
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,773
How am I supposed to show
a kid how to play clarinet...

275
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,415
without touching
their arm, their back?

276
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,676
What school are you at?

277
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,343
- Oak Hill Elementary.
- Lily, can you give me a hand?

278
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,182
No problem.

279
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:49,290
One of my students came
forward about a year ago.

280
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,799
I thought it would all be
settled by a quick conversation...

281
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,128
with her and her parents...

282
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,996
but then next thing I know...

283
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:05,011
I'm suspended without
pay, facing a lawsuit.

284
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,510
Her word against yours?

285
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,844
Then the whole neighborhood...

286
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,018
went on a witch-hunt.

287
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,882
Everyone we knew.

288
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,358
They just turned against us.

289
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,999
Can you open your
mouth for me please?

290
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,397
- Say "Ah."
- Ah.

291
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,905
She said I did stuff.

292
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,979
Made her do stuff.

293
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,552
I have a daughter.

294
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,926
I would never hurt a kid.

295
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:09,603
I thought it would be all over
when they found me not guilty...

296
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:15,215
but they just kept harassing us.

297
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,752
Now they tried to
burn down our house.

298
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,453
I'm sure the cops will
find out who did this.

299
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,288
The cops don't care.

300
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,894
To them, I'm guilty.

301
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,072
I've got eight clinic patients
waiting, so this better be...

302
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,208
- Is that your hand?
- Can you forget that.

303
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,368
I was hoping you could
do a quick skin biopsy.

304
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,945
- Do something.
- Send him...

305
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,379
- to Derm clinic?
- Don't have an opening until February.

306
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,916
How long have you had this?

307
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,077
Don't know, for a while? I'm
getting married in a month.

308
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,745
My body can't look like this.

309
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,290
- Have a minute?
- Asymmetric, irregular burns.

310
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,325
He can't wait three
months for a biopsy.

311
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,053
Yeah. Give me a sec.

312
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,925
- Get one of these?
- No, what is it?

313
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,395
Bertha's family is suing.

314
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,898
You're kidding. They
said they wouldn't do that.

315
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,766
- You talked to them?
- I had to tell them the truth.

316
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:13,998
You told them?

317
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,335
- My brother's very ethical...
- I can handle it.

318
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,842
- I'm just saying that...
- Daria, I can handle it.

319
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,280
It was my mistake, I
needed to own up to it.

320
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,042
This is not just about you.

321
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,187
What about the department?

322
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:31,518
You're an intern. You'll be protected.
It's the rest of us who are gonna fry.

323
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,453
Hey, Dr. Rasgotra?
Dr. Rasgotra, please.

324
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:36,789
Dr. Rasgotra.

325
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,694
- How'd my diverticulitis guy do?
- Sepsis resolved.

326
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,358
- Was there peritonitis?
- Just a walled-off abscess.

327
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,994
Mr. Lotery's wheezing cleared.
No carbon monoxide on his ABG.

328
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,004
That's too bad.

329
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,276
Okay, thanks. You're
wife's still in Radiology.

330
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,209
- It was a rush CT.
- They're backed up.

331
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,349
Still in the hallway.
Go sit back down...

332
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,645
- I get an update, I'll let you know.
- Thank you.

333
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,857
I had a rough night. My friend, Mary
Ann, read my blog and went ballistic.

334
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,620
- What did you write?
- I said how a certain tall boy...

335
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,025
in gym class who
she thought liked her...

336
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,530
really doesn't like
her, in fact likes Jean.

337
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,962
I see.

338
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,626
And then when I woke
up my head was killing me.

339
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,396
Then you took the acetaminophen?

340
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,235
When I went into the
bathroom I saw the bottle open.

341
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,502
How many did you take?

342
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,202
Six?

343
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,844
You did the right thing bringing her
in. We'll be able to give you antidote.

344
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,715
- Thank you.
- It's not gonna hurt, is it?

345
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,515
- You'll be fine.
- Deep breath.

346
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,920
GI consult, LFTs and
four-hour Tylenol level?

347
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,493
Start mucomyst. We can't be
sure until we get the labs back.

348
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,654
How long? I just need
to go call my job...

349
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,662
- tell them.
- Phone's at the desk...

350
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,597
- or you can use your cell outside.
- I'll be right back.

351
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,327
So tell me more about this blog.

352
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,239
Why would Andrew do that?

353
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,570
All the research says
when you're honest...

354
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,338
about your mistakes,
they are less likely to sue.

355
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,540
Look, I'll speak to Anspaugh.
I bet it'll get tossed out.

356
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,447
Better or else I'll be doing
a ho stroll down the street.

357
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,110
- A what?
- Forget it.

358
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,257
- Doctors.
- Oh, hey.

359
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,450
I've been here a month
and I have an enemy.

360
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,685
I don't get enemies.

361
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,456
- Jeff Davis, you stepped on his frog.
- It jumped under my shoe, remember?

362
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,758
Hey, what's up, guys?

363
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,026
- Hey.
- We're having a pity party.

364
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,931
More Attending problems?

365
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,267
Andrew told the family he made
a mistake and now they're suing.

366
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,035
Do you think what you did was right?
- I'd do it again.

367
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,075
Then man up, go
in there and kick ass.

368
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,769
- Yeah?
- The more you rock it...

369
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,916
- the less likely they are to remember.
- She's got a point.

370
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,076
Right I do. Because if you
keep acting all soft and wimpy...

371
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,852
we're gonna throw
you out of the crew.

372
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,080
We have a crew?

373
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,247
I can't find your mom...

374
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,757
and we need to draw
your blood level now.

375
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,761
Sure, just get it over with.

376
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58,661
- Ow.
- Relax, I haven't done anything yet.

377
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,396
I hate needles.

378
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,236
Can't you wait until
the mom comes back?

379
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,102
Blood has to be drawn
four hours after ingestion.

380
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,840
She took the pills at
9 so now is the time.

381
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:15,182
- I'll go find your mom.
- No, please, just stay here. I can do it.

382
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're okay.

383
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:32,437
- What school do you go to?
- Claflin Elementary, over on Lincoln.

384
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,629
<i>Thank you.</i>

385
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,165
I'm friends with your principal.

386
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,366
He's really nice.

387
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,103
He's a great guy. We used
to be in a band together.

388
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,542
Would you do me a favor?

389
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:45,412
Tell him the next time you see
him that Henry Lotery says hello?

390
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:52,183
Sir, what are you
doing? Step back.

391
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,451
Are you crazy?

392
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,619
- It's not what you think.
- No, you need to move.

393
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,424
You piece of crap.

394
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,731
You twisted
bastard. I'll kill you.

395
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,837
He was helping me.

396
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,337
Security!

397
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,368
Okay, okay, that's
enough. That's enough.

398
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,537
All right. All right. I'm good.

399
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,873
I didn't do anything.

400
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,314
I need some help here.

401
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,478
I didn't do it.

402
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,856
I didn't do it.

403
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,089
Scalp bleeder. I
need a Raney clip.

404
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,562
- No one wants to believe me.
- Epistaxis. Some pressure on your nose.

405
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,361
What's the point
of their system?

406
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,696
- Tachy at 120.
- You need help in here?

407
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,339
- We're fine.
- I'll give you a hand with the access.

408
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:44,500
- Hey! I don't want him working on me.
- Go.

409
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,179
Cops are done with the brother-in-law,
they may need to talk to you too.

410
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,018
Dr. Brenner. Dr. Brenner,
I've got a complex lip laceration.

411
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,915
Align the vermilion
border with 6-oh.

412
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,612
- I haven't done it.
- You should.

413
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,520
Simon, I could use your help.

414
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,127
Just get Dr. Gates to help you.

415
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,763
Looks like a flail chest with
diminished breath sounds.

416
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,900
- This the chopper run?
- Tasha Overbrook, auto vs. pedestrian.

417
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,595
- Pulse, weak and thready.
- She needs bilateral chest tubes ASAP.

418
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,798
I was on my way to my first date
with this guy I met on Facebook.

419
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,374
Open an intubation tray.

420
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,443
A car came out of
nowhere and hit me.

421
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,603
Trauma panel, get two of O-neg.

422
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,410
- I die the day I'm to meet my husband...
- One, two, three.

423
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,143
You know when the last
time I got kissed was?

424
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,652
Let's concentrate
on getting you better.

425
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,018
We need you in here.
Possible orbital blowout.

426
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,025
It's gonna have to wait.
Check an intraocular pressure.

427
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,095
Could be worse.
Maybe a surgical eye.

428
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,390
I was there. He was awake.

429
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,466
This lady's more critical. Did
you try Dubenko or Crenshaw?

430
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,230
- They're both in the O.R. Your intern?
- One percent with lido, 32 French.

431
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,669
Neela, I need a hand.

432
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,502
10 blade.

433
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,577
- Neela.
- Call Andrew. Tell him I need him now.

434
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:56,910
Mitch Kellems twisted his ankle getting
into a fight outside of a supermarket.

435
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,415
- I'm Dr. Gates.
- I was passing out my coupons...

436
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,520
and some vegans
started talking smack.

437
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,679
- Can you wiggle your toes?
- I can...

438
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,121
but my giblets kind of hurt.

439
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,318
Neurovascular intact.

440
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,928
- Curtain 4's open.
- Give him 10 of morphine...

441
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,156
and a knee series
with a sunrise view.

442
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,824
I saw that picture you
had posted in the station.

443
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,799
- Max Gonzalez?
- I might've seen him...

444
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,269
couple nights ago in
front of Benny's Liquor.

445
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,136
Passed out, when we got
there he didn't want to come in.

446
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,746
All he kept yapping about was
how he lost his bag or something.

447
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,941
Still don't have
a BP on this girl.

448
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,244
Two units are up.

449
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,988
- What are you doing?
- I'm hooking up my central line.

450
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,186
What, you don't want
blood from the infuser?

451
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,828
Right.

452
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,924
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

453
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,294
You wanted me in here?

454
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,131
Yeah, go in next door and
see if he needs the O.R.

455
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,205
- Me?
- Yes, you.

456
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,466
Sure, no problem.

457
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,401
Get T-POD, it's a
bad pelvic fracture.

458
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,205
Large hematoma behind the eye.

459
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,008
- I can't see a thing. Going blind.
- Your optic nerve is getting compressed.

460
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,050
The anterior packing's not
helping. He lost a couple units.

461
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,210
Vision loss from a
retrobulbar hematoma...

462
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,721
- bleeding from posterior epistaxis.
- Blood's going down my throat.

463
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,971
Frazier-tip suction.

464
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,323
Okay, Gottschalk the nose
and do a lateral canthotomy.

465
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:21,759
- Uh. You sure you don't want to switch?
- Come on, somebody do something.

466
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,095
Systolic's down to 60.

467
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,295
You're going to have to do it.

468
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,391
- Heart rate's 42.
- Amp of atropine.

469
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,703
Okay, let's get her to
Angio before she arrests.

470
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,236
Ugh. Please don't make
me drink more of that stuff.

471
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,348
Well, hopefully
you won't have to.

472
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,974
If your acetaminophen level is low
enough, you'll be able to go home.

473
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,711
Is that man okay?

474
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,990
- They're working on him. Don't worry.
- When are those results gonna be back?

475
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,391
Soon. I'm gonna go call the lab.

476
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,200
- Where are you going?
- To find his mind. Clearly, he's lost it.

477
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,702
Zadro saw Max on Halstead.

478
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,603
- Are you kidding?
- No, you want to come?

479
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,903
Tony, I'm working
and so are you.

480
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:08,047
- It'll take a half hour.
- What are you doing?

481
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,910
You didn't chase diabetic
patient who left last week...

482
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,245
or the AIDS patient
who went this morning.

483
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,752
- This is different.
- Why, because he's military?

484
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:20,017
- You don't understand.
- No, because you won't let me in.

485
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,720
You toss and turn. Every morning
you're calling Veteran advocacy groups...

486
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,388
homeless shelters. Not
like you served with him...

487
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,228
Sam, either you're going
with me or you're not.

488
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,545
T-POD's tightened
as far as it goes.

489
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,948
Okay, ask the blood
bank to stay ahead 8 units.

490
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,315
- Passed the Gottschalk. Now?
- I can't breathe.

491
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,581
Pulse ox 97.

492
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,282
Inflate the posterior
balloon at 8 cc's of water.

493
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,757
Ten-cc syringe.

494
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,658
- Chest tube bandage is loose.
- Oh, God.

495
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,095
- We're getting an air leak.
- Keep a hand on it.

496
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,996
I'll go and get some elastoplast.
- Okay.

497
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:07,731
- It's going in.
- Then 20 cc's anterior. Slowly.

498
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,236
Okay, both balloons are up.

499
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,449
Oropharynx looks
dry. I think you got it.

500
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,023
I need to get
this girl to Angio.

501
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,025
I could use some help
with the canthotomy.

502
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,830
- Lost the pulse.
- I'll bag.

503
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,365
- Starting compressions.
- Thoracotomy tray.

504
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,529
- Can we wait for Neela to assist?
- No, you can do it.

505
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,105
- Come on, help me.
- We're looking at permanent blindness.

506
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,537
Lido's ready.

507
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,177
Sir, I need to numb
up the side of your eye.

508
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,337
- Yankauer.
- Two units, type specific.

509
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,178
Major hematemesis. You
think it's just swallowed blood?

510
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,512
It's a good possibility.

511
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:57,247
- Maybe increased intraocular pressure.
- Or exsanguinating from GI bleed.

512
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:01,656
One way to tell. Hemostat and iris
scissors. I'm gonna open the eye socket.

513
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,692
- Hey.
- Lotto just closed.

514
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,527
Have you seen this guy?

515
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,664
No, can't say I have.

516
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,999
I heard he was asleep
out on your sidewalk...

517
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,801
and you called the paramedics.
You know where he is?

518
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,500
I don't follow them with GPS.

519
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,408
I just try to keep them
away from the front door.

520
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
Yeah?

521
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,007
How about this guy?

522
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,646
Look familiar?

523
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,346
That the same guy?

524
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,581
I wish I could help you.

525
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,733
He's numb. TRACY: And
he's out with four of Versed.

526
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,165
Then crimp the skin
at the lateral corner.

527
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,773
You're prepped and ready.

528
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,740
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

529
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,540
- We can get someone to cover for you.
- I'm fine.

530
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,088
What's next?

531
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,622
Okay. Iris scissors.
Two centimeter cut.

532
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:46,226
- 10 blade's ready.
- Hold on, I've got a femoral pulse.

533
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,927
It feels pretty strong.

534
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,866
We got ahead of the
bleeding. Try for a BP.

535
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,674
Incision's done. The eye
pressure's still way up.

536
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,972
Cut the inferior crux of
the lateral canthus tendon.

537
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,809
- You're gonna have to dissect down a bit.
- Great.

538
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,384
Neela, we could
use your help in here.

539
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,651
I can't. Keep the blood pouring
in with platelets and Factor 7-A.

540
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,317
Let's get her to Angio and
bring a thoracotomy tray.

541
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,962
I may have to open her up.

542
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:21,390
Retract the inferior lid downward.
- Got it.

543
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,763
That's either a
tendon or the arteriole.

544
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,666
You better be
sure it's a tendon.

545
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,806
Well, should I?

546
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,672
I'm cutting.

547
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:38,148
- Did he bag the artery?
- Bleeding stops, we're out of the woods.

548
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:44,016
Hematoma's drained. We did it, Neela!
- Congratulations.

549
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,055
Get him to CT,
we're off to Angio.

550
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,888
- I've got the infuser.
- You stay here. We've got it.

551
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,544
Hey!

552
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:14,912
You want a ride?

553
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,321
I'm doing my show, laying
my normal knowledge.

554
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,858
This guy calls in and
says, "The economy's fine."

555
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,655
I say, "The
economy is not fine."

556
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,821
Then he breaks into
this long monologue...

557
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,194
about how we're
screwing up and I said:

558
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,895
"Dude, have you been living under
a rock for the last eight years...?"

559
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,972
- God. My left arm's hurting again.
- Just take a deep breath.

560
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,441
I can't stay long. I gotta
tape some commercials.

561
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,341
I need to check some labs.

562
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,073
This whole political season's
been way too stressful.

563
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,740
Well, thank goodness it's over.

564
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,909
It's not over. I'm
on five days a week.

565
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,213
You might need a break.

566
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,688
That is unless you wanna be
doing a radio show up there.

567
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,122
You have a recording
studio upstairs?

568
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,362
What? You mean I could die?

569
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,632
Well, we're all dying. Stress
just gets you there faster.

570
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,034
Let me get a nurse
to draw your blood.

571
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,274
- Hey.
- Hey.

572
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,203
You all right?

573
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,244
They moved Henry's
wife out of recovery.

574
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,280
- That's good.
- Into the ICU.

575
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,214
- She needed another two units.
- Okay.

576
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,888
I gotta finish up with a patient
but we can talk in a minute.

577
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,547
- About what?
- You're kidding me?

578
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,193
It's not my fault. The
street sign says no parking.

579
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,727
What does she think, I
made the sign? It's my job.

580
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,456
Gary Jones, punched in
the face during an altercation.

581
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,792
Swollen over the zygoma.

582
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,902
Once I start the ticket, I
can't stop it. It's in the system.

583
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,302
Why don't we take him to
Curtain 2, we'll do a facial series.

584
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,170
I'm pregnant and this jerk
won't let me get my vitamins.

585
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,541
She got into it with the parking
guy. Fell with a knee abrasion.

586
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,238
Let's move her to Exam 3.

587
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,679
Does he want me to
park around the corner?

588
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,977
I don't make the rules!

589
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,984
What man writes parking
tickets anyway, you wuss?

590
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,281
Get a real job!

591
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,357
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Yeah.

592
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,392
If my kid grows up to be like
him, I'm dropping him off in Omaha.

593
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,553
I will disown him!

594
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:13,570
- What are you starting?
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

595
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,800
- With an endovascular stent?
- That's the plan.

596
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:20,004
Well, if you need an
extra set of hands, I'm free.

597
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,011
I'll be fine. I should be in
and out in an hour or so.

598
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,980
So rumor has it that Andrew
did a lateral canthotomy.

599
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,645
- He did.
- By himself?

600
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,848
Well, actually I
walked him through it.

601
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,721
Oh, you taught him? I thought
Mighty Mouse worked alone.

602
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,420
I was with an unstable
patient. No way I could do it.

603
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:43,160
- I assisted him through the other room.
- So he was receptive to your knowledge?

604
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,826
He was a little nervous...

605
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,531
but he was able to incise the canthus
tendon and relieve the pressure.

606
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,968
- I'm surprised the patient isn't blind.
- What?

607
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,343
Well, yeah. An inexperienced
surgeon can rupture the globe.

608
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,011
Okay. You've made your point.

609
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,155
I'm sorry, I probably
didn't react very well earlier.

610
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,621
Good, because I was beginning
to wonder why I'd wasted my time...

611
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,227
- teaching you.
- I was never like that.

612
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,695
Right. I seem to remember a
blown triple-A you almost sent home.

613
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,232
Then the phrenic nerve I
stopped you from cutting.

614
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,494
Lucien...

615
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,604
And when you
cross-clamped the esophagus.

616
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,208
- What, are you keeping score? I get it.
- Who do you think you are?

617
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,743
Dr. Dubenko, uh, we're ready.

618
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,813
They call this a
teaching hospital...

619
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,381
because this is where
doctors give back.

620
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,850
If you're only interested in
becoming a rock star, Dr. Rasgotra...

621
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,718
I suggest you look elsewhere.
We don't need you here.

622
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,603
- We're driving around in circles.
- Make a right up here.

623
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,363
Tony, it's getting absurd.

624
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,838
- If you didn't wanna help, why come?
- Because I'm worried about you.

625
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,738
Don't worry about
me. Just drive me.

626
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,748
I'm sorry, Sam.

627
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm sorry.

628
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,586
I told you about Keith, right?

629
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,694
Sarah's dad?

630
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,390
Yeah. We got back from the
Gulf, we were so messed up.

631
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,933
Nobody cared about
us. Nobody gave a damn.

632
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:27,903
We had no plans, we had no
goals. So we just... We cut loose.

633
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:31,407
We got high all the
time, drank like crazy.

634
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:33,807
Yeah, you were
young, it happens.

635
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:38,110
No. Keith started having
these nightmares, you know?

636
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:42,220
Alcohol wouldn't make them go
away. He'd get aggressive and angry.

637
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,720
And then one night,
he just snapped.

638
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,622
He punched Meg so hard in the
face, she flew across the room.

639
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,389
Was Sarah there?

640
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,294
Yeah. She saw everything.

641
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,728
Instead of asking
him what's wrong...

642
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:01,067
or finding out if I could help
him, I said "Get the hell out...

643
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,003
you're not my problem anymore."

644
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,804
And although I was trying
to protect Meg and Sarah...

645
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,641
You know, I turned my
back on my best friend.

646
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,252
And then two days later he OD'd.

647
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,285
So I'd really like to
try to find this guy.

648
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,962
Okay.

649
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,524
Well, we got good
news. No brain bleed.

650
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,704
And the eye surgery took all
the pressure off the optic nerve.

651
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,636
- My vision's better.
- Good. That's what I like to hear.

652
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,934
How's my wife?

653
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,100
Repaired injuries to
the liver and spleen.

654
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:43,009
- She's doing well in recovery.
- Good, that's good.

655
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,820
That doctor had
no right to touch me.

656
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,717
I was helping that girl.

657
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,619
I'll speak to him.

658
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,828
Are you gonna speak to the
jerks who hurt my wife too?

659
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,568
You know, you
guys got lucky today.

660
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,397
It could have been far worse.

661
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,206
And it might be next time.

662
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,339
I'd leave here in a minute...

663
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,308
move someplace else...

664
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,814
but my wife grew
up in that house.

665
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,187
Her parents are in a
nursing home 3 miles away.

666
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,294
- I understand...
- She has a card shop around the corner.

667
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,292
She's not gonna go.

668
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,668
Umbrella girl tolerated fluids,
going home with follow-up.

669
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,634
Great. I didn't
think she'd make it.

670
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,670
What happened to you in there?

671
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,639
- I'm just having a bad day.
- I'm the one getting served.

672
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,869
- You want to talk about it?
- No, it's okay.

673
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,071
Oh, and Crohn's CT
is negative for abscess.

674
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,149
Yeah, well, pulse with steroids
and have GI see him next week.

675
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,344
I'll talk to you later.

676
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,581
Is he acting strange?

677
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,190
Kind of. I don't know
what's up with him.

678
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,392
- You kicked ass in there.
- I rocked it.

679
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,532
- Yeah, Neela can't say jack now.
- Excuse me, Dr. Martin?

680
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,395
Oh, Dr. Rasgotra.

681
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,560
We were about to go get drinks
to celebrate the team's victory.

682
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,569
And we were
hoping you'd join us.

683
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,901
I'll pass. Andrew, you have a second?
- Yeah.

684
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,771
Thank you for trusting me.
- Doctor.

685
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,107
- For guiding me and teaching me.
- That's what I'm supposed to do.

686
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,375
And about last week, I thought
I was doing the right thing.

687
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,452
I didn't realize what's right
for me isn't for the team.

688
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,488
Look, I admire your
empathy for Bertha's family.

689
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,716
Your emotional
impulse was correct.

690
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,885
Next time talk to me or Dubenko
before you approach the family.

691
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,224
- That's why we're here.
- Got it.

692
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,093
Now go have yourself a drink.

693
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,464
- You did kind of rock it today.
- Thank you.

694
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:52,008
Hey, I was looking for you.
What was up with you today?

695
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:55,011
You know, that guy
could throw a lawsuit at us.

696
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,012
You Americans sure love to sue.

697
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,115
You think this is funny?
He was proven innocent.

698
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,412
So what does that mean?

699
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,079
He has the right to get treatment
without getting roughed-up by doctors.

700
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,818
What if he goes to Anspaugh?
Or the board? What then?

701
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,985
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

702
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,495
- What are you talking about?
- That guy's guilty.

703
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,999
- Hey, we don't know that.
- I know what he is.

704
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,501
What? What do you...?
What do you know...?

705
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,910
Did something happen to you?

706
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,351
I was 10 the first time.

707
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:52,231
My mother was wild, you know?
The type everyone wants to be around.

708
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,039
And she'd throw these parties...

709
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:03,805
that started on the Friday
and they'd last till the Sunday.

710
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,448
There was this one guy.

711
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,581
Bobby.

712
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,095
Older.

713
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,594
He has a grey mustache.

714
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,171
He'd always buy my
mom this cheap wine...

715
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,865
and he'd give me those little
candies that were stuck on the paper.

716
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,748
And when the parties were going on,
he'd sometimes hang out in my room.

717
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,854
Did you tell anybody about this?

718
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:53,124
My dad was long gone
and my... My mom...

719
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,436
She was unconscious
half the time, so...

720
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,412
They appear to be nice, Archie.

721
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,949
That's what they do.

722
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,455
Hi. I just wanted to make
sure you were all right.

723
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,661
That's very sweet
of you. How are you?

724
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,325
- Good, how are you?
- I've been better.

725
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,736
They buddy up to you.

726
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,967
I hear you have a blog. - Yeah.

727
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,806
- What's it called?
- "Meredith's Memories.com."

728
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,846
I'm gonna e-mail you
soon as I get home.

729
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,108
Cool.

730
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,775
They act interested in
everything you've got to say.

731
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,953
- Do you like movies?
- I like animation movies.

732
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,251
- I love all the Shreks.
- I love the Shreks too.

733
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:58,658
And then you let your guard
down just for one second...

734
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,095
And that's when
they make their move.

735
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,100
Come here. Let
me give you a hug.

736
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,449
But it feels... It
feels normal...

737
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,952
It feels normal at first.

738
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,682
Like your secret and his.

739
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,469
We'll be special friends.

740
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,836
- Let's not tell anyone, okay?
- Okay.

741
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,540
You better get back to your
mom, she's gonna be worried.

742
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,342
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

743
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,367
But then it fes... It festers in
you because you know it's wrong.

744
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,777
Like it's your fault. Like
you've actually brought this on.

745
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,110
You feel... You feel guilty.

746
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:29,414
I mean, I could've screamed.
I could've screamed.

747
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,886
My mom was in the next room.

748
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,426
Simon.

749
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:43,024
Simon, you... You need to
talk to somebody about this.

750
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,171
It does... It doesn't
just go away.

751
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,872
I need to go back to work.

752
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,736
It's still affecting you.
You have to deal with it.

753
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,611
I am dealing with
it. In my own way.
