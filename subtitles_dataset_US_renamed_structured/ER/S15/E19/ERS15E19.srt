1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:06,934
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,440
Your mom will get
a new heart, Lucy.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:15,476
I got paged for an organ transport.
Heart donor. Plane leaves in two hours.

4
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:19,313
The, uh, heart's in Seattle, so we won't
be back until the middle of the night.

5
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,081
- A heart retrieval for Joanie?
- Yeah, it's good news.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,054
- Waiting on a kidney transplant?
- Yes, long story.

7
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,154
Anyone else you want us to call?

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,959
No.

9
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,012
Hey.

10
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:36,830
Let me go, you bastards.
Let me go. Let me go.

11
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,090
Okay, what do we got?

12
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,167
She's not gonna tell Banfield.
Anybody could have missed it.

13
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,395
You wouldn't have.

14
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,804
You've got it all twisted, girl.

15
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,534
- You should just shut up about this.
- No, you shut up.

16
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,975
I wasn't the one out
with that bitch all night.

17
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,309
I told you, it wasn't like that.

18
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,887
I have no idea how long I'm
gonna be stuck in this place.

19
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,613
You're gonna have to
reschedule my entire day.

20
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,119
Please? MARQUEZ: Just a sec.

21
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,710
I'll be with you in a second.

22
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:13,964
Please. I found a
baby. I think it's dying.

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,501
- You found it? Outside?
- In front of my apartment.

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,469
In the vestibule by the
mailboxes. Inside but still cold.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,166
I need an infant warmer,
IV access, and a rectal temp.

26
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,005
Try an antecubital vein.
- CBC, chem panel.

27
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,340
- Add a blood culture too.
- How old, you think?

28
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,076
- Can't be more than a couple weeks.
- Umbilical stump is on but it's clean.

29
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,846
Somebody tied
it off with a string.

30
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,718
- Tenting. Dehydrate it.
- He. We got a boy.

31
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,756
How's that IV coming?

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,087
Got it.

33
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,958
I'm drawing the bloods.
Send the lytes critical.

34
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,362
- What fluids do you want?
- Six pounds.

35
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,468
Fifty cc saline bolus.

36
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,330
Temp's 35.7.

37
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,536
Was there a note?
Anything? Ma'am, was there...?

38
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,575
- Where'd she go?
- Who?

39
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,441
- The girl who brought him in?
- She was here a minute ago.

40
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,480
He's seizing.

41
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,080
Point-25 milligrams Ativan.

42
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:52,698
Sleep okay? K's down to 4.8.

43
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,066
Take a deep breath.

44
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,999
And another.

45
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,998
Good. Lungs are clearing.

46
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,643
- I'm actually starting to feel...
- You were lucky.

47
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,403
- You skip dialysis this week?
- No.

48
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,639
- Stay away from salt, weigh yourself?
- Yes.

49
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,716
If your labs come back okay,
we discharge you this afternoon.

50
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:14,719
Maggie will go over dietary restrictions.
Make sure you stick with the program.

51
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:18,222
And pay attention to your
fluid intake, all right, doctor?

52
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,589
That was brisk.

53
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,231
I really don't need to go over
the dietary restrictions again.

54
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,702
Nope.

55
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,735
Put that down.

56
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,768
- Who are you?
- You eat?

57
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,502
No. KURTAG: Liquids?

58
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,738
- Not since last night.
- Who paged me here?

59
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,907
- Me. How are his lungs?
- Drying out. I was gonna order a x-ray.

60
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,361
Do it now. Sats? CLAYPOOL: 92.

61
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,377
Coags, call the blood
bank, electrolytes.

62
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,383
- What's going on?
- Dr. Kurtag from the transplant team.

63
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,187
UNOS called. There's a chance
they may have found you a kidney.

64
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,362
Hi. I'm Carol
Hathaway. Who's who?

65
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,975
Chris Zafares,
OSHU, Portland, lungs.

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,737
John Pares, St.
Luke's Boise, liver.

67
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:15,041
Amela Ratkovich, Salt
Late City Medical, pancreas.

68
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,946
Neela Rasgotra, Chicago,
heart. What's the hold up?

69
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,748
16-year-old kid riding his bike home
from the movies, drunk driver hit him.

70
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,824
Grandma said yes to organ
donation and then changed her mind.

71
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,722
- Why? CAROL: She
squeezed his hand.

72
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,419
She got a spinal cord reflex.

73
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,088
- The kid squeezed back?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,394
- So, what now?
- Well, I've ordered a CBF study.

75
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,299
- Doug Ross, attending physician.
- Hi.

76
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,632
- How long's that gonna take?
- Hour, maybe two.

77
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,604
- Grandmother's got consent?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,300
No mom or dad to ask?

79
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,105
Dad's gone, the grandma's
trying to find the mother.

80
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,009
She's gonna do the right thing.

81
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,082
Sit tight, have
coffee, watch TV.

82
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,913
We'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

83
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,447
Still no mom?

84
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,752
Number the grandmother
gave is disconnected.

85
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,794
- Busy downstairs?
- Yeah, I gotta get back.

86
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,592
Grandmother's alone,
frightened. She could use support.

87
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,600
I asked her if I could call anyone else.
She said, "No, just find my daughter."

88
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,864
Let's hope we didn't bring all
these people out here for nothing.

89
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,200
Hmm.

90
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,209
Okay. Hi. I've gotta go.

91
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,983
Did you run the test?

92
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,991
We'll get the results soon.
Don't get your hopes up.

93
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,130
I've heard of people in
coma for a very long time...

94
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,789
and then they suddenly wake up.

95
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,063
We don't think
Billy is in a coma.

96
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,227
- He squeezed my hand.
- I know.

97
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,397
But it was probably
just a spinal-cord reflex.

98
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,307
The test that we ran earlier
indicates there is no brain stem activity.

99
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,710
He squeezed my hand.

100
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,187
I'll come and find you when the
new test results come in, okay?

101
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,482
There were five kids
riding their bikes home...

102
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,993
and the car only hit Billy.

103
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,569
- Can I get you something? Some coffee?
- No. Thank you.

104
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,712
- Why is he seizing?
- What do you think?

105
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,078
Sepsis? MORRIS: Maybe.

106
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,049
- Glucose, 88.
- Uh, um... Electrolytes?

107
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,518
Add ammonia level,
serum ketones, lactate level.

108
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,782
What are you thinking?

109
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,892
- Inborn errors of metabolism.
- Rare.

110
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,551
- We don't know if we don't look.
- Ativan's on board.

111
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,754
- We still need an etiology.
- Infection?

112
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,263
Is that a statement
or a question?

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,633
All right, ceftriaxone, 150 milligrams.
Set up for a cath UA and an LP.

114
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,706
Labs are back.

115
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,865
Bingo. Sodium is 115.

116
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,410
- Daria, why so low?
- Uh... Dehydration?

117
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,411
Or maybe mom was
watering down formula.

118
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,743
- Watering it down?
- Trying to make it stretch.

119
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,886
I've seen it before.
Formula's expensive.

120
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,920
- Hypertonic saline.
- What about the risk of myelinolysis?

121
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,058
He seized. We have
to correct his sodium.

122
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,625
Fix it too quickly, he
could sustain brain damage.

123
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,423
We're not gonna do it too quickly.
Ten cc bolus of 3 percent saline.

124
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,982
Hey.

125
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,792
She's hanging in there.

126
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,488
It's amazing, isn't it? No
heart but she's still alive.

127
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,535
So they told you?

128
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,105
That another heart
might be coming?

129
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,874
They're not gonna screw it up again.
And that was a one-in-a-million thing.

130
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,119
You know, having someone
that you really care about...

131
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,128
who you really
love, who's sick...

132
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,399
that's a lot like
running a marathon.

133
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,972
You just gotta take one step
at a time, one day at a time.

134
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,164
But if you keep running
and having faith...

135
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,471
that it'll happen, then one day,
eventually, you'll finish the race.

136
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,841
Repeat sodium is 122.

137
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,479
Hemogram and the rest
of the lytes are normal.

138
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,087
Headed in the right direction.

139
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,484
Keep normal saline
going at 10 cc's per hour.

140
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,252
- You really think it was just the fluids?
- Looks likely.

141
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,225
Maybe he's hungry?

142
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,694
No. No, no, no.

143
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,735
I... I try to keep the relationship
with the babies strictly professional.

144
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,099
- Daria?
- Hmm, me?

145
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, for God's sake.

146
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,875
Get Family Services down
here and call the PICU.

147
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:16,380
They're gonna have to watch him
overnight and follow his electrolytes.

148
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,357
- Did the girl ever show up again?
- Uh, what girl?

149
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,017
- The one who brought him.
- I haven't seen her.

150
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,596
The police are gonna wanna
talk to her. Family Services too.

151
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,892
- I'll look around outside.
- Okay.

152
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:41,064
- Yeah, I think he likes you.
- Oh, no, it's just the grasp reflex.

153
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,039
Sure it is.

154
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,579
Cappuccino machine's
broken, so no lattes.

155
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,915
No lattes in Seattle. Is
that some sort of cruel joke?

156
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,823
So you're almost done with
your surgical residency, huh?

157
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,295
- Yep.
- You gonna stay at County?

158
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:09,095
You guys are from Chicago, right? We
have one kidney heading to Tacoma...

159
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,670
another to Spokane,
but the guy got the flu.

160
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,569
UNOS kicked out a match
in Chicago, Northwestern.

161
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,735
Thought you wouldn't mind
hauling an extra cooler on the plane?

162
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,575
- The grandmother sign off?
- Not yet. CBF just came back.

163
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,614
We're gonna go talk to her now.

164
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,281
The CBF allows us to measure
the blood flow in the brain...

165
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:31,288
by injecting radioactive
isotopes into the bloodstream.

166
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,986
Now this is a normal brain.
That's the radioactivity.

167
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,793
Now this is a dead brain,
which is essentially silent.

168
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,961
That's your grandson's brain.

169
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,033
There's no blood flow.

170
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,635
No corneal or jaw
reflex, no gag reflex.

171
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,305
He failed the apnea
test and now the CBF.

172
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,449
Nora, Billy's gone.

173
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,662
She needs to see him.

174
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,725
- I'm sorry? She?
- His mother needs to see him.

175
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,367
Did you reach her? I tried
the numbers you gave me.

176
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,969
Maybe there's another number.

177
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,731
- I don't know. CAROL:
Does she live in Seattle?

178
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,636
I don't know what she
would want me to do.

179
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,803
- I could send someone out to find her.
- His mother needs to be here.

180
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,684
How you doing?

181
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,386
- Uh, hungry.
- Yeah, well, don't eat.

182
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,928
I'm thirsty too.

183
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,363
We'll get you some ice
chips to suck on. Half a cup.

184
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,899
- Where are we? KURTAG:
There's been a delay.

185
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,535
What kind? KURTAG: No idea.

186
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,573
Kidney's coming
from the West Coast.

187
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,542
There's been a delay. Soon
as your kidney's in the air...

188
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,171
- we'll haul you to pre-op.
- So it may not happen?

189
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,944
What, you were doing
something more important today?

190
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,611
If it takes longer, all the
better to dry your lungs.

191
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,790
We got two days on
a kidney once it's out.

192
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,052
After I see your labs, I may
wanna hold off a day anyway.

193
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,752
Okay.

194
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,957
We can't browbeat
her into donating.

195
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,691
She didn't give you
more info on mom?

196
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,130
No.

197
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,271
- Who's in there with her?
- Neighbor.

198
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,236
- You okay?
- Ha, ha, I'm just tired.

199
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,278
Go home. You've been on
since last night. I can finish this.

200
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,745
No, I'm gonna stick around.

201
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,781
How were the girls this morning?

202
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,419
Complaining.
Thursday, spelling test.

203
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,078
Mm, you know, I'm
a very good speller.

204
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,819
- Yeah.
- Heh, heh.

205
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,052
Grab yourself some
coffee, stay awake.

206
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,890
- Okay.
- I'm gonna try and intercept the neighbor.

207
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,761
- Find out more about the family situation.
- Okay.

208
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,597
- So you guys are from Chicago, huh?
- Yep.

209
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,744
- Where? I used to work there.
- County.

210
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,777
No kidding.

211
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,138
I did my residency there.

212
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,681
- Really?
- What?

213
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,911
- You were a surgeon?
- No, Pediatrics. Emergency pediatrics.

214
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:19,589
- Is Kerry Weaver still kicking around?
- No, she, uh, left a couple of years ago.

215
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,821
Mm-hm. Peter
Benton? Susan Lewis?

216
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,158
Was Abby Lockhart around
when you were there?

217
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,630
No.

218
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,793
- How about Greg Pratt?
- No. Hmm.

219
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,440
- You're in Surgery, right?
- Yeah.

220
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,272
- How about Anspaugh?
- Yep. He's still there.

221
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,175
Yeah? NEELA: Yeah.

222
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,111
Well, you say
hello to him for me.

223
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,346
Tell him Doug Ross said hi.
- Sure.

224
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:53,186
- I didn't even hear the murmur.
- They can be transient, tough to pick up.

225
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:57,729
An IV drug user with a fever? I
should have been thinking endocarditis.

226
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,695
- We've all missed one of those.
- That's what Laverne said.

227
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,837
Laverne is a wise woman.
You should listen to her.

228
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,297
Look, don't say anything
to Banfield, okay?

229
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,671
I already questioned her clinical judgment
once today. Evaluations are this week.

230
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,369
Eighty-four-year-old woman
with multiple sclerosis.

231
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,039
Fever and vomiting for two
days. BP, 102/64, heart rate's 120.

232
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,185
I tried to get a line
in but I couldn't.

233
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,015
Uh, she really can't hold her
head up very much anymore.

234
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,747
Okay.

235
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,856
- Hey, Frank, what do you got open?
- Curtain 2.

236
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,154
Okay. Can she hear
me? Understand me?

237
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,423
Oh, yeah, she understands,
but she doesn't speak very much.

238
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,499
But, uh, she's
sharp as a tack, doc.

239
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,399
Okay. I'm Dr. Gates.
You've been vomiting?

240
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,698
Her name's Marjorie.

241
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:43,331
Okay, ready? On three,
guys. One, two, three.

242
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,240
So, Marjorie, you've been
vomiting for a few days?

243
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,573
Uh-huh.

244
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:52,082
- What medication is she taking?
- Oh, I got a list here. Uh... Oh, here.

245
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,245
Baclofen for muscle spasms,
Clonazepam for tremors...

246
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,586
Ditropan for bladder,
and Zoloft for depression.

247
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,922
- Okay.
- Move your head, sweetheart.

248
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,428
Can you open your
mouth? Good, all right.

249
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,464
Now take a deep
breath will you, please?

250
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,402
Good, Marjorie. Yeah, very good.

251
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,636
Okay, let's do 10 of IV
Reglan, gram of rectal Tylenol...

252
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,404
CBC, chem panel, UA, and
what am I leaving out, Daria?

253
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,107
- Oh, um... A chest x-ray.
- Portable chest, right.

254
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,773
Yeah.

255
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,645
<i>We form a circle and we draw.</i>

256
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,652
<i>And that will take
us to about 5:00.</i>

257
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,291
I thought you were NPO?

258
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,586
- What the hell are you doing?
- Ha, ha, I'm working.

259
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,597
- What are you doing?
- I'm waiting.

260
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:46,030
- Nice socks.
- My feet got cold.

261
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,573
You look ridiculous, Carter.

262
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,813
I didn't know you
were on staff here.

263
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,539
Yeah.

264
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,311
- Renal failure?
- It's a long story.

265
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,579
- Are you on my transplant team?
- No, I'm General Surgery.

266
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,613
I saw J. Carter on the board...

267
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,621
- figured I'd check it out.
- Uh-huh.

268
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,187
- Kurtag?
- Yeah. Yeah, I just met him today.

269
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,823
- Is he any good?
- Oh, he's terrific.

270
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,367
He trained with Tullius at the
Brigham. Uh, a bit of a prick though.

271
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,834
Yeah, I kind of picked
up on that already.

272
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,600
So I... I thought you
were still in Africa?

273
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:26,074
I thought you were still in private
practice out in suburbia-ville.

274
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,672
Yeah, well, Reece is 13 now.

275
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,307
He's 13? Oh, my God.

276
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,509
How does that happen?

277
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:37,020
- What about you, you got kids?
- No.

278
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,818
- You can get married though, right?
- In theory.

279
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,893
- Sorry.
- Don't be. It's just another long story.

280
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,895
- I, uh... I guess I should get back.
- Yeah?

281
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,800
- Yeah.
- Okay.

282
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,378
- It's really good to see you.
- Yeah.

283
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,807
Did they tell you what
time you're going up?

284
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:07,147
No. We're in a bit of a holding
pattern, waiting for the kidney to arrive.

285
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,384
I got a hernia. I'll check
back in on you, though.

286
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,684
That would be great.

287
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,858
Hmm.

288
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,600
- What's up?
- Transpo team from Salt Lake...

289
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,262
is losing their patient. I
spoke to the neighbor.

290
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,774
Billy's mom split six,
seven years ago. Meth.

291
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,913
Neighbor does not think
grandma's seen her since.

292
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,346
- Talk to Nora about it?
- No, she wants to talk to you.

293
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,646
Okay.

294
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,861
- Hi, I'm Doug Ross.
- Suzy Nepsee.

295
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:52,863
I'm gonna go find a cup of
coffee. You want anything? Okay.

296
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,467
- Nice to meet you.
- It was nice to meet you.

297
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,578
Uh, your daughter, what's
her name, Billy's mother?

298
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,480
Melissa.

299
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,980
Do you have other children?

300
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,891
When was the last
time you saw her?

301
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,573
What was Billy like?

302
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,781
He's wonderful.

303
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:47,985
Smart, funny, handsome.

304
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,458
He loves music, especially
the kind that I can't stand...

305
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,858
and he plays it really loud.

306
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,622
Yeah.

307
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,130
Uh.

308
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,495
Lots of friends.

309
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,672
There's always kids coming
in and out of the house.

310
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,643
Big heart.

311
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,372
He really cares about people.

312
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,385
Even the little kids. I mean,
that's really unusual, you know?

313
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,451
- Sounds like a great kid.
- Yeah.

314
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,828
Generous?

315
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,665
Yeah.

316
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,543
Yes.

317
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,190
What parts do they use?

318
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,597
Well, uh, Carol, you...?

319
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:16,539
Pancreas, kidneys, liver, lungs.

320
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,701
Corneas to help
the blind see again.

321
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:24,749
Bones, tendons, cartilage,
ligaments, to help people walk.

322
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,683
He can change
lives for the better.

323
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:35,193
Five lives, maybe
10, maybe dozens.

324
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:39,594
Billy's heart could possibly save
someone else's life before dark.

325
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,894
It's not gonna make
up for what you lost...

326
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,700
but it is something.

327
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,403
You guys wanna hold
up here just for a second?

328
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,543
Can I...? ROSS: Yes.

329
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,977
Mr. Manning?

330
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:10,612
- Oh, call me Paul, please.
- Paul, the results are back.

331
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,851
Your wife has a urinary tract
infection that's spread to her kidneys.

332
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:18,759
We need to admit her to
the hospital for IV antibiotics.

333
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:22,527
- Oh, well, can't it be done at home?
- Home treatment is not as effective...

334
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,863
- as in-hospital.
- She'd prefer it at home.

335
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,529
A kidney infection can
be life-threatening...

336
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,140
in a woman your wife's age.

337
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,300
Um, I think she's trying
to get our attention.

338
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:35,175
- Oh, uh, she's thirsty.
- Daria, can you get some water, please?

339
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,373
No, no, no. No water.
Water will choke her.

340
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,145
I got something here
that I know will work better.

341
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,845
A little peach juice.

342
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,355
Here, we're gonna have
some peach juice, darling.

343
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,292
Here we go. Here we go, darling.

344
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:53,697
There you go. Easy, easy, easy.

345
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,933
She just doesn't wanna
be in another hospital.

346
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,803
Okay, we'll see what
we can do. We'll be back.

347
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,801
Easy, girl. Easy.

348
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,470
- You're gonna let him take her?
- It's what she wants.

349
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:12,243
- She has a treatable infection.
- She's 84, she's frail, she's disabled.

350
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,920
You're gonna send her
home to die from an infection.

351
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,147
500 Levaquin for Mrs.
Manning in Curtain 2.

352
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,848
They know what they're asking.

353
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,586
If she wants to die at home,
who are we to say she shouldn't?

354
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,096
Hey, hold the elevator, please?

355
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,843
- How's the child?
- Stabilized.

356
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,413
But we're gonna have to keep him a
couple of days, make sure he's okay.

357
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,743
Woman who dropped him
off give you an address?

358
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:45,941
No. Mm-mm.

359
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,020
She told a desk clerk she
was late for work and then left.

360
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,419
We'll begin a search
for the parents or family.

361
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,083
I contacted the police. They don't
have any reports of missing babies.

362
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,786
If no one shows up before,
uh, we discharge him...

363
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:03,095
then I'll take him to the ERC
and get foster proceedings started.

364
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,636
- He's a cutie.
- Oh, yeah.

365
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,865
I'm gonna appoint
someone from the staff...

366
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,307
to be his protective
custodian while he's in here.

367
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,412
You up for it?

368
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,550
- Sure.
- Good. I'll get the paperwork.

369
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,222
Oh. Excuse me.

370
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,297
Where's our plane?

371
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,463
What happened to our plane?
The plane that came from Chicago?

372
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,804
The G5? They had to leave.
- They what?

373
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,172
How much time do we have?

374
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,940
Eight hours until this heart
needs to be in a chest...

375
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,607
or we might as well chop it
up and use it in shepherd's pie.

376
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,522
- Hi, uh, we need a plane.
- Excuse me?

377
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,524
- I... I need a plane now to Chicago.
- Do you have an aircraft reserved?

378
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,628
No, our plane left
and we need another.

379
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,424
Something about service hours?

380
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,590
I don't have anything available
now. I can make a few calls...

381
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,168
- see if I can get a flight crew in.
- How long?

382
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,430
I can get a crew in
three hours, maybe four.

383
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,131
No, no, no. We don't have
four hours. You see this?

384
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,277
There's a heart in
here. A human heart.

385
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:19,468
In there? NEELA: Yeah.

386
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,944
There's a woman in
Chicago who needs this heart.

387
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,452
I don't know if they'll do it.

388
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,487
They're supposed to
be going to Cleveland.

389
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:34,016
You like reggae music? - What?

390
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,735
Carter?

391
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,407
Carter?

392
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,646
- Hey.
- You okay?

393
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,186
Yeah. Well, they
gave me Kayexalate...

394
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,551
- to lower my potassium.
- Hmm.

395
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,189
- Oh, that is just cruel.
- What?

396
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,353
I'm dying of thirst.
I'm starving too.

397
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,193
What else you got? A burger
hidden in your scrubs there?

398
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:18,064
- No, just an energy bar.

399
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,069
- Mm.
- That's just wrong.

400
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,734
- Mm, peanut butter.
- Ha-ha-ha, oh, God.

401
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,179
Mm-mm-mm.

402
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,107
- So where is everybody?
- Who?

403
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,115
Your people. Your family.

404
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,847
My folks are in the
Bahamas for winter.

405
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,048
They know what's going on?

406
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,291
They couldn't make it,
even if they wanted to.

407
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,693
Come on. Fire up the jet, they
could be back before leave post-op.

408
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,129
- No more jet.
- Really?

409
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,565
It's a recession man.
Haven't you heard?

410
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,865
Heh. Tell me about it.
My mortgage just reset.

411
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,867
So, uh, how long
were you in Africa?

412
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,741
- Four years.
- Yeah?

413
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,112
- Is that where you met your ex?
- Kem.

414
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:06,608
She's not my ex yet.

415
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,185
Would you like to
see a picture of her?

416
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,216
Sure.

417
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,236
You married a sister?

418
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,777
She's half Congolese.
She was raised in France.

419
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,715
Wow.

420
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:42,978
And she's gorgeous, man.
You gonna let this get away?

421
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,325
Not my choice really.

422
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,984
Does she know what's going on?
That you're here waiting for a transplant?

423
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,099
She's in Paris. Ahem.

424
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,758
Her mom's sick. It's a whole...

425
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,302
Dr. Carter? Excuse me.

426
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:03,932
- Everything okay?
- We are moving you.

427
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,135
Where's Kurtag?

428
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,878
Could you grab that bag?

429
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,314
Heads up. Let's go.

430
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,353
Wish me luck, huh? - Yeah.

431
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,264
Mom?

432
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,268
They found a heart?

433
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,409
You should call her.

434
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,014
- Who?
- Your wife.

435
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,878
She'd wanna know, maybe come.

436
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:49,419
Ahem, yeah, well, I don't know.

437
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,856
Being on your deathbed and all,
she could swoop in, be by your side.

438
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,517
- Very romantic.
- Deathbed.

439
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,728
I know your surgeon.

440
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,168
You know what? Reece is going to
a Bulls game with a friend's family.

441
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:10,901
I'll stick around for a little bit, make
sure Kurtag gets all the sponges out.

442
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,073
You don't have to do that.

443
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:18,115
I'll be at home on the sofa,
watching <i>SportsCenter</i> anyway.

444
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:32,189
- They take her in already?
- Yeah.

445
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,964
You mind if I stick around?

446
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,597
That would be nice.

447
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,736
Was that it?

448
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,577
Mm-hm.

449
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,889
- Somebody order a kidney?
- Hey, we'd just about given up on you.

450
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,424
You get lost?

451
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,325
Stopped, got my nails done in
Boise. Figured, what's the hurry?

452
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,056
Flight was good?

453
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,428
- You like reggae?
- What?

454
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,365
Take care, huh?

455
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,747
Does anybody know
when he's coming?

456
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,427
How about a rough estimate?

457
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,860
More than a minute, less
than a hockey season?

458
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,261
More than an hour but
less than the lifespan...

459
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,196
- of a giant redwood tree?
- Carter.

460
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,361
I'm so hungry,
thirsty. I'm tired.

461
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:49,337
- I'm cold. My arm just fell asleep.
- Stop being a baby.

462
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:53,172
I feel like I'm hanging out of this
thing. Can someone cover up my crotch?

463
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,973
He's here.

464
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,342
We have a visitor.

465
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,283
I don't remember being asked
if Dr. Benton could scrub in.

466
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,921
I'm a friend of the patient.

467
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,649
- He asked if I would observe.
- Uh-huh.

468
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,727
- Put him under, let's do this.
- Whoa, whoa, what about the checklist?

469
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,523
- Excuse me?
- Safe Surgery Checklist.

470
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:13,889
I've had 10 cases today, doctor.

471
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,625
All the more reason to take
the necessary precautions.

472
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,095
- It'll only take a minute.
- One minute.

473
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,299
John Carter here for a right
cadaveric renal allograft?

474
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,737
Correct.

475
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,907
Does the patient
have a known allergy?

476
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,049
- No.
- Does Anesthesia anticipate...

477
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,548
- a difficult airway?
- No.

478
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,743
The risk of bleeding
greater than 500 cc's?

479
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,549
I sure as hell hope not.
Let's go, put him under.

480
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,418
Whoa, whoa. Everybody slow down.

481
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:42,083
Now let's just take our
time and introduce the room.

482
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,162
What's next? We all hold
hands and sing "Kumbaya"?

483
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,732
- Sheila Lane, scrub nurse.
- Paula Cheney, circulating nurse.

484
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,801
Kay Schumaker, anesthesiologist.

485
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,938
Randall Okerman,
chief surgical resident.

486
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,164
Ethan Dean, surgical intern.

487
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,571
Peter Benton, observing
general surgeon.

488
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,735
- Concerns from the surgical team?
- That you're wasting my time.

489
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,404
- Nursing concerns?
- Don't have reperfusion solution.

490
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,744
- We won't need it.
- I'll have some sent up.

491
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,943
Were antibiotics given
the last 60 minutes?

492
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,985
- Just starting them now.
- Ten blade.

493
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,418
Hold it, hold it, hold on.

494
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,584
If you run antibiotics prior to incision,
you cut the risk of infection by half.

495
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,494
Dr. Benton, you're a guest
here and I don't like guests.

496
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,794
As a friend of the patient,
you're welcome to sit, observe...

497
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,870
and shut up.

498
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,601
Ten blade.

499
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,200
That sucks. - What?

500
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,870
There's not much atrial cuff.
Pulmonary artery's a little short as well.

501
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,515
We can still use it?

502
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,811
It's been seven and a half
hours. We're at the limits of time.

503
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,114
Fixing this is only
gonna prolong the delay.

504
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,452
- We don't have a choice.
- Sure, we do. Wait for another heart.

505
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,685
What about the
pericardium as the buttress?

506
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,126
- Use it to graft to the native atrium.
- We're really on the edge.

507
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:56,029
Even with ischemia, she's got a
better chance of surviving with this heart.

508
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,330
If we leave her on the
ECMO, she's gonna die.

509
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,900
Four-0 Prolene on an SH needle.
Dr. Rasgotra, take us through the steps.

510
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,170
Donor left atrium to
the native arterial cuff.

511
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,008
Arterial and venous
anastomoses are complete.

512
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,308
Releasing the clamps.

513
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,145
Suture lines look
good. No leaks.

514
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,684
Five-O for the ureter.

515
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,754
Shouldn't it be
pinking up by now?

516
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,357
What happened to
sitting quietly, Dr. Benton?

517
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,857
No, seriously, shouldn't it be?

518
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,229
Sometimes it takes a minute.

519
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,134
I don't have a
parenchymal pulse.

520
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,104
Crap. We've got an
arterial thrombosis.

521
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,604
Re-clamp, take down the sutures.

522
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,572
- Satinsky?
- Where's the clot?

523
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,862
Renal artery. It's
obstructing the blood flow.

524
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,776
You're gonna have to take
it out and start all over again.

525
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:48,279
Problem solved.

526
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,493
Flush with heparin, saline
and reperfusion solution.

527
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,021
Reperfusion solution?

528
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,681
We've got it. We're all set.

529
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,884
Good thing we had
some laying around.

530
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,462
How long to get the reperfusion
up from the pharmacy?

531
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,029
Fifteen minutes.

532
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,860
What happens if
you don't have it?

533
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,468
You made your point.
- I disagree, doctor.

534
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,934
I think that this is an
excellent teaching opportunity.

535
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,639
Fifteen minutes of warm ischemia.
Organ would have taken a major blow.

536
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,643
A chance we would have ended
with a non-functioning kidney.

537
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,280
Wouldn't you agree, doctor?

538
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,576
If we're all done teaching here,
perhaps you would assist me...

539
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,118
in getting this kidney back
into the patient's body?

540
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,283
Where do you get that checklist?

541
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,584
Now, people.

542
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,254
How long? NEELA: Nine
hours and 14 minutes.

543
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,328
I've got the airway.

544
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:34,464
Get the transesophageal
echo ready.

545
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,296
Cut. NEELA:
Anastamoses are irrigated.

546
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,471
Temp's up to 34.

547
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,075
Okay, moment of truth.
Remove the cross clamp.

548
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,969
No oozing at the graft sites.

549
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,443
We've got fibrillation, people.

550
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,010
Paddles to Dr. Rasgotra. Go.

551
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,919
Charged to 10. NEELA: Clear.

552
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,016
- Still fib.
- Going again. Clear.

553
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,489
Fib. - Go again.

554
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,652
Come on Joanie,
sweetheart, you can do it.

555
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,921
Clear.

556
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,270
Hey.

557
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:18,935
Where'd you go this morning?
We were looking all over for you.

558
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,173
Is he okay?

559
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,373
Yeah. We're gonna keep him
in the hospital for a few days...

560
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,676
but, uh, he's fine.

561
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,342
Um, what's your name?

562
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,853
- What?
- Your name?

563
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,514
Family Services needs to
get a report to the police.

564
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,457
They need to get the
address where you found him.

565
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,292
See if we can find somebody
who knows anything about him.

566
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:48,030
I tried, you know, to take
care of him. I tried really hard.

567
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,401
You did a good job.

568
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,170
Bringing him here was
the right thing to do.

569
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,048
I thought I was gonna
be able to handle it.

570
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,816
But after he was born,
it was just so hard...

571
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,217
and I couldn't deal with it.

572
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,521
You're the mother?

573
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:13,424
Derrick said he was gonna
stay with me and take care of us...

574
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,424
but he split a few months ago.

575
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,867
My parents don't want
me around. They hate me.

576
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,110
I just thought that if I...

577
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,509
- So he's really okay?
- Yeah.

578
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,710
Look, do you wanna hold him?

579
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,445
No.

580
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,752
I wanted to make sure
he's gonna be all right.

581
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,689
No, please, stay.

582
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,797
Look, you don't have to
decide anything right now.

583
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,627
The weeks after childbirth
are stressful, traumatic.

584
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,961
You may be experiencing
postpartum depression.

585
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,834
We can help you with that.
There are support groups.

586
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,871
Look, you're just
overwhelmed, but that'll pass.

587
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,443
You just have to give it time.

588
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,877
Please, wait.

589
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:09,344
He'll have a good home, okay?
Make sure he has a good home.

590
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,641
It's been too long, hasn't it?

591
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,112
These things take time.

592
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,119
Would you like to see her?

593
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,174
Here, here. Press for fentanyl.

594
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,350
You're still here?

595
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,182
I don't wanna miss all the fun.

596
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,790
- What about Reece?
- He's at home with Cleo.

597
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,290
Hmm.

598
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:33,937
- You and Cleo are still...?
- Yep.

599
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:42,242
So how did it go?

600
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,244
Well...

601
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,481
Oh.

602
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,013
That is a beautiful sight.

603
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:55,482
800 cc's of liquid gold.

604
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:06,768
Hey, um, is my personal-belonging
bag around here someplace?

605
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,169
- Yeah, it's right here.
- There's a cell phone in there.

606
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,175
- Would you dial a number for me?
- Sure.

607
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,441
Here.

608
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,708
There's a speed-dial
toggle to the left there.

609
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,115
- John, I know how to use a cell phone.
- Okay, it's under K.

610
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,055
Kem.

611
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,300
Hey.

612
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,107
Did I wake you?

613
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,442
I have some really good news.

614
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,622
She's just there.

615
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,266
Oh, go on. It's okay.

616
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,600
Okay.

617
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,849
Hi, Mom.

618
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,503
Carol Hathaway.

619
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,509
Really? Oh, that's fantastic.

620
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,941
No, no, I appreciate it.

621
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,173
Yeah, I'll see you in
the morning. Thanks.

622
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,373
- Hey.
- Mm.

623
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,480
- Hey.
- Mm-hm.

624
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,519
That was Cindy.

625
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,849
Chicago called them.
The heart worked.

626
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,860
Went to a 36-year-old
woman with a daughter.

627
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:14,898
And the kidney too.
Went to some doctor.

628
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:21,033
- Not bad for a day's work, huh?
- Not bad.

629
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:31,706
- I love you.
- I love you.
