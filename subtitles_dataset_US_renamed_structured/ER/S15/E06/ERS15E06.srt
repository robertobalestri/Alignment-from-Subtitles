1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,770
Couple of months from now
I'll be a first-year med student.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,675
It's all thanks to you, Greg.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,645
Trying to show off to Daria by making
me look small? That is never gonna fly.

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,114
Teaching interns is my job.
What do you want me to do?

6
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,550
You gave me great tips on our last
shift. I'm glad we're working together.

7
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,724
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,952
There's nothing going on between
us. We work together, that's it.

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,858
I thought we could have a drink.
- I wanna stay with him.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,861
- I wanna push his gurney.
- We embrace the memory...

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,935
of our colleague
and our dear friend.

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,545
- They're coming tonight?
- We talked about this two weeks ago.

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,580
- It's not a good weekend.
- So when's good? Pick a date.

14
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,615
I'm working Saturday.
I won't be around.

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,912
They're excited, they've been
planning. They drive five hours...

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,181
to see you, see us.

17
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,848
- You want me to tell them not to bother?
- You better.

18
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,791
Doing that since you got
back. They're starting to wonder.

19
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,898
- Wonder what?
- What's wrong.

20
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,863
I got a full day, all right?
The house is a mess.

21
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,630
- They need clean linen.
- Look, look.

22
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,706
I've already set up the guest room.
We'll stay in tonight, have dinner...

23
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,367
- I don't have time to cook.
- Then we'll go out.

24
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,036
After that drive? They're
not gonna want to go out.

25
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,545
It's just three days.

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,885
They're your family.
And they miss you.

27
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,726
It's not my fault the
pipes froze up and burst.

28
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,755
What?

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,729
Okay, well, then you can
always pay for the hotel.

30
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,661
No.

31
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,994
No.

32
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,230
No, no, no.

33
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, well, I don't care
what the law says. I...

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,577
Okay, you know what,
forget it. Thank you, you jerk.

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,140
We have two days
to find a place...

36
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,911
while they fix this
stupid pipe that I don't...

37
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,749
You know, there is
an obvious solution.

38
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,792
Hey. Hey. Excuse me, sir?

39
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,293
You can't be right there.

40
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,763
I gotta go pick up a physiology
syllabus. I'll see you inside, okay?

41
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,335
Hold it. Hey, come on, buddy.
We gotta let sick people in. Let's go.

42
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,599
- Let's go.
- Come on, Jake. Let's go.

43
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,201
You order me around.
Don't order me around.

44
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,641
And today's the fourth time in three
weeks that you crashed your bike?

45
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,886
- Where does it hurt at, exactly?
- Right side, shoots down my leg.

46
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:38,321
- Any weakness in the foot?
- Are you for real? I could hardly walk.

47
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,654
- Chaz, my man, how we doing?
- Good.

48
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,991
I put a splint on your ankle guy
and restocked the paramedic cart.

49
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,633
- Already? Wow.
- I need something for the pain, damn it.

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,531
- You've already had 10 of morphine.
- It ain't touched me.

51
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,228
You should start taking the bus.

52
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,669
Not that we don't enjoy
seeing you every week...

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,901
Dr. Morris, I'm concerned
about a L4 motor deficit.

54
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,308
Huh? She's never
had that before.

55
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,472
Could be nerve-root
impingement or cord compression.

56
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,744
No. We should check for
cauda equina syndrome.

57
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,148
We're checking labs
and doing blood draws?

58
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,881
He's a first-year med student.
He should be observing.

59
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,924
Teacher's pet needs
to learn a physical.

60
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:16,325
- He's an EMT. He still works shifts.
- I can't stand do-it-all guys.

61
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,091
Especially ones named Chaz.
What kind of name is that?

62
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,895
- Chaz Pratt. Nice coat.
- Ha, ha. What's up, Tony?

63
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,904
Hey, Frank, page Neurosurge. I
need a stat lumbar MRI on Patty.

64
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,065
You mean Patty,
the pain in the ass?

65
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,541
We all assumed that she's full of
it but Chaz picked up a foot drop.

66
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,874
She may need
emergent-decompression surgery.

67
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,539
Nice job, buddy. Healing
and dealing, I dig it.

68
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,354
- Hey, you guys take her up to Radiology.
- Maybe the med student could do that.

69
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,048
Good idea. You know
what? We'll all go.

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,887
- I'll meet you guys up there.
- Cool.

71
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,964
Dude. Chaz, he's a
natural. Must be in the genes.

72
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,861
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, he's awesome.

73
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,229
- Smarter than I was.
- That ain't saying much.

74
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,065
Stable pneumonia, had ceftriaxone
and Zithro, medicines admitting.

75
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,265
Why has cellulitis guy
been here all night?

76
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,240
Oh, get in line. I just got
here. I haven't had my coffee.

77
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,970
With intractable nausea.

78
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,139
Ultrasound's negative,
so I'm thinking gastro.

79
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,478
Digitoxicity could
explain the symptoms.

80
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,088
- She's right. Good thinking.
- All right. Well, I'll add a level.

81
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,588
Why are you all dressed
up? You have a hot date?

82
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,785
- You're blushing.
- Dr. Banfield just suggested...

83
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:25,126
that I present myself more,
you know, professionally, so...

84
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,624
These are not gonna
cure themselves.

85
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,630
What do I gotta do to
get some damn morphine?

86
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,330
- Ms. McPhee. PATTY:
What's wrong with you people?

87
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,009
- Thank God.
- So, Chaz, you'll see a herniated disc...

88
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:40,739
at L4-L5, L5-S1, according
to our exam on Miss McPhee.

89
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,850
- Doctor, can we go in the booth?
- You cannot go in the booth.

90
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,485
Now get her in here.
I haven't got all day.

91
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,122
- Let me give you guys a hand.
- Go in the booth.

92
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,293
- You didn't switch gurneys?
- I thought he did it.

93
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,761
I thought you did it.

94
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,127
I didn't know it had to be done.

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,202
Can I get my morphine now?

96
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,308
How much? Does that come
with breakfast or anything?

97
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,646
Okay, thank you.

98
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,484
- Do you know any good, cheap hotels?
- Good and cheap, no. One or the other.

99
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,024
Hey, Sam. You think about my solution?
- Solution?

100
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,630
- Yeah, to your problem.
- Oh, if you got one, spit it out.

101
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,958
All right. I was thinking
that maybe you...

102
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,293
Sorry. Excuse me, Sam.

103
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,967
Um, Mr. Rappaport needs a TropT.
Should have been sent an hour ago.

104
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,869
Sorry. I don't know why the
night shift didn't tell me. I'll get it.

105
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,839
And if he has two
negative troponins?

106
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,501
Low-risk. If Cards can do
a treadmill, he'll go home.

107
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,772
All right, good plan.

108
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,711
Hey, Crash, how's it going?

109
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,352
Radiology called, said you owe
them 300 large for a new scanner.

110
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,886
- You heard about that?
- You almost killed a woman.

111
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,547
No, her plain films
were negative. She's fine.

112
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:02,822
Chaz, I don't know if anyone's told you,
but the M in MRI stands for "magnetic."

113
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,157
Thanks for the tip.

114
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:08,462
Dr. Morris, Ms. McPhee's still pretty
upset about the whole gurney thing...

115
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,127
but her foot drop resolved.
She's got full range of motion.

116
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:15,400
Ha! The accident must have been
some weird chiropractic manipulation.

117
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,137
Nice job. You cured a patient.

118
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,509
I should check the
carts in the exam rooms.

119
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,677
Through there are the trauma
rooms where the serious cases go.

120
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,722
Hey, Brenner, I got your
unstable angina admitted to Cards.

121
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,588
Thanks. Morris, Frank, these
are my mates, Collin, Roger.

122
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,161
These your derelict
countrymen I've heard about?

123
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,353
Good day.

124
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,208
Good day to you too.

125
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,996
Dr. Morris, we
got a rig coming in.

126
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,329
Oh, hello there.

127
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,028
- Dawn Archer.
- Hi, there.

128
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,003
- Charmed. BRENNER:
That's about it, guys.

129
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,836
- There you have it. County General.
- Beauty. Impressive.

130
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,708
Good on you. I can't believe you
guys trust the bastard with human lives.

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,906
- Us either. BRENNER:
Much appreciated, Frank.

132
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,516
- Where you headed?
- Big game.

133
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,676
- Sevens against the dreaded Kiwis.
- Rugby.

134
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,516
It's seven on seven against
some boys from New Zealand.

135
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,421
I've always wanted to learn rugby.
Maybe I could come with you sometime.

136
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,620
- Yeah, maybe.
- I was a kicker for high school football.

137
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,355
Yeah. If you ever need an extra.

138
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,865
No, we're good. We're all signed
out. But I'll see you guys later.

139
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,732
Gonna play in your stubbies?
COLLIN: Yeah. I'm true blue.

140
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,432
Somebody print out a
recipe for chicken piccata?

141
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,975
Do you read everything
that comes off the printer?

142
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:28,104
Yes. And if you need recipes, I got
some that can knock your socks off.

143
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,749
Keep your recipes to yourself.

144
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,415
Looks like maybe it's
just gastroenteritis?

145
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,248
Do think they'd call us down
for a non-surgical problem?

146
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,789
Is this about my 2-year-old with vomiting?
- Mm-hm.

147
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:43,261
- What's your differential?
- Right. So something structural like...

148
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,922
I'm thinking malrotation
with a possible volvulus.

149
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,559
How do you think we should proceed?
- Upper GI.

150
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,570
- You mind if I do the cut down?
- Nope. Not today, too busy.

151
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,176
Go back to the floor. I'll just put
in the line and meet you at rounds.

152
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,107
Derrek Taylor, facial and chest
trauma from a knockout in the fifth round.

153
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,283
How you doing, Derrek?
- Been better.

154
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,284
They didn't say nothing
about a southpaw.

155
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,446
- Dawn, what's open?
- Trauma 2's ready.

156
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,125
Dr. Morris, I'd like to discuss the case
of the levitating gurney at some point.

157
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,024
- Soon as I can.
- A broken nose.

158
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,860
Third time. But I feel pretty
good now, I don't need all this.

159
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,298
Chaz, facial trauma with LOC. We
can review the cranial nerve exam.

160
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,962
- Look what we got here.
- Bards, what's up, baby?

161
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,869
Not much, man.
Looks good on you.

162
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,475
You know how to assess
for mandible fractures?

163
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,838
- No.
- Good, I'll show you.

164
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,503
- Sending him to CT?
- Definitely.

165
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,844
- Dr. Banfield said we should jump in.
- Sure. Kaya, on your count.

166
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,451
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

167
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,785
Pleasure doing business with
you. Chaz, don't screw it up.

168
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,951
Trauma panel, portable
chest, head and facial CT.

169
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,656
Kaya, eyes, nose. Ryan, extremities.
Chaz, we'll do primary assessment.

170
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,031
Pulse ox 99 on 2 liters.

171
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,065
Sixth round I was
gonna make my move.

172
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,000
- You were a round late. CHAZ:
Breath sounds good, bilaterally.

173
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,696
- A little tachycardic?
- I agree.

174
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,307
Thought I had him.

175
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,909
Explain this sport to me.
Look at this poor man.

176
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,841
- Lid edema, no hyphema.
- Peripheral pulses intact.

177
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,676
They call it the sweet
science for a reason. It's hard.

178
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,011
I'm not saying it
ain't hard, just stupid.

179
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,212
- So what are you, a middleweight?
- Welterweight.

180
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,256
- You a fighter?
- No, my dad just showed me a little bit.

181
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,155
Mine too.

182
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,761
Old man won the Golden
Gloves back in the day.

183
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,830
CT is starting a guided biopsy.

184
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,558
If they can't take him
next, I'll talk to Bettina.

185
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,397
- We had dinner the other night.
- Yeah? How's she doing?

186
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,200
Real good. She's putting in work on
that program we started in Greg's name.

187
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,538
- You're pretty young for a doctor.
- I'm a med student.

188
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,042
Brainiac, huh?

189
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,909
Not really. I just decided
this is what I wanna do.

190
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,914
Looks like it's
working out for you.

191
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,451
Trying. It's not easy though.
- I feel you.

192
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,554
Septal hematoma.
I need an 11 blade.

193
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,190
That's okay. I'll do the
procedure with Chaz.

194
00:09:58,665 --> 00:09:59,758
- Hey.
- Hey.

195
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,061
- Labs come back on taxi lady?
- What?

196
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,965
- Labs?
- Yeah.

197
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,537
Isolated thrombocytopenia.
Yeah, like you thought.

198
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,437
- Hematology see her?
- Yeah. They wanna start IVIG.

199
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,635
- Blood bank's gonna send it down.
- Perfect.

200
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,143
Coffee?

201
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:18,251
No. No, I get this percent-latte
thing. Thanks though.

202
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,460
Hey, you want a hot coffee?

203
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,634
It's cold out here.
I have an extra.

204
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,762
Here.

205
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,846
You wanna come inside?
Have us check you out?

206
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,246
- Have a shower, hot meal?
- I hate hospitals.

207
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,486
All right. Offer stands.

208
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:04,994
L-shaped incision from high to
low, then along the floor of the nose.

209
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,861
- Okay.
- Okay, if we don't drain it...

210
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,265
we get something called
pressure necrosis of the septum.

211
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,995
Go for it.

212
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,938
- Everything okay in here?
- Draining a septal hematoma.

213
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,471
Pressure down to 80 systolic.

214
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,616
- Liter of saline.
- Pulse ox down to 85.

215
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,252
Slip the packing
underneath the flap.

216
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,018
How are you doing, sir? Sir?

217
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,958
One hundred percent non-rebreather.
Intubation tray and repeat the HemoCue.

218
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,292
Prep the cordis for the IJ.

219
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,560
Tell me why we're ignoring the
ABCs of a critical trauma patient.

220
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,068
An emergent procedure
and the patient was stable.

221
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,899
- You call Surgery?
- On their way.

222
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,406
And who's your assistant
with the short coat?

223
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,569
- Med student.
- Fourth year?

224
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,880
- First.
- With a scalpel up a patient's nose.

225
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,280
Anything wrong with
that picture, Dr. Morris?

226
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,528
Kaya, left upper quadrant?

227
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,425
No perisplenic blood.

228
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,533
- And the subxiphoid view?
- Negative for pericardial effusion.

229
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,498
- I'm not getting a flash.
- I'll try.

230
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,160
No. Andrew.

231
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:22,332
Forty-five degree angle.
Aim for the ipsilateral nipple.

232
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,343
- Level 1 is ready with 2 liters.
- Soon as they get the line.

233
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,446
A little higher... no.

234
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,018
- I can't get it.
- Okay, move.

235
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,303
No blood in the belly. - Flash.

236
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,121
Chest is still clear,
pupils are still equal.

237
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,886
Repeat HemoCue is 14.2.

238
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,896
We didn't miss any internal
bleeding. He's just dehydrated.

239
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,866
You got lucky. All right, you,
you, you and you, with me.

240
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,965
Was I not clear? Now, please.

241
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,405
Excuse me. Dr. Wade's
a surgical intern.

242
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,410
In my department. I wanna
see the two of you at the desk...

243
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,707
soon as you're finished here.

244
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,320
Now is when you
acquire skills for the future.

245
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:13,449
Do not let upper-level residents
and attendings decide your fate.

246
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,563
You get in there. This is your shot.
Speak up for your right to be educated.

247
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,326
And if your supervisors aren't
respecting that right, then you talk to me.

248
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,992
Except for you.

249
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,162
You, stay quiet,
stand back and watch.

250
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,274
You are barely
qualified to speak.

251
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,502
Okay, good. Let's
get back to work.

252
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,749
Look, I know what
you're gonna say.

253
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,582
We are teachers at
a teaching hospital.

254
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,054
Which means we have
young kids running around...

255
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,352
trying to learn how
not to kill patients.

256
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,257
- I understand...
- Then why teach...

257
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,558
a first-year student a procedure
your interns should be doing?

258
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,462
- Chaz was an EMT.
- That's irrelevant.

259
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,125
He is only here to observe.

260
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,534
Teach your interns,
Dr. Morris. Both of you.

261
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,700
They learn by doing. Let them do
things. Teach, educate, delegate.

262
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,142
That's your job. Now
go clear the board.

263
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:13,310
Um. Excuse me, Dr. Banfield, but
we have a different culture in Surgery.

264
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,284
- And?
- And I supervise my intern...

265
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,755
as I feel appropriate and I don't
appreciate you undermining me.

266
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,953
Dr. Rasgotra, I prefer to
handle this at the attending level.

267
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:27,089
You have a problem, have
Dr. Dubenko give me a call.

268
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,403
All right. Keep him warm. Keep
the head of the bed up 30 degrees.

269
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,511
Hey, Sam. I wanna
ask you something.

270
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,138
Actually, I wasn't
so clear earlier.

271
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,976
About what?

272
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,143
- What?
- Move in with me.

273
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,448
You and Alex need a place
to stay, you stay with me.

274
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,918
No. We're not a charity case.

275
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,493
Who said anything about
charity? Split the rent.

276
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,320
- You mean, like, temporarily?
- Yeah, if that's what you want.

277
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,758
Your place is too small.

278
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,925
We have a bedroom
downstairs we don't use.

279
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,365
What do I tell Alex?

280
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,200
Alex and Sarah get along.
Me and Alex are cool.

281
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,441
You're insane. It's way too
soon. It would never work.

282
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,171
Why are you laughing at
me? You wanted to get serious.

283
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,009
No, I do. I'm not
laughing at you.

284
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,175
It sure seems like you're
laughing. You're something else.

285
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,617
Why do you have to do
everything the hard way?

286
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,950
Forget it. Forget I even
asked. Just forget it.

287
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,883
- Tony. CITY WORKER:
Need a little help here.

288
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,190
Hey, some help over here.

289
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,190
Excuse me.

290
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,334
There's something
wrong with him.

291
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,161
Hey. Sir? Sir?

292
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,531
How long you gonna keep this up?

293
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,075
Eight hundred bucks, Pop.
Double if I win. We need that.

294
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,644
Not this bad.

295
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,214
- Dawn, he needs three grams of Unasyn.
- I'm on it.

296
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,544
- Are you Derrek's dad?
- Yeah, Louie Taylor.

297
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:56,451
Dr. Morris. The CT was negative.
No bleeding in the brain. Good news.

298
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,887
That means you're gonna be okay.

299
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,551
Derrek, you have a
depressed zygoma fracture.

300
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,492
Basically, your
cheekbone is broken.

301
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,826
- But that's serious?
- It's completely fixable.

302
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,662
- But requires surgery.
- How long to come back from that?

303
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,661
Good six weeks of recovery.

304
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,364
You should be able to
train with headgear after that.

305
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,509
- Got another bout in two months.
- Derrek.

306
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:20,340
Don't start, Pop. I ain't
loading boxes for $9 an hour.

307
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,846
No, you'd rather continue
getting your ass beat?

308
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,535
Let's take one thing at a time.

309
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,244
We'll get you through
the operation first, okay?

310
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,049
Surgery should be
down soon, take you up.

311
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,249
Hey, Dr. Morris?

312
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,732
- He really gonna be able to fight again?
- Yeah, there's a good chance.

313
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,270
The procedure's very
routine and he's young.

314
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,635
- You okay?
- Spinal stenosis.

315
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,144
Up until a couple months ago
I was able to work full time...

316
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,475
you know, hit the gym
a few days a week.

317
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,117
We've got some great surgeons.

318
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:01,311
Yeah, I'm on the list.
Eighteen-month wait.

319
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,322
Derrek's got it in his head that
he's gonna make enough fighting...

320
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,428
get me the surgery. That
and a new car, a new house.

321
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,121
- Seems like a great kid.
- Yeah.

322
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,427
He showed a lot of promise
when he was young, you know?

323
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,433
Then his mother died.

324
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:23,834
He's got a lot of heart, doc,
but his record's 5 and 28.

325
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,170
Nothing's easy at first.

326
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,405
- But he keeps at it, who knows?
- Yeah, but, doc...

327
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:33,278
You know what they say about
a fighter like that? He's a stiff.

328
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,820
A bum. A silent offering.

329
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,918
My son gets paid to
lose. They laugh at him.

330
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,460
They throw him in the
ring at somebody for real...

331
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,121
who can use him to tune
up. Know what I'm saying?

332
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,131
And for what?

333
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,804
Oh, man, I was good.

334
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,805
And still, I was barely
good enough to turn pro.

335
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,604
And Derrek ain't half
the fighter I used to be.

336
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,846
The difference between us is
that I knew when to hang it up.

337
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:07,715
Now, he won't listen to me,
but maybe he'll listen to you.

338
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,879
Maybe you could talk to him.

339
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,026
Help me out. Give him a
real reason to stop, huh?

340
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,155
Due respect, Mr. Taylor,
but I can't do that.

341
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,996
He's a grown man.

342
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,797
He's got something he
wants, there's nothing I can say.

343
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,964
- He's killing himself.
- But he's going for what he wants.

344
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,869
Maybe you should think
about giving him a little support.

345
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,057
Excuse me. Excuse
me, please. Watch out.

346
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,251
- Maybe he hit his head.
- No sign of trauma.

347
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,589
We gonna finish our talk later?

348
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,231
Daria, give us a hand, please.

349
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,560
Um. No, actually,
Dr. Banfield really wanted...

350
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,100
Now please.

351
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,329
- What do you think he's altered from?
- Probably ingestion.

352
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,736
Of what? Coma's pretty deep.

353
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,741
- Benzos, barbs, opiates.
- No pinpoint pupils.

354
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,744
- Respirations aren't suppressed.
- Want me to start a line?

355
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,006
No, Sam can do that.

356
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,446
It'd be really good for
me to have the practice.

357
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,171
- Thank you, Daria.
- Sam, vitals.

358
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,414
- I'm putting him on the machine now.
- What kind of labs you want?

359
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,185
I want chemistry, I want
CBC, ETOH levels...

360
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,590
acetaminophen
and aspirin, please.

361
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,459
Tony. Looks like yours.

362
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,132
Oh, yeah.

363
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,235
We need to scan.
Can I have my light?

364
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,770
- Secure his airway.
- I don't wanna wait. Light?

365
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,032
- My light?
- Yes.

366
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,474
Um, you two have
this under control.

367
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,945
No. Will you stay here
and check his Babinski?

368
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,981
- Give him dextrose.
- No, a finger stick.

369
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,619
- It'll take too long.
- Whoa, whoa.

370
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,081
- Want me to get some Ativan?
- Yeah, two mgs.

371
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,225
- Okay.
- I'll mix some Dilantin.

372
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,692
- Oh! Sorry.
- Get the Ativan.

373
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,398
Dilantin load's running.

374
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,268
- So his tattoo means he's Army, right?
- Yeah, paratrooper.

375
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,241
- Same as you?
- Yep.

376
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,009
Let's get some antibiotics
onboard. Two grams of ceftriaxone...

377
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,550
and one gram of Vanco.

378
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,746
I think maybe we should
get him on some steroids too.

379
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,520
Listen, I'm sorry if I
hurt your feelings earlier.

380
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,858
Dr. Gates, he's waking up.

381
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,598
- So steroids?
- Yeah. Decadron, 10 milligrams.

382
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,931
Okay. Don't let me
tell you what to do.

383
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,937
Don't worry, you're not.

384
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,532
All right.

385
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,048
- Feeling okay?
- Huh?

386
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,313
How are you feeling?

387
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,582
Like I got my bell rung.

388
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,316
Yeah, you had a seizure. You
ever have one of those before?

389
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,890
I don't know.

390
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,161
Can you tell me your name?

391
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,324
Max.

392
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,500
- Your last name?
- How'd I get in here?

393
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,999
The last thing I remember,
I was drinking coffee.

394
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,161
We found you passed
out on the street.

395
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,829
Where's Jake?

396
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,072
- My dog.
- I'm sorry, I don't know. Didn't see him.

397
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,237
I gotta go. Where's my stuff?

398
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,577
- I got stuff in my duffel.
- We got it. Don't worry.

399
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,150
- Hey.
- I gotta go.

400
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,911
- No, no, no.
- Jake needs me.

401
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:32,024
All right. Oh, God. Okay.
Come on. Sit down, please.

402
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,353
- Jake.
- You need to stay in bed, sir.

403
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,086
We're gonna find
him, okay? Don't worry.

404
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,995
And Neuro wants us to send CSF
for prions and HSV for our ataxic guy.

405
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,534
What? He's stoned. What's
wrong with neurologists?

406
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,761
I don't know.

407
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,839
I've got an ingrown toenail in
3 with my name on it, so I'm...

408
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,705
- Hey, hey, hey. You okay?
- Yeah. I mean, why wouldn't I be okay?

409
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,971
- Do I not seem okay?
- No, you seem hasty.

410
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,274
No. No, no, no. I'm
just busy, that's all.

411
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,212
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

412
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,279
Hey, Frank, do you have
the LFTs on my jaundice guy?

413
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,944
Yeah, I'll find them.

414
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:07,457
Excuse me, Dr. Banfield? I
can't just stand by and watch.

415
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,620
- Here. Veal Frank-a-lini.
- I thought I told you...

416
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,961
You can't tell by looking at me. I
happen to be a culinary genius.

417
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:18,002
I used to cook for the guys
at the precinct all the time.

418
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,968
And Chicago cops know good food.

419
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:23,303
Now, this is my variation
on a timeless classic.

420
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,741
Veal scaloppine with a
chanterelle cream sauce.

421
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,678
A little touch of heaven.

422
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,148
Now, the key is the chanterelles.
A good chanterelle is firm.

423
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,720
- You don't want a soft chanterelle.
- Please stop saying "chanterelle."

424
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,254
Sorry.

425
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,727
Thank you, Frank.

426
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,425
You're welcome.

427
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,259
Hey, you. Ahem.

428
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,059
Russ, what're you doing here?

429
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,569
Didn't like the way we
left things. Got a minute?

430
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,003
No, I don't. I'm busy.
You should've called.

431
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,700
I've been trying your cell
all day. Left messages.

432
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,073
You just can't just
show up at work like this.

433
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,044
- I need to talk.
- Well, not here.

434
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,842
Cate.

435
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,209
Uh... Sorry, I can
come back later.

436
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,878
What is it, doctor?

437
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,958
My husband, Russell Banfield.

438
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,218
Hello, I'm Neela
Rasgotra. Nice to meet you.

439
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,023
- You too.
- Could you wait for me outside, please?

440
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,232
You know, it really can
wait, I didn't mean to interrupt.

441
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm here now. Go.

442
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,411
Okay, so I spoke
to Dr. Dubenko...

443
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,644
and he feels that I should
handle our issue on my own.

444
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,378
- Since I'm the one...
- You know what, Dr. Rasgotra?

445
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:46,321
We'll do it your way. Make
things nice and easy for you.

446
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:49,394
And you let me know if
there's anything else I can do.

447
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,594
- What happened here?
- Rugby match.

448
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,963
- You win?
- 23-6.

449
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,128
I think that qualifies
as a massacre.

450
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,240
Can we get on?
All I need is a drink.

451
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:05,503
Yeah, I'll go and get you wrapped.
We'll get some ibuprofen and some ice.

452
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,909
Hey, you should celebrate with
us. Bring your pretty nurse friends.

453
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:12,347
I don't think my surgeon
friends would be interested.

454
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,919
We're gonna head to
Ike's. Stop by if you're free.

455
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,819
Maybe you could have a spot of tea.
You know, leave the real drinking to us.

456
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,787
Unasyn finally came
up from the pharmacy.

457
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,162
- Yo, med student.
- What's up, man?

458
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,859
- You graduate yet?
- Not yet.

459
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,867
How much longer you
gonna keep us here?

460
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,030
- He needed surgery.
- He's next. I'm sorry, they're swamped.

461
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,868
Isn't he an emergency?
Look at him.

462
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,874
- Give the guy a break, Pop.
- It's okay.

463
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,343
Gives me time to do a
full neuro assessment.

464
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,675
Chaz, will you cover that eye, please?
- Sure.

465
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,614
Okay, I want you to look into
my eye and not move yours.

466
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,345
Tell me when you
see my finger moving.

467
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,386
- Now.
- All right.

468
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,484
Tell me again when
you see it moving.

469
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,398
How about now?

470
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,029
Now.

471
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,967
- There's a visual-field deficit.
- Translate.

472
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:13,237
Well, your retina's fine, which means
there could be a problem in your brain.

473
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,711
- What?
- You said my brain was okay.

474
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:19,079
Well, it might be something
called a diffuse-axonal injury.

475
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,880
Doesn't show up on a CT.
Happens with repetitive head trauma.

476
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,149
You mean like getting
punched over and over?

477
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,192
Which is why you keep getting
hit by all those shots, man.

478
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,420
I could step in there
and take you out.

479
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,656
Imagine what somebody
half my age would do.

480
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,063
- He's got brain damage, right?
- We need to get an MRI to be sure.

481
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:40,331
- You can't keep doing this to yourself.
- I'm doing this for us.

482
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,168
This doesn't do
us any good, son.

483
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,742
- Pulse ox is down.
- What's going on?

484
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,277
- What's going on?
- My chest.

485
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:48,914
Where? Where? LOUIE: Derrek?

486
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,413
To The left. To the left.

487
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,346
Decreased breath.
Get him to Trauma.

488
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,714
I'll get the non-rebreather.

489
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,583
Derrek?

490
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,590
Derrek?

491
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,425
Best I could do.

492
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,867
Got you an extra Jell-O.

493
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:13,134
Is there anyone we can contact
for you? Family or friends?

494
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,134
Just Jake.

495
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,577
- I'm fine on my own.
- Yeah, well, you don't seem fine.

496
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,042
No one likes to be
alone all the time.

497
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,414
- What do you know?
- I've been on my own most of my life.

498
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,956
But it's up to me to
fix that, you know?

499
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:36,419
Could I get some
mustard or something?

500
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:44,893
The incision goes along the
fifth rib, midaxillary line, all right?

501
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,632
Tunnel superiorly to
the next interspace.

502
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,175
Curved vascular clamp around the
tube. Know what? You push it through.

503
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,142
It's okay. Dr. Banfield said
I shouldn't touch anything.

504
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,944
I did the whole procedure. We'll
push it together, so you can get the feel.

505
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,280
Wait. Time out. He's
a student here, right?

506
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,581
This is a teaching
hospital, sir.

507
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,452
Right here, just
above the rib margin.

508
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,287
Right there.

509
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,420
- Heard you guys needed help.
- I'm sorry if this hurts a little, man.

510
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,426
- A little force to get through the muscle.
- Shouldn't Chaz be observing?

511
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,470
He's assisting.

512
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,498
- Feel it? Okay.
- Mm-hm.

513
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,937
Push it in.

514
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,469
Harder. A little harder.

515
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,346
Harder.

516
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,481
- Yeah.
- Pulse ox coming up, strong pulse.

517
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,054
Way to go, Chaz.

518
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,617
Now we just sew it in.

519
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,987
You mean, you sew it in.

520
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,824
Yes. 0 silk.

521
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,365
- Thora-Seal provides...
- Dropped in pressure again.

522
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,500
Five hundred cc's.
What are you guys doing?

523
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,662
Hang two units of blood.

524
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,206
I thought you said he
had a collapsed lung.

525
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,514
- Morris?
- We bagged an intercostal artery.

526
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,841
Chaz, when you
pushed the tube in...

527
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,487
- did it slip?
- No. I don't know. Maybe.

528
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,646
- He's not breathing.
- What?

529
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,656
Prepare intubation
tray. Page Surgery.

530
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,887
Derrek.

531
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,569
Honey, I've been out
here for half an hour.

532
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:39,184
I'm busy. You should have called. I
don't like people knowing my business.

533
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,634
How can you work in that?

534
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:42,788
You didn't pull me
out to talk about this.

535
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,056
Russ, please, my board is full.

536
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,425
I made dinner reservations.
Mia Francesca, your favorite.

537
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,726
- We are not going to dinner.
- They'll be at our place in an hour.

538
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,098
That's not what I meant, damn
it. I'm going to cook. I will cook.

539
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,898
I thought you didn't have time.

540
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,974
- I know what I said.
- I'm trying to make this easier for you.

541
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,703
By making your mother think that I
can't make dinner or keep a home?

542
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,576
- That won't make it easier. Believe me.
- Baby, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help.

543
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,818
All right. I'll be
there at 7:30.

544
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,522
Come on. I can't get
control of the bleeder.

545
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,064
- BP's in the toilet.
- Up inside the costal groove.

546
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,431
- Fourth unit's going in. MORRIS:
Come on, come on, come on.

547
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:34,607
- I got it.
- All right, 120 over 80. Not bad.

548
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,833
- Chest tube output's down.
- Surgery's here.

549
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,649
- Where's Neela?
- Gone for the day.

550
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,697
Finger on the vessel.
- You got it.

551
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,908
- He gonna be okay?
- Gotta get him up to Surgery.

552
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,518
- What's going on?
- We tore an intercostal but he's stable.

553
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,678
And how'd you tear an
intercostal doing a chest tube?

554
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,559
Must have slipped.

555
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,751
It happens.

556
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,363
- OR's ready.
- Should be an interesting M and M.

557
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,126
- Stay ahead four units.
- Hey, Morris, you got a second?

558
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,600
Got 18 gauge in each
arm. Get something central.

559
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,238
Come here.

560
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:10,036
What the hell are you doing?
Chaz isn't trained to do chest tubes.

561
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,110
- He has EMT.
- They don't do chest tubes in the field.

562
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,715
- I was trying to teach him.
- By letting him kill a patient?

563
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:21,479
Put in a situation he wasn't ready for.
Not a head start, that's setting him back.

564
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,773
Hey, look who it is.

565
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,846
Got a cup of Earl
Grey waiting for you.

566
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,846
- You take milk with that?
- You made it.

567
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,644
Well, looks that way.

568
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:55,253
Maybe some chamomile
since it's almost bedtime.

569
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,581
Let's get you a drink.

570
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,782
Hey, I am so sorry that I
barged in the other night.

571
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,087
- I didn't realize that you and Ray were...
- Not at all. It's fine.

572
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,425
He and I were friends. He was
in town, catching up. It's all good.

573
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:10,262
Okay. Oh, Jimmy,
another round for my mates.

574
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,233
And whatever she's drinking.

575
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,670
Hey, Max, how you doing?

576
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,634
- Your CAT scan looks good.
- Okay.

577
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,675
So you don't remember anything
like this happening to you before?

578
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,116
- I forget lots of stuff.
- No head injury? Anything?

579
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,484
Maybe epilepsy?

580
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:35,126
Look, could I get a sandwich?

581
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,785
That nurse lady brought
me one but I'm still hungry.

582
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,898
Sure, no problem.

583
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,325
Can you remember
your last name for me?

584
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:47,200
I tried to see it on your
duffel but I couldn't read it.

585
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,898
All right.

586
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,844
You let me know
if you can, all right?

587
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,703
What about this
ink on your chest?

588
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,009
Paratrooper?

589
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,152
Oh, yeah.

590
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,179
Thing hurt.

591
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,853
I got one too.

592
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,049
101st Airborne.

593
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,059
- Screaming Eagles.
- Right.

594
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,595
Where'd you get yours?

595
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,596
This dude.

596
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,670
Max, do you remember
where you served?

597
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,206
Tal Afar.

598
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,244
- Hot as hell.
- Yeah. Up north by Mosul, right?

599
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,885
Tony?

600
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,685
- Homeless guy you were just in with?
- Yeah?

601
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,727
Neuro wants to discharge him.

602
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:48,526
Outpatient EEG and clinic referral.
He won't get his Dilantin filled.

603
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,602
- He'll never make it back here.
- Sam, I took care of it.

604
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,363
- You did?
- Pulled some strings...

605
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,871
and got him admitted
into the Neuro service.

606
00:32:56,041 --> 00:33:00,069
Oh. Okay. Well, there you go.

607
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:01,440
There you go.

608
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,583
Listen. Look, I feel like...
- Hey, Mom.

609
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,082
You're early.

610
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,244
- What's up, Tony?
- Alex, how you doing?

611
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,117
- I'm good.
- Hey, can we go eat?

612
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,259
Yeah, let me get my stuff.

613
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,588
- See you tomorrow.
- Later, Tony.

614
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,653
Good night.

615
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:26,429
Daria, before you leave, can you get
a read on my pericarditis guy's echo?

616
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:30,804
Yeah, no problem. Dr. Gates?
I was just wondering.

617
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:33,377
I wanted to make sure
that everything was okay.

618
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,481
You know, with you and Sam.

619
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,811
- Yeah, everything's fine.
- Oh. Okay.

620
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,511
Yeah. Well, no, that's great.

621
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,580
It was just because, you know,
earlier, things got a little bit weird.

622
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,023
Not that weird, per
se. Just a little bit weird.

623
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,993
And so I just wanted
to make sure that...

624
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,664
Yeah. But everything's
okay. So that's great.

625
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,598
- Yeah. You good?
- Yeah.

626
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,169
- You sure?
- Totally.

627
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,306
Because you're blushing again.

628
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,833
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

629
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:14,344
Oh! Oh, hi. So you're
ready for sign outs?

630
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,479
After you tell me how today went.
Did Dr. Gates instruct you well?

631
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:22,219
You know what? These
are the pass ons. Good night.

632
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,629
Somebody had a poopy day.

633
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,057
- You sure?
- I don't know.

634
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,671
Are you sure? I mean,
what else are we going to do?

635
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,830
- Lot of things. We could go to a hotel.
- Mom, you hate hotels.

636
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:40,672
Hey, sorry to interrupt, but since I
am, I wanna tell you, both of you...

637
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,939
that I want you to
come stay with me.

638
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,718
Because I really like you guys.

639
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,047
And I know it's fast
but if it doesn't work...

640
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,384
then you guys can move out.
I think we'd be great together.

641
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,721
I think we'd all be great. All of
us. And Sarah's totally onboard.

642
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:59,353
And I have a flat-screen TV and
I live in a great neighborhood...

643
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,097
Tony, we were actually
just talking about it. Ahem.

644
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,834
We're in.

645
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,573
- You are?
- Uh-huh. Right?

646
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,437
You had me at flat-screen.

647
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,942
All right. Up your bum.

648
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,603
- Yeah, no pressure now love.
- Shut up. Shut up.

649
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,339
- Just don't miss.
- Don't listen.

650
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,006
Yeah, hold it.

651
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:22,177
- Yes. Yes. You see that? You see that?
- Oh, yes.

652
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:26,689
- Come on.
- Thank you and thank you and thank you.

653
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,851
Green is my favorite color.
Don't worry, it is a British game.

654
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:33,692
- Yeah. God save the queen and all that.
- She's your queen too, you know?

655
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,891
- Excuse me? Who invited the Brit?
- You did.

656
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,467
- Sore loser.
- Shut up.

657
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,538
Oh, what? What did you
just say to me, convict?

658
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:44,073
Oh, again. That's all right.
It's my shout. Who's drinking?

659
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,711
Oh, I am, if you're buying?

660
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,143
All right. Jimmy?

661
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:54,213
So surgery went well.

662
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,948
I'm doing okay then, right?

663
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,956
Well, your lung will heal
and so will your face.

664
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,459
But the damage from repeated
head trauma, that won't heal.

665
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,463
- See? You gotta stop this mess.
- Pop, please.

666
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,667
Just let the man talk.

667
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:18,309
Actually, your dad's right. Yeah,
boxing's just not a good idea.

668
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,273
You saying I can't
fight or I shouldn't fight?

669
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,575
I know you think you
don't have a choice...

670
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,948
- You don't know what I think.
- You want to do whatever it takes...

671
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,319
help your dad, to
make him proud.

672
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,828
But if you keep fighting, you
are risking serious brain damage.

673
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,599
I know I've been tough on you.

674
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,868
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,712
I take full
responsibility for that.

676
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:01,583
But where you go from
here is up to you, Derrek.

677
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,717
You got nothing to prove.

678
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,151
What're we gonna do, Pop?

679
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,633
We'll find a way, like always.

680
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,031
We'll figure it out.

681
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,917
I'll come to check on you later.

682
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,215
Hey, doc?

683
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,927
Thank you.

684
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:56,440
Dr. Banfield, I thought
you were gone for the night.

685
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,442
- I needed to follow up.
- You don't have to check up on me.

686
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,740
- I was checking up on your patient.
- Right. My patient.

687
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:08,649
Yes, who thankfully survived your
little therapeutic misadventure today.

688
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,732
May I ask you a question?

689
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,534
How can such a good doctor
be such a knucklehead?

690
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,942
I thought Chaz was different.

691
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,201
It was a mistake.

692
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:43,622
After Greg Pratt
died, I lost some focus.

693
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,561
I'm working on it.

694
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,304
Well, I hope you
find clarity soon.

695
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,575
Dr. Morris, good night.

696
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,774
Good night.

697
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:19,186
Dr. Banfield. Oh.
Glad I caught you.

698
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,350
Here's everything you need.
Veal, cream, chanterelles.

699
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,929
- You'll never find good ones. I got a guy.
- No, I can't accept that.

700
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,657
Please, I insist.

701
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,967
- Let me know how it turns out.
- And Frank.

702
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:39,436
Remember, this never happened.

703
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,457
Hey, man.

704
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,196
So how was your first day?

705
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,670
I'm so sorry about
that chest tube.

706
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,540
Don't worry. He's gonna be fine.

707
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,307
- And all the interns hate me.
- No.

708
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,316
They don't hate you. They
probably hate me, but not you.

709
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,489
Listen, all that
stuff, my fault.

710
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,058
I'm the one that
should be sorry.

711
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:36,793
It's just, every time I see
you, I see your brother.

712
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,860
And he was a hell of a doctor.

713
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,000
And you will be too, one day.

714
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,202
But you got a ways
to go and I forgot that.

715
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,747
So, today, just chalk it up.

716
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:57,117
All right, it's your first step
on a 1000-mile journey.

717
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,226
I really appreciate
you looking out for me.

718
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,624
That's what Greg used to do.

719
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,458
Yeah.

720
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:17,140
Hey, I'm off soon.

721
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:20,403
I was gonna go grab a
burger. Forgot to eat today.

722
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,412
- You wanna come?
- Sure.

723
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,243
- I'd like that.
- Cool.

724
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,642
Hi.

725
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,982
They're here.

726
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,700
- Cate, is that you?
- It's me.

727
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,370
Hi. MARIE: Hi.

728
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,200
George, get down
here. Cate's here.

729
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:25,673
Oh, so good to see you, baby.

730
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,011
Let's get inside, it's freezing.
