00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,000
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,169
- Told you to get a desk job.
- Bastard shot me in the back.

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,838
Lucien, I've withdrawn
my application.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,449
I'm not staying at County.

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:20,281
And talking about every stupid
damn thing that bothers me? No.

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,383
You know, I truly believe...

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,128
there's something better
out there for both of us.

8
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,059
Better?

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,093
Something more right.

10
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,675
- So.
- So.

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,577
- Listen.
- I'm sorry.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,117
- I'm sorry things got so weird.
- I really didn't...

13
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:56,587
- Shouldn't have been such a... Okay.
- I know kind of I sprung things on you.

14
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,658
You go first.

15
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,653
I know I've been somewhat
closed-off about all this...

16
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,460
but I was afraid that if I discussed it
with you, you'd convince me to stay.

17
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,334
Well, I certainly
would have tried.

18
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,302
But you know what? It's
a good thing you're going.

19
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:15,938
- It is?
- Yep.

20
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,273
Adjusting to a new environment,
a new way of doing things.

21
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,177
You will gain so much
confidence from that.

22
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,477
Well, I hope so.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,513
When you're sick of your
third-rate, community trauma center...

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,124
Now it's third-rate?

25
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,456
- Demoted from B-list.
- You always, always have a job here.

26
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,727
- Really?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,699
Six months, six years. I don't
know. Not sure, but you will be back.

28
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,695
County is in your blood.

29
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,711
And until then, my
friend, good luck.

30
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,883
Get out of here already.

31
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,152
Lucien.

32
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,021
I don't know if I can
do this without you.

33
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,890
Of course you can.

34
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,328
You'll see. You'll see.

35
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,832
Now go. You get
out of here. Please.

36
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,775
Go. Please.

37
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,115
MRA's gonna tell us if
there's blood in his brain.

38
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,444
Well, that's the hope.

39
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,549
And if there is, then
what? Brain surgery?

40
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,451
Possibly.

41
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,726
Jay, I know how much
you need to talk to him.

42
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:23,098
Okay, I'm gonna do everything
that I can to make that happen.

43
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,400
No, no. He has to wake up.

44
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,675
Dr. Brenner. Dr. Brenner.

45
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,668
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

46
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:36,311
<i>Change of gate
announcement for flight JR-2309.</i>

47
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,349
<i>This flight has
now been canceled.</i>

48
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,919
Where have you been?
Frank really out did himself.

49
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:45,492
I took Mr. Walters up to the MRA suite,
they're gonna try and squeeze him in.

50
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,293
- What?
- Nothing.

51
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:54,362
If it turns out to be an aneurysm,
they can embolize it if it's caught early.

52
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,094
You don't think Neela
noticed that you weren't there?

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,330
I meant to go, but I
was dealing with this...

54
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,702
You couldn't find five
minutes to stop by?

55
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,088
Gates, I'm signing out
to Morris for a while.

56
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,018
It's me. I'm at the airport.

57
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,161
Could really use some of
your sage wisdom right now.

58
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:25,288
Can you call me when
you get this? Thanks. Bye.

59
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,333
- What can I get you?
- Glenfiddich straight, please.

60
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,698
Need some warming up, do we?

61
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:35,068
- Off to someplace sunny?
- Yes, actually.

62
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,177
Beach vacation?

63
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,809
Business trip?

64
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,509
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

65
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,213
- It's a new job. I'm moving.
- Really? What do you do?

66
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,754
I, uh... BRENNER: Neela.

67
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,322
I couldn't let you go like this.

68
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,069
- What are you drinking?
- Uh, what do you got on tap?

69
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,077
No, uh, actually, forget that.

70
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,617
Soda water with a...
With a lime. Thanks.

71
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,082
Thank God for this storm or you'd
be somewhere over Missouri by now.

72
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,851
Geography's pretty
good for a foreigner.

73
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,827
Look, I, um... I just...

74
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:37,095
I thought that if I didn't catch you now,
then maybe we'd never speak again.

75
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,611
Today's been
strange and difficult.

76
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,309
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

77
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,378
For me too.

78
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,566
Oh, and don't mutter in Spanish
when you're angry. It's a cliché.

79
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,226
I understand a lot more
than you think I understand.

80
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,462
Fine, you win.

81
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,973
I'll stay home with my hair
in curlers, knitting and baking.

82
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,337
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

83
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,503
- Apple pie or cherry?
- If you'd just listen to what I'm saying.

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,979
Give up, Archie. This
conversation is over.

85
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,983
Well, okay. Have a great day.

86
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:30,715
And please accept my sincere
apology for giving a rat's ass.

87
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,019
- Everything okay?
- Everything is fine.

88
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,388
What do we got?

89
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,121
Uh, one-story fall with
LOC, that's all I know.

90
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,729
- What the hell is that?
- It's something for Neela.

91
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,996
- It's her last day.
- Piñata?

92
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,401
- What is she, 5?
- It's not just any piñata...

93
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,871
I had this custom made.

94
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,533
It's a Gandhi piñata.

95
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,941
That is scary.

96
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,375
Uh, not to mention offensive.

97
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,073
Who's gonna wanna bash
Gandhi's head in with a bat?

98
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,912
You have no sense of culture.

99
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:05,119
Gary Walters, 53, fell head-first down
a flight of stairs after a few too many.

100
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,692
I slipped on the rug.

101
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,056
Observed LOC, awake
at scene, but disoriented.

102
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,791
- Do you know what day it is?
- I told you, I slipped on the rug.

103
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,525
Okay, Gates, what do you want?

104
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,866
Uh, head CT, C-spine, trauma
labs, tox screen and, uh, ETOH level.

105
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,099
- I'm on it.
- Good. And, uh, get him to surgery.

106
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,244
- They're gonna need to see him.
- Neela's already on the floor.

107
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,538
She's guarding. How's the CBC?

108
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,477
- First was good.
- Send a repeat now.

109
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,810
Does anything hurt you, ma'am?

110
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,749
Remember what happened today?
- Nobody will listen.

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,755
Drove her motorcycle into the museum
warning about the end of the world.

112
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,153
- Psych history?
- It seems.

113
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,319
- I'll check if she has a record here.
- Equilibrium is shifting.

114
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,727
I thought that was just me on
account of it being my last day here.

115
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,061
It's Claudia's first day back at work.
- Good.

116
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,827
I mean, I'm not sure that it is.

117
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,596
LFTs and lipase are normal.

118
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,564
I think, ma'am, you might
be my last surgical case.

119
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,074
I thought I was okay
with it. I really did.

120
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,771
It's her job and I respect
that, but she got shot.

121
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,939
Why couldn't I fall
for a nice librarian?

122
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,848
A librarian in Springfield died
last month. Bookshelf fell on her.

123
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,320
- I swear, it was in the paper.
- Guys, we need a surgeon in here.

124
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,618
Andrew, check the tox screen...

125
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,456
and let Dubenko know we've
got a possible laparotomy.

126
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,958
What've you got?

127
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,997
53-year-old male,
fell down a staircase.

128
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,158
Multiple contusions
to head, hip and back.

129
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,965
32 French and draw up some lido.
Decreased on the left, sats in the 80s.

130
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,505
Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

131
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,668
- Do you remember falling?
- I was dizzy, I guess I tripped.

132
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,711
Smells like ETOH was involved.

133
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,873
- Belly's benign, I figured you'd sign off.
- Happy to help.

134
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,313
Thank God. - I'm fine.

135
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,149
You're not fine.

136
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:45,019
Just a few scrapes and
this headache won't go away.

137
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,683
- All right, a little pinch here.
- What are you doing?

138
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,298
Well, he may have broken a rib
when he fell, punctured a lung.

139
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,797
- Tube'll help inflate it.
- When is this gonna stop?

140
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,697
- It's not even 10.
- Mom, don't start.

141
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,839
- Woke up this morning with a headache.
- It's called a hangover.

142
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,803
I just needed
something for the pain.

143
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,502
He's a drunk, but you've
probably figured that out by now.

144
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,839
- Let the doctors work.
- Two people ahead.

145
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,142
Type and cross and let me know
when the scan is back, please.

146
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,150
Sorry, uh, my in-laws have
been through some messy stuff.

147
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,185
No worries.

148
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,323
<i>We all have messes in our past.</i>

149
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,092
Shouldn't have been hard on you.
Wasn't the best way to end things.

150
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,892
- You were right.
- I was righteous.

151
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,161
Which isn't my best
quality, honestly.

152
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:36,172
For my whole adult life, I've
been doing exactly what you said.

153
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,344
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- Disappearing.

154
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,082
Using sex as an escape...

155
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,552
or worse, as a weapon, a
way of disarming people.

156
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:54,456
Look at you two. So sweet.
Like nobody else is in the room.

157
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,426
- You want another round?
- Uh, sure.

158
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,065
Yeah.

159
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,973
I'm in. 0-silk, elastoplast.

160
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,200
I'll get the Thora-Seal.

161
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,539
Hey, guys, look.

162
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,273
- Irregular rhythm, looks like A-fib.
- Nice pick up.

163
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,077
Do you have a history
of atrial fibrillation?

164
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,584
He didn't tell you?
You didn't tell them?

165
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,587
- I don't know, I forgot.
- Forgot. That's a load of crap.

166
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,282
It's okay. What meds is he on?

167
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,123
Uh, calcium blockers and
some other pill to thin his blood.

168
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,232
- Coumadin.
- He's bad about taking his meds.

169
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,423
He drinks. He forgets.

170
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,594
Or at least that's what he
says. But really, it's a death wish.

171
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,400
He thinks if he doesn't take his pills
he'll figure out a way to disappear.

172
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,669
- Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
- Today...

173
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,871
of all days, you
couldn't control yourself?

174
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,074
What's so special about today?

175
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,843
- It's been 10 years.
- Here we go.

176
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,250
He has this pathetic
need to tell everyone.

177
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,946
Mom. Please.

178
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,954
Um, today is the anniversary
of their son's death...

179
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,623
so everyone's a bit tense.

180
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,264
My dad blames himself.

181
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,269
I let Timmy go.

182
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,340
I'll be outside.

183
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,135
Mom.

184
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,679
Sam, add an INR and
rush the head scan, please.

185
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,649
I keep thinking it's gonna
get easier, it doesn't.

186
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,523
Staircase fall in 1 with a
pneumo and a headache...

187
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,057
and a motorcycle crash
in 2 with a seatbelt sign.

188
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,695
Okay, sounds good. Who
do you want me to see first?

189
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,798
Motorcycle looks like she might
need O.R. and you know what?

190
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,367
- This'll be case number 2500.
- 2500? No way.

191
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,495
Yeah, can you believe it? I'll have
logged 2499 surgeries since internship.

192
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,141
That's impressive.

193
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,708
- Serial crits?
- Not back yet.

194
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,368
Ah, surgeons, perfect timing.
I have a question for you.

195
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,290
- Haldol's in.
- How's she doing?

196
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,874
- Fast is negative, CBC's good.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Dubenko.

197
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,916
- Reckoning is here.
- Okay.

198
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,214
Why are eschatological delusions
common among psychotic patients?

199
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,981
- Escha-what?
- Eschatology.

200
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,092
Pertaining to the
end of the world.

201
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,751
I checked, no psych
hospitalization at County.

202
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,555
She doesn't look familiar.

203
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,189
- There's no hiding from the fifth cycle.
- Okay, sweet dreams, my dear.

204
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,393
- Your girlfriend gets shot on the job.
- Uh-huh.

205
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,539
Seeing that you care about
her and want her to not die...

206
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,835
you gently suggest that she
do another job. Is that sexist?

207
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,739
- No. No. No.
- Yes. Yeah.

208
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,243
- No. Tomato, "tomato."
- What?

209
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,041
Rigid abdomen, probably
needs the O.R. You can scrub in.

210
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,275
- Awesome. She's seizing.
- Oh, boy. Look out.

211
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,248
I see that. Two of Ativan.

212
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,752
Crank up O2. Haldol
lowers the seizure threshold.

213
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,289
Call me when she's
ready for the scanner.

214
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,790
- Andrew, let's go.
- You want me to cover the ER?

215
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:45,193
Forget about the ER, meet us upstairs.
You've got to log case number 2500.

216
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,731
What's with him?

217
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,529
Denial, avoidance.

218
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,299
Fear.

219
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,608
There's so many things I've
missed out on because I was afraid.

220
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,875
Well, you're obviously not
afraid to fly in really bad weather.

221
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,986
You know, when I was 6...

222
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,992
my, um, aunt took
me to a toy store...

223
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,461
and gave me 5 pounds and
said I could buy anything I wanted.

224
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,962
I wandered around the store
for what seemed like hours...

225
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,104
terrified I'd choose
the wrong thing.

226
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,068
Wrong doll and my
sister would laugh.

227
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,606
Wrong book, my
brothers would take it.

228
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,904
Wrong teddy, the kids at
school would think I was a baby.

229
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,110
I left the store with nothing.

230
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,183
My father put the
money in the bank.

231
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,945
Sensible kid.

232
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:47,753
Well, the point is, is that for
as long as I can remember...

233
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:52,490
I've carried this irrational
dread of making a mistake.

234
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,626
It's with me all the time.

235
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,664
And why on earth I
decided to become a doctor...

236
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,471
where the cost of
a mistake is so high.

237
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,375
- It's insane.
- It's masochistic.

238
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,481
I know.

239
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,683
And this is all my way of saying
I know I helped screw things up.

240
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,784
I'm not following.

241
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,222
Well, there's...

242
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,397
So many times in my life,
I've... I've failed to take a chance.

243
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,398
Even when it was clear to everyone
else, including me, that I should have.

244
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:45,050
That's why I gotta go. Even
if it scares the hell out of me.

245
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,313
I just don't want to be that
person anymore, you know?

246
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,183
Me either.

247
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,189
Don't worry, Neela. I'm not here
to try and convince you to stay.

248
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,041
Then why are you here?

249
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,212
I really, really don't know.

250
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,386
How'd you get past security?
Don't you have to have a ticket?

251
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,958
You bought a ticket.

252
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,502
So you got any, um, good
ideas of things to do in Detroit?

253
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,197
Detroit?

254
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,105
Yeah, well, it was the only way.

255
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,177
It just seemed wrong.

256
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:56,749
It just seemed terribly wrong to let
you go and not even say goodbye.

257
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,599
Do you wanna take a walk?

258
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,600
Head looks good,
Mr. Walters. No bleeding.

259
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,803
- You didn't need to stay for this.
- I know. I wanted to.

260
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,717
- Jay was my boy's best friend.
- One, two, three.

261
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,613
He pulled Tim out of the water.

262
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,724
Did CPR for an hour till
the coast guard got there.

263
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,293
Let's not go there, okay?

264
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:39,292
After the funeral, everyone
got on with their lives.

265
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,299
Jay came by every
day just to check on us.

266
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,903
It was just an excuse
to flirt with your daughter.

267
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,132
- It looks like it worked.
- We've been married three years now.

268
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:52,768
I lost Tim, but you
became like a son to me.

269
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,777
All right, all right.

270
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,246
At least you're affectionate
when you're drunk.

271
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,612
You guys having a party?
We need the scanner.

272
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,277
- Hello, Mr...
- Walters.

273
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,118
- How are you feeling?
- My head's killing me.

274
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,760
But the, uh, CT's clear.

275
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,691
No bleed? No edema?

276
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,027
- Who's that?
- The other case. Staircase fall.

277
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,431
Uh, did you think
of tapping him?

278
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,466
- Uh, tap him? Why?
- I don't wanna miss subarachnoid bleed.

279
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,006
Could be the cause and
not show up on the CT.

280
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,040
- That's pretty rare.
- Extremely rare.

281
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,544
I know, but the cause of his
dizziness, the headache before the fall.

282
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,376
- He was drinking.
- Well, his ETOH wasn't all that high.

283
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,850
- Not for a chronic alcoholic.
- We don't tap all our negative CTs.

284
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,956
Well, if it was up
to me we would.

285
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:40,025
Let's not risk missing
something we can fix.

286
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,562
- You on board with this?
- Me?

287
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,166
I trust her instincts. She's gonna
be her own boss starting tomorrow...

288
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,666
so I don't have
much leverage, really.

289
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,803
The ad said snake charmer.

290
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,636
I brought tarantulas too if
you think she'd prefer that.

291
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:01,372
No, I was thinking of a turban
and a flute and a snake in a basket.

292
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,373
Not this S & M getup.

293
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,612
- People dig the outfit.
- It won't work. Go.

294
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,058
Here.

295
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,821
For your trouble.

296
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,932
What was that?

297
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,160
Ah, when Neela first got here,
we kind of got off on the wrong foot.

298
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:29,173
I said some things I shouldn't have
said about her ethnic background, and...

299
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,335
Frank, come on. That was six
years ago, I'm sure she's over it.

300
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,777
Well, I would just like to show
her how much I've changed.

301
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,713
Why don't you try
something simple, like flowers.

302
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,250
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,787
That's not even remotely
original or cultural.

304
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,118
Just because her parents
were born in India...

305
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,456
doesn't mean she's gonna
appreciate some kind of Indian cliché.

306
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,961
In fact, she may very
well find it offensive.

307
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,723
What?

308
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,958
She's English, Frank.

309
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,902
Okay, so a Gandhi piñata or
a turbaned snake charmer...

310
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,133
is gonna end up
working against you here.

311
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,770
Well, thank you, Sam, I'll
take that under advisement.

312
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,974
- No free fluid.
- Aorta's intact.

313
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,914
- And IVC.
- Kidneys look functional.

314
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,419
- Ureters.
- I know how to read an abdominal scan.

315
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,490
- Of course you do.
- What's going on?

316
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:22,059
- I'll meet you in the O.R.
- The O.R? But the scan's perfect.

317
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,460
Rigid abdomen, it's surgical.
Doesn't matter what the scan says.

318
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,623
Her vitals are good, her
counts are unchanged.

319
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,668
Why not watch her in the ICU,
move her at first sign of instability?

320
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,498
- By then she'll be unstable.
- Lucien...

321
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,766
Small bowel perforation,
mesenteric injury.

322
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,434
Let's not risk missing
something we can fix, right?

323
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,911
Meet you in the O.R. in 10.

324
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,349
Sometimes there can be a head
bleed which we can't see on CT.

325
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,184
A more sensitive test is to place a
small needle into the spinal canal...

326
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,689
and remove some fluid.

327
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,158
If the lab finds red blood cells
then we know there's a problem.

328
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,024
What are the risks?

329
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,224
Infection and bleeding are the main ones,
but we'll take precautions to avoid both.

330
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,462
What do you think, Jay?

331
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,939
Right. Fluro's here,
so we should step out.

332
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,544
Hang in there, Dad.

333
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,779
Dr. Brenner, no disrespect
but, uh, this is stupid.

334
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,284
His mental status is getting worse,
we don't have a good explanation.

335
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,515
- Subarachnoid bleed's a theory.
- Except that he's on Coumadin.

336
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,491
The chances of bleeding complications
is higher than even finding a problem.

337
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,856
His INR is less than two.

338
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,658
There's something subtle
that led Neela to ask for this.

339
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,859
Yeah, it's her last day, she
doesn't wanna make a mistake.

340
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,733
But she'll feel bad if the procedure
leads to an uncontrollable spinal bleed.

341
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,874
Got your LP kit.

342
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,071
I'm not gonna do it.

343
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,178
We'll use Fluro,
give FFP, it'll be fine.

344
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,679
You will be there to assist.

345
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,011
We could go in
laparoscopically. Have a look.

346
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,052
- We'll be doing it open.
- Recovery time would be easier.

347
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,156
I'm aware of advantages
of laparoscopy.

348
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,987
All serial ultrasounds are fine,
normal CT, vitals are good, crit is stable.

349
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,220
You wanted to
log 2500 surgeries.

350
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,327
Don't rush a patient to surgery
because you're mad at me.

351
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,695
I'm not mad. I'm amused
by your narcissism...

352
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,167
but the patient has a
surgical abdomen, okay?

353
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:15,365
I suggest it is your judgment being
clouded by the significance of the day.

354
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,668
Lucien, please.

355
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,609
- Why don't you say what you need to?
- I don't need to say anything.

356
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:24,841
One minute you're strange and
loopy, the next you're gritting your teeth.

357
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,248
Look, it isn't personal.

358
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,055
Maybe you can just wish me luck.

359
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,918
I'd like to, but I can't.

360
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,617
I can't accept the fact
that you've accepted a job...

361
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,127
at an academically and clinically
inferior institution to spite me.

362
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,764
Oh, now who's the narcissist?

363
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,692
Patient is prepped,
Ancef is running.

364
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,895
Can't wish you luck,
I want you to hate it.

365
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,436
- You are unbelievable.
- I haven't spent these years...

366
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:51,373
helping you be an incredible talent
so you could work at a B-list institution.

367
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,376
- Ten blade to Dr. Wade.
- Sweet.

368
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,744
- It's not B-list, you're a snob.
- You're better than that place.

369
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,977
They have a busy trauma
service and catchment area.

370
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,782
- No medical school, research.
- Which allows me my time in the O.R.

371
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,288
Why can't you respect that?

372
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,426
I imagined something
better for you.

373
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,585
No, it's not what
you imagined for you.

374
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,993
Which is fine. But it's my life.

375
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,059
If I stay here, I'll always be
your protégée, little Neela.

376
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,328
It's time to move on.

377
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,667
What the hell are you doing?
You just contaminated yourself.

378
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,077
- Hyperpigmentation.
- Starting the incision.

379
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,770
Andrew, wait, stop.

380
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,506
- Go and get the Woods Lamp.
- Why?

381
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,378
Just get it. Go. Now.

382
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,414
- Bingo.
- Wow!

383
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:36,612
Hey, what the hell?

384
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,520
- Call Heme, they'll admit her.
- Heme?

385
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,184
Doesn't have internal
bleed, she's acute porphyria.

386
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,795
Disorder of heme
synthesis pathway.

387
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,627
Rigid abdomen, hyperpigmentation
on the extremities...

388
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,632
psychosis,
seizures, it all fits.

389
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,271
Yeah, she's the right
age for first presentation.

390
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:56,432
Okay, reverse the anesthesia,
she doesn't need surgery.

391
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:02,538
I guess 2499 will
have to be enough.

392
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,509
That's a big needle.

393
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:12,516
Yeah, well, if we've done our
job right, he won't feel a thing.

394
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,156
You do a lot for their family.

395
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,991
I've no choice,
I married into it.

396
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,726
- Lily's worth it, though.
- That's better. I'm in.

397
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,863
I don't feel right.

398
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,565
Hold on. Almost done.

399
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,805
- Gary? You okay?
- Take the needle out.

400
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,640
- Almost done.
- Take the needle out.

401
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,577
- He's bradying down.
- Damn it.

402
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,877
Another unit of
FFP. Mr. Walters?

403
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,517
Mr. Walters? All
right, Jay, talk to him.

404
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,248
- His heart rate is 48.
- Wake up, do you hear me?

405
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,417
Transcutaneous pacer.
- Atropine in.

406
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,653
Chase it with epi.
I've lost the pulse.

407
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:53,196
- Oh, my God, what's happening?
- His heart is beating dangerously slow.

408
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,699
It could be a vagal reflex or to do
with what's going on in his brain.

409
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,531
Overdosed on the
calcium blockers?

410
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,902
- Let's get 500 of calcium gluconate.
- Don't do this.

411
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,543
Atropine and set up
for a dopa infusion.

412
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,737
- Let's pace him.
- It was a fight, okay? A stupid fight.

413
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,041
Increase voltage. We
need a hand in here.

414
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,049
I meant to tell you so many
times. It's not what you think.

415
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,052
- Increase the volume.
- It's not what you think. He slipped.

416
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,690
- It was an accident.
- All right. Quiet.

417
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,516
We got capture.

418
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,027
It's a strong
carotid. This is good.

419
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,528
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,934
I'll go let the family
know he's okay.

421
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,874
Jay. What's going on?

422
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,157
I met a man today who
accidentally killed his best friend.

423
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,053
That's awful.

424
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:57,094
They were out on a boat, and
they got into a fight over a girl.

425
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:01,427
And the guy punched his friend
and he tripped and fell overboard.

426
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,093
- And that was that.
- They brought the friend to the ER?

427
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,941
This happened 10 years ago.

428
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,937
Now, the guy never told
the family the truth until today.

429
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:17,982
And for years they were...
Well, their lives just stopped.

430
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,051
- Sad.
- Yeah.

431
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,424
Thank you for helping
me see that I was stuck too.

432
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,626
You know, I'm the last
person who should be telling...

433
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,772
Neela, look, you were right.

434
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,935
I can't love anyone
until I sort some stuff out.

435
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,676
But maybe, because of
you, I've started to do that.

436
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,351
Simon...

437
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,384
This is why I came here.

438
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,162
Neela, this really...

439
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,128
God, this mattered
so much to me.

440
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,673
Thank you.

441
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,217
Thank you for saying that.

442
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,169
You know, it's gonna be so
weird not to see you all every day.

443
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,978
Frank, the soft collar ever
come down from central?

444
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,169
Yes.

445
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,440
Were you gonna tell
me or keep me waiting?

446
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,641
I forgot. So shoot me.

447
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,115
Don't tempt me.

448
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,948
- Could you get it please?
- No.

449
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,148
- No?
- Oh, I'm gonna miss this.

450
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,618
Neela. Morris has a complicated
hand lac he wants you to look at.

451
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,823
Okay. Well, might be my last consult.
- Curtain 3.

452
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,195
Can you lay hands
on my rule-out appy?

453
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,964
- Page Andrew, I have a plane to catch.
- All right, cool.

454
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,176
Wow, what happened here?

455
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,839
Oh, Dr. Rasgotra,
this is Ed McDow.

456
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,180
And this is what happens when
a tug of war gets out of hand.

457
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,316
Get it? Out of hand? Ha, ha.

458
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,024
Company picnic. The winning
team gets the close parking for a year.

459
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,217
Wow.

460
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,354
Rope wrapped so tight it went numb.
Didn't feel it cutting through the skin.

461
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,024
Well, you're lucky. It almost
took the whole thing off.

462
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,932
I was so focused on the
game. I just couldn't let go.

463
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:55,233
I was gonna have Ortho do it,
but the edges approximate nicely...

464
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,502
and there's no neurovascular
damage so thought I'd give... Ow!

465
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,078
- Did it go through the glove?
- Ah, yes.

466
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,044
- Damn it.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,708
It's not your fault, really.

468
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,750
I'll be right back.

469
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,921
You need to,
uh, irrigate that...

470
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,421
- then go see Employee Health.
- I know.

471
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,890
- Closed-bore needle is a very low risk.
- I know.

472
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,445
But you still need
to check for hepatitis.

473
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:17,962
I know.

474
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,564
Man, what is going on today?

475
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,291
A PCP vigilante chucks a
mayo stand at my head...

476
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,299
a 7-year-old
Republican bit me...

477
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:28,065
while I was irrigating
his lac and now, this...

478
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,209
Oh, my God. I am an ass.

479
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,868
I'm not following.

480
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,072
- Uh, come with me.
- I'm gonna be late for the...

481
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,513
It's important, I swear.

482
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,222
Frank, I'm gonna be late for the pl...
- Surprise!

483
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,403
- This is amazing.
- Frank did it all.

484
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,104
- Wow!
- Thank you.

485
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,907
Admit it. You thought we forgot.

486
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,176
- No.
- Or didn't care?

487
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,185
- Maybe.
- How could you think that?

488
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,949
Nobody stands up to our
bone-head attendings like you.

489
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,853
Who's gonna get
tough central lines?

490
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,254
Or chew out the lazy
Radiology residents?

491
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,124
Or teach me how to
do, like, everything?

492
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,698
To Neela! ALL: To Neela!

493
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:35,004
Haleh, I think this is
what you were looking for.

494
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,784
I didn't know if this wall really
existed or it was just a rumor.

495
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,618
I knew this day would
come, but so soon?

496
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,284
Stop it, Haleh, you're
gonna make me cry.

497
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,635
<i>- Excuse me, can you help me, sir?</i>
- You need to find a triage nurse.

498
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,365
- No, I'm sorry. I work here.
- Lucky you.

499
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,635
I'm supposed to start
today. Neela Rasgotra.

500
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,906
Rag what?

501
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,526
<i>You're a really
good surgeon, Neela.</i>

502
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,185
A few more years
and you could be great.

503
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,659
Thank you.

504
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,405
<i>I was wondering if you didn't mind,
do you think you could lead the way...</i>

505
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,346
and stand up there with
me when we do this?

506
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,186
You mean, uh, I'd be
your maid of honor?

507
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,386
<i>I'd be honored.</i>

508
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,747
<i>But out in the bay this
morning, I was, uh...</i>

509
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,383
I was thinking
about asking you out.

510
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,923
I was thinking of saying yes.

511
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:49,007
Thirty-two-year-old mother of
two with a rare blood disorder.

512
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,472
Still alive tonight.

513
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,833
Dr. Brenner? Dr. Brenner?

514
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,194
Oh, God.

515
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,128
Thank God it's you.

516
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,701
Please tell me I'm not
making a horrible mistake.

517
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,804
Of course, you're
not making a mistake.

518
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,372
But how does one know?
How does one ever know?

519
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,744
- You're doing that thing you do.
- What thing?

520
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,143
That existential crisis-spin-out
thing that never leads you anywhere.

521
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,978
- Hey, maybe you should have a drink.
- I've had three.

522
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:10,247
Oops! Hey, slow down
everybody. Slow down.

523
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:14,189
Thursday is my day to do
this childcare swap thing.

524
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,884
I hate Thursdays.

525
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:20,328
Abby, you'd tell me if you thought
I was making a mistake, right?

526
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,526
- I would.
- You promise?

527
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,194
If this doesn't make sense,
I don't know what does.

528
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,840
Just get off the phone
and get on the damn plane.

529
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:31,907
Okay.

530
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,672
- I'm hanging up now.
- Okay.

531
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,079
- You still there?
- Yes.

532
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,886
- I'm getting on the plane.
- Good idea.

533
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,316
<i>Bye.</i>

534
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,157
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

535
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:01,500
<i>tower's telling us it'll be at least an
hour before they clear us for takeoff.</i>

536
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:06,611
<i>We apologize for the
delay, we'll keep you advised.</i>

537
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,047
Hey, Sam.

538
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,017
Um, what happened
to our staircase guy?

539
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,620
LP came back positive for blood
as they were sliding him into MRA.

540
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,353
- Tony's upstairs with him in Angio.
- Okay. Thanks.

541
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,022
Hey, Dr. Brenner.

542
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,927
- Have you seen Archie around?
- I'm here.

543
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,726
- What is going on?
- Come with me.

544
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,571
I stuck myself with
a needle today...

545
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,076
and it made me realize that
I was an ass this morning...

546
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,511
about your work thing.

547
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,219
- An ass.
- I get it, Archie.

548
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,814
What's with the pie?

549
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,587
A symbol of my temporary
chauvinism and a gesture of apology.

550
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,764
My original idea was to bake you a
pie wearing nothing but an apron...

551
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:04,027
but I had to work late
and I don't own an apron.

552
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:08,601
- Me either.
- See? We're perfect.

553
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,905
If you can handle being with a
guy who gets stuck by needles...

554
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:18,414
and kicked by patients...

555
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,178
and takes an occasional slug
of radiation to his cojones...

556
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,688
What are you talking about?

557
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,126
Well, then I can certainly
stomach some occasional gunfire.

558
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,310
As long as you promise
not to get shot again.

559
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,041
What?

560
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,414
See, I just wanted to see how
much Spanish you really understand.

561
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,759
- See that?
- Yeah, I think so.

562
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,126
Ten-millimeter aneurysm at
the vertebrobasilar junction.

563
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,733
The headache he had
was probably the initial leak.

564
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,130
Yeah, leak was tiny.

565
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,930
No way it would show up on CT.

566
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,130
More contrast, please.

567
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,567
By all rights, this thing
should have been missed.

568
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,609
- It's nice work.
- Neela was right.

569
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:24,807
We use electrolytically
detachable coils to fill the lumen.

570
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,107
Cool.

571
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,311
Clot forms around the coils,
blocking off the aneurysm...

572
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,854
leaving the vessel open.

573
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,491
Dome-to-neck ratio looks...

574
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,320
Damn it. Stop the heparin.

575
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,239
- It's off.
- What's happening?

576
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:40,425
Coil went beyond the
confines of the road map.

577
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,158
- You ruptured the aneurism?
- Looks that way. Contrast.

578
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:47,669
- Doesn't he need the O.R?
- We can continue with softer coil.

579
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,274
I'm not waiting around
to test that theory.

580
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,934
- Heart rate's down.
- This is Dr. Brenner from the ER.

581
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:56,445
I need an O.R. and a neurosurgeon
for an acute cerebral hemorrhage.

582
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,515
I believe that's
my call to make.

583
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,278
- Get the portable monitor.
- Systolic's 62.

584
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,893
- It'll limit the bleeding.
- And deprive the brain of oxygen.

585
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,718
- What are you doing?
- Taking care of my patient.

586
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,019
- I got the femoral site covered.
- This is totally out of line.

587
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,229
I'm gonna write you guys up.

588
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,545
Hey.

589
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,861
- You're still here?
- I crashed in the call room for a bit.

590
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,896
The, uh, the surgeons were
able clip the aneurism quickly...

591
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,728
so the bleeding was
contained to a very small area.

592
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,569
Is he gonna have brain damage?

593
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,997
He's got a very good
chance of doing well.

594
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,905
But we won't know the
answer to that for a while.

595
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,215
Where is your wife?

596
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,452
She went home for a shower.

597
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,184
I don't know what
she's gonna do now.

598
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,724
About us.

599
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:23,357
- You two will work through it.
- Easy for you to say.

600
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,907
The truth is a time bomb.

601
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,043
But once it's out, it
can't hurt you anymore.

602
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,237
You can move on,
you can move forward.

603
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,216
Get some rest, Jay. I'll, um...

604
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,452
I'll drop by later.

605
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,092
Thanks.

606
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,396
I'll appreciate that.

607
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,166
<i>Bill to crack down on
experiments on animals...</i>

608
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,069
<i>is to become law today.</i>

609
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:06,769
<i>Animal-rights activists have been
pushing for the bill for nine years...</i>

610
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,505
<i>and have taken part in
mass demonstrations.</i>

611
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:14,152
<i>The bill will outline just what animals
will be allowed to be used in labs...</i>

612
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,912
<i>along with penalties...</i>

613
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:25,493
- How are you doing?
- Fine, you?

614
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,497
Sure. Fine.

615
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,797
Andrew, what do you think
of the patient's tachycardia?

616
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,700
Uh, probably volume-related...

617
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,773
but could be due to
fever, pain, infection.

618
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,670
Mm-hm. Good, more.

619
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:41,335
Uh, drug withdrawal,
toxins, vascular.

620
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,980
More.

621
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:46,811
Uh, trauma, iatrogenic.

622
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,954
- Neela never taught you VINDICATE?
- No.

623
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,057
It's my favorite mnemonic for
post-op rounds. Excuse us, Dr. Brenner.

624
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,523
If you run through this
on all your post-ops...

625
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,128
- you will never miss major complication.
- Mm-hm.

626
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,231
V is for? ANDREW: Vascular.

627
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,163
- I is for?
- Infection?

628
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,327
- Inflammation? DUBENKO:
Don't ask me, tell me.

629
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,511
You can come in now.

630
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,618
What happened to you?

631
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,958
Uh, ahem, I'm sorry,
I was up all night.

632
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,963
I see.

633
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,202
So. How was your week?

634
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,423
Can you excuse me for a second?

635
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,950
Finally.

636
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,221
You're really here?

637
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,550
Yeah.

638
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,686
I really am.
