1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,902
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,508
I'm John Carter.

3
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,920
I was thinking about picking
up some shifts while I'm here.

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,005
There's a lot of re-learning required
and if you're not fully invested...

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,049
I know procedures and I know the
patients that come through those doors.

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,846
Your mom is on a
cardiac bypass machine.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,286
She needs to stay on it
until we find her a new heart.

8
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,858
- I want to move her to Chicago.
- No. Don't.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,655
You know, even after
everything, she's still your mother.

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,321
Who I haven't spoken
to since I was 15.

11
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,978
- You can't just bury this.
- I'm the new guy, I follow orders.

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,600
- It doesn't have to be through IVF.
- So you're back to adoption, then.

13
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,980
Well, the heat is still not
working, but the stove is just fine.

14
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,644
Yeah, I can smell that.

15
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:32,485
I've got eggs, poached, English
muffins, rashers, juice, coffee.

16
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,458
- You're catering to my every need.
- Every?

17
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:39,133
All the ones I can think of. I'll
try and come up with some more.

18
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,661
You know, my mom used
to bring me breakfast in bed...

19
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,500
every Saturday
morning when I was a kid.

20
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,573
We had no money
really, barely scraped by...

21
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,111
but the one luxury, I
could always expect.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,475
That sounds nice.

23
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,316
You?

24
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,009
Me what?

25
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,414
What was it like when you were
a kid? You never talk about that.

26
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,525
Well, I was barely
living before I met you.

27
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:11,194
What about your parents? Do
you have brothers and sisters?

28
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,094
I don't know anything about you.

29
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,963
Aliens dropped me from a
space ship just outside Perth...

30
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,367
as a fully formed adult in 2007.

31
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,006
I'm 2 in Earth years.

32
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,165
But I really love this planet.

33
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,106
Uh...

34
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,940
Raised by my mother, only child.

35
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,911
Tell me more.

36
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,523
- Eat.
- Oh, come on.

37
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,826
Now, why does every conversation
with you have to end in sex?

38
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,436
- Oh, that sounds like a complaint.
- No.

39
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,969
I mean... No. Ha, ha.

40
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,674
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,009
Turtleneck's not too severe?

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,551
No. What are you...?
You're nervous.

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,713
Yeah. I hear the
director is really tough.

44
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,382
I wanna be sure when she
looks at me, she sees a mom.

45
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,360
Yes, she does,
baby. Oh, excuse me.

46
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,732
You'd think with all the
money we're spending...

47
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,925
we'd get sushi or something.
- Heh.

48
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,696
Yeah. Chicago Connection
Adoption Agency.

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,103
For 10,000 bucks, you get cold
coffee, a stale bagel and a baby.

50
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,008
Now, come on. That was a
little funny, hmm? Come on.

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,513
Knee and shoulder pain.
Drove into Lake Michigan.

52
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,674
- What?
- I've never had a moving violation.

53
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,786
- It wasn't his fault.
- Were you driving?

54
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,353
No, he was, but we were
only following directions.

55
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,548
Someone told you to
drive through the lake?

56
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,749
- Kathy.
- Who's Kathy?

57
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,121
Our GPS system.

58
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,093
- Your GPS said to drive into the water?
- Not exactly.

59
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,754
It just turned out that way.

60
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:55,562
Multicultural adoptions have
been on the rise in the last 10 years.

61
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,401
Shorter wait times and reduced
fees have all played a key role.

62
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,371
Reduced fees?

63
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,875
Why wait a year for a white baby?
Pick up a six-pack of black kids...

64
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,810
- on the way home from work.
- You think this is funny, huh?

65
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,109
The devaluing of black children?

66
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,616
Calm down, it was a joke.

67
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,118
I mean, why are you guys here?

68
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,155
- It's obvious that you're not serious.
- What's your problem?

69
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,920
- You're feeling stress from this...
- You making a joke of this.

70
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,289
They're blowing off steam.

71
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,931
Need to shut up, pay
attention to what's going on.

72
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,294
You need to get that
stick up out of your ass.

73
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,402
Okay. Let's get out of here.

74
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,765
We encourage an open
adoption philosophy...

75
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,305
in which birth parents
and adoptive parents...

76
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,444
I feel bad for the kid
who ends up with you.

77
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,554
The GPS system said go straight.

78
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,352
Kathy has this
kind of authority.

79
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,018
But Kathy was telling you
to drive off an embankment.

80
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,222
We asked for an alternate
route. She kept saying go straight.

81
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,926
You knowingly crashed into the lake
because a computer voice told you to?

82
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,364
She's got satellite data.

83
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,563
You don't think
anything's wrong with that?

84
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,072
Of course there
is. Kathy's broken.

85
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,576
Okay, ha, ha. I'll be
back to sew up that cut.

86
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,709
I'm sure they can get her
back to baseline if they...

87
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,783
Okay. All right, I'll be
there. See you then. Thanks.

88
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,253
That your mom?

89
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,688
Yeah, she got a little
loopy on the plane.

90
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,419
- Altitude could drop her sats.
- That's what I thought.

91
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,461
They'll buff her up
in the nursing home.

92
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,224
It'll be fine. I'm gonna
head over after my shift.

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,301
How long has it been since
you've seen your mom?

94
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,797
I don't know. It's, uh, a while.

95
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,445
I better get that.

96
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,945
Frank, Keflex for the
cellulitic mime in 3...

97
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,607
and duct-tape girl needs a
note for her parole officer.

98
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,276
Forgot how much I love it here.

99
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,617
You can't discharge a patient
without a med-reconciliation form.

100
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,814
A what?

101
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,755
New requirement
from the commission.

102
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,753
We have to be sure all meds
are current in our records.

103
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
I see.

104
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,296
And we stopped
using Keflex years ago.

105
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,935
- You know, with all the MRSA around.
- Right.

106
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,333
Explosion in an apartment
building on Dearborn.

107
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,565
- Six coming in, five minutes out.
- Gates, Sam, outside.

108
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,336
Somebody find Morris. We
need another attending here.

109
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,571
- Uh, hello?
- Oh, thought you might lay low...

110
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,909
- sit out your first one.
- Not my first one.

111
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,745
I mean you've
been out of the loop.

112
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,683
Spent five years running a
refugee hospital in Darfur.

113
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,119
More loop than anyone
should see in a lifetime.

114
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,486
All right. Do what you
feel comfortable with.

115
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,287
All right, get
Brenner down here.

116
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,110
It's been over a week.

117
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,519
You said she could
only live like that a month.

118
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,557
Well, they'll find
another heart.

119
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,155
- I heard it can take a year sometimes.
- Yeah, but she's on the top of the list.

120
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,204
Can I stay here today
instead of going to school?

121
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,175
- What do you think?
- No. Ha-ha-ha.

122
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,005
No. No. Ha, ha.

123
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,177
Now, how's your, um...?
How's your foster family?

124
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:32,012
Elaine's okay. She's the mom.

125
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,354
Stan's, heh...

126
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,217
a little weird.

127
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,355
He's weird?

128
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,097
He's like all flirty and silly.

129
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,789
Makes dumb jokes and walks
around without clothes on.

130
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,097
- He does what?
- He's a freak.

131
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,672
He acts more like a kid
than an adult sometimes.

132
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,174
It creeps us all out.

133
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,284
I've gotta go down
to the ER now, Lucy.

134
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:12,415
I want you to wait here with your
mom until it's time for school, okay?

135
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,858
Okay.

136
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,897
Okay.

137
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:25,098
Twelve-year-old, minor burns, radial
deformity. GCS is 15, vitals are good.

138
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,866
Curtain 3, IV, morphine, x-ray.
- Got it.

139
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,374
- Mom! SAM: We'll see
her as soon as we can.

140
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,411
Annie Dixon, 37, complaining
of abdominal pain and headache.

141
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,139
Tachy and hypotensive, sats 92.

142
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,317
Trauma One's open.
I'm Doctor Banfield.

143
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,543
My kids.

144
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,278
They're doing okay. They're
more scared than anything.

145
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,252
This is Norman,
the good Samaritan.

146
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,291
- They're 3A, I'm 4B.
- Heard the explosion, got the kids out.

147
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,485
I live alone. She
likes to cook for me.

148
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,153
Hypoxic 8-year-old with
a crush injury to the leg.

149
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,299
Curtain 3, find
Dawn to help you.

150
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,059
- Breena, honey?
- In good hands.

151
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,568
Ortho to the cast room.
Picked up five beds.

152
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,332
This is Norman. He needs
access, fluids and pain meds.

153
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,442
Take Mrs. Dixon.
She's sicker than me.

154
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,633
- Yeah?
- No, I got her.

155
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,834
Uh, you help Gates.

156
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,470
Maybe you can benefit from having
an experienced resident in the room...

157
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,617
- just in case.
- Just in case what?

158
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,843
Got your back, Johnny.

159
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,647
First you can't trust a
GPS, then it's your parents.

160
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,086
- Then it's the government.
- It's a slippery slope.

161
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,317
- You're losing me.
- We're not ashamed of it.

162
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,428
If more people were like us,
the world would be a better place.

163
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,588
But there'd definitely be a lot more
cars at the bottom of Lake Michigan.

164
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,128
What are you, some kind
of rebel, breaking the rules?

165
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,361
Some defiant bad boy...

166
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,633
riding around in a leather jacket on
his unlicensed, un-carbureted hog?

167
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,367
- Uh, Tildie.
- That's Doctor Morris.

168
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,652
Is that what you are?

169
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,843
Knees done. I'll go
check on their x-rays.

170
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:44,109
We pay our taxes, we don't jaywalk, I
change our air filter every six months.

171
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,377
What's wrong with that?

172
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,784
Nothing, but being a little
free-spirited can be healthy at times.

173
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,151
- Might save your life.
- We're free-spirited.

174
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,026
You ever go skinny-dipping,
hmm? Built a bonfire on the beach?

175
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,926
Question authority of any kind?

176
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,058
- Who'd you vote for?
- We were afraid of change.

177
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,898
Okay, well, it's obviously
time for you two to live a little.

178
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,505
Here.

179
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,702
See this?

180
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,343
- Cut it off.
- What?

181
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,642
- Wait.
- That's against the law.

182
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,546
Guys, you're missing
the whole point.

183
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,519
Sometimes you just
gotta cut the tag off.

184
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,012
Yeah.

185
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,704
Archie, I've got a kid with
an open radial fracture.

186
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,579
- Another in danger of losing her airway.
- Be right there.

187
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,984
Lots of mattresses around
here, guys. Go to town.

188
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,796
Peter Parker gets bit by the
spider and becomes Spider-Man.

189
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,557
- Kind of what happened to me.
- You were bit by a spider?

190
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,202
No, ha, ha. Since that
ambulance blew up last year...

191
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,531
it's like I'm fearless. I
got a whole other sense.

192
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,697
- Sense?
- I can feel when someone is in distress.

193
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,309
Like Superman always knew
Lois Lane was in trouble?

194
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,638
Whatever it is, it's a
gift to use for good.

195
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,610
Tachy to 110, sats 99.

196
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,208
Get some Silvadene down here.

197
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,376
You mean Aquacel.
That's what we use now.

198
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,454
It's better. Big
improvement. You'll like it.

199
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,552
A little fluid on Morrison's.

200
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,784
- You have any pain?
- No.

201
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,453
And that's the strange
part. I never get hurt.

202
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,227
Fire, car crashes, storms. If someone's
in danger, I just go and I'm fine.

203
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,234
Fluid on the ultrasound
could be blood.

204
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:48,239
- Need a special x-ray called a CAT scan.
- Hurry up, I wanna go see her kids.

205
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,242
- PO contrast, send him down.
- We don't use contrast for belly CTs.

206
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,674
Oh, no? GATES: Mm-mm.

207
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,338
- Not since we got the 64-slice scanner.
- Ooh, how long have you had that?

208
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,145
I don't know. Couple years.
I'm gonna go get the Aquacel.

209
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,159
- Whoa, must have ruptured her
TM. BANFIELD: From the blast.

210
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,091
Ear drum's the
first thing to go.

211
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,494
Please. My kids. My kids.

212
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,794
- We'll get them as soon as we can.
- How's it going with the hero?

213
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,995
Fluid on the FAST,
we're taking him to CT.

214
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,164
- How's Doctor Carter doing?
- He's cool. A little rusty.

215
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,142
Only a little while. Mom's been
trying to pay the electric company.

216
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,716
- Sats 89, 100 percent non-rebreather.
- Hooked up the gas grill for heat?

217
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,353
- Told her it wasn't safe.
- Hemopneumo on the left.

218
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,216
- What's that?
- Bleeding in her lung.

219
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,858
We have to drain it.
Chest tube, 20-french.

220
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,017
I'm gonna check on Clay, okay?

221
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:45,359
I'm calling for Stan Griswold. I'm the
doctor on Joanie Lipson, Lucy's mom.

222
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,557
- We were talking today...
- Breena all right?

223
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,465
Wanted to make sure
everything was all right with her.

224
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,335
Can you call me please at County
as soon as you get this? Thank you.

225
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,203
Is his arm gonna be okay?

226
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,402
Gave him a nerve
block. Can't feel a thing.

227
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,671
You're gonna need
surgery on that wrist.

228
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,538
For real?

229
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,814
- You weren't home when this happened?
- I was on the roof. Got a pigeon coop.

230
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,648
That's a good time
to have a hobby.

231
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,414
I'll go check on
Mom and be back.

232
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,489
Archie, Ortho knows
about this guy?

233
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,491
Yeah, but bug them
again. They're slow.

234
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,486
Seven-oh and an intubation tray.

235
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,655
Gonna put a tube down
to help you breathe.

236
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,733
- No. Let me see my kids.
- We'll take it out as soon as we can.

237
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,370
- Someone find her son.
- Strike anyone as strange...

238
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,029
that she can hardly
breathe, but her sats are 100?

239
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,176
Grady, put her on 100
percent O2. Sam, good call.

240
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,939
- I eat fire, I wrestle lions.
- Sinus tach with PVCs.

241
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,241
Carter, get your patient
on a 100 percent O2.

242
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,616
- He has carbon monoxide...
- Carbon monoxide poisoning.

243
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,721
- Confabulating, hallucinations, fits.
- Send for carbon monoxide level?

244
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,188
- I'm doing it right now.
- You feel better if Dr. Morris took over?

245
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,724
- Lift your leg.
- What?

246
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,794
Been out a long time.
I know how that is.

247
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,795
- This patient is sick. He needs...
- I know what he needs.

248
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,865
All right, I want you
to be comfortable.

249
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,729
- Wiggle your toes.
- I'm comfortable.

250
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,734
- They won’t.
- What won't?

251
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,599
I can't move my legs.

252
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,014
Subluxation fracture of T-10.

253
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,049
- Oh, my God, you're pretty.
- Hey, you have to keep this on.

254
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,686
Norman Chapman. C-H-A-P-M-A-N.

255
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,481
He has no sensation in his feet.

256
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,489
- They're gonna regenerate.
- Attending is John Carter.

257
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,356
Carter. Well, I'm new, sort of.

258
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,587
Systolic only 92.

259
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,892
Spinal shock, blood loss or both.
Pack him up, get him to the OR.

260
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,728
- To the hyperbaric chamber.
- What?

261
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,099
- Gotta get oxygen to his brain.
- Neurosurge needs to get in there.

262
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,706
I'd rather be paralyzed
than brain damaged. You?

263
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,537
His crit's dropping. He'll bleed out.
- OR's ready.

264
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,509
Okay. Tell them we'll be
there after the decompression.

265
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,740
Load with Solumedrol
before we take him in.

266
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,043
- Solumedrol is no longer...
- I know the debate.

267
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,178
With respect, whether a patient needs
surgery needs to be left to the surgeon.

268
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,053
Neela, with equal due respect, I
remember what it was like to be you.

269
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,718
- To be me? CARTER:
When you're a surgical intern...

270
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,558
you feel like surgeons
are the only real doctors.

271
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,963
- That approach can be a little narrow.
- I am not an intern.

272
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,404
Protecting his brain is
our highest priority, doctor.

273
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,929
You'll thank me later.

274
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,607
Marisol, can you get
Lucien on the phone now?

275
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,549
- How long's it been stuck here?
- It's hasn't moved in five minutes.

276
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,654
- Frank, call Maintenance.
- Already did.

277
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,416
Eager to tell us they'll
get to it when they get to it.

278
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,287
It's an old infrastructure.
Try to be patient.

279
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,299
Shoulder films on
your GPS drone.

280
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,593
- You okay?
- Yeah.

281
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,737
Just ran all the way down from
Radiology on account of the elevators.

282
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:38,928
Hmm.

283
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,098
Mary Taggart, end-stage
emphysema, decompensated on a flight.

284
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,734
Hey, I'm sorry. The home wouldn't
take her without getting checked out first.

285
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,505
- Who's this?
- Sam's mother.

286
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,273
She's tachypnic in the 30s
and has a left hemiparesis.

287
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,081
- That's her baseline. She had a stroke.
- All right, I'll take this. Exam 2.

288
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,487
Ready for the Thora-Seal.

289
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,925
Another unit, type
specific, FFP and platelets.

290
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,587
Let Surgery know we
have a potential customer.

291
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,461
Okay, duly noted.

292
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,659
Grade-two liver lac,
pulmonary contusions.

293
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,328
Stay ahead of the blood
loss so she can avoid the OR.

294
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,304
Sounds like a good plan. How
is her carbon monoxide level?

295
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,671
29 percent. Not stable
enough for hyperbaric.

296
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,676
Exactly. Neither
is Carter's patient.

297
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,873
So can you please explain to
me why he won't listen to reason?

298
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,450
400 cc's out of the chest tube.

299
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,216
Get the rapid infuser. Sometimes
reason doesn't get you anywhere.

300
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,222
- Excuse me?
- We have four kids...

301
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,861
who could be orphaned
despite all reasonable efforts.

302
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:39,328
Part of the deal. Doesn't mean
we can start abandoning protocol.

303
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,694
Carter was in the field.

304
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,393
Without the technology,
you only listen to your gut.

305
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,197
Systolic's down to 82.

306
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,308
Can't say I blame him. Looks
like reason's having a bad day.

307
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,044
He's hypoventilating.
You don't want to tube him?

308
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,875
No, he'll wake
up in the chamber.

309
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,583
Why did you roll over on this?

310
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,753
Something about
reason having a bad day.

311
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,752
This robs him of any
chance of walking.

312
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,084
- You're being dramatic.
- Ask any neurosurgeon.

313
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,726
- We're making a mistake.
- Neurosurgeons are biased.

314
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,157
And by the way, so are we.

315
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:13,095
We see every case through the haze of
our own experience, our own expertise.

316
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,497
Sometimes a fresh set
of eyes is a valuable thing.

317
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,703
This is crap.

318
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,535
- Hey. You okay?
- No, I'm having a horrible day.

319
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,540
We're blowing this
case, which nobody...

320
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,441
Frank, any messages for me?
- Nothing.

321
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,248
- You were saying?
- Oh, never mind.

322
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,578
- I'm sorry, I'm listening.
- No, it's all right.

323
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,879
Hi, Neela. NEELA: Hey.

324
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,249
Hi, Simon. BRENNER: Hey.

325
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,390
- Time to go.
- Okay, I'll walk her out.

326
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,049
Okay, I'll see you later.

327
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

328
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,258
When can I live
with my mom again?

329
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,598
That depends on a lot of stuff.

330
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,569
I don't like living there.
I don't feel comfortable.

331
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,238
- It's not gonna be for much longer.
- Okay.

332
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,140
Hey, Lucy, how's
she doing today?

333
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,836
The same.

334
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,416
Mrs. Griswold,
can I have a word?

335
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,714
- Oh, it's Dr. Brenner, right?
- Yeah.

336
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,948
Well, I gotta get
her to school...

337
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,457
drop off my little one at her
grandma's and then be at work by 11.

338
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,892
I'm, uh, curious,
how it's going?

339
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,056
- Excuse me?
- At home with Lucy.

340
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,599
Did she say something?

341
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,762
She seems a little
uncomfortable with Stan.

342
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,807
- I tried ringing, but...
- Everyone's uncomfortable with Stan.

343
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,605
He's my husband and I love
him, but he's weird. Okay?

344
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:37,512
Weird is not a qualification
for being a foster parent.

345
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,152
We got two of our own and
three foster kids in our apartment.

346
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,344
He's great with them.

347
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,012
It's me he's not so great with.

348
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,422
Laid off in October, he still
won't get off his ass and find a job.

349
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,960
Look, I really gotta get going.

350
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,533
You know, she was fine at first.

351
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,932
And then she started having trouble
breathing and not making sense.

352
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,664
I wouldn't even recognize her.

353
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,374
It's been a really long time.

354
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,444
It's hard to believe how easy
it could be just to shut stuff off.

355
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,041
Looks like your mom has
right-middle lobe pneumonia.

356
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,378
IV antibiotics?

357
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,520
Yeah, but her sats
aren't too bad though.

358
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,054
- What's that mean?
- We could probably buff her up.

359
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,215
She'll be back in the
home in a few hours.

360
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,825
That's good.

361
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,489
She's gonna be more
comfortable there.

362
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,728
Gotta change my flight. Can
I use the phone at the desk?

363
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,528
Use the Break Room. You
remember where that is.

364
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,365
Yes.

365
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,905
Looks like the O2 is working.

366
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,840
Yeah, she'll be coming around.

367
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,884
- I don't even know what to say to her.
- I'm sure you'll figure it out.

368
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,386
Yeah I just hope it's
not something like, um:

369
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,320
"Why did you have to
be such a crappy mom?"

370
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,983
Or "Why couldn't you just
stay in Dallas and die?"

371
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,359
Oh, I'm guessing you'll
come up with something better.

372
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,236
Where is my...?

373
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,499
What's going on?

374
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,234
What's going on?

375
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,242
Hi, Mom.

376
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,281
It's me, Sammy.

377
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,610
- You're in Chicago.
- Where?

378
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,980
At the hospital where I work.

379
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,488
You're a nurse.

380
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,130
Yeah. Sammy.

381
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,201
Sammy.

382
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,396
Sammy.

383
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,437
Sammy. Sammy?

384
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,605
I'm sorry that
it's been so long.

385
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,075
Do I...? Do I know you?

386
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,154
Have we met before?

387
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,582
- Thanks for waiting.
- We can do this inside.

388
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,226
Eh, I need my nicotine fix
anyway. The baby's sleeping.

389
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,624
I gotta take the trash out.

390
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,459
I left a message for you
on your answering machine.

391
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,069
I don't know how to work that
thing. My wife's the one who checks it.

392
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,501
Right, well, I was just, uh,
wondering how it's all going with Lucy.

393
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,609
She's a good kid.
Been through a lot.

394
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:57,478
Well, she, um... She says
she feels uncomfortable here.

395
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,747
That's natural, right?

396
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:05,517
I mean, new place, new people,
and she is a little bit of an odd duck.

397
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,694
They're my favorites. Not the
most adaptable, but in the end...

398
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,660
She says you make her
feel, uh, uncomfortable.

399
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,133
What's that supposed to mean?

400
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:20,637
Look, I got a really narrow
tolerance for the way people treat kids.

401
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,775
That's a personal
foible of mine.

402
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,104
What the hell's a foible?

403
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,542
Are you crossing
the line with her?

404
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,617
You come here for this?

405
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,049
My wife and I love
these kids. All of them.

406
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,745
You're gonna accuse me of some cra...?
- Shut up!

407
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,187
Shut up. Just stop talking.

408
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,485
I don't know what's
wrong with you...

409
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,631
if you're nuts or just got
the wrong idea somehow.

410
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,893
- You walk around naked.
- What?

411
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,063
Or is she lying? Is she lying?

412
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,505
She came home early one day, I
got out of the shower in my towel.

413
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,512
I'm not some pervert,
man. I'm not some freak.

414
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,547
What, you think
I get off on kids?

415
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,811
Is that what you think?

416
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,854
Look, we don't have a lot of dough.
- I'm sorry.

418
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,224
And maybe I look
like a loser to you.

419
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,696
But I don't need some
rich doctor coming here...

420
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:25,236
accusing me of terrible things
that I would never, never do.

421
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,743
- They spiked your soda?
- It was like a diuretic or something.

422
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,005
And nailed up a stuffed
animal by your desk?

423
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,943
It's hazing. It'll
stop eventually.

424
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,016
Think this has to do
with what happened?

425
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,675
Same difference. Either
way, I'm gonna ride it out.

426
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,015
- If this goes on too long...
- I gotta stop it.

427
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,918
- This time I'll deal with it.
- Okay.

428
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,749
I can take care of
myself, Archie, really.

429
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:48,773
I know.

430
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,860
I gotta admit, I do like
that you worry about me.

431
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,066
Here's my partner to pick me up.

432
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,240
Archie, this is my new
partner, Ed Bernstein.

433
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,035
- Archie Morris.
- Nice to meet you.

434
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,973
- You're looking out for her.
- She looks out for herself.

435
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,944
I'll be right back. I
left my phone inside.

436
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,712
You're the doctor friend, huh?

437
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,649
The outfit gives me
away every time, ha.

438
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:23,059
- How long you been on the job?
- Been in HGS almost 15 years.

439
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,788
You can show her the
ropes. You know, back her up.

440
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,867
Cops take care of each
other, doc. You know that.

441
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,475
- Let's get out of here.
- Sure thing.

442
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,299
- See you later, Archie.
- Bye.

443
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,496
Thanks for the coffee.

444
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,882
- Oh, no, no. It's still blinking.
- Come on, Burt. Live a little.

445
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,147
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Guys.

446
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,288
- Guys!
- Burt, watch out!

447
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,325
Brenner called, said he's not feeling
well, gave his pass-ons to Gates.

448
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,626
I just love how this
place runs itself.

449
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,367
- It's okay, Burt.
- I got hit by a moped, Tildie.

450
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,441
- But it was exciting. Risky. Daring.
- I'll take them to 3, call Ortho.

451
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,601
- Please do. TILDIE:
He'll be all right, won't he?

452
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,646
Yes, but you two really have
to get control of yourselves.

453
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,409
You're the one who said
to tear the mattress tag.

454
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,610
Tear the what?

455
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:24,223
No, it was a metaphor for
living fully, taking chances.

456
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,221
A metaphor?

457
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,553
Why didn't you tell
me she was so altered?

458
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,787
Well, she's not always
like this, you know.

459
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,831
When she's home and
everything's okay, she's pretty clear...

460
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,968
but the plane really
tipped her over.

461
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,299
All right, she can stay here
tonight and we'll move her tomorrow.

462
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,497
You can stay with
me if you want.

463
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,038
Uh, actually, I can't. But I'll check
in with you when I get to Tokyo.

464
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,508
What? You're going?

465
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,237
Sammy, I have to, I...

466
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:52,145
You said you were gonna stay until
we got her settled into the nursing home.

467
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,512
I can't, Sammy.

468
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,056
Look, this is...
This is hard and I...

469
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,554
I know it's probably
more than she deserves.

470
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,223
Thank you.

471
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,431
- FFP's in.
- Order more from the blood bank.

472
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,813
Three-sixty. BANFIELD: Clear.

473
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,242
- I heard you could use a little help.
- No, we're good.

474
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,743
You sure? BANFIELD: Clear.

475
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,610
- Still in V-tach.
- Resuming compressions.

476
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,775
Another, type specific.
Liver lac opened.

477
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,920
- She needs the OR.
- Well, good idea.

478
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,683
But she goes into v-tach
every time we try to move her.

479
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,723
James, understand
what's going on?

480
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,588
Is she gonna die?

481
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,356
- What are you doing?
- Find the source of the bleeding.

482
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,897
- She's got a shot.
- Gonna do an ex-lap right here?

483
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,090
No, he's not.

484
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,135
Surgeons come once a week.
Rest of the time, on our own.

485
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,101
- Ten blade. JAMES:
I don't understand.

486
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,266
- You're gonna cut her open?
- Gonna pack off the liver...

487
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,242
try and control this bleeding
and buy us a bit of time.

488
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,044
Tell me about your mom.
Tell me something she likes.

489
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,776
- The beach. She likes swimming.
- Hold her hand.

490
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,217
And pretend that's
where you are.

491
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,253
- Thirteen units up.
- Lucky 13.

492
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,756
Switch out, get sterile.
Gonna need an assistant.

493
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,394
You heard him. Come on.

494
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:13,428
You think we should tell
Surgery we're doing this, at least?

495
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,033
No.

496
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,066
Hey, how is Mrs. D
and the kids doing?

497
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,836
I'll try and get an
update for you.

498
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,975
Hang in there, Norman.

499
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,914
- When you're an attending, you'll get it.
- Get what?

500
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:35,816
How the subtle administrative political
nuances become a big part of your job.

501
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,753
I don't get how you let that
trump the care of a patient.

502
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,587
The right course of action
was frankly a little unclear.

503
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,162
He has a spinal fracture and
paralysis. Seems clear he needs the OR.

504
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,697
- We'll see.
- You never take my opinion seriously.

505
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,926
- Not true.
- You don't view me as an equal.

506
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,697
I have 15 years of experience
on you, so no, I don't.

507
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,999
- Then how's that ever gonna change?
- Neela.

508
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,804
You might wanna call
Neurosurge. He's moving his toes.

509
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,953
- What you did in there...
- Had a really good chance of working.

510
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,656
It did, so spare me.

511
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,323
It was smart and gutsy.

512
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,161
Thought she was gonna make it.

513
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,198
- Almost doesn't really count, does it?
- Guy in the hyperbaric chamber...

514
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,038
- is moving his legs.
- Really?

515
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,545
Mm-hm. Neurosurgery
is up there now.

516
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,879
Would you tell her I'm upstairs, if
she's looking for me? Thank you.

517
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,214
You know, this has been
one incredibly weird day.

518
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:48,318
I read in the paper that Mars is
transitioning from Capricorn to Aquarius.

519
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,688
- That must be it.
- Yeah.

520
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,490
Blast injuries can force air
from the lungs into blood.

521
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,260
An embolus is likely lodged in his
spinal cord, causing transient paralysis.

522
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:59,269
- Chamber shrank the embolus?
- It forced it into solution.

523
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,627
It was carried to the lungs.

524
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,431
You think the spinal
fracture is stable...

525
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,872
- no cord injury?
- Too soon to know.

526
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,410
We need to look. Call me
when you get to the unit.

527
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,448
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes, yes. Am I done?

528
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,915
- Do you wanna come out of
there? NORMAN: Yes. Please.

529
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:18,080
Man, this is like the pod
from the <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

530
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,452
The original one.

531
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,422
You're a very lucky
man, Mr. Chapman.

532
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,119
That's what I've been
trying to tell you, ha, ha.

533
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,288
I am indestructible.

534
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,094
Hey, how is Mrs. D
and the kids doing?

535
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,533
The kids are stable.
They've all been admitted.

536
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,798
But Mrs. Dixon had very serious
injuries to her liver and spleen.

537
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,740
And she died. NORMAN: What?

538
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,902
We did everything
that we possibly could.

539
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,811
- We couldn't control the bleeding.
- No, no. I don't believe it.

540
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,384
Mrs. D can't be dead. That
doesn't make any sense.

541
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,612
You saved those
children. Don't forget that.

542
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:54,624
We have to take you to the OR now,
make sure you're not bleeding internally.

543
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,589
Oh, my God. This last year was like I've
been under a magic spell or something.

544
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,600
I guess I got kind
of hooked on it.

545
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,830
- But I guess it's pretty much over now.
- What's over?

546
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,134
The era where
everything works out.

547
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,851
Make sure to tap
the pseudo-tumor girl.

548
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,115
Brenner was supposed
to and never got to it.

549
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,452
- What happened to him anyway?
- Went home sick.

550
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,788
- Seemed fine this morning.
- Hello, everybody.

551
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,055
You here already?
I don't get off till 7.

552
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,392
I know, but my hand's
feeling a little worse for wear.

553
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,025
- I thought someone could take a look.
- Let me see.

554
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,399
Please, ignore my advice.

555
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,202
You were doing fine without me.

556
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,709
Just don't rely too much
on the GPS system, okay?

557
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,642
- Okay.
- No more running with scissors?

558
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,574
- I think not.
- No more sex in the...?

559
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,344
Definitely not.

560
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,849
Oh.

561
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,545
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

562
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:00,017
Wow, I feel like I just
drowned their puppy.

563
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,026
That's what you get for
telling them to tear the tags off.

564
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,164
Grady, set my
husband up in Curtain 2.

565
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,595
We might have to do a hand series.
- Sure thing.

566
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,769
Here. After you're done, get
the other stuff. I'm leaving soon.

567
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:14,202
- Right this way, Mr. Banfield.
- Russell's fine, I'm not an old man.

568
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,674
- So, uh, how's it going with the cop?
- Good. Very good.

569
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:22,406
In fact, I kind of want things to
move forward, but I'm not sure how.

570
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,779
You know what I just did for the
old lady as a romantic gesture?

571
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:29,319
Adjoining burial sites.
She cried and cried.

572
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,220
I'll keep that in mind, Frank.

573
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,223
How does, uh, Claudia
feel about things?

574
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,261
I'm not sure. I can't tell. That's
what's making me nervous.

575
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,422
You know, I don't like to get
into all this personal stuff...

576
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,534
you people drag around here.

577
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,637
But I'm gonna offer you a bit
of wisdom I heard on the street.

578
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,774
Sometimes you just
gotta cut the mattress tag.

579
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,432
Mattress tag?

580
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,604
I'm telling you, Dan and Rose's
Shared Plots and Cremation Urns.

581
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,841
I got the number in my phone.

582
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:17,068
Well, I suppose I could tell you
that I cut myself with a scalpel...

583
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,637
or that I slipped in the snow or
make up some other stupid excuse...

584
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,071
but why bother?

585
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,836
- A shunt.
- Yeah. It's for dialysis.

586
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,981
I had it revised yesterday,
but it seems to be oozing a bit.

587
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,981
I'd call that more than a bit.

588
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,482
Why are you on dialysis?

589
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,444
Oh... Bad luck, really.

590
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,949
Some years ago, I lost function in
my left kidney after an incident here.

591
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,823
I, uh...

592
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:48,091
I got stabbed by a patient
and a med student was killed.

593
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,267
And then when I was in
Africa, I developed amyloidosis...

594
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,100
secondary to schistosomiasis,
which took care of the other one.

595
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,868
Wow. That is bad luck.

596
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:02,344
For a while, I kind of had this idea
that it would all magically disappear...

597
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:07,509
but a week in a Nairobi hospital
cured me of that. So I need a kidney.

598
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:10,815
And I came back to the
States to get on the list.

599
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:17,185
I'll, uh, keep my
fingers crossed.

600
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,897
Actually, as it turns out, you
and I have the same blood type...

601
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,468
and minor antigens group.

602
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,665
Really?

603
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:31,375
In fact, the truth is that I wanted to
work here so that I could to meet you...

604
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,948
and try to convince you to
donate one of your kidneys to me.

605
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,344
What do you say?

606
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,215
I'm just kidding. I have no idea
what your blood type you are.

607
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,692
- Oh, so serious, Cate.
- Hmm.

608
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,204
You gonna wanna do a
resection or a primary repair?

609
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,575
I don't know. Depends on what
we find when we get in there.

610
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,113
Right.

611
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,947
Neela, you know the main
reason that you and I fight...

612
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,578
is that you're one of the
only people around here...

613
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,021
that I actually find
worthy of arguing with.

614
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,057
I don't like these new brushes.

615
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,186
Which is another way of
saying that I respect you...

616
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,561
and look forward to working
together as colleagues.

617
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,897
The committee's announcing
appointments at the end of the week.

618
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,040
I think you're gonna
be very happy.

619
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,136
Lucien, I've, um,
withdrawn my application.

620
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,808
I'm not staying at County.

621
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,725
- Hey.
- Hey.

622
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:03,232
This morning at the
agency, I was acting crazy.

623
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,394
- You and me both.
- No.

624
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:10,303
- You were just defending my honor.
- Still... Heh.

625
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,068
When was the
last time I hit a guy?

626
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,275
Do you think our erratic
behavior was some sort of sign?

627
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,546
Sign of what?

628
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,456
That maybe adoption
isn't the right thing for us.

629
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,327
- I don't know.
- Hmm. Me either.

630
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:37,333
Being there, thinking
about being a father again...

631
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,666
what that would mean, it
was harder than I thought.

632
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,976
Still, it doesn't mean
that we shouldn't do it.

633
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,172
It doesn't?

634
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:55,811
Let's just sit with it a while.
See how we feel down the line.

635
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,650
Hmm.

636
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,821
Can I get you anything?

637
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,295
Oh. We're still
waiting on your x-ray.

638
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,668
Soup. I need soup.

639
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,707
Neela.

640
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,385
- Simon.
- Oh.

641
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,986
Baby, I've missed you.

642
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:32,318
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah. Well, no, just a little.

643
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,516
Where have you
been? I've been calling.

644
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,993
Yeah, well, I had the ringer
on my phone turned down, so...

645
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:41,327
Well, I bet my day
was worse than yours.

646
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,161
Wanna play the
who's-more-miserable game?

647
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,700
Oh, that sounds fun.

648
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,668
I went out on a limb against
the ER, all by myself...

649
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,001
and Dubenko wouldn't back me up.

650
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:53,043
I mean, I knew I was
right, I absolutely knew it.

651
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,112
But you know what?

652
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,374
Turns out I wasn't.

653
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,542
Neela, just let it go.

654
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,514
- That's it?
- Yeah.

655
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,624
You were wrong. There's no
point in getting upset about it.

656
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,090
- Well, how can you say that?
- Okay, how about...?

657
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,788
How about you take your
aggression out on me?

658
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,229
What...? Simon. Please.

659
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,028
Why do you do this every time...

660
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,306
I try to talk about
something that matters?

661
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,402
Okay. You shoot away.
What do you wanna talk about?

662
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,104
I don't know.

663
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:34,415
I don't know, stuff. You. The things
you think about, the things you want.

664
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,715
Talk about the real stuff. The hard
stuff. That's what being together is.

665
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:41,087
I had a bad day too, Neela.
I did something stupid.

666
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,662
I did something really
stupid, really messed up...

667
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,231
but I don't have a neurotic urge
to come here and burden you...

668
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,460
Bore you with some
ridiculous little tale of woe!

669
00:37:56,307 --> 00:38:00,244
- Do you need to get that?
- I don't know. I mean no.

670
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,783
You go ahead.

671
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:17,428
Ray. Yeah, hi.

672
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,433
- Hey.
- Hey.

673
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,626
Sorry I left the,
uh, frostbite guy...

674
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,362
in Curtain 3.

675
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,838
There's a homeless shelter that's
supposed to come by and talk to him.

676
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,874
It's okay.

677
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,478
- When's your shift over?
- Uh, T-minus-six.

678
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,879
- Hours or minutes?
- Minutes.

679
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,179
But I'm gonna stay
until my mom gets a bed.

680
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,154
It's hard seeing
your parents age.

681
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,795
Mm.

682
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,193
Seems like yesterday
she was a tough broad.

683
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,467
And now she's a
terrified old lady.

684
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,300
How do you get
from there to here?

685
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,771
That's the
million-dollar question.

686
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,644
It's nice to have you back.

687
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,893
Brought you something to eat.

688
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,841
Why won't they let me
go? I don't know anything.

689
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,175
We gotta get you healthy first.

690
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,673
They're lying to you.
I don't belong here.

691
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,876
You're confused.

692
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,113
Things'll be clearer soon.
You just gotta eat something.

693
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,616
I don't know that
I can trust you.

694
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,855
Can I?

695
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,088
Can I trust you?

696
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,858
Are you scared?

697
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,867
I understand.

698
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:24,246
You know, when I was really
little, I used to have trouble sleeping.

699
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:31,657
My mom used to sing
to me to calm me down.

700
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,096
It's okay.

701
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,884
I wish I had a
daughter like you.

702
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,894
- See you next time, Dr. Carter.
- See you then.

703
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,230
Good job today,
like you never left.

704
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,669
Yeah, almost.
