1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,705
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,242
I don't believe we've
been properly introduced.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,776
I'm Cate Banfield.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,379
How can you let him leave?

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,709
I don't like it either,
but he forced our hand.

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,943
Lucien, don't be an
idiot. Come back to work.

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,350
My work makes it difficult
to have a normal social life.

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,492
- Me too.
- We're work colleagues and that's all.

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:29,687
I don't wanna go for coffee or
drinks with you. Not now, not ever.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,196
Ah, the new interns.
Welcome to County.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,426
The adventure is just beginning.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,372
Daria's assessment was atypical
chest pain, which I agree with.

13
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,378
He's going home after two
normal troponins and EKGs.

14
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,947
Not during rounds.

15
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:52,610
And when he drops dead in his own
kitchen, it'll be because we missed a...?

16
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,448
- P.E.?
- No, symptoms are too intermittent.

17
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,582
- Are you thinking variant angina?
- He complained of abdominal pain.

18
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,561
Am I boring you, Dr. Gates?

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,460
Oh, I'm sorry. It's this 6 a.m. shift.
My brain's here, but my body isn't.

20
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:09,069
If there's pain above and below
the diaphragm, think aortic dissection.

21
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,432
- Get a CT.
- Great teaching point, Dr. Banfield.

22
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,437
If you learn
something every case...

23
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,769
you'll be brilliant by the
time you finish training.

24
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:19,641
So in order to get to the next
level, each intern will get a mentor.

25
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:24,443
Gates, you get Wade. Uh,
Brenner, Martin. Morris, Sanchez.

26
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,788
Mentors. As they go, so you go.

27
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,790
I guess Brenner's gone. Seeing
as he likes to demoralize...

28
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,450
- when he teaches.
- Bite me.

29
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,392
There will be two-way
critiques on a daily basis.

30
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,059
- Now, get to work.
- Let's go get a patient.

31
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,396
The paramedics just
brought in an eye injury.

32
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,165
This is ridiculous. I don't
need interns critiquing me.

33
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,343
That's too bad, I was gonna
give you some advice on that tie.

34
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,738
What's wrong with my tie?

35
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,631
Someone call for a consult?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,907
This tie is Italian.

37
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,659
- Doesn't matter.
- Don't touch me.

38
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,619
Okay, present your patients to
me before you run any tests...

39
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:04,247
and, uh, we can discuss the differential
and come up with a plan together.

40
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,859
Or I can come up with a
plan and you can tell me...

41
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,496
whether or not you
agree with it later?

42
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,133
- Four of Ativan.
- Eye surgery.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,791
- Hey.
- Triple hit of LSD...

44
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,132
- peyote and crack last night.
- That's pretty hard-core.

45
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,171
Stabbed his belly
with a potato peeler.

46
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,503
Okay. Looks superficial. Andrew?

47
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,111
- One percent with epi.
- Exactly right.

48
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,974
- You glad to be back?
- Yes, I am.

49
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,048
And I appreciate
what you did for me.

50
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,549
I just, uh, helped it along
a bit, it was really Neela.

51
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,153
- I heard it was your idea.
- They need you up there.

52
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,383
Well, if you ever need anything,
Dr. Brenner, you just let me know.

53
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,651
I owe you one.

54
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,390
I know. I know. I
love Lake Geneva.

55
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,361
I was just hoping
we could stay here.

56
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,433
Sorry, it's broken.
Try down the street.

57
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:54,807
I've been away from Chicago so
long, just being home feels like vacation.

58
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,545
All right, next month, I
promise we will go to the lake.

59
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,673
Okay, now go back to work and
make us some money. I'll call you later.

60
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,647
- Oh, God.
- I got a gun.

61
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,381
- Pass me your wallet.
- It doesn't have any cash in it.

62
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,527
Lady, are you stupid?
Come on, hand it over.

63
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,454
Me? Go out? Come on, Ray.

64
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,200
Hey. I do have a life.

65
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,043
Last weekend, I went
out with friends for drinks.

66
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,045
I'm not lying.

67
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,247
Who are my friends?

68
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,008
All right, fine.

69
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,418
Yeah, I fell asleep watching
three Tracy-Hepburn movies and...

70
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,160
Stop laughing at me.

71
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,887
I am not a loser.

72
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,089
You saw how it cleaned
up the corneal rust?

73
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,597
Yeah, it was kind of scary.

74
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:31,000
- You can't drill it into the eye, right?
- No, the blades only go down a millimeter.

75
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,237
I can't breathe. What
the hell did you do to me?

76
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,740
Another kick, I'd have
to put you in the morgue.

77
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,936
- She's threatening me.
- Victim of assault.

78
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,877
- Self-defense. He tried to mug me.
- You crushed my chest.

79
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,072
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

80
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,550
- Blunt chest trauma, decent vitals.
- Give me something for the pain.

81
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,053
- You need to be checked.
- You've got a contusion.

82
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,123
- Could have a septal hematoma.
- I need ice.

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,554
Inferior orbit fracture.

84
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,285
- All right, quickly.
- Come on.

85
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,091
- Decreased breath sounds on the left.
- I agree.

86
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,890
- I can't believe I mugged a doctor.
- Not just a doctor, she's the chief.

87
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,970
What the hell is that supposed
to mean? Is she an Apache?

88
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,437
- No, she runs this joint.
- Oh, God, kill me now.

89
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,805
Okay, tenderness over the fifth
and sixth ribs, midaxillary line.

90
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,206
What should we do, Tracy?

91
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,281
Uh, obvious rib fractures, collapsed
lung. He needs a chest tube.

92
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,917
- That's right.
- No, no, no. Not necessarily.

93
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,213
If it's a pure pneumothorax, we
can manage with a Heimlich valve.

94
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,254
- Okay.
- You're not holding back are you?

95
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,755
- Don't think so.
- Me either.

96
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,258
He needs a chest tube
in case there's bleeding.

97
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,056
- I'd like to use a 32 French.
- I'll open one up.

98
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,826
Why stick a garden hose in his chest
when we can get by with swizzle stick?

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,664
- Makes a lot of sense.
- Pulse ox: 98. BP: 122 over 78.

100
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,774
Well, he's stable for now. We
can wait for the chest x-ray...

101
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,172
- then decide on the course of action.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,142
And when there's no
hemothorax, we can do it my way.

103
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:51,650
To the left. Right.
Up. And then down.

104
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,185
Yeah, extraocular
movements are intact.

105
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,949
You really did a
number on that guy.

106
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,159
Took tae kwon do for the workout.
Never thought I'd have to use it.

107
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,490
Clearly it came in handy.

108
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,360
When you have
an orbital blowout...

109
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:11,362
the inferior rectus can get
trapped and you can lack upgaze.

110
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,940
- I'm taking a facial series.
- No, I don't need x-rays.

111
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,239
All right, how about bacitracin
on the abrasions? Is that all right?

112
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,511
- It's broken, huh?
- Oh, yes.

113
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,176
My husband gave it to
me on our first anniversary.

114
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,346
Want me to call him?
Have him pick you up?

115
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,184
No, not while the market's open.

116
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,288
He's a commodities trader.

117
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,292
- Dr. Banfield...
- I'm not leaving. What?

118
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,522
- You should go home.
- We have a full board.

119
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,756
We'll take care of it.

120
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,661
We gotta run. Five minutes out.

121
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,805
- You okay, Dr. Banfield?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

122
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,840
- Your tetanus up to date?
- Yeah, of course it is.

123
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,178
- How far in? MORRIS:
About three inches.

124
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,174
Now attach the Heimlich valve.

125
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,047
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- You put a gun to her back...

126
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,055
- and all you can say is you're sorry?
- No, it wasn't a gun. It wasn't a gun.

127
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,352
Who robs somebody
with a pink highlighter?

128
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,995
A runner-up for the
Darwin Awards, that's who.

129
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,722
- The connective tubing goes to this bag.
- Got it.

130
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,764
The valve leaflets
only flow one way...

131
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,369
so no air or blood
can re-enter the chest.

132
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,940
- Unusual approach with the Heimlich.
- Yeah, it's a pure pneumothorax.

133
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,605
Let's get him off
to the Jail Ward.

134
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,939
Jail Ward? I don't
wanna go to the Jail Ward.

135
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,345
Yeah, they'll ignore him there.
Let's keep him for observation.

136
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,748
I thought the Jail Ward
nurses could handle it?

137
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,619
- He's a moron, but he's still our patient.
- Yeah, listen to her. She's the chief.

138
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,026
See you. GATES: Hey.

139
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,924
How was your sleepover? - Fun.

140
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,067
You all ready for your
soccer tournament?

141
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,101
- Judy's mom is picking me up.
- I'm sorry I can't be there.

142
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,034
It's her first time
being left wing.

143
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,367
- Oh, Daria, Sarah. Sarah, Daria.
- Hey.

144
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,736
- Kick butt today.
- Thanks.

145
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,708
- What are you guys doing after?
- Pizza, movie.

146
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,108
- Why are you talking like that?
- Like what?

147
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,251
"Like what?"

148
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,879
- Toothache.
- No, open your mouth.

149
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,446
- You're not a dentist.
- Open your mouth.

150
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,658
- A tongue ring?
- No, it's only a stud.

151
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,884
When did you get that?

152
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,293
Heather's sleepover. Her big
sister took us to get it. Isn't it cool?

153
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,491
No, it's not cool.

154
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,433
Don't you have to get a parent
to sign on something like this?

155
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,073
- You're acting like I killed someone.
- You did. Me.

156
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,176
Now, go wait in the break
room. What did...? I don't get it.

157
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,846
What's this whole fad
about a tongue stud?

158
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:38,452
Girls do it, you know, to
pleasure the boys, so I've heard.

159
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,484
Julie O'Fallon, fell off a
six-foot wall to cement surface.

160
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,854
- Head trauma and obvious femur fracture.
- How are you doing, Julie?

161
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,997
I'm okay. I'm just really dizzy.

162
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,099
Is she gonna get shots?
She hates shots and blood too.

163
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,633
- Let's check you out first.
- You're gonna be okay.

164
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,966
All right, let's get a trauma
panel and portable x-rays. Let's go.

165
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,303
I tell her if she wants to be a
gymnast, she has to practice.

166
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,377
- That wall is not a balance beam.
- Pupils equal and reactive.

167
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,877
Good breath sounds.

168
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,346
- It hurts.
- They're gonna fix you up, sweetie.

169
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,284
One-oh-five over
70, tachy at 120.

170
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,853
- Is that bad?
- It could be from all the pain.

171
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:15,997
Give her something.

172
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,116
It also could be from
internal bleeding...

173
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,453
in which case pain
meds could be dangerous.

174
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,961
- So just give us a second, okay?
- Dr. Gates?

175
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,827
Blunt head trauma,
femur fracture.

176
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,232
Clear the belly and the neck
and send her to head CT.

177
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,339
- All right, sounds like a plan.
- What does this thing do?

178
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,670
Oh, that's a rapid infuser, but
your sister doesn't need that.

179
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,335
Liver and spleen look good.

180
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,977
Is this where you keep
all the tubes and stuff?

181
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,743
No. Uh, move away from there.

182
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,887
Claire, what did I tell you
about touching things?

183
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,252
Will you come over here? Will
you just stay here next to me?

184
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:57,060
- Foot pulses two plus and equal.
- Pressure's down to 80 systolic.

185
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,365
All right, bolus, 20 per
kilo. Julie? Are you okay?

186
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,205
- You okay, Julie?
- I have to...

187
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,863
- Sats are only 88.
- A hundred percent non-rebreather.

188
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,203
Give me an intubation
tray and a 6-0 tube.

189
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,073
- What's happening?
- Could be head injury or blood loss...

190
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,715
in the thigh. All right,
give her some oxygen.

191
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,687
Okay, good news, Freda,
you didn't break your hip.

192
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,949
Are you sure?
Feels broken to me.

193
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,593
- It's a bad bruise.
- Well, I think it's broken.

194
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,319
What do you think of the belly?

195
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,262
Could be benign. The epigastric
pain is an ongoing problem.

196
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,094
I, uh, saw your post-op
Billroth wound infection.

197
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,599
- And?
- We'll admit him.

198
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,033
- Glad you agree.
- Andrew, H and P in Curtain 2.

199
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,038
- You mind if I go, Dr. Dubenko?
- No, not a problem.

200
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,403
I've got reflux esophagitis.

201
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,239
I've tried everything.
Nothing helps.

202
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,404
Maybe if you'd stop
smoking cigarettes?

203
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:54,077
Why don't you ruin my day altogether?
I'm 80 years old. This is my only joy.

204
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,920
Well, I do a little X too.

205
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,555
What do you have,
nursing-home raves?

206
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,491
You'd be surprised what a
girl's libido does at my age.

207
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,097
Look, Freda, I don't
want you to fall again.

208
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,325
I've organized for a
nurse to come around...

209
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,469
and give you a home
safety assessment.

210
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:13,505
You're gonna need a
nightlight, and a walker...

211
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,471
and I'd lay-off the X.

212
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,605
Do you make house calls,
Simon? I get up from my nap at 7.

213
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,078
You listen to Doctor Brenner,
Freda, you'll be fine. Listen to him.

214
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,243
Dr. Morris. Interesting use of
the Heimlich valve this morning.

215
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,912
- Yeah, how's he doing?
- He's doing well on room air.

216
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,649
- How's Dr. Banfield?
- Unfazed. She's still working.

217
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,962
Hey. What are you doing here?
- Hey.

218
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,989
Um, pilates. I fell
off the reformer.

219
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,467
Ryan, finish those
charts, then find me.

220
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,869
I will take it from here. This
is one of my VIP patients.

221
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,469
- Pressure's up and so are the sats.
- Do we have to intubate her?

222
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,943
You don't want her off
the CT without an airway.

223
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,309
We're gonna put a tube
in your mouth, Julie...

224
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,111
- it's gonna help you breathe.
- No, I don't want that.

225
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,847
- It won't be too bad, I promise.
- Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.

226
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,548
All right, premedicate
with lido, fent and atropine.

227
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,524
You have time. We have to
wait at least three minutes.

228
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,596
We'll be right back.

229
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,464
- Etomidate and sux, let's go.
- All right. Bag her up, get ready.

230
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,331
- My mom said I fell.
- I checked the cuff.

231
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,665
I didn't fall.

232
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,405
She pushed me. She pushed me.

233
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,851
So how have you been? - Okay.

234
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,783
It's been hard. My whole
life revolved around my mom.

235
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,828
- It's good that you had that.
- Yeah.

236
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,862
Packing up her things
was weird, you know?

237
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,630
Our entire lives get
reduced to a garage sale.

238
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,966
If you can't get rid of
your parents' stuff...

239
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,941
on a Saturday morning, you're dropping
it off at Goodwill on Sunday night.

240
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,611
My dad died a year
ago, I'm still not over it.

241
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,946
You know, I haven't even
disconnected her phone yet?

242
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,781
Sometimes I call it...

243
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,982
and just listen to the sound
of her voice on the machine.

244
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,893
Sit tight, I'm gonna
go order an x-ray.

245
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,256
Hey, did you see my
clotted dialysis shunt?

246
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,594
Yeah, I put in a Quinton.

247
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:26,172
Lucien, wait up. I've got
something to discuss with you.

248
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,638
Dr. Rasgotra discovered an
abscess on the Billroth patient.

249
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,473
- Was there a delay? What?
- Not at all. I thought you could help me.

250
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,842
- What?
- I want to thank her.

251
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,109
- Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely not.
- Why?

252
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,616
I'm a surgeon, not a yenta.

253
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,187
No, but you're
colleagues. You're friends.

254
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,984
No, we're work friends, okay? I
know nothing about her personal life.

255
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,094
You know what she
likes, what she doesn't.

256
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,492
In the O.R., when I
walk out of the hospital...

257
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,928
that's the end of our
personal relationship.

258
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,533
Can I make a quick suggestion?

259
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,034
Find somebody else to
bang and cast aside, okay?

260
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,331
Neela doesn't deserve that.

261
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,610
Lots of times when parents
encourage their kids...

262
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,646
- to do their best, they lose patience.
- I don't believe this.

263
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,808
- She said you pushed her.
- Are you kidding me?

264
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:17,321
We got her x-rays back.
She has multiple old fractures.

265
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,990
- She's an athlete.
- She's 13.

266
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,496
Claire, get over here.

267
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,331
You saw your sister fall.
Tell them what happened.

268
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,140
All right, now is not the time to
be bashful. What did you see?

269
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:44,213
I was in my room and
I heard her scream.

270
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,413
Keep going.

271
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,748
Let her talk, Ms. O'Fallon.

272
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,084
And then I looked outside my
window and she was on the ground.

273
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,926
- And I wasn't anywhere near her, right?
- Right.

274
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,656
That's when I came and got you.

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,768
- In your room.
- There. You heard her.

276
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,977
Claire, you can go back in.

277
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,739
Well, we're still gonna
have to call Social Services.

278
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,249
- They're gonna have to review this.
- What?

279
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,354
What do you think,
I coached her?

280
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,725
This is crazy.

281
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:29,556
Do whatever you have to do. Just
please take care of my daughter.

282
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,626
Your first trauma with
me. Watch and learn.

283
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,136
- Okay, great.
- Sixty-year-old belted passenger...

284
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,206
T-boned with
intrusion. Tachy to 110.

285
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,138
Some guy ran a
red. I didn't see him.

286
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,301
Her son Chuck was
on-scene, refused treatment.

287
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,413
- I'm Dr. Brenner, this is Dr. Martin.
- How bad is she hurt?

288
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,607
Probable rib, humerus
and pelvic fractures.

289
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,082
None of that sounds
too serious. She'll be fine.

290
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,882
We need to do a complete exam
before assessing her prognosis.

291
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,992
How did your respiratory
physiology exam go?

292
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,457
Meh. I think I flunked it.

293
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,563
I used to feel the same way
after every med-school test.

294
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,132
Well, maybe I just need a good
mentor. I hear you're a real rock star.

295
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,325
You did?

296
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,800
I've been looking for
you. Judy's mom's outside.

297
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,464
- Good luck and come back after.
- What about pizza and a movie?

298
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,770
I've instructed Judy's mom to
bring you back here after the game.

299
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,971
Take that thing out of your tongue.
- No.

300
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,480
- I'm not gonna do it. GATES:
Take it out of your tongue.

301
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,529
You're gonna do it when you come
back. If I have to get the pliers out...

302
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,954
- You need to have the talk.
- No, no, no.

303
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,856
Tony, if she's gonna have
oral sex, she could get an STD.

304
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,588
- La, la, la. I'm not laughing.
- Hey, it's not a joke.

305
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,030
A woman should have that talk
with her. Why don't you have the talk?

306
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,294
It's not my place.

307
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,462
If Alex ever needs to have
the man talk, I'll return the favor.

308
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,507
Alex is 15. I had that conversation
with him when he was 10.

309
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,371
- Ten?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,006
Isn't that a little young?

311
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,707
Trauma panel, type and cross, four
C-spine, chest, pelvis, left humerus.

312
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,648
- Head CT, abdominal CT, pelvic CT...
- Easy, Tracy.

313
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,846
Let's just start with the
labs and plain films first.

314
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,689
- Where are you hurting, Mrs. Holmes?
- Everywhere.

315
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,386
Richard, call the
insurance company.

316
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,555
- Those jerks tried to rip me off in '67.
- Mom, it's Chuck, you gotta calm down.

317
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,567
Flail chest on the right,
decreased breath sounds.

318
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:20,537
- BP's 95 over 60.
- Somebody, turn on the grill...

319
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,800
I was thinking about
making some brisket.

320
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,206
She's got Alzheimer's.
My mom can get loopy.

321
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,347
Okay. Tracy,
start a second line.

322
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,143
- Do you want a subclavian?
- Just a peripheral 18-gauge.

323
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,979
She had any other
medical problems?

324
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,712
She used to be healthy.
Wouldn't even take aspirin.

325
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,248
Loved the outdoors. That's
why I was taking her for a drive.

326
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,122
- BP's down to 80 systolic.
- Okay, call Surgery.

327
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,559
She needs intubation,
chest tube and central line.

328
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,325
Somebody, get the door.

329
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,662
Wow, this is a
great teaching case.

330
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,333
- Where do you live, Ms. O'Fallon?
- We just moved to Bridgeport.

331
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,241
The company that I work
for opened a new store there.

332
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,678
This is our third
move in two years.

333
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:08,048
- Must be tough relocating all the time.
- No, it's not hard. We travel well.

334
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,212
You know, everyone
gets mad at their kids.

335
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,052
What do you do when
that happens, Ms. O'Fallon?

336
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,924
I, uh, count to 10.

337
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,593
Uh, I ask them to sit down, think
about what they did, and we talk about it.

338
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,565
Hey, we're out of suction
catheters. I'll be right back.

339
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,103
- Do you ever raise your voice?
- Yeah.

340
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:30,106
- What, is that not allowed?
- Have you ever been physical with Julie?

341
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,070
Be honest. She's gonna
talk to both your kids.

342
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,546
Maybe once or twice
when they weren't listening.

343
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,778
You know how you grab a kid,
you say, "Stop touching the stove."

344
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,548
- What was it like when you did that?
- What do you mean?

345
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:44,952
How did it make you feel?

346
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,120
Look, my father beat
the crap out of me.

347
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,197
And I wasn't gonna
do that to my girls.

348
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,598
What's going on in there?

349
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,806
- Sats are dropping. CLAIRE:
I don't know what's wrong.

350
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,908
Do something.

351
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,438
- I don't think she's breathing.
- Pulse is weak and thready.

352
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,245
Cycle the Dynamap.

353
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,308
What's the story?

354
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,115
- Got a hemopneumothorax.
- MVA, PSI, hemopneumothorax...

355
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,315
- pubic, ramus and humerus fractures.
- Okay, how's the belly?

356
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,017
FAST scan negative.

357
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,288
Were you drinking? Is
that how this happened?

358
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,126
- Someone hit us, Dad.
- How do we know that?

359
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,824
Chest tube output?

360
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,765
- Three-hundred CCs.
- Not so bad.

361
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,201
Did you give him a
Breathalyzer? He's a drunk.

362
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,341
I've been clean for 8 months.

363
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,670
You haven't been
clean since you were 16.

364
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,641
Second two units are up.

365
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,680
Okay, right-sided rib
fractures, probably the liver.

366
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,510
- There's nothing there.
- Look again.

367
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,677
- Shouldn't you check the pelvis?
- Unlikely with an anterior fracture.

368
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,220
- I think it's in the chest.
- Probably a contusion.

369
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,634
We need to think about
a right-sided thoracotomy.

370
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,320
- Right-sided?
- It's not the chest.

371
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,724
- Bradying down.
- Give me the ultrasound.

372
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,694
- Heart rate: 40.
- Amp of atropine.

373
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,459
Look at this. There's blood
pooling in the hemothorax.

374
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,967
Right. Thoracotomy tray.
- We lost the pulse.

375
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,661
Okay, start compressions.

376
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:10,299
If she's not okay,
so help me God.

377
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,473
- Systolic's down to 70.
- Bolus, 250 of saline.

378
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,706
- What's happening?
- Pulse ox in the low 80s.

379
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,077
- You think she dropped a lung?
- Is she dying?

380
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,748
No. Breath sounds good
bilaterally. Call for a portable chest.

381
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,550
- Someone talk to me.
- What about a fat embolus?

382
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,082
What is that?

383
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,927
Uh, when you break a large
bone, like she did in her thigh...

384
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,433
fat from the bone marrow can
travel up and damage the lungs.

385
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,867
- Okay.
- It can be very serious.

386
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,872
Why is she only on
21 percent oxygen?

387
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,876
- I had it at a hundred.
- Somebody turned off the O2.

388
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,310
- What?
- I mean, that would explain it.

389
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,181
Uh, I had the rate
at 16 after the ABG.

390
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,750
Oh, God. Please.

391
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,529
You sure you didn't
fiddle with the FiO2?

392
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:58,388
No, I don't think so. It is a touch
screen though, I could have accidentally...

393
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,617
- Has this happened before?
- No.

394
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,091
All right, repeat a
blood gas in 20 minutes.

395
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,898
Gates, re-check Doppler
pulses in her foot...

396
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,470
and call Ortho and see how long
before they can take her to the O.R.

397
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:19,602
You people should have been in
here instead of outside grilling me.

398
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,945
- I'm not so sure if the mom pushed her.
- You heard her.

399
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,021
Yeah, she said, "She pushed
me." I think it was the daughter.

400
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,987
- What? The 12-year-old?
- Mm-hm.

401
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:35,458
The mother displays all the
classic signs of child abuse.

402
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,156
Unrealistic expectations, she
moves around a lot, she's unemployed.

403
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,199
- Dr. Gates.
- Depression, she was abused as a child.

404
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,030
See the way she
grabbed those kids?

405
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:49,141
- I've seen it. I grew up with it.
- Okay, we'll let Social Services decide.

406
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,469
Fine.

407
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,807
- How's that board look?
- We're down to 44 in the waiting room.

408
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,210
That's great. It's usually
closer to a hundred.

409
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:59,648
And, uh, two tele admissions are
going upstairs, that'll free up some beds.

410
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,884
So what's up? No broken
bones in the x-ray. Just a sprain.

411
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,719
- Should I get a stirrup? MORRIS:
No, an ace bandage is fine.

412
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,054
You know the drill.
Ice, rest, elevation...

413
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:12,164
And early weight bearing
gives superior functional results...

414
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,062
compared to immobilization.
2004 Cochrane review.

415
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,396
Are you back in school
for physical therapy?

416
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,368
Started a month ago.

417
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,700
All set.

418
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:24,867
Well, uh, it was great
seeing you again, Christine.

419
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,673
Hopefully you'll stay on the
Pilates machine next time.

420
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,214
Ha, ha. Yeah, I'll try.

421
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:34,515
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh, thank you.

422
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:44,559
Look, I was just wondering
if maybe you were free later?

423
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,201
Oh, um...

424
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,036
Well, I'm flattered,
Christine...

425
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,937
but, um, we have a policy
against dating patients.

426
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,873
Technically, she's my patient.

427
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,574
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. I can't.

428
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,979
- Doctor Morris.
- I can't.

429
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,713
Well...

430
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,386
Here.

431
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:18,928
If you change
your mind, call me.

432
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,260
Thanks.

433
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,270
What the hell was that about?

434
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,110
- Suction, Andrew.
- Hope we don't have to access the aorta.

435
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,444
Divert the tube to the left main stem.
- Why?

436
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,586
Makes it easier to
clamp the right hilum.

437
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,520
- Fifth unit is up.
- Okay. Satinksky to Neela.

438
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:49,928
That's better. I
can see the hilum.

439
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,188
She's not perfusing.

440
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,161
- And we're clamped.
- More suction.

441
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,632
Breath sounds on the left.

442
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,197
- Good call. Looks dry.
- Heart rate up to 50.

443
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,433
- Got a femoral pulse.
- That's good, right?

444
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,100
It's great. It's excellent.

445
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,543
Okay, page Ortho. We're
gonna meet them in the O.R.

446
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,944
- Can we follow?
- You stay here.

447
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,815
Until you prove you're not drunk, I don't
want you anywhere near your mother.

448
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,987
She likes salsa dancing
and screwball comedies.

449
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,128
You hurt her, I'll
remove your gallbladder.

450
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,826
- Not good.
- She implicated the mother?

451
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,060
Yells, loses her temper from
time to time, spanks them.

452
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,568
I need to get Child
Protective Services involved.

453
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:36,197
- You'll be able to keep the kids together?
- Since the dad's not in the picture...

454
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,037
Claire will go into foster care.

455
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,339
By the time her sister's released,
maybe a relative will step up.

456
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,005
If all goes well, she'll
be discharged in a week.

457
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,049
Great, I'll start the paperwork.

458
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,389
Well, that's settled.

459
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,192
This blood test will show
us your alcohol level.

460
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,387
Which will be zero.

461
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,863
Can you guys rush this,
so my dad can calm down?

462
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,832
One test is not gonna solve
the problem. Trust me, I know.

463
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,665
All right. You're all set.

464
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,205
Your mom will be out of
surgery in a couple hours.

465
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,673
I'll go get some coffee,
give my dad some space.

466
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,473
Hate to get all <i>Jerry Springer</i>
in the waiting room. Thanks.

467
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,574
Back in Oz, we don't waste
tax dollars on family disputes...

468
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,242
we talk it out over a beer.

469
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,120
Well, it was nice of you.

470
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,452
- What's so funny?
- Your accent. It's cute.

471
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,457
I dated this guy in
New Zealand once.

472
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,428
I spent a summer there in
college teaching Maori kids science.

473
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,533
New Zealand?
It's totally different.

474
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,432
Oh, well, if you say so.
The shopping sucked.

475
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,267
- Do you miss Sydney?
- Every now and again.

476
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,909
- Where are you from?
- Newton, Mass.

477
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,979
- You didn't want to train at the Brigham?
- No, I'm all about Michigan Avenue.

478
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:50,082
Get Banfield!

479
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,786
God! What happened?

480
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:02,620
Get security.

481
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:06,630
I saw a piece of glass in Julie's leg, I
wanted to get it out with the tweezers.

482
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,736
But I wanted to sterilize them with a
flame first so she didn't get an infection.

483
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,134
But I accidentally
dropped it on the bed sheet.

484
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,638
Take her to another room
and don't let her leave.

485
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:19,142
Looks like 15 percent body
surface area. Nothing circumferential.

486
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,904
Let's go.

487
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,305
I didn't mean it. I
was just helping.

488
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:27,078
- What should I do?
- Hang another liter of Ringer's.

489
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,986
Dr. Brenner, call the Burn Unit
and get back to your other patients.

490
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,266
Who are you, Stevie Wonder?
Did you see her smile? Her legs?

491
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,925
- Isn't she lovely?
- Forget lovely. I'm not doing it.

492
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,197
Why? Give me one good reason.

493
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,034
- You're gay? Not that there's...
- I'm not gay.

494
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,767
- You're seeing someone?
- She...

495
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,605
- Impotent?
- Because she's a patient.

496
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,805
A technicality.
Do it for the team.

497
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,780
Okay, here it is Sanchez, okay?

498
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,510
She's a call girl.

499
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,986
Yeah, a whore, an escort.

500
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,556
So it's even better
than I thought.

501
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,783
We're all whores.

502
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,451
You prescribe antibiotics
from some drug companies...

503
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,120
that give you stethoscopes
and free lunch, whore.

504
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,358
Look, I am done with dating.

505
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:19,369
Ryan, the last girl I really
liked took my heart to Caracas.

506
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,803
You're just gonna sit
on the sidelines forever?

507
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,569
- Yeah, that's the plan.
- Then I need another mentor.

508
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,871
- Why?
- I want someone who's well-rounded...

509
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,310
and understands
interpersonal relationships.

510
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,540
I understand them.

511
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:36,718
Then get in the game,
Archibald. It's time.

512
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,991
Keep the Ringer's
at 85 cc's per hour.

513
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,329
Ortho's ready for her in the
O.R., then she has a Burn Unit bed.

514
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,993
- Let's move her to surgery.
- Why does she need that?

515
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,868
- They need to pin the femur.
- Is she gonna be okay?

516
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,706
She's gonna be fine.

517
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,412
But we need to talk
about something else.

518
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,876
I'm afraid Claire is a danger
to others, Mrs. O'Fallon.

519
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,417
No, it was an
accident, like she said.

520
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,388
There was no
glass in Julie's leg.

521
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,119
How do you know if
her legs were burned?

522
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,729
- I realize this is hard.
- Claire is a good kid.

523
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,297
Has she been depressed lately?

524
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,732
No.

525
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,961
I mean, maybe a little.

526
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,629
Uh, her friend got hit by a car last
spring, but I thought she was over that.

527
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,208
Someone from Psychiatry
needs to talk to her.

528
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:39,379
- Why? She's just acting out.
- Well, we'll see if they agree.

529
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:41,945
And if they don't?

530
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,386
Then she might need to
spend some time in the hospital.

531
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,785
My kids are okay.

532
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,400
Claire's down the hall. You're
welcome to go be with her.

533
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,968
Physical and
psychological things...

534
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,132
- can push kids to do all kinds of stuff.
- I know, Dr. Gates.

535
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,801
If this woman is hurting
them, all this makes sense.

536
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,141
We're both trying to
get to the bottom of it.

537
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,840
Go clear some patients.

538
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,860
Score any goals?

539
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,190
They got to go get pizza and
see a movie, and I'm stuck here.

540
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,094
- Why can't I go home?
- You take that thing out?

541
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,934
No. It's my body, and I
can do what I want with it.

542
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,666
Sarah, I know it's your body.

543
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,607
This is something
we have to discuss.

544
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,715
You know, you're getting to
that age where you're, you know...

545
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:49,185
you're starting to get
curious about boys and sex.

546
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,289
What does a tongue
stud have to do with sex?

547
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,652
Come on, Sarah, don't
play dumb with me.

548
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,025
That's not why I got it.

549
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,528
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

550
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:02,532
And I'm not having sex.
We thought it would be fun.

551
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:06,194
I was gonna do my belly button, but
they bet me 10 bucks to do my tongue.

552
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,931
- I'll give you 20 bucks to take it out.
- Tony.

553
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,108
Listen. I want you
to take that out...

554
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,713
before you go back
to school on Monday.

555
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,775
Fine.

556
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,760
I think you're overreacting.

557
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,926
I know this is weird, you know?

558
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:35,090
And it's weird for me
too, but do me a favor.

559
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:39,398
Next time you think about piercing
something else on your body...

560
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:45,772
or if you wanna talk about
sex, then you come to me, okay?

561
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,845
Because I'm here for you.

562
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:56,785
- I'll just wait over here.
- All right, give me a minute.

563
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:12,498
You know, it killed me to
put her in a nursing home...

564
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:18,933
but after a while, I couldn't deny
that she put the eggs in the hamper...

565
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,273
ice in the microwave.

566
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,507
- Alzheimer's is hard.
- Oh, it kills you.

567
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,949
She doesn't remember
me half the time. And him?

568
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,148
He can't even help out.

569
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,787
His blood-alcohol
level came back.

570
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,797
It was zero, none detected.

571
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,333
The other driver ran a
red light, Mr. Holmes.

572
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,507
I know your son has
made mistakes in the past...

573
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:56,409
but let him show you that
he's changed. He's trying.

574
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,519
- How is she? NEELA:
The surgery went well.

575
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,057
We were able to repair her
pulmonary artery and vein.

576
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,717
Good... That's good, right?

577
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,228
I mean, at her age, her
rehab could be a while...

578
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,730
but she's already
starting to wake up.

579
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,698
Thank God.

580
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,564
When can I...?

581
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:26,238
- When can we see her?
- Come on, I'll take you to Recovery.

582
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,849
That seems like it
calls for a celebration.

583
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:47,923
<i>Bringing up Baby</i> is playing at the
Limelight, we should, uh... We should go.

584
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,864
I can't. I'm working here, late.

585
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:55,067
Or we could grab a quick
coffee at the Jumbo Mart?

586
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,634
Think of it as an olive branch.

587
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,583
- All right, coffee it is.
- Great.

588
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:08,743
I will meet you out
the front, one hour.

589
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,457
Good thing you
weren't seriously hurt.

590
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,153
Been a few muggings
recently that didn't end so well.

591
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,231
- How much time will he get for this?
- Depends on his priors.

592
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,597
- You'll be called for a court date.
- I don't have time for court.

593
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,501
Unless he takes a deal, this is the
only way we can put him behind bars.

594
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:33,006
Here, if you have
any questions, call me.

595
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,874
Thanks.

596
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:40,950
- How you doing?
- I'm fine, Dr. Morris.

597
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,922
You know, I don't get it.

598
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,949
You get mugged, you
beat him up, you're injured...

599
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,459
but you still go
through the day?

600
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,588
I don't buckle, Dr. Morris.

601
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,757
Okay. Sometimes you might
wanna give yourself a break.

602
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,597
No.

603
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,104
Because then I might have
to give someone else one.

604
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,681
Just wait outside for me.

605
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,645
Mm-hm. Sure.

606
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,919
- So how you doing, Claire?
- I'm fine.

607
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,523
You know, you never told
me what grade you were in.

608
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,460
Sixth.

609
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,363
- What do you think of school?
- It's boring.

610
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,797
You know, some kids, when
they're bored, they cut class.

611
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,672
- I've never done that.
- Hm. Your mom said you did.

612
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:47,480
School's a waste of time. I'm
smarter than most of the teachers.

613
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,446
Hm.

614
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,384
How do you and
your sister get along?

615
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,321
Okay.

616
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,687
She thinks she's
going to the Olympics.

617
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,465
What happens when you fight?

618
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,562
My sister and I always fought.

619
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:11,067
It really sucks, because
she's always right.

620
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,541
She's Little Miss Perfect.

621
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,240
And even if she starts it, my
mom always sides with her.

622
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,613
- That must bug you.
- It's every day.

623
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,516
If she breaks a plate, it's
because I bumped into her.

624
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,920
How do you get back at
someone for doing that?

625
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,685
- Teach her a lesson.
- By doing what?

626
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,732
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?

627
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,401
Claire, we have video cameras in
the ceilings of our trauma rooms.

628
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:52,407
We saw you adjust the ventilator
and light the sheet on fire.

629
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,248
I didn't want to kill her.

630
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,655
I just wanted to mess her up.

631
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,090
You did.

632
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:11,763
If she's in the hospital, Mom
will see what a good girl I am.

633
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,568
She won't be blaming
me for everything.

634
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,436
Is that why you
pushed her off the wall?

635
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:27,481
Claire, they're accusing
your mother of child abuse...

636
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:31,023
which means she could go to
jail, and your sister and you...

637
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,454
could both go to foster homes.

638
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:37,619
Now, something tells me...

639
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,628
that she doesn't hit you two...

640
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,492
and she didn't push your sister.

641
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,200
Did you do it, Claire?

642
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,172
Did you?

643
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,953
It was cool seeing
her lying there...

644
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,787
all pale, with blood coming out.

645
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:14,632
And then when she couldn't move,
and her legs were getting burned...

646
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,461
it was great.

647
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,732
That made you feel good?

648
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,806
Really good.

649
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,139
Hm.

650
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,905
Well...

651
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:35,685
It'll probably be better if you
stay in the hospital for a while.

652
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,850
Why? I'm not sick.

653
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,724
We just think it
would be a good idea.

654
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,228
No, I won't.

655
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,770
I won't!

656
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,245
- No, I won't! I won't! I won't!
- Claire.

657
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,745
Claire. SAM: I got her.

658
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,178
Get me a gurney.

659
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,182
- Mommy.
- Call the Psych Ward.

660
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,548
We can hang out now
that Julie is in the hospital.

661
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,241
What's happening? Claire, relax.

662
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,380
No! Help, Mommy!

663
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:13,889
- Come on.
- Mommy, help me!

664
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,789
Claire, relax. Let us take
care of her, Ms. O'Fallon.

665
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,862
- Relax.
- Get off of me!

666
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,090
Get 2.5 of Haldol. Ativan.

667
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,896
- Hard restraints.
- This is just for a short time, right?

668
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,799
Then I can take her home soon?

669
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,701
I will kill you!

670
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,133
I will kill you!

671
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,801
I will kill you!

672
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,471
I'm gonna cut you
up into little pieces.

673
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,780
Can't remember last time we did a
right-sided thoracotomy. The guy's lucky.

674
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:47,085
Well, I, uh, lost a trucker in
Sydney with a right hilar tear.

675
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,126
- You miss it once, you never forget.
- I guess you're right.

676
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:59,629
We should go, uh,
salsa dancing sometime.

677
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,237
How do you know I like
dancing and old comedies?

678
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,205
I do my research.

679
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,709
We're just gonna be friends.

680
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,274
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

681
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:15,284
- What, you mean sleeping with me?
- The awkward shag that...

682
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,753
on a horrible day, doesn't
count as "sleeping with you"...

683
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,088
- it counts as poor judgment.
- Oh, you romantic fool.

684
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,356
I thought we fit well together.

685
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,796
Okay.

686
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,465
All right, I'm not gonna
hound you. I'm not gonna beg.

687
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,868
But one day, you will
wake up next to me...

688
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,276
and you're gonna wonder,
"How did this happen?"

689
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:46,475
And I'm gonna smile and
remind you that I predicted this...

690
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:51,021
over coffees and
chocolate-glazed donuts.

691
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,124
- You're a cocky bastard.
- Yeah.

692
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:58,491
But I'll be a correct cocky bastard
and that's all that will matter.

693
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:01,996
You ready to go?

694
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,180
- Are you all right?
- Oh, Claire left her coat down here.

695
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,879
You know, about a month ago...

696
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:25,285
I, um, caught her throwing
rocks at the neighbor's dog.

697
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:30,227
And then a few days later, she
was trying to stick a metal rod...

698
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,092
through one of
the fish in our tank.

699
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,561
And I just tried to
pretend it was normal.

700
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,329
You know, just a kid acting out.

701
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,002
I don't get it.

702
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,432
Why her? Why our family?

703
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,576
I don't know.

704
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,213
That's all you can say?

705
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,085
You can't lie to me and tell
me that she's gonna be okay?

706
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:04,358
That she's gonna grow
up to be a normal girl?

707
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:09,527
I mean, that's why we
come here, to get answers.

708
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,364
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

709
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,700
I'm sorry, that's all I have.

710
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,075
Well, that's not
good enough, doctor.

711
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,986
That's not good enough.

712
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,910
<i>No, he doesn't take anything.</i>

713
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,264
<i>Get some atropine.</i>

714
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,281
<i>I'm not a doctor,
can you explain that?</i>

715
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,923
<i>Come on. Come on, girl.</i>

716
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,592
<i>No.</i>

717
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,463
<i>An hour ago...</i> MAN 7: <i>Clear.</i>

718
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,179
<i>We know it's working.</i>

719
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,414
<i>We have no choice.</i>

720
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:21,997
<i>Clear.</i>
