1
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,134
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:09,003
- Michael's coming home today.
- Well, hello, soldier.

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,154
<i>Michael's unit had
a heavy patient flow.</i>

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,613
<i>He'll be unable to make
it home as anticipated.</i>

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,442
- Hi, I'm Tony Gates.
- Dr. Rasgotra.

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:19,178
- You don't like my style? What is that?
- We were here a long time before you.

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,753
We work together. You're new.

8
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,413
- I'm her father, I have a right to know.
- Dad, please.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,252
Stop it!

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,157
You ever come near my
daughter again, I'll kill you.

11
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,870
Wasn't as cold this morning.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,903
Thought people from
the Bronx were tough.

13
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,271
- We are.
- Yeah, right. Talk to me in February.

14
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,344
What's up?

15
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,107
- What we got?
- Martin Trudeau, 60, short of breath.

16
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,477
Uh-oh. Looks like trouble.

17
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,608
You're telling me.

18
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,220
- How's the rookie doing?
- She could smile more.

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,481
She's fine.

20
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,249
All I wanted was
a little oxygen.

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,155
And these clowns keep
poking me for 10 minutes.

22
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,353
Status post-cardiac
transplant, 2001.

23
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,967
Think those bastards at the Mayo
Clinics give refunds on bad hearts?

24
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,233
- Marty's on a lot of meds.
- Neoral, mycophenolate, Lipitor...

25
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,568
benazepril, nicardipine, Isordil,
furosemide, potassium, aspirin.

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,606
Now we got freaking
Rain Man here.

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,677
- I'm taking her to Vegas.
- Lungs are wet.

28
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,746
Forty of Lasix, 25 of sublingual
captopril. I'll be right in.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,611
- So how's it going?
- They don't have a coat that fits.

30
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,310
They woke me and my
neighbors at 5 a.m. with that siren.

31
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,979
Gates is like a dog in heat. Other
than that... There is no other than that.

32
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,159
- Look on the bright side.
- What bright side?

33
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,659
Pratt, your diarrhea guy's
butt is exploding again.

34
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,263
- You could be stuck here.
- Yo, Mayday.

35
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,094
- Dr. Rasgotra will be fine.
- I'm gonna go restock, Mayday.

36
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,168
- Thanks.
- Nice jacket, roomie.

37
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,032
Or can I still call you that?

38
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,002
As long as you
don't call me Mayday.

39
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,765
How's the ride-along?

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,410
- That good, huh?
- You need a fresh Steri-Strip.

41
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,704
Ow.

42
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,279
- Oh. Sorry.
- Yep, still a little tender.

43
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,508
All things considered,
you got off easy.

44
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,414
My ass-kicking was a breeze.
All I had to do was lay there.

45
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,249
Beats jail time. Here, sit.

46
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,584
- Heard from Gallant?
- Not yet. He got stuck.

47
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,159
- He's still coming home, right?
- Not at the moment.

48
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,695
Oh, that's cool.
I mean, too bad.

49
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,993
- But, uh, maybe I can come home now?
- No.

50
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,533
- No?
- It's nice without you.

51
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,103
That smell hasn't been
there since you've been gone.

52
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,467
- But it's my place.
- Got another run, Mayday.

53
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,371
You can come back
on these conditions:

54
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,239
No dishes in the sink, no
using the couch as your hamper.

55
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,778
Didn't I let you move in?

56
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,777
Okay, fine. Done deal.

57
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,113
I'm on graveyard, I'll be
back in the morning. Oh, crap.

58
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,878
Admit, 2 o'clock.

59
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,285
- I thought you got rid of her.
- Help, please.

60
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,480
- Ray.
- Neela.

61
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,063
- Zoe.
- Oh, hey, Neela.

62
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,165
- Why are you here?
- Where is Ray?

63
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,199
- He's off today.
- That's not true.

64
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,203
He pulls doubles Thursdays so he can do
Friday gigs. I totally know his schedule.

65
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,137
He had a doctor's
appointment. Eye specialist.

66
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,404
He hasn't returned my
calls. I've been worried.

67
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,978
Come on, we got a man down.

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,250
- I'll tell him you were here.
- Give him this. It's all our songs.

69
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,511
It's a make-up mix.

70
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,022
- Residency office is looking for Abby.
- She's on nights.

71
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,290
Lucky her.

72
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,322
She's on nights.

73
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,676
I think I know why you got
fluid in your lungs, Mr. Trudeau.

74
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,820
I take long showers.

75
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,513
Is there anything
you wanna tell me?

76
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,893
- Like what?
- Listen, your cyclosporine level was zero.

77
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,324
Yeah? So?

78
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,959
So you stopped taking
your meds. Am I right?

79
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,001
- Are you taking your pills?
- Nope.

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,065
So you're wasting a good
heart, not to mention my time.

81
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,300
You know how much the
medicine costs me a month, huh?

82
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:14,107
I take piles of that medicine
at almost 4 large a month.

83
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,305
What about Medicare?

84
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,611
Oh, please. You gotta
declare poverty for that.

85
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:23,052
You have to give up your house
and your savings and your car. Huh?

86
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,953
Who's gonna take
care of my wife?

87
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,790
How are you supposed
to if you're dead?

88
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,363
Oh, please. She drives me
back and forth to the hospital.

89
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,023
I puke, she cleans it up.

90
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,330
And I can't make it
up the stairs alone.

91
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,938
I pass out.

92
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,376
Mr. Trudeau, are you refusing
to take your medication?

93
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,171
Because if you are, you're
gonna go into heart failure...

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,474
- and you're gonna die.
- Aw...

95
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,480
All right, then, put
him in Curtain 3.

96
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,349
We're done.

97
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,088
Sam, how many
nurses are you short?

98
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,692
Two, and the registry's empty.

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,523
You'll manage. Here's my
number. My flight leaves at 4:20.

100
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,892
- I'll keep my cell phone on.
- What about Malik?

101
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,432
- Funeral in Detroit.
- Arson capital of the world.

102
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,694
- Did you try Jarvik?
- I called everybody.

103
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,862
Sam, do you want me to stay?

104
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,101
- Oh, go ahead. We got it, go.
- Okay, I got a flight to catch.

105
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,609
- Yo, Rocky.
- Hey, Inez.

106
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,111
- You wanna pick up a drunk samurai?
- Samurai?

107
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,716
GYN has a bed, but can't
take the PID for two hours.

108
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,251
- I'll call them.
- Sam, why is my UTI still here?

109
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,443
We're out of ICONs.

110
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,952
- Could you, please?
- I got it.

111
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,124
- Like, before Christmas?
- I said, I got it.

112
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,556
- Four more.
- What did she say?

113
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,753
Same thing she
said the last six times.

114
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,194
Kobayashi. That's
your real name?

115
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,634
You, with hair like ray
of sun, you are beautiful.

116
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,796
Ha-ha. Hee, hee.

117
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,770
Whoa.

118
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,574
What are you doing?

119
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,521
Looking for my underwear.

120
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,515
Are you on tonight?

121
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,624
No.

122
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,356
Why are you leaving?

123
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,257
I just thought I should.

124
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,369
- You should stay.
- I probably shouldn't.

125
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,199
I have a lot of stuff
I need to do and...

126
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,246
Oh. Your bra.

127
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,079
Thank you.

128
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,748
Panties.

129
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,896
Still like ketchup on your eggs?

130
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,623
Okay. I'll make
us some breakfast.

131
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,737
I think we probably
slept through breakfast.

132
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,507
And lunch.

133
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,773
I can't believe he's
doing this to himself.

134
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,981
Can you stop it?

135
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,312
Really, what's the point if he's
not gonna take the medication?

136
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,284
He's not such a pain
in the ass, you know.

137
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,983
He's just angry because
he's been so sick.

138
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,488
I wish you could help him.

139
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,295
I'm not sure I can.

140
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,758
He's my life.

141
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,372
I'm not ready to let him go.

142
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,573
Take a cab.

143
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,217
And next time, fake a seizure.

144
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,844
So how about some sushi? You
like sushi? I know a great sushi place.

145
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,651
- Does he ever stop?
- Get a ring. He's scared of husbands.

146
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,988
- I told you, I have a boyfriend.
- Oh. So, what is he, a lawyer?

147
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,097
- A commodities trader? A dentist?
- He's a doctor.

148
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,857
- County?
- In the Army.

149
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,265
- Stateside, I hope.
- Iraq.

150
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,496
- CASH unit?
- 10th Combat Support.

151
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,236
You know, I was a
medic in Desert Storm.

152
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,504
- 101st Airborne.
- Airborne?

153
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,409
- Did you fly planes?
- Nope, just jumped out of them.

154
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,914
- When's he coming home?
- Soon, I hope.

155
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,280
To prove I'm a good guy,
know what I'm gonna do?

156
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,581
I'll let you sit in front,
play with the siren.

157
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,088
- I'm gonna buy you coffee.
- With an empty wallet?

158
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,898
Paramedics and
cops drink for free.

159
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,688
Technically, you're
not buying anything.

160
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,558
Technically, it's the
thought that counts.

161
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,540
Come on in.

162
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,671
Sorry. Sorry, I
won't do it again.

163
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,083
My foot slipped, I
promise. Scout's honor.

164
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,287
What took you so long?

165
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,390
Buckle up.

166
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,099
What the hell's that?

167
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,326
Monoclonal antibodies
to stop the rejection.

168
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,097
Did I not make myself
clear? I don't want it.

169
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,503
Well, you're getting it anyway.
And you're gonna take these too.

170
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,339
I spoke to your doctors at the Mayo.
They agreed to take you. By helicopter.

171
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,504
- I'm not going.
- This is Neoral.

172
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,618
If you take this, you'll have a detectable
blood level by the time you get there.

173
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,178
You are so wasting
your time, doc.

174
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,822
Yeah, okay, good. So look,
this is how it's gonna go.

175
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,186
You gonna take these
pills, get on that chopper.

176
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,829
You're gonna stay on your meds as
long as that donated heart keeps beating.

177
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,158
Who the hell do
you think you are?

178
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,995
You see that woman
over there? She loves you.

179
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:41,908
And I have no idea why, because,
personally, I find you extremely annoying.

180
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,002
But if you think you're helping
her by killing yourself, you're wrong.

181
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,341
You know, you're
a miserable guy.

182
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,518
But she seems like a great lady
and she wants to keep you around.

183
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,088
So open wide, Marty.

184
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,254
- Be careful, it's hot.
- Thanks.

185
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,964
<i>The passenger jet crashed
in the 5700 block of...</i>

186
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,294
- Child rooms clear?
- And sutures and Curtain 2.

187
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,131
- CCU can take Jenkins.
- I'll get him up next.

188
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,740
- If they walk, they go to the lobby.
- I'm not moving.

189
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,104
Been waiting six hours
with a dislocated finger.

190
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,610
- Lot of critical patients...
- My finger's critical.

191
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,941
- Excuse me?
- My finger's critical.

192
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,777
Let me see that.

193
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,544
- Not anymore.
- Guys, shut up, please.

194
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,452
<i>Passenger jet at low
altitude moments after takeoff.</i>

195
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,389
- Terrorists?
- What airline was Eve on?

196
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,223
<i>When the pilot lost
control, eventually colliding...</i>

197
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,922
So much for
conspiracy theory, huh?

198
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,295
Okay, that's it, folks.

199
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,770
Here we go. We're
about to get clobbered.

200
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,271
Exam 3, I want
six monitored beds.

201
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,442
Damn it. Ray, I got two
words for you: "hard restraints."

202
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,739
We can't do that
anymore. Hey, settle down.

203
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,939
The warrior path is never easy.

204
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,140
Start with Haldol.

205
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,185
Battalion chief needs another
doctor. Possible field amputation.

206
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,233
Whoa, whoa. Yeah, okay.
- Okay, I could go.

207
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,483
- Nope. Not a good idea.
- I could use the experience.

208
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,490
Not a drill. I'm going
out with Pickman.

209
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,323
Congratulations, have
her home by 10. Set this up.

210
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,658
- City fire needs a physician.
- With experience.

211
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,925
Somebody with experience
would be better here.

212
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,331
- It's a tough call.
- I've done my ride-alongs.

213
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,938
They'll need crikes,
central access, chest tubes.

214
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,903
- I'm good at that.
- If he's supervised.

215
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,805
- We need to roll. You got anybody?
- I'm going, come on.

216
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,846
Okay, okay, Pratt, it's you. But
get your ass back here in an hour.

217
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,326
Drug box. Airway kit.

218
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,959
Triage tags.

219
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:58,369
Green is nothing, yellow is
urgent, red is critical, black is dead.

220
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,603
Oh, man.

221
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,991
Chief Bukata.

222
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,434
- Triage on the north side.
- All right, stick with me.

223
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,442
One patient at a time.

224
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,010
Sir, sir.

225
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,483
Sir, can you hear me?

226
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,714
- He's not breathing, there's no pulse.
- Black tag and move on.

227
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,483
Watch your step.

228
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,726
Ma'am.

229
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,736
Ma'am, can you open your eyes?

230
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,729
Flail chest, respiratory arrest.

231
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,398
Trauma 1 then ICU. Quickly, quickly.
I want you clearing exam rooms.

232
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,198
- Shouldn't the nurses be...?
- No, you decide who stays and who goes.

233
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,633
- Thanks for coming.
- Where do you need us?

234
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,709
- Hypotensive pelvis.
- Two minutes.

235
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,574
Get triage in the waiting room.

236
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,046
- The waiting room?
- It's warm, the light is good.

237
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,617
- You can do a better assessment.
- You're not serious.

238
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,983
- That's how we do it.
- This is like <i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

239
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:00,422
Let the walking woundeds through the
door, it's over. Got me? Triage stays here.

240
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,961
- Abby, this is your pelvis. Come on.
- The plane was going to Cleveland.

241
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,224
- I don't care. INEZ: Eve
was going to Saint Louis.

242
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,231
- I'll deal with it.
- So she's okay?

243
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,063
- Who's in 2? SAM:
Altered stroke patient.

244
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,670
Let's park him in the hallway.

245
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,569
Please, yes, I need
you right away. Great.

246
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,107
Okay.

247
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,144
Sir, we're gonna have to move
you. We have to move you folks...

248
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,975
I am so sorry about my dad.

249
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:26,509
- You're not supposed to be here, Zoe.
- You're so cool for not pressing charges.

250
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,622
- Now is not a good time.
- Okay, but you get off at 8, right?

251
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,258
Ha. When I said we can't
see each other anymore...

252
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,156
Just because my Dad's a jerk
doesn't mean we can't keep going.

253
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,763
I got my ass kicked once.
I don't wanna go to jail.

254
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,798
I know, but we could keep it a
secret. Like Romeo and Juliet.

255
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,526
No, you need to leave right now.

256
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,205
- You can't just walk away.
- Don't you have some homework to do?

257
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,136
- I am not a child.
- Yes, you are.

258
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,038
- I'm your girlfriend.
- No, you're not.

259
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,702
- Yes, I am.
- Forty-five-year-old, unstable pelvis.

260
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,678
Ninety palp after a liter. Can
you check the dorsalis pedis?

261
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,978
- But I love you, Ray.
- Plugged earwax. I had to clean her out.

262
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,883
- Whatever.
- Yeah. Oh!

263
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,082
What are the foot pulses? Ray?

264
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,857
- Keep pressure while I wrap.
- Saline's wide open.

265
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,623
- Neela.
- What are you doing here?

266
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,632
- Heard you needed help.
- Fire's knocked down at the fuselage.

267
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,167
- Let's go, Pratt.
- All right.

268
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,704
Woody Ebbots, 85, auto
vs. pedestrian, blunt chest.

269
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,069
She's not critical. Lead
her to the yellow tarp.

270
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,677
- How's your breathing?
- It's been better.

271
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,838
Something fell and hit the car
and the car came right at me.

272
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,415
Okay, deep breath.

273
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,649
- The driver okay?
- We'll have to check on that.

274
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,584
- 95/60. Tachy, 120. NEELA:
Five liters by nasal prong.

275
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,248
- Got it.
- You seen a dog around here?

276
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,423
I'm gonna give you
some oxygen, Woody.

277
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,258
- I was walking my dog.
- A big stick in your arm.

278
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,085
- Look over here. Look over here.
- Ow!

279
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,603
- Look over here.
- A cocker spaniel. You seen her?

280
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,733
Hold still.

281
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,404
Maybe she didn't get hit. You
would have seen her if she got hit.

282
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,341
- Hold on.
- Hey, Riley.

283
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,256
We'll find the dog.
Take a deep breath.

284
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,840
Hey, Riley!

285
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,748
- Oh, man.
- Anything for us?

286
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,793
Not in there. This way, doc.

287
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,260
Guy in back got lucky.

288
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,528
Coming through.

289
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,204
- Up here.
- Talk to me.

290
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:32,436
Baxter Yi, facial trauma and
projectile to the right chest.

291
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,741
Can someone call my fiancée?

292
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,443
Airway's good. Strong
pulse, unbelievable.

293
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,713
- Lila Frankfurt is her name.
- Okay.

294
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,789
- Line's in. Need to get him down.
- We need some foam on this.

295
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,086
She's waiting for me. Oh.

296
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,489
Dr. Pratt.

297
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,465
- Saw and a backboard, let's go.
- Baxter, you're one lucky guy.

298
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,729
Well, can you call her
cell? I have the number.

299
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,895
What's the status
on his wound degree?

300
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:04,567
Crushing substernal chest pain,
10 out of 10. Adrian, Dr. Pratt.

301
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,975
- What about his arm?
- Can't feel it.

302
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,479
- 170/95.
- Yeah, blood pressure's high.

303
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,948
- So's my cholesterol.
- You taking Viagra?

304
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,780
I look like I need Viagra?

305
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,813
All right, lift up your
tongue for a minute.

306
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,561
- Hey, we need help with an extrication.
- Stand by.

307
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,792
Just calm down, sir. Don't worry,
we're gonna get you out of here.

308
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,999
- 105/75.
- That's better.

309
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,440
- What?
- It means "thank you" in Hindi.

310
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,944
Had to learn a little
in '44. Army Air Force.

311
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,446
I flew supplies over
the Hump to China. Oh!

312
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,847
- C-46s?
- I've never been to India.

313
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,351
She was asleep and
the window blew out.

314
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,319
- What's her name?
- Olive.

315
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,288
The glass cut her. And my
son's on the second floor.

316
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:57,055
His legs are cut, he can't walk,
and they won't let me back in.

317
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,494
- My building's not on fire.
- It's a precaution.

318
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,328
- I can get in and out real quick.
- No, stay here. I'll go.

319
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,732
- Go, go.
- Stay here.

320
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,473
- Baxter Yi, passenger on the jet.
- He's still got vitals?

321
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,443
- Blunt face, penetrating chest.
- We have a trauma room open.

322
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,946
- Systolic's down to 80.
- All yours, Kovac.

323
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,244
- I'm losing the pulse.
- Prep for a thoracotomy.

324
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,977
No, no, hold on, hold up.

325
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,378
Pressure's back.

326
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,196
Dressing converted it
to a tension pneumo.

327
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,521
- Good call. Go to Trauma 1.
- No, I can't waste a trauma room.

328
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,664
- He fell, like, 2000 feet.
- He's just fine with a chest tube.

329
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:35,529
- Come on, go. Exam 3, go.
- Hey. Hey, where the hell's Pratt?

330
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,499
Said he'll be back
with the next run.

331
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,502
- Pratt's out there?
- They needed a doc.

332
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,471
- You gave away our senior Resident?
- Not now. I gotta triage.

333
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,203
We need our doctors here,
not off playing in the field.

334
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,552
Okay, bag him.

335
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,846
That central line okay?

336
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,784
- Yeah.
- Good.

337
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,424
- Hey, how's the chest pain?
- Down to two out of 10.

338
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,859
Okay, four of MS. Bukata,
we need some help, man.

339
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,521
As soon as we get
these two out of here.

340
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,794
- How's my arm?
- It's hard to say.

341
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,768
I guess I'm lucky. Could
be my head under there.

342
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,531
You still live on Dearborn?

343
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,940
Huh? Yeah, I came over
here to visit my girlfriend.

344
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,406
I made her bougatsa.
Custard in phyllo dough.

345
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,348
Women love a man who can cook.

346
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,588
- PVC's on the monitor.
- I want you to lidocaine.

347
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,420
So, what, you go to
chef's school or something?

348
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,030
When I was a kid, my mom
wouldn't let us watch TV.

349
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,091
That's rough.

350
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,897
We could either
cook or read a book.

351
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,765
And I never did like...

352
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:46,962
V-tach.

353
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,833
Charge to 200.

354
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,678
Charged.

355
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,179
Adrian. Okay, clear.

356
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,509
Sinus. Good pulse.

357
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,017
What the hell was that?

358
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,787
- Hey, we can't wait anymore.
- Just one minute. Come here.

359
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,190
- Pressure's staying up?
- Compare the radials.

360
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,420
My son's in there.

361
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,122
- My partner went to check on him.
- He should be out now.

362
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,291
- He'll find your son.
- Go ahead, help her.

363
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,800
Pulse discrepancy. You
may have injured your aorta.

364
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,838
- Stop, I need my stuff.
- You're not going in.

365
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,967
My checkbook, my jewelry.
What is this, a police state?

366
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,348
No, you can't do this.

367
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,643
- Get away from me.
- Settle down.

368
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,686
- No! Let me go!
- Come on, settle down now.

369
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,121
- Hey, come back.
- Go ahead, she needs you.

370
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:44,320
Ma'am. Ma'am, stop.
You can't go in there.

371
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,493
Hey, guys!

372
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,145
Keep moving, we
got people inside.

373
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,283
Dr. Rasgotra, do you read me?

374
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,377
Yeah.

375
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:11,149
Somebody, help us!
Can anybody hear me?

376
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,226
- Help!
- Hold on! Hurry!

377
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,330
She's impaled. I got a
mid-shaft femur fracture.

378
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,796
Get out of this
building now, Neela!

379
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,458
- Doc, talk to me.
- Hold on.

380
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,128
My son is in 207.

381
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,865
Neela, go! Get out!

382
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,136
- My son, help him.
- Leave the building now.

383
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,873
- Please help my son.
- Hold my hand.

384
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,743
Help!

385
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:38,976
Doc, acknowledge.

386
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:43,111
Paramedic Gates and a woman
are trapped inside the basement!

387
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,515
<i>Doc, give me your location...</i>

388
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:47,853
<i>so my guys can get to you.</i>

389
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,394
<i>There's a boy trapped on
the second floor. I'm going.</i>

390
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,073
<i>No, find a door.
Get to a window.</i>

391
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,190
Give me that.

392
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,529
Neela, it's Greg. Turn around.
- <i>I'm almost there.</i>

393
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,170
Get your ass out now.

394
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,772
<i>Neela, get the hell out
of the building. Neela!</i>

395
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,377
Hey, hey! BOY: I'm in here.

396
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:08,412
<i>- Neela, it's Greg. Get the hell out.</i>
- Hello!

397
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,211
- I'm over here. I'm over here.
- Hello!

398
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,120
Hey. Cover your mouth with this.

399
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,389
<i>Dr. Rasgotra, come in.</i>

400
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,862
<i>Acknowledge, doc.</i>

401
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,204
<i>Dr. Rasgotra, do you
read me? Are you there?</i>

402
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:37,810
- Neela, respond. Neela! BUKATA:
<i>I said, grab this girl, damn it.</i>

403
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,003
- Someone's in trouble?
- A friend from work.

404
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,648
The guys are all over the
building. They'll get her.

405
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,149
If this all works out, I'm
baking you two a cake.

406
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,050
I'm more of a low-carb guy.
All right, fellas, let's do this.

407
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,534
You can't just eat to
live, you gotta live...

408
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:57,558
Come on.

409
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,658
Aah!

410
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,493
No Radial pulse. No ulna.

411
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,665
Adrian, can you feel this?

412
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,873
Adrian. PICKMAN: V-tach again.

413
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,006
- Charge to 200.
- Charged.

414
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,272
Clear.

415
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,313
<i>Only bodies up
here. No survivors.</i>

416
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,723
- Charging.
- Amp of epi.

417
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,616
- Charged.
- Clear.

418
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,347
- Still tach.
- Damn it. Three-sixty, intubation kit.

419
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,290
Starting compressions.

420
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,721
<i>Rescue 3 to Battalion 4.</i>

421
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,122
<i>Go ahead, Rescue 3.</i>

422
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:34,232
<i>Leaving the second floor, 10:45.
Got a female body, no vitals.</i>

423
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,698
<i>Keep looking.</i>

424
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,132
Please...

425
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,201
Get up. Get up.

426
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,573
- Who's next for the O.R.?
- Avulsed ear in 2, tib-fib in 4, then him.

427
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,580
Haleh, thank you so
much for coming in.

428
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,959
Glad to help. Eve here?

429
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:55,152
No. I'm gonna tell
her it's the way it is.

430
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,916
- We're out of cefotetan and DT.
- I'm gonna call the pharmacy.

431
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,491
And I'll get to work.

432
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,152
- Is that blood?
- You cracked a bone in there.

433
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,854
Minimal chest tube output.

434
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,933
- Who called my fiancée?
- In a minute, you can call her yourself.

435
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,093
Supposed to meet
with the caterers and DJ.

436
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,499
Vaseline gauze.

437
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,500
Tomorrow, it's
flowers and the pastor.

438
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,342
She'll be worried.

439
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,372
- Haleh?
- Sam called.

440
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,449
Good thing too. Home two weeks,
my husband's driving me crazy.

441
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,677
- Glad you're back.
- Call for a portable chest.

442
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,816
Sats are dropping.

443
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,381
Baxter.

444
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,164
- Baxter. KOVAC:
He's not breathing.

445
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,628
He knocked out the alveolar
ridge, fractures Teeth 9, 10 and 11.

446
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:47,102
Must have aspirated the
fragment. Try to finger sweep.

447
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,709
- Another 50 of lidocaine.
- Got it.

448
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,439
They ID the body in there?

449
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,050
Woman in her 80s. Still looking.

450
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:04,657
- Where's my mom? Where is she?
- They find anybody else inside?

451
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,985
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's
awake. Holding compressions.

452
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,216
Still V-tach.

453
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,725
No pulse. What the hell...?

454
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:13,229
Adrian. Adrian, can you hear me?

455
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,827
Your heart stopped beating.
We're doing CPR. Keep going.

456
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,735
The compressions are
getting oxygen to his brain.

457
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,340
We're gonna get you
to the hospital, all right?

458
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,131
- You had no business going in there.
- I'm sorry.

459
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,769
You put yourself in danger,
you put my men in danger.

460
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,928
- Can we talk about this later?
- We will.

461
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,716
IC says they're
moving toward the back.

462
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,764
Get a water...

463
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,433
Woody, you found your dog.

464
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,172
Probably blew out his aorta.

465
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,679
I was just talking to him.

466
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,151
Over here, doc.

467
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:18,029
Large-bore IV. O2, 15 liters.
Take Mom and the kids together.

468
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,694
Doctor...

469
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,198
thank you.

470
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,536
Neela, pressure's borderline.

471
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:34,706
- What's he got?
- Distal neurocirc is intact.

472
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:38,709
- You can stop being the med student.
- As soon as you stop being firefighter.

473
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,822
Tongue is too edematous.

474
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,496
- Okay, bag him a few times.
- I can prep his neck.

475
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,598
Take another look, I'll retract.

476
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:02,031
PVCs. I'll get the crash cart.

477
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,302
There it is.

478
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,438
Got it.

479
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,011
- See something new every day.
- All right, settle down, settle down.

480
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,349
Fifteen liters by mask.

481
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,950
- Nice work.
- You did great.

482
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,695
Probable MI with
refractory V-fib.

483
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,265
- Trauma 1.
- Trauma 1.

484
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,995
And an ischemic right arm.

485
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,808
- Be right in.
- I'll be right in.

486
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,432
You know, she needs
to get to the suture room.

487
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,304
- She doesn't need the suture room.
- It's a complicated lac.

488
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,843
Nope, not that complicated.

489
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,983
What, you've never
seen a zipper before?

490
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,758
Any chest pain? - My belly.

491
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,223
Probably just broke a rib.

492
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,897
- It's his liver. Scoop and run.
- Soon as we get another rig.

493
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,693
- We don't have an ambulance?
- We just sent 30 patients in.

494
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,046
- Heart rate's up to 140.
- Because I'm in pain.

495
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,505
- Maybe.
- Elevate my legs. Shock position.

496
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,141
I need to stick your belly.

497
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,743
Peritoneal aspirations?
Maybe you should numb up my...

498
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,644
Ow!

499
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,682
It's positive.

500
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,243
- Splenic lac?
- More likely hepatic.

501
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,513
- I was hoping for spleen.
- Do we have lap pads?

502
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,522
- Just burn dressings.
- Ten of them. Push etomidate.

503
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,750
What are you doing?

504
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,828
Tony, I need to sedate you, open
up your belly and pack off your liver.

505
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,276
What? ZADRO: Can't be serious.

506
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,196
- Do I have your permission?
- Will you go out with me?

507
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,424
I need to do this.

508
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,481
If you didn't have a
boyfriend, yes or no?

509
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,505
Yes.

510
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,933
I'm all yours.

511
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,966
Okay, bag him through this.

512
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,843
From the subxiphoid
to the symphysis pubis.

513
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,314
Clear.

514
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,681
Still V-fib. When's the
last time you saw her?

515
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,188
I told you, we were a block
apart. Resuming compressions.

516
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,224
- Amiodarone's onboard?
- Five minutes ago.

517
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,123
Should've kept an eye on her.

518
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,888
- Pronestyl drip?
- Infusing.

519
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,397
- You could've done better?
- Wouldn't let her into a burning building.

520
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,126
Sure wouldn't have left her.

521
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,730
Guys.

522
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,301
You're doing okay, Adrian.

523
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,308
- Take a break.
- I got it.

524
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,006
Greg, go.

525
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,781
Adrian, we're doing
what we can, okay?

526
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,021
All you do is point, okay?

527
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,992
We're using all the medication
we can to fix your heart.

528
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,501
Sometimes it takes a while.

529
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,003
Anything else?

530
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,649
You want your family?

531
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,687
We called and
they're on their way.

532
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,847
Fifteen-foot fall. I
packed off the liver.

533
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,534
Whoa, whoa. In
the field? Damn, girl.

534
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,301
- He was about to arrest.
- Pressure's up at 100 systolic.

535
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,206
- Was he awake?
- I had etomidate.

536
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,711
It's always the quiet ones.
Always the quiet ones.

537
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,408
Look, I'll take him up to the O.R.
Let Dubenko finish what you started.

538
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,418
You got big <i>huevos,</i> big brass
ones. They look good on you.

539
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,682
- I had no idea what else to do.
- You okay? Need you on a pulse ox.

540
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,723
- No, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you sound terrific.

541
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,588
- No, I'm okay.
- Singed nasal hairs.

542
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,254
- Indicates substantial smoke inhalation.
- I just need to wash up a bit.

543
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,230
- I would hate for you to stop breathing.
- I'd hate that too.

544
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,370
- Neela, come on.
- Can I at least pee first?

545
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,232
I'll get you a bedpan.

546
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,436
Ninety-four in room
air. That's not great.

547
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,047
- There're some expiratory wheezes.
- Those will pass.

548
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,913
Or get worse. I'm
a bit worried here.

549
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,779
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.

550
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,049
It was just...

551
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,090
Today was so...

552
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,119
Terrifying and amazing.

553
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,391
There was no labs, no x-rays,
no rapid infusers or cutdown trays.

554
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,558
Just me.

555
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:28,469
I mean, maybe it's the
adrenaline, but I feel high.

556
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,664
I need to go back out.

557
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,276
Sounds like I should
call for a psych consult.

558
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,616
- Still patients out there.
- Yes, and they're being handled.

559
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,116
Excuse me, Abby.
Dubenko called from the O.R.

560
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,619
Alice Watson died on the table.

561
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,654
Okay, thanks.

562
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:49,056
- Patient of yours?
- Impaled abdomen.

563
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,957
- From the crash?
- Mm-hm.

564
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,292
- Where are her kids?
- Exam 2.

565
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,099
You need to be monitored.

566
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,750
Hey, Abby?

567
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,285
How's he doing?

568
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,291
Lung is up after two chest
tubes. We're going up to ICU.

569
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,420
- So I stopped breathing?
- It was more like holding your breath.

570
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,397
- But I could've died.
- Theoretically, yeah.

571
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,537
Think you were in more
danger on the plane.

572
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:36,368
- Hm. I cheated death twice today.
- You're very lucky.

573
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:41,306
I guess I should feel bad,
or guilty, or something.

574
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,471
But truth is...

575
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,777
I feel happy.

576
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,186
I have a second chance.

577
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,019
I'm calling off the wedding.

578
00:34:56,027 --> 00:35:01,989
- Oh. You might wanna sleep on that.
- No, I have been sleeping my whole life.

579
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:07,470
I never do what I wanna do.
I never say how I really feel.

580
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,871
- I'm not in love with her.
- Maybe you two should talk about that.

581
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,806
Screw that.

582
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,503
Screw it.

583
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,411
No more messing with "could
have, should have, would have."

584
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,348
Carpe diem.

585
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,217
All right. Well,
good luck with that.

586
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,350
Besides, I'm pretty
sure, um, I'm gay.

587
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,325
Getting tired? RAY: No.

588
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:40,172
Dr. Pratt, this is Adrian's
girlfriend, his brother and his uncle.

589
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,068
- I explained everything.
- I'm sorry.

590
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,836
We gave him every kind of medication
possible. Nothing's working right now.

591
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,913
He's awake. You can
talk to him if you want.

592
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,174
Hey, you hang on.
Everyone's coming.

593
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,412
Pratt, check it out.

594
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,021
I guess she's okay, then.

595
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,784
Yeah.

596
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,922
- It's alive.
- They shut down the Dan Ryan.

597
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,590
It took me two hours to get
here. Where do you need me?

598
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,363
- How about Peoria?
- How'd we do?

599
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,529
- We're still here.
- No ICU boarders?

600
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,732
- None.
- And we're reopen for trauma?

601
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,868
Yup. Hey, call housekeeping for
T1. Pharmacy's here to restock.

602
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:24,608
Excuse me. Could someone
please remove these?

603
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,308
Go for it.

604
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,683
- Sir, why are you restrained?
- I have no idea.

605
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,253
Hey, Sam.

606
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,794
- More Sianis family members.
- I'll be right there.

607
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:42,161
- Sam, what is Haleh doing here?
- Exam 2's going up to 4-West.

608
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,428
- I gotta help Pratt with a trauma.
- Did you bring her back?

609
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:49,301
Haleh's one of the best nurses in town
and we're getting our asses handed to us.

610
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,999
I did whatever I
thought I could.

611
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,842
Good move.

612
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,445
- You need a chest x-ray.
- I told you, I'm fine.

613
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,814
Tell the kids I'll check
on them in the morning.

614
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,013
- Come on.
- Please, I've been on for 16 hours.

615
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,091
- Yeah, well, what if your lungs get worse?
- I'll call 911.

616
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,785
Stay at the hospital. You
can sleep in the call room.

617
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,488
- I need to be at home tonight.
- That might not be safe.

618
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:17,102
If I start to die, you'll
be the first one I'll call.

619
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,705
- Fine. I'll come and stay at your place.
- It's not necessary.

620
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:24,604
Oh. Okay, is there anything,
anything I can say to get you to stay?

621
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,142
No.

622
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,542
- I slept with Luka.
- Yeah, nice try.

623
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,851
I can bag.

624
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,357
So how is this
gonna go if you stop?

625
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,122
There'll be lack of
oxygen to the brain.

626
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,027
He'll pass out,
like going to sleep.

627
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,293
Is he gonna be in pain?

628
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,198
He's had a sedative.
He's comfortable.

629
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,142
And you've done everything?

630
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:02,370
Yes, we have.

631
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,560
What, you want us to stop?

632
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,006
Are you ready?

633
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,275
No.

634
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,627
No.

635
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,562
No.

636
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,699
No.

637
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,152
Nine forty-two p.m.

638
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,851
No.

639
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,089
I'm sorry.

640
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,493
No.

641
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:47,549
- He was a lucky guy.
- He's dead.

642
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,817
A lot of people loved him. They
all got a chance to say goodbye.

643
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,522
All right, you gotta
stop calling me.

644
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,826
No, because we're
done. We've been done.

645
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,836
No. No. No. WOMAN <i>Why?</i>

646
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,496
Because you're
not listening to me.

647
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,666
Let me say it to you really
nice and slow for the last time.

648
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:15,837
I don't love you. Go
back to your husband.

649
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,483
<i>I'm not going back to him...</i>

650
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,481
Hey, Dr. Kovac. You know, you
and I should have a little sit-down.

651
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,884
Yeah, probably.

652
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,288
No, I think, like, definitely. We're
both captains on this team here.

653
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,655
If we break down, the
whole machine breaks down.

654
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,059
We can't have that,
especially on days like today.

655
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,699
I agree.

656
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,529
Oh, because, see, I thought I
was the incident commander.

657
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,331
- I thought I was clear...
- Know what? Let's talk tomorrow.

658
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,734
Yeah, tomorrow's great.

659
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,209
I'll be here all day, 8 to 8.

660
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,751
Hey.

661
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,245
Hi.

662
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,516
- Rough night.
- Yeah, I'm glad it's over.

663
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,525
Yeah, me too.

664
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,656
Did Baxter get upstairs okay?

665
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,797
Oh, he's fine. Not so sure
about his fiancée, though.

666
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,334
Hmm.

667
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:15,068
- Listen, I was thinking that...
- Sorry.

668
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,367
- No, you go ahead. Go ahead.
- No.

669
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:23,412
Okay. No, I was
just thinking about...

670
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:29,316
Uh, I was thinking about
what happened last night.

671
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,493
It was nice.

672
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,490
"Nice"?

673
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,966
Yeah.

674
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,297
- Wasn't it?
- No...

675
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,302
Ha. Yeah, of course.

676
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,100
- But...?
- What?

677
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,267
I don't know.

678
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,984
I don't know. What do we do now?

679
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,019
Not sure.

680
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,995
For a long time, even when
we weren't connecting a lot...

681
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,400
you've been the one
person I can count on.

682
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,006
I feel like that too.

683
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,008
That means a lot to
me, that friendship.

684
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:30,741
Me too.

685
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,313
So?

686
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,680
Maybe we should just
leave it at that, then.

687
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,861
I don't know.

688
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,998
I don't wanna lose that. But if that's
what you... That's what's the best.

689
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:53,366
So, what we're just saying is
that we'll just stay friends, then.

690
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,533
Need a lift?

691
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:03,372
No, I have some stuff
I need to finish inside.

692
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,840
Okay.

693
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,509
- Good night.
- See you.
