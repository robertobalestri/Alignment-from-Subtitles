00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,867
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,530
- Dr. Pratt.
- Olivia Evans.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,808
- I should move out.
- Why?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,678
<i>I think we both know why.</i>

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,751
Cops brought in a friend of mine a
while ago for a blood-alcohol level.

6
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,751
I drew my own blood.
Switched the tubes.

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,516
There's little doubt they'll
suspend your license.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,591
- You're going on a vacation.
- What?

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,019
I was offering you the job. You
and Alex would be welcome...

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,892
- to come live with me.
- Excuse me?

11
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,838
- Good morning, Samantha.
- Hi.

12
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,141
Uh, I was just gonna wake Alex.
He'll sleep for a week if I let him.

13
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,480
Ha-ha. My boys
were the same way.

14
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,178
Not Kelly though.

15
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,287
I used to tease her
about being part rooster.

16
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,818
Three must've been a handful.

17
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,361
Yeah, but kids are
great, you know?

18
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,556
Especially when they're young.

19
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,463
They haven't turned
on you yet, right?

20
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,433
- Your wife is beautiful.
- Mm.

21
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,503
No idea what she
was doing with me.

22
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,971
Cancer.

23
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,413
Even towards the
end though, she was...

24
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,741
something else.

25
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,611
I've got meetings
in the city all day.

26
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,220
I'll be back by 6.

27
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,051
I'm entertaining guests.

28
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,723
- Yeah, you gonna sing for them?
- Ha-ha.

29
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,352
No, no, just a dinner for
the old board of directors...

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,694
and their snooty wives.

31
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,365
- Well, I should check your crit.
- Yeah, no, we'll do it tonight.

32
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,097
- I'm feeling fine.
- At least a urine sample.

33
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,708
Listen, my pee right now
is a lovely shade of salmon.

34
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,607
- The chelation's working.
- Like watercolors in my toilet.

35
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,044
- An ounce of prevention...
- Oh, listen. Come on.

36
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,377
There is no cure for MDS.

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,486
You can stick me with your
needles after I'm done entertaining.

38
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,418
You know, you should
use the car today.

39
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,024
- That's okay. We can take the 'L'.
- No, I insist.

40
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,561
And I'll have Mrs. Harrison whip
you and Alex up some breakfast.

41
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,720
It's the most important
meal of the day.

42
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,835
They raised Gallant, he turned
out okay. They can't be that bad.

43
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,040
They're great, it's
just they're strangers.

44
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:52,439
What are they doing in town?

45
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,234
Family wedding.

46
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,172
- You gonna go?
- I wouldn't know a soul.

47
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,905
Besides, I'm sure I'm more dirty
little secret than daughter-in-law.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,812
Well, look who it is. Back
with the commoners, are we?

49
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,112
Good Lord, what is that?

50
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,754
- What?
- That smell.

51
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,254
It's really bad.
It smells like ass.

52
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,189
You do realize how
close we are to the ER?

53
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,256
I think it's you, Morris.

54
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,365
That patient we just transferred
threw her colostomy bag at him.

55
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,697
- I changed my clothes though.
- Well, I would recommend a shower.

56
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,278
- Oh, somebody's got a sugar daddy.
- You jealous?

57
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,705
Guys.

58
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,214
Chemo boy pulled his central
line. He's bleeding all over Curtain 4.

59
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,878
Chop, chop, Rasgotra, we
earn our money down here.

60
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,183
I better go before
stinky gets mad.

61
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,795
Hey, uh, I've been
trading e-mails with Carter.

62
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,295
Really? Did you
tell him about us?

63
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,525
No, no. Uh, he needs help.

64
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,134
In Sudan.

65
00:03:55,502 --> 00:04:01,203
And he asked me if,
uh, I would join him.

66
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,245
- In Africa.
- I'd be back before the baby's born.

67
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,506
Oh, okay.

68
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,808
Okay. I mean, were you, um,
planning on talking to me about this?

69
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,284
I am talking to you. If
you don't want me to go...

70
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,719
You don't need my
permission to go.

71
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,522
The people need help there.

72
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,754
In his camp alone, there are
over 60,000 IDPs being cared for...

73
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,489
by just a handful of
doctors and nurses.

74
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,361
- Problems like clean water...
- I know.

75
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,901
Believe me, between
you and Carter, I know.

76
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,611
If this is something you really feel like
you have to do, then you should do it.

77
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,229
Greg?

78
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,239
All right, I'm coming,
I'm coming. Damn.

79
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,644
Are you there?

80
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,609
Greg.

81
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,192
- Hey, baby, what are you doing here?
- Hey. Are you all right?

82
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,930
Yeah, I'm... What time is it?

83
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,661
I was worried. I tried your cell
phone. I left a message at the hospital.

84
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,897
Yeah, I'm sick. Um,
turned my phone off.

85
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,803
I tried here too.

86
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,438
Well, what do you want me to do?
I'm sick. Don't stress me out about it.

87
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,247
Can I, um, come in?
I'll make you some tea.

88
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,545
No, no, I'm cool. Uh...

89
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,782
Look, now is not a good time.

90
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,860
- But I will be at work later.
- Okay.

91
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,934
Maybe we can talk
then, okay? Olivia.

92
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,635
- That's it right there. S600.
- Yep, sure is.

93
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,141
- A hundred-thousand-dollar car.
- Probably more with the chauffeur.

94
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,873
- Chauffeur? Get out of here.
- The Daimler-Benz company...

95
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,177
was a vital cog in the
Nazi war machine, right?

96
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,320
- Hey, so who is he?
- Who's who?

97
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,889
Your new whale, Daddy Warbucks.
Spill it, you little gold digger.

98
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,151
Go kill another patient, Morris.

99
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,353
What, 97-year-old lung
cancer guy? Yeah, all my fault.

100
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,725
Dr. Rasgotra, phone call.

101
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,491
Hi, this is Dr. Rasgotra.

102
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,536
Oh, hi, you're here. I'll come and get
you. It's easy to get lost. See you soon.

103
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:18,728
- Hey.
- Hey.

104
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,431
- Got a second?
- Not really. Michael's parents are here.

105
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,544
- I haven't seen you around.
- Well, I've been crazed.

106
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,404
- I wanted to... Ha.
- Was there something you wanted...?

107
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,843
- I'm sorry.
- No, go ahead.

108
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,385
Okay. Um... I was just thinking
about this whole roomie situation thing.

109
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,749
I just wanted to make
sure everything was cool.

110
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,720
- Yeah, as far as I know. Yeah.
- Okay.

111
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,589
- So if we needed to work on anything...?
- No, no. You know...

112
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,662
I'm married now, and I should be past
sharing a bathroom with your mates...

113
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,701
and your not-so-occasional
one-night stands.

114
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,634
I've been inconsiderate when
it comes to having people over.

115
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,502
- Well, it's not just that.
- No, no.

116
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,734
My clothes are
everywhere, dirty dishes...

117
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,506
- It's both of us. I'm a mess too.
- Sure, but you're not nearly as bad as me.

118
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,343
I've already started
looking for a new place, Ray.

119
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,078
Oh.

120
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,449
- Neela. Ha-ha.
- Colonel Gallant.

121
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,755
- What did I tell you the last time?
- Right. Dad, Mom.

122
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,624
- Hello, Neela.
- This is my colleague...

123
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,588
Oh, he was just here.

124
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,429
Seventeen-year-old restrained driver.
Auto versus parked SUV at high velocity.

125
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,266
He lost it taking a turn too fast.
Why do they think they can get away?

126
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,237
- You were chasing him?
- A stolen car.

127
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,570
Found a girl in the back.
Must have jacked her.

128
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,010
- How you doing, Deshawn?
- He's altered. BP, 130/75. Pulse, 110.

129
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,149
- What do we have?
- Blunt head, good vitals.

130
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,114
- Passenger coming.
- Go, I'll take this.

131
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,344
Jane Doe found
unresponsive in the back seat.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,252
- Multiple abrasions and contusions.
- Okay. Hello, can you hear me?

133
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,120
Neela, we might
need a hand here.

134
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:50,354
I'm sorry. I'll have someone show you to
a seating area. I'll get you when I'm done.

135
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,590
Actually, I wouldn't
mind observing your SOP.

136
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,428
Oh, of course.

137
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,070
No, I'll leave the gore to
old blood and guts there.

138
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,432
Where can I get a coffee?

139
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,972
- The cafeteria, 6th floor.
- Thanks.

140
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,270
- Sinus tach on the scope.
- Pupils, 4 millimeters and reactive.

141
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,675
Abby, this is Colonel
Gallant, Michael's father.

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,314
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

143
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,780
You were a medic in
Vietnam, weren't you?

144
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,978
- First Air Cavalry, '68 to '72.
- Four tours. Wow.

145
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,817
Let's see what we've got here.

146
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,620
Is a systematic approach to
the trauma patient called ATLS.

147
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,456
Advanced trauma life support.

148
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,590
It ensures resuscitation and stabilization
in even the most critical of patients.

149
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,434
Trauma panel, C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

150
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,604
Ah, Chicago's finest.
Dr. Morris, chief resident.

151
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,209
Settle down, Deshawn.
We're trying to help you, okay?

152
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,902
Guy must be on
meth or something.

153
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,844
Deformity to the fifth metacarpal.
- A boxer's fracture.

154
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,779
- A real fighter?
- Took a swing at me.

155
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,680
- Need me to check that?
- I'm good.

156
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,912
Okay, liter of NS.
Throw in a second IV.

157
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,819
- BP's good, 125/80. Pulse ox, 99.
- Calm down, man.

158
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,154
- Head CT and a tox screen.
- Tenderness to the left mandible.

159
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,319
- Looks broken.
- Add a jaw series.

160
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,829
- Airway's patent. Is the trachea midline?
- Yes.

161
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,194
- Any JVD? Muffled heart tones?
- No. No.

162
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,391
Where are we, ladies?

163
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,038
Assessing the nine most
life-threatening injuries.

164
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,833
Inadequate airway protection...

165
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,339
tension pneumothorax,
flail chest with hypoxia...

166
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,001
I'm sure you were a big
hit at surgical grand rounds.

167
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,545
Dr. Morris, Colonel
Gallant, Michael's father.

168
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,376
Ah. It's a great
honor to meet you.

169
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,849
- You in the service, Dr. Morris?
- Uh, no. Flatfeet.

170
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,921
- Guys, I don't think she's breathing.
- Pulse ox, 88.

171
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,718
Ambu-bag, intubation tray,
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

172
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,384
Dr. Morris, provide inline
stabilization of the neck.

173
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,894
- Sats are dropping. NEELA:
Oh, it's hard to bag her.

174
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,056
Take a look, Neela.

175
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,171
I can't. She's completely
clamped down.

176
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,899
- Did you push sux?
- Yeah.

177
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,874
- Is that a good IV?
- It went right through.

178
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,173
She's completely spasmed
shut. I can't bag her.

179
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,249
Okay. Throw in
two nasal trumpets.

180
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:54,478
Start a second line. Push another
150 of sux from a different vial.

181
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,555
We're taking you off this
board to make you comfortable.

182
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,922
Lie still. Lie still,
you son of a bitch.

183
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,293
- Let's get him on hard restraints.
- Can I give him some morphine?

184
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:09,129
- I don't want him to stop breathing.
- He's got a broken jaw. He's in pain.

185
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,794
- I'll splint him.
- He won't lay still for the head CT.

186
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,237
He will if you tape his head
down. I don't know what he's on.

187
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,105
- He could have a real head injury.
- Yeah. Hence the CT.

188
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,771
If it's normal, then he can spend
the time in a jail cell and sober up.

189
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,183
Okay, two of Versed.

190
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,621
- You said his air bag deployed.
- Yeah.

191
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,962
Kind of hard to break
your jaw on an air bag.

192
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,298
One-fifty of sux
going in the second IV.

193
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,924
- Got your flush.
- She should be relaxing.

194
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,968
Damn, it's worse. Her
masseter's in spasm, it's like a vise.

195
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,540
- How about Valium?
- It's too late. Abby, bag her.

196
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:52,806
- I'll prep the neck. Crike tray.
- Wait, wait, wait. Maybe it's the sux.

197
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,971
- What?
- Pavulon.

198
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:55,945
Six of Pavulon.

199
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:58,141
If sux isn't working...
It's a paralytic...

200
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,550
When I was a nurse, we had a
patient that went to the O.R. for TOA...

201
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,850
who had the exact same response
to sux. Her jaws were like steel.

202
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,687
- Betadine and a Steri-Drape.
- Give the Pavulon a chance.

203
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,886
- Eleven blade.
- Neela, do not cut.

204
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,926
- Sats are down to 82.
- We should get Kovac.

205
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,641
If we wait, she'll have
anoxic brain injury.

206
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:17,502
Jaw is slack.

207
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,402
- Suction. Let's go.
- Abby Lockhart with the save.

208
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,804
We were about to crike her
when the Pavulon kicked in.

209
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,314
Masseter spasm after sux.

210
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,146
There was a case
report in <i>JEM</i> last fall.

211
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,685
- Good catch.
- Thank you.

212
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,755
Head CT on your carjack girl.

213
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,188
- Morris, films on your carjacking.
- Thank you.

214
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,625
No bleed, no fracture, completely
normal. Why did she stop breathing?

215
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,390
Hard to say. Could
be drugs, alcohol.

216
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,967
We need to get her into an ICU
bed, monitor her for hyperthermia.

217
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,299
- Police ID'd her yet?
- No, they're still working on it.

218
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,304
Hello.

219
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,705
Hey. Can you open your eyes?

220
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,209
Still paralyzed from the
Pavulon. Give her an hour.

221
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,041
All right. Can you call RT?

222
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,446
Tell them to lower the Fl02 to 50.
- Sure.

223
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,022
Have you made a decision yet?

224
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,858
About what?

225
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,799
- If you don't want me to go...
- No, I know.

226
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,767
You said that already. I don't understand
why you're putting this all on me.

227
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,304
- I told you, it's only for a few weeks.
- You don't know that.

228
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,367
The last time you went,
we thought you died.

229
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,239
Instead, you came
back with malaria.

230
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,079
Dr. Kovac, paramedics are bringing
in a chest pain with ST elevation.

231
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,117
Page Cards and put the cath
lab on hold. I'll be right there.

232
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,753
Okay.

233
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,884
- Can we talk about this later?
- Yeah, sure.

234
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,729
Fifth metacarpal fracture,
30 degrees of angulation.

235
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,871
Non-displaced mandible
fracture. No need for surgery.

236
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,076
Hey, easy, man.
You broke your jaw.

237
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,072
- Versed must be wearing off.
- Tox screen negative, blood alcohol, 0.

238
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,515
- He's combative from his concussion.
- Stop eyeballing me, jack-off.

239
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,780
What?

240
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,251
- You worried about her?
- You better be.

241
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,294
She dies, we got your
ass on felony murder.

242
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,627
That's 25 to life you get
to spend with your homeys.

243
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,239
You've got a hell of a
unit in there. Good people.

244
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,205
Especially that Lockhart.

245
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,312
Worked her way up from a nurse?
You can learn a lot under her.

246
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,105
- Actually, Abby and I...
- All right.

247
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,613
- Thank you.
- Yeah, she's excellent.

248
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,386
You're lucky. Good
leadership, half the battle.

249
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,580
So I was thinking, if we hurry,
we can do Michigan Avenue...

250
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,090
and still have time for
Field's down on State.

251
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,626
Can't go two days without
swiping that credit card.

252
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,162
We need to get you
something nice for the house.

253
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,426
Sheets. Michael loves soft
sheets. When he was a little boy...

254
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,570
we used to have to
drag him out of bed...

255
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,001
That's not necessary.
I'm looking for a new place.

256
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,801
Michael and I got everything
we needed after the wedding.

257
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,968
Oh, don't be silly. We'll
find you something at Field's.

258
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,944
I can always find something
at Field's. It'll be fun.

259
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,480
For who?

260
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,247
You don't have to go with.

261
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,751
Neela and I can get
along just fine without you.

262
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,889
Maybe the girl
doesn't wanna shop.

263
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,354
Our son deserves
something nice for the house.

264
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,654
- The boy isn't in the house, Glo.
- And why is that, James?

265
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,593
Why don't you explain why
he's not here with his wife?

266
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,072
Jim Coker, 82, assault victim.

267
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,538
Multiple contusions
to the arms and torso.

268
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,008
- A and O, BP, 165/100.
- Nasty bruises.

269
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,172
- What'd you get hit with, sir?
- It felt like a brick.

270
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,544
Did they get the attacker?

271
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,982
Meet Fredna Nasse, 80.

272
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,122
Lacerations to the right palm.

273
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,781
- You attacked him?
- Damn right.

274
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,392
Cheating bastard.

275
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,118
What did you hit
him with, ma'am?

276
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,524
An urn.

277
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,360
I would have hit him again,
but the damn thing broke...

278
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:12,631
and cut my hand, and spilled
Wally's ashes all over everything.

279
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,967
- Who's Wally?
- My husband.

280
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,667
- God rest his soul.
- Can you wiggle your fingers?

281
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,507
Okay, order a hand series.
Where does it hurt, sir?

282
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,874
All over. Mostly my chest.

283
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,677
- What's this scar?
- Uh...

284
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,821
They put a pig valve in
my heart 10 years ago.

285
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,183
You've got a pig head too.

286
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,689
Philanderer.

287
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,661
Come on, open your eyes.

288
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,223
Yankauer.

289
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,562
BP's sky high, 190/122.

290
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,229
- Okay, amp of atropine. Morris.
- 195/120.

291
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,467
- Mix up Nipride. Have you seen Neela?
- I gave her a few hours off.

292
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:54,273
- She's out with the Gallants. What's up?
- Hypertension and bradycardia.

293
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,407
Cushing reflex. Increased
pressure in the brain.

294
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,916
No, the CT was clear.

295
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,881
Right pupil's slightly bigger.
- Her fundi?

296
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,456
Yeah, disc margins are blurry.

297
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,719
- Elevated ICP.
- Is it a brain bleed?

298
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,489
- I told you, CT was clear.
- Maybe you should repeat it.

299
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,642
I doubt she bled in
the last five minutes.

300
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,532
I'll call Neurosurg
for an ICP monitor.

301
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,692
- Where's Luka?
- I think he's in Exam 3.

302
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,271
Okay, 50 of mannitol, dial up
the Nipride, and I'll be right back.

303
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,032
Chest is clear,
heart looks good.

304
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,973
- He doesn't have a heart.
- Oh, for God's sake, Fredna.

305
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,976
- Give it a rest, will you?
- I'm not the one who needs a rest.

306
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,709
I'm gone two days, and you
can't keep it in your pants?

307
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,048
Did I crack a rib
or something, doc?

308
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,281
The pain's getting worse.

309
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,947
It's awful hard to breathe.

310
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,458
- Both lungs are up.
- BP's dropping, 90/50.

311
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,064
Okay, repeat EKG and
chest, 500 cc saline bolus.

312
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,893
Not gonna die, is he?

313
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,195
- No. No, I don't think so.
- Well, if he is, let him.

314
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,963
You sure you two aren't married?

315
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,506
Can you take another
look at our carjacking girl?

316
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,735
- Not now. I'm sorry.
- Systolic's only 80.

317
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,811
She's got elevated
ICP and a normal scan.

318
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,312
- Put him in Trendelenburg.
- Should I repeat the CT?

319
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,074
Anything pertinent
in the history?

320
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,481
I didn't get history, she's
intubated, paralyzed.

321
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,417
Okay, try to talk to the
guy they brought her in with.

322
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,887
- The carjacker?
- Yeah.

323
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,856
ICP rises with cocaine
and amphetamine.

324
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,359
She may need phentolamine
or a beta-blocker.

325
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,424
Repeat EKG. Sats only 82.

326
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,090
Uh, try to get a history.
I'll be in as soon as I can.

327
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,136
Set up for BiPAP, get an ultrasound,
and let's see if there's any free resident.

328
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,035
He's really not
okay, is he, doc?

329
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,201
- What's his name?
- Deshawn Liberty.

330
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:34,472
Deshawn, the girl in the car, does
she have any medical conditions?

331
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,013
He's not the helpful type.

332
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,617
Did she take any drugs?
Coke, meth, anything?

333
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,543
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get a history.

334
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,282
- He can't talk with a broken jaw.
- Well, okay, fine, then he can write.

335
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,087
- Not with a busted hand.
- Well, he can use his good hand.

336
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,229
- Can you take these off?
- I don't think so.

337
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:56,358
- Fine. I'll take off the hard restraints.
- Are you crazy? He's dangerous.

338
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,868
You know, he's
not going anywhere.

339
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,303
Deshawn, did she take any drugs?

340
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,972
Kid knows something.

341
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,139
- Like?
- Anything. Take the cuffs off.

342
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,545
He hit a police officer.

343
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,243
Let them do their
jobs, we will do ours.

344
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,479
I'm trying to do...

345
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,056
Do you sign?

346
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,853
That girl needs help. Now.

347
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,223
- Hey, what are you doing?
- He's deaf, okay?

348
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,727
Do you read lips?

349
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,031
Good. Um...

350
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:39,008
The girl in the car,
did she take drugs?

351
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,976
Damn it. I don't
know what that is.

352
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,742
Oh, right.

353
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,410
Here.

354
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,653
X? All right. Ecstasy?

355
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,957
Did she take ecstasy?

356
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,669
G. GHB.

357
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:08,199
All right. That girl's been
frying her brain for 20 minutes.

358
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,010
Brook Sawyer.

359
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,380
We didn't know.

360
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,576
Well, maybe if you guys
weren't so busy beating on him...

361
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,356
That's eight of Ativan.
- Systolic's up.

362
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,790
- Head CT ready.
- Might not need that.

363
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,487
Her brain's seizing, but the
Pavulon has her paralyzed.

364
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,395
- Subclinical seizure.
- Ativan should take care of that.

365
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,832
- She's gonna need a CT.
- Five hundred of Dilantin.

366
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,938
- Keep going, 50 mgs a minute.
- I'm calling Neurosurgery.

367
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,668
- Give it five minutes. It's not a bleed.
- Abby, if it is, we don't have five.

368
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,506
- It's not a bleed.
- This is Dr. Morris from the ER.

369
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,210
Pressure's coming down, 130/85.

370
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,612
- Pulse normalizing, 84.
- Hang up, Morris.

371
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,844
- Uh, wrong number.
- Nice call.

372
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,988
- What do you think happened?
- I don't know.

373
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,681
Dr. Morris, broken-arm
kid's mom is packing up to go.

374
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,819
- You guys good here?
- We got it.

375
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,861
Jerry, can you ask Frank
where our sign interpreter is?

376
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,520
Right here.

377
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,423
- What? I'm trilingual.
- I hate this thing!

378
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,161
It's only for six weeks, then
you'll be as good as new.

379
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,205
- Six weeks? That's forever.
- Dickie, quiet down.

380
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,036
- All right. Can I check your cast here?
- No! I hate you!

381
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,075
Stop it. Now.

382
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,611
You suck.

383
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,878
- Any pain in your fingers, buddy?
- No.

384
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,781
- Can you feel this?
- Yeah. Can you feel this?

385
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,285
Ow!

386
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,584
Dr. Morris, Jordan Prior,
Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.

387
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,455
If I could just steal a
moment of your time.

388
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,824
Systolic's down to 75.

389
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,465
- Damn it.
- What's happening?

390
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,227
- Heard you need a hand. Blood in belly?
- No, it's clear.

391
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,233
- In the heart? SAM:
No cardiac effusion.

392
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,599
All right, let's try
it with the Doppler.

393
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,934
Please, I didn't
mean to hurt him.

394
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,634
- Not like this.
- You did this?

395
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,177
Yes. SAM: Lover's spat.

396
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,974
Mitral regurgitation
through his porcine valve.

397
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,172
He blew it out.

398
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,874
Hypertensive when he came in.

399
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:03,045
- Stress raised his BP, damaged the valve.
- Page Cardiothoracic and hold an O.R.

400
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,021
- He's not gonna make it to the O.R.
- Afterload reduction?

401
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,718
- Dopamine at 10 mics.
- All right, 1.25 of enalapril.

402
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,454
Ma'am, were gonna fix
him right up. Don't worry.

403
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,761
They were at an after-hours
party. And he couldn't wake her up...

404
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,463
so he grabbed her and threw
her in the car and brought her here.

405
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,766
That car was stolen.

406
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,412
No, that car was her parents'.

407
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,104
And she snuck out.

408
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,673
Well, why didn't he
stop for the police?

409
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,085
He knew that Brook needed
help, and he needed to get her here.

410
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,784
He figured he'd explain
everything when they got here.

411
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,896
Why did he fight with them?

412
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,362
What...? Oh, he
was fighting back.

413
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,298
Trying to protect himself.

414
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,734
Cops don't sign.

415
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:57,174
And Brook, she's gotten
drunk before, but never like this.

416
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,278
He doesn't even drink.

417
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,607
He's an athlete.

418
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,482
- He wants to know if she'll be okay.
- We hope so.

419
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,414
You probably saved her life.

420
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,926
Thank you.

421
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,619
Thank you.

422
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,292
So you're sticking
with surgery, then?

423
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,798
I'm not sure yet.
It's a big decision.

424
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,766
Well, sounds good. You'll
be able to find work anywhere.

425
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,704
- I was hoping to stay at County, actually.
- You like working there.

426
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,934
I never thought I'd
say this, but, yes, I do.

427
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,238
I've grown quite fond
of Chicago as well.

428
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,147
Well, don't get your heart set.

429
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:38,011
I've got a Residency set up
for Mike when he gets back.

430
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,345
Muskogee VA, Oklahoma.

431
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,417
Perhaps Michael will
decide to settle here.

432
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,525
Don't worry, first time's the
hardest. You'll get used to it.

433
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,189
- To what?
- Relocating.

434
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,457
Soldier's gotta go
where they tell him to.

435
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,898
The upside is you
get to see the world.

436
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,095
Bismarck, North Dakota.

437
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,706
Barstow, California.
Christmas in Anchorage.

438
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,810
And my all-time favorite,
Indian Springs, Nevada.

439
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,240
Gorgeous in July.

440
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,439
Guess you don't remember when
Mike learned to sail on Lake Como.

441
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,484
How Val's face lit up when
she saw her first ballet in Paris.

442
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,951
We've had a good life, Gloria.

443
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,354
So, uh...

444
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,157
You two talk about kids yet?

445
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,028
Um...

446
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,698
No.

447
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,660
Not yet.

448
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,199
Abby, your carjacking
girl's waking up.

449
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,807
- Did you check the NIF?
- Yeah, it's 30.

450
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,500
- Tidal volume is 700.
- Oh, oh, oh.

451
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,202
Don't do that, don't do
that. Look at me, look at me.

452
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:44,783
I'm Dr. Lockhart, okay?
Wiggle your fingers for me.

453
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:49,581
All right. Give me a thumbs-up sign.
Do you want me to take that tube out?

454
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,021
All right. Hold
on just a second.

455
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,459
All right, deep breath in.

456
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,623
And blow it out.

457
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:09,934
Oh, my head hurts.

458
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,544
A thousand of acetaminophen.
- You got it.

459
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,237
Do you remember what happened?

460
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,841
We were at a party.

461
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,511
You got in a car accident...

462
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,848
and you stopped breathing.
We had to put you on a ventilator.

463
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:32,087
And the ecstasy that you took
caused you to have a seizure.

464
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,200
And we had to treat
you with anticonvulsants.

465
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,359
Oh, my God.

466
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,396
Yeah, you were very lucky.

467
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,807
He likes to feel my heartbeat.

468
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,203
Yeah, it's funny.

469
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,811
He's the only person in my whole
life who actually listens to me.

470
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,119
You would serve on
the advisory board...

471
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:34,056
be responsible for recruiting
doctors to participate in clinical trials.

472
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,856
And with your Residency ending in
July, this could be a real opportunity...

473
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,966
to advance the practice of
medicine, as well as your career.

474
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,897
Okay, you know
what? Ow. I don't know.

475
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,038
You know, I'm really not
that much of a salesman.

476
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,265
- Expense account?
- A generous one.

477
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,376
And this isn't a sales position
we're offering you, Dr. Morris.

478
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,775
Your official title would be
director of physician relations.

479
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:59,245
- Hmm. It's got a nice ring to it.
- Anything broken?

480
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,513
Thankfully, no. It's just a
sprain. Please continue. Aah.

481
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:08,457
There are meetings and presentations
at medical centers across the country.

482
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,823
Um... First-class air travel?

483
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,901
Of course. And quarterly meetings
at some very desirable resorts.

484
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:23,232
Best of all, no nights, no weekends,
and no exposure to bodily fluids.

485
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,507
Salary?

486
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,344
Somewhere in the neighborhood
of 300,000 a year. Plus bonuses.

487
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,752
- My kind of neighborhood.
- Hmm.

488
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:37,946
Huh.

489
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,615
Are you sure you wanna
wait? It's a four-hour surgery.

490
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:44,320
Oh, yes. Somebody has to
be with him when he wakes up.

491
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,522
Let me give you some
sound medical advice...

492
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,394
please, do not
make her mad again.

493
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,628
I can't help it, I'm a ladies'
man. Always have been.

494
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,601
Well, just take it easy, okay?

495
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,866
Thank you, doctors.

496
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,134
Pretty nice save, huh?

497
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,938
Yep, timely diagnosis of a
rare condition. Good work.

498
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,603
Looks like Dr. Pratt is back.

499
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,181
Well, that's something I
wanna talk to you about.

500
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,783
What?

501
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,611
Your status here.

502
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,812
My status? I thought
my suspension was over.

503
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,617
That was time off so you
could think about what you did.

504
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:17,025
And so I could think
about what to do about it.

505
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:22,029
- I was talking to Dr. Carter recently.
- Yeah, okay.

506
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,227
He wants me to come
to help him in Sudan.

507
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,206
- Oh, you're leaving?
- No.

508
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,968
But I thought you could
use a change of perspective.

509
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,546
- No, I think my perspective is just fine.
- Greg, you'll be an Attending next year.

510
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,309
That means all the
decisions fall on your head.

511
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,385
You're a good doctor. A month
there will only make you better.

512
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,283
- What?
- Get your shots.

513
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,185
Make sure your
passport is current...

514
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,724
and get your hat. It
can get really hot there.

515
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,385
Wait a minute. Wait,
you're sending me to Africa?

516
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,690
Yeah, I am.

517
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,423
And what if my answer's no?

518
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,061
It's not a request.

519
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:07,507
That's about it. I'm sorry
it's not much of a tour.

520
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,409
So when do you plan on moving?

521
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,447
I've been looking for a place.

522
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:15,145
It's been a bit of a challenge with
my schedule and Michael being gone.

523
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,848
Only one bathroom, huh?
Must get hard with the roommate.

524
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:24,257
Oh, we manage. We work
different shifts most of the time.

525
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,230
- Mm. So he's not really here much?
- Cut it out. They're just roommates.

526
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,268
- It's not her. I don't know the boy.
- I need to use the phone.

527
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,871
- You can use the phone in my room.
- Thank you.

528
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:46,378
Neela, I feel I should apologize
for the way we've been acting.

529
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,316
Oh, no. There's no
need. Couples bicker.

530
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,652
Pssh. We passed
bicker years ago.

531
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,120
Oh, it's nothing, really.
You should hear my parents.

532
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,755
Is there, uh, anything
I can get you?

533
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,894
Gloria and I are separating.

534
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,503
Oh. Does Michael know?

535
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,942
No. Nobody does.

536
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:17,412
We decided to come to the wedding,
put on a good show for the family...

537
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,915
before we dropped the bomb.

538
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,587
We'd like to tell
Mike ourselves.

539
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,486
So if you don't mind,
keep it in the vault.

540
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,093
Uh, yes, of course.

541
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:33,421
36-year-old with epididymitis. No
need for ultrasound, it's not torsion.

542
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,158
- Any STD risk?
- Of course, he's male.

543
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,729
- You give him levofloxacin?
- I wrote a scrip.

544
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,373
Okay. Fine.

545
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,806
- That's all. Thank you.
- Abby, we need to finish our talk.

546
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,775
No, we don't, actually, because
you know what? I understand.

547
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,539
- No. No, you don't.
- No, I do.

548
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,684
- Listen...
- No, you listen. I mean...

549
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,514
Sorry, I just... You know, I
know that we're not married...

550
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,282
and, um, we don't
live together...

551
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:02,189
and we haven't really defined
our relationship, and that's mostly...

552
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,596
Probably all, uh, because of me.

553
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:09,326
But you looked at me and said
that we were gonna do this together.

554
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,699
And I know that you'll be
back before the baby's born...

555
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,702
but I just hate
that you wanna go.

556
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,307
And I hate that I hate
that you wanna go.

557
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,605
But I'm just a little
bit scared, Luka...

558
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,874
and, um, I don't
wanna do this by myself.

559
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,484
But if I have to,
I can, and I will.

560
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,210
I'm sending Pratt.

561
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,085
To help me with the baby?

562
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,717
To Darfur.

563
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,361
He volunteered.

564
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,327
Long story.

565
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,361
- So you're staying?
- Mm-hm.

566
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,068
Oh, good. That's good.

567
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,511
- Well, I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

568
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,417
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

569
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,620
What's up with the
suit? Getting married?

570
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,130
It's my new school uniform.

571
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,927
How do you like it?

572
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,967
It's school.

573
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,502
But our new house is sweet.

574
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,867
- Oh, you moved?
- Yeah, Kenilworth.

575
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,341
Man, you should see it, Luka.
It's like a museum it's so big.

576
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:31,176
Uh... When did that happen?

577
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,375
When my mom started
working for Mr. Elliot.

578
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:37,683
It's his house, but he's got an
indoor pool and a movie theater.

579
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,385
- You ready, kiddo?
- I didn't know you guys moved.

580
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,690
Yeah, uh, my boss needs
chelation therapy every night...

581
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,390
so room and board's
part of the deal.

582
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,932
Hey.

583
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,937
See you later, Luka.

584
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,009
So, uh, do you
guys live there now?

585
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,737
- Yeah.
- Wow. That's a big change.

586
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,178
It was either that or
double up on my shifts here.

587
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,012
And even then, it wouldn't
have been as much money.

588
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,177
Is this part of the deal too?

589
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,289
I guess.

590
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,020
We're good, Luka.

591
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,095
Really.

592
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,397
Mrs. Gallant?

593
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,102
Is everything okay?

594
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,111
Are you all right?

595
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,615
Can I get you anything?

596
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,056
No, thank you.

597
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,961
He told you, didn't he?

598
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,700
I'm very sorry.

599
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,306
So am I.

600
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,313
You're a very sweet girl, Neela.

601
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,589
And I see why Michael
fell in love with you.

602
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,521
- I can tell you love him too.
- I do.

603
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:24,094
- Very much.
- And that's good.

604
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:28,496
I just wish that love
was always enough.

605
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,335
God knows I love that
man in the other room.

606
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,665
- But here I am.
- You know...

607
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:41,143
Michael always talked about
what great parents you were.

608
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,343
Maybe there's still
a chance to work...

609
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,950
Have you any idea why
Michael went back to Iraq?

610
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,387
- Not exactly.
- Mm.

611
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,649
I guess he felt like
he was needed there.

612
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,226
- He has a strong sense of duty.
- Ah!

613
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,929
Duty.

614
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,330
For years, I have sacrificed
and compromised...

615
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:10,168
moving from one sorry
little town to the next.

616
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,140
All because of duty.

617
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,614
The boy's his father's son.

618
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,080
They're soldiers.

619
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,180
And no matter how
much you love them...

620
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,718
there's always another war.

621
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:34,129
I'm not quite sure what
you're trying to tell me.

622
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,702
What I'm trying to tell you...

623
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:46,709
is that a strong marriage
is about two people.

624
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,676
Now, Michael's a good man.

625
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:52,011
Michael is kind. He is
loving, he is generous.

626
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,311
Just like his father.

627
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,484
But if staying here at
County, in Chicago...

628
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,888
is something that you want to
do, then that's what you should do.

629
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:06,896
Never let anybody or anything
make you ever forget who you are.

630
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,742
Miss Taggart,
please, come quickly.

631
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,248
Mr. Elliot, you're awake.

632
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,225
- I couldn't get him to open his eyes.
- I'm fine.

633
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,261
Go make sure they
don't ruin the duck.

634
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,868
- Mr. Elliot...
- Regina, I've got 20 people waiting here.

635
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,299
- Please, go.
- Yes, sir.

636
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,741
You might wanna think
about canceling your dinner.

637
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,903
Transfusion's supposed
to last three weeks.

638
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,608
- Well, not this time. You need blood.
- Yeah, right. It'll take three hours.

639
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,220
- I got guests.
- Let's get you on some oxygen at least.

640
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,719
Out of the question.

641
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,256
How will I be able to sing,
huh? With a tube up my nose?

642
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,224
This is serious. You're
obviously anemic right now.

643
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,727
Really?

644
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:16,398
Well, I'll be done by 9.

645
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:19,071
You can transfuse me then.

646
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,896
You hired me to
take care of you.

647
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,236
If you'll not let me do my job, I
don't know what I'm doing here.

648
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,777
What you're doing here, now,
Samantha, is you're working for me.

649
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,817
Maybe I shouldn't
be working for you.

650
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,114
Maybe not.

651
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,157
Rents are signing some
paperwork for your transfer.

652
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,762
I guess they want you at the
highfalutin hospital in the suburbs.

653
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,328
Yeah, that sounds like them.

654
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:50,333
We were able to get ahold of your father,
Deshawn. He should be here pretty soon.

655
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,599
We called Dr. Christiano. He's
going to meet us at Saint Helen's.

656
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,637
So we checked it out.

657
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:02,512
Guess the parents were all out of
town, and they came home early...

658
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,672
saw the car gone,
and called it in.

659
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,646
They thought the daughter
was at a friend's house.

660
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,515
Um...

661
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,453
My guys here have something
they wanna say to you.

662
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,524
Uh... Ahem.

663
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,562
We just wanted to apologize
for the misunderstanding.

664
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,990
We thought you were
flashing gang signs at us.

665
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:27,868
Yeah, um, we had no
idea you were, um...

666
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,507
We're...

667
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,540
We're really sorry.

668
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,512
He says that he has a
special sign for you guys.

669
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,553
I think that requires
no translation.

670
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,248
Yeah.

671
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,724
And Gyn has a bed, but they
can't take the PID for two hours.

672
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,094
- You get a chance to meet the Gallants?
- No, I must have missed them.

673
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,235
Yeah. Probably better that way.

674
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,428
- Would've been weird.
- Why's that?

675
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,732
Why do you think?
Hey, to tell you the truth...

676
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,000
- I don't know how you do it, my man.
- What?

677
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,667
Every girl I slept with won't
give me the time of day.

678
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,438
Neither one of
them? I'm shocked.

679
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,208
Ooh. I bet it was really
freaky being at her wedding.

680
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,544
Dude, what are
you talking about?

681
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,778
You know, you and Neela.

682
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,118
The whole, uh,
roommate-with-benefits thing.

683
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,121
You think I slept with Neela?

684
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,456
- You didn't?
- No.

685
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,121
Huh. Uh...

686
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,358
- I just assumed.
- Everybody did.

687
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,463
- Everybody did?
- Pretty much.

688
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,128
Hey, but, you know, don't
sweat it. It's just a rumor.

689
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,740
Pratt, Kovac left this for you.

690
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,275
- What is it?
- You're headed back to the motherland.

691
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,777
You better be careful,
I'm having a very bad day.

692
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,506
Maybe you woke up on
the wrong side of the bed.

693
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,482
- Hey, we should go talk somewhere.
- Oh, really? About what, Greg?

694
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:51,054
- What about? About us.
- That's a short conversation.

695
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,214
- Olivia, come on.
- Who was she?

696
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,882
Nobody.

697
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,326
Look, I'm sorry. I
really am. Come on.

698
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,661
- What? I just said I'm sorry.
- I heard you. I... You know...

699
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,464
Explain to me why you did it.

700
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,736
We never talked about
being monogamous.

701
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,173
We never said anything
about not being monogamous.

702
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,369
All you had to do was
be straight with me.

703
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,709
- I never meant to hurt you, I...
- You what?

704
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,910
You played me, Greg. You acted like
we were in this committed relationship.

705
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,579
And if you thought that it
was cool to sleep around...

706
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,750
you wouldn't have had your
sorry ass at the door playing sick.

707
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,795
Olivia, listen, I like you. I
never was trying to mislead you.

708
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,829
- I just thought...
- No, you didn't think...

709
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,991
Pratt, I got a phone call
from L'Alliance de Medecins.

710
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,536
- They got your number from Kovac.
- Yeah, just tell them to hold on, okay?

711
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,665
Listen, I really cannot
do this right now.

712
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:43,140
Why not?

713
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:46,767
Because my boss is making
me go to Africa, that's why.

714
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,578
- You just don't stop, do you?
- Stop what?

715
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,147
- Right.
- Olivia.

716
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,911
Wait a minute.
I'm not lying to you.

717
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,684
You know, you're right, Samantha.
I feel much better with the oxygen.

718
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,355
Did it affect your
singing voice?

719
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,898
Well, I didn't wear
it for the party.

720
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,731
I just stayed in my
chair and never got up.

721
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,729
Just did much more
listening than talking.

722
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,841
Wow. I was beginning to think
you didn't know how to do that.

723
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:28,349
Anyway, if you're ready,
I'll take my blood now.

724
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,052
- Yo, Neela.
- I'm in here.

725
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,130
Hey, I brought you a peace
offering. Extra anchovies.

726
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,824
And I promise, no
more dirty dishes, okay?

727
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,062
I'm gonna go and stay
at Abby's for a while.

728
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,866
Uh, she's at Luka's
most of the time, so...

729
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,407
So, what, are you
moving out, like, tonight?

730
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:56,537
I'll get to the post office when
I can, get my mail forwarded.

731
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,507
Do you wanna at least wait
until you find a new place?

732
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,881
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

733
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,891
Yeah, you're probably right.

734
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,722
Hey, um...

735
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,133
All good things, right?

736
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,707
Sure had a lot of fun though.

737
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,611
Well, maybe the next guy
won't drink all my tequila, huh?

738
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,080
- Uh... You need a hand with anything?
- Uh, no, thanks.

739
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,912
- Pizza?
- Oh, I better get going.

740
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,610
Okay.

741
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,485
I've been looking for
this for, like, a month.

742
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,059
I rather liked sleeping in it.

743
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,899
I'll, uh, get the rest tomorrow.

744
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:57,606
Neela.

745
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,368
Look, just...

746
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:02,173
Would you just wait
one second, please?

747
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:11,580
I wish I didn't feel how I feel.

748
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,848
But you...

749
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,355
You're the best
friend I've ever had.

750
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,691
Keep this.
